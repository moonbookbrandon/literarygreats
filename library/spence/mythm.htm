THE MYTHS OF MEXICO AND PERU
by Lewis Spence



PREFACE
IN recent years a reawakening has taken place in the study of American 
archæology and antiquities, owing chiefly to the labours of a band of 
scholars in the United States and a few enthusiasts in the continent of 
Europe. For the greater part of the nineteenth century it appeared as if the 
last word had been written upon Mexican archæology. The lack of excavations 
and exploration had cramped the outlook of scholars, and there was nothing 
for them to work upon save what had been done in this respect before their 
own time. The writers on Central America who lived in the third quarter of 
the last century relied on the travels of Stephens and Norman, and never 
appeared to consider it essential that the country or the antiquities in 
which they specialised should be examined anew, or that fresh expeditions 
should be equipped to discover whether still further monuments existed 
relating to the ancient peoples who raised the teocallis of Mexico and the 
huacas of Peru. True, the middle of the century was not altogether without 
its Americanist explorers, but the researches of these were performed in a 
manner so perfunctory that but few additions to the science resulted from 
their labours.

Modern Americanist archaeology may be said to have been the creation of a 
brilliant band of scholars who, working far apart and without any attempt at 
co-operation, yet succeeded in accomplishing much. Among these may be 
mentioned the Frenchmen Charnay and de Rosny, and the Americans Brinton, H. 
H. Bancroft, and Squier. To these succeeded the German scholars Seler, 
Schellhas, and Förstemann, the Americans Winsor, Starr, Savile, and Cyrus 
Thomas, and the Englishmen Payne and Sir Clements Markham. These men, 
splendidly equipped for the work they had taken in hand, were yet hampered 
by the lack of reliable data -a want later supplied partly by their own 
excavations and partly by the painstaking labours of Professor Maudslay, 
principal of the International College of Antiquities at Mexico, who, with 
his wife, is responsible or the exact pictorial reproductions of many of the 
ancient edifices in Central America and Mexico.

Writers in the sphere of Mexican and Peruvian myth have been few. The first 
to attack the subject in the light of the modern science of comparative 
religion was Daniel Garrison Brinton, professor of American languages and 
archaeology in the University of Philadelphia. He has been followed by 
Payne, Schellhas, Seler, and Rrstemann, all of whom, however, have confined 
the publication of their researches to isolated articles in various 
geographical and scientific journals. The remarks of mythologists who are 
not also Americanists upon the subject of American myth must be accepted 
with caution.

The question of the alphabets of ancient America is perhaps the most acute 
in present-day pre-Columbian archaeology. But progress is being made in this 
branch of the subject, and several scholars are working in whole-hearted co-
operation to secure final results.

What has Great Britain accomplished in this new and fascinating field of 
science? If the lifelong and valuable labours of the late Sir Clements 
Markham be excepted, almost nothing. It is earnestly hoped that the 
publication of this volume may prove the means of leading many English 
students to the study and consideration of American archaeology.

There remains the romance of old America. The real interest of American 
mediaeval history must ever circle around Mexico and Peru-her golden 
empires, her sole exemplars of civilisation; and it is to the books upon the 
character of these two nations that we must turn for a romantic interest as 
curious and as absorbing as that bound up in the history of Egypt or 
Assyria.

If human interest is craved for by any man, let him turn to the narratives 
of Garcilasso el Inca de la Vega and Ixtlilxochitl, representatives and last 
descendants of the Peruvian and Tezcucan monarchies, and read there the 
frightful story of the path to fortune of red-heeled Pizarro and cruel 
Cortés, of the horrible cruelties committed upon the red man, whose colour 
was "that of the devil," of the awful pageant of fold-sated pirates laden 
with the treasures of palaces, of the stripping of temples whose very bricks 
were of gold, whose very drain-pipes were of silver, of rapine and the 
sacrilege of high places, of porphyry gods dashed down the pyramidal sides 
of lofty teocallis, of princesses tom from the very steps of the throne-ay, 
read these for the most wondrous tales ever writ by the hand of man, tales 
by the side of which the fables of Araby seem dim -the story of a clash of 
worlds, the conquest of a new, of an isolated hemisphere.

It is usual to speak of America as "a continent without a history." The 
folly of such a statement is extreme. For centuries prior to European 
occupation Central America was the seat of civilisations boasting a history 
and a semi-historical mythology second to none in richness and interest. It 
is only because the sources of that history are unknown to the general 
reader that such assurance upon the lack of it exists.

Let us hope that this book may assist in attracting many to the head-
fountain of a river whose affluents water many a plain of beauty not the 
less lovely because bizarre, not the less fascinating because somewhat 
remote from modern thought.

In conclusion I have to acknowledge the courtesy of the Bureau of American 
Ethnology, which placed in my hands a valuable collection of illustrations 
and allowed me to select from these at my discretion. The pictures chosen 
include the drawings used as tailpieces to chapters; others, usually half-
tones, are duly acknowledged where they occur.

CHAPTER 1: THE CIVILISATION OF MEXICO
The Civilisations of the New World
THERE is now no question as to the indigenous origin of the civilisations of 
Mexico, Central America, and Peru. Upon few subjects, how. ever, has so much 
mistaken erudition been lavished. The beginnings of the races who inhabited 
these regions, and the cultures which they severally created, have been 
referred to nearly every civilised or semicivilised nation of antiquity, and 
wild if fascinating theories have been advanced with the intention of 
showing that civilisation was initiated upon American soil by Asiatic or 
European influence. These speculations were for the most part put forward by 
persons who possessed but a merely general acquaintance with the 
circumstances of American aboriginal civilisation, and who were struck by 
the superficial resemblances which undoubtedly exist between American and 
Asiatic peoples, customs, and art-forms., but which cease to be apparent to 
the Americanist, who perceives in them only such likenesses as inevitably 
occur in the work of men situated in similar environments and surrounded by 
similar social and religious conditions.

The Maya of Yucatan may be regarded as the most highly civilised of the 
peoples who occupied the American continent before the advent of Europeans, 
and it is usually their culture which we are asked to believe had its seat 
of origin in Asia. It is unnecessary to refute this theory in detail, as 
that has already been ably accomplished.[By Payne in The New World called 
America, London 1892-99] But it may be remarked that the surest proof of the 
purely native origin of American civilisation is to be found in the unique 
nature of American art, the undoubted result of countless centuries of 
isolation. American language, arithmetic, and methods of time-reckoning, 
too, bear no resemblance to other systems, European or Asiatic, and we may 
be certain that had a civilising race entered America from Asia it would 
have left its indelible impress upon things so intensely associated with the 
life of a people as well as upon the art and architecture of the country, 
for they are as much the product of culture as is the ability to raise 
temples.

Evidence of Animal and Plant Life
It is, impossible in this connection to ignore the evidence in favour of 
native advancement which can be adduced from the artificial production of 
food in America. Nearly all the domesticated animals and cultivated food-
plants found on the continent at the period of the discovery were totally 
different from those known to the Old World. Maize, cocoa, tobacco, and the 
potato, with a host of useful plants, were new to the European conquerors, 
and the absence of such familiar animals as the horse, cow, and sheep, 
besides a score of lesser animals, is eloquent proof of the prolonged 
isolation which the American continent underwent subsequent to its original 
settlement by man.

Origin of American Man
An Asiatic origin is, of course, admitted for the aborigines of America, but 
it undoubtedly stretched back into that dim Tertiary Era when man was little 
more than beast, and language as yet was not, or at the best was only half 
formed. Later immigrants there certainly were, but these probably arrived by 
way of Behring Strait, and not by the land-bridge connecting Asia and 
America by which the first-comers found entrance. At a later geological 
period the general level of the North American continent was higher than at 
present., and a broad isthmus connected it with Asia. During this prolonged 
elevation vast littoral plains, now submerged, extended continuously from 
the American to the Asiatic shore, affording an easy route of migration to a 
type of man from whom both the Mongolian branches may have sprung. But this 
type, little removed from the animal as it undoubtedly was, carried with it 
none of the refinements of art or civilisation; and if any resemblances 
occur between the art-forms or polity of its equal descendants in Asia and 
America, they are due to the influence of a remote common ancestry, and not 
to any later influx of Asiatic civilisation to American shores.

Traditions of Intercourse with Asia
The few traditions of Asiatic intercourse with America are, alas! easily 
dissipated. It is a dismal business to be compelled to refute the dreams of 
others. How much more fascinating would American history have been had Asia 
sowed the seeds of her own peculiar civilisation in the western continent, 
which would then have become a newer and further East, a more glowing and 
golden Orient I But America possesses a fascination almost as intense when 
there falls to be considered the marvel of the evolution of her wondrous 
civilisations-the flowers of progress of a new, of an isolated world.

The idea that the "Fu-Sang" of the Chinese annals alluded to America was 
rendered illusory by Klaproth, who showed its identity with a Japanese 
island. It is not impossible that Chinese and Japanese vessels may have 
drifted on to the American coasts) but that they sailed thither of set 
purpose is highly improbable. Gomara, the Mexican historian, states that 
those who served with Coronado's expedition in 1542 saw off the Pacific 
coast certain ships having their prows decorated with gold and silver, and 
laden with merchandise, and these they supposed to be of Cathay or China, 
"because they intimated by signs that they had been thirty days on their 
voyage." Like most of these interesting stories, however, the tale has no 
foundation in fact, as the incident cannot be discovered in the original 
account of the expedition, published in 1838 in the travel-collection of 
Ternaux-Compans.

Legends of European Intercourse
We shall find the traditions, one might almost call them legends, of early 
European intercourse with America little more satisfactory than those which 
recount its ancient connection with Asia. We may dismiss the sagas of the 
discovery of America by the Norsemen, which are by no means mere tradition., 
and pass on to those in which the basis of fact is weaker and the legendary 
interest more strong. We are told that when the Norsemen drove forth those 
Irish monks who had settled in Iceland, the fugitives voyaged to

Great Ireland, by which many antiquarians of the older school imagine the 
author of the myth to have meant America. The Irish Book of Lismore recounts 
the voyage of St. Brandan, Abbot of Cluainfert, in Ireland, to an island in 
the ocean which Providence had intended as the abode of saints. It gives a 
glowing account of his seven years' cruise in western waters, and tells of 
numerous discoveries, among them a hill of fire and an endless island, which 
he quitted after an unavailing journey of forty days, loading his ships with 
its fruits, and returning home. Many Norse legends exist regarding this 
"Greater Ireland," or "Huitramanna Land" (White Man's Land), among them one 
concerning a Norseman who was cast away on its shores, and who found there a 
race of white men who went to worship their gods bearing banners, and 
"shouting with a loud voice." There is, of course, the bare possibility that 
the roving Norsemen may have on occasions drifted or have been cast away as 
far south as Mexico, and such an occurrence becomes the more easy of belief 
when we remember that they certainly reached the shores of North America.

The Legend of Madoc
A much more interesting because more probable story is that which tells of 
the discovery of distant lands across the western ocean by Madoc, a 
princeling of North Wales, in the year 1170. It is recorded in Hakluyt's 
English Voyages and Powel's History of Wales. Madoc, the son of Owen 
Gwyneth, disgusted by the strife of his brothers for the principality of 
their dead father, resolved to quit such an uncongenial atmosphere, and, 
fitting out ships with men and munition, sought adventure by sea, sailing 
west, and leaving the coast of Ireland so far north that he came to a land 
unknown, where he saw many strange things. "This land," says Hakluyt, " must 
needs be some part of that country of which the Spaniards affirmc themselves 
to be the first finders since Hanno's time, and through this allusion we are 
enabled to see how these legends relating to mythical lands came to be 
Associated with the American continent. Concerning the land discovered by 
Madoc many tales were current in Wales in mediæval times. Madoc on his 
return declared that it was pleasant and fruitful, but uninhabited. He 
succeeded in persuading a large number of people to accompany him to this 
delectable region, and, as he never returned, Hakluyt concludes that the 
descendants of the folk he took with him composed the greater part of the 
population of the America of the seventeenth century, a conclusion in which 
he has been supported by more than one modern antiquarian. Indeed, the 
wildest fancies have been based upon this legend, and stories of Welsh-
speaking Indians who were able to converse with Cymric immigrants to the 
American colonies have been received with complacency by the older school of 
American historians as the strongest confirmation of the saga. It is 
notable, however, that Henry VII of England, the son of a Welshman, may have 
been influenced in his patronage of the early American explorers by this 
legend of Madoc, as it is known that he employed one Guttyn Owen, a Welsh 
historiographer, to draw up his paternal pedigree, and that this same Guttyn 
included the story in his works. Such legends as those relating to Atlantis 
and Antilia scarcely fall within the scope of American myth, as they 
undoubtedly relate to early communication with the Canaries and Azores.

American Myths of the Discovery
But what were the speculations of the Red Men on the other side of the 
Atlantic? Were there no rumours there, no legends of an Eastern world? 
Immediately prior to the discovery there was in America a widely 
disseminated belief that at a relatively remote period strangers from the 
east had visited American soil, eventually returning to their own abodes in 
the Land of Sunrise. Such, for example, was the Mexican legend of 
Quetzalcoatl, to which we shall revert later in its more essentially 
mythical connection. He landed with several companions at Vera Cruz, and 
speedily brought to bear the power of a civilising agency upon native 
opinion. In the ancient Mexican pinturas, or paintings, he is represented as 
being habited in a long black gown, fringed with white crosses. After 
sojourning with the Mexicans for a number of years, during which time he 
initiated them into the arts of life and civilisation, he departed from 
their land on a magic raft, promising, however, to return. His second advent 
was anxiously looked for, and when Cortés and his companions arrived at Vera 
Cruz, the identical spot at which Quetzalcoatl was supposed to have set out 
on his homeward journey, the Mexicans fully believed him to be the returned 
hero. Of course Montezuma, their monarch, was not altogether taken by 
surprise at the coming of the white man, as he had been informed of the 
arrival of mysterious strangers in Yucatan and elsewhere in Central America; 
but in the eyes of the commonalty the Spanish leader was a "hero-god" 
indeed. In this interesting figure several of the monkish chroniclers of New 
Spain saw the Apostle St. Thomas, who had journeyed to the American 
continent to effect its conversion to Christianity.

A Peruvian Prophecy
The Mexicans were by no means singular in their presentiments. When Hernando 
de Soto, on landing in Peru, first met the Inca Huascar, the latter related 
an ancient prophecy which his father, Huaina Ccapac, had repeated on his 
death-bed, that in the reign of the thirteenth Inca white men of surpassing 
strength and valour would come from their father the Sun, and subject the 
Peruvians to their rule. "I command you," said the dying king," to yield 
them homage and obedience, for they will be of a nature superior to ours." 
[Garcilasso el Inca de la Vega, Hist. des Incas, lib. ix. cap. 15.]

But the most interesting of American legends connected with the discovery is 
that in which the prophecy ot the Maya priest Chilan Balam is described. 
Father Lizana, a venerable Spanish author, records the prophecy, which he 
states was very well known throughout Yucatan, as does Villagutierre, who 
quotes it.

The Prophecy of Chilan Balam
Part of this strange prophecy runs as follows: "At the end of the thirteenth 
age, when Itza is at the height of its power, as also the city called 
Tancah, the signal of God will appear on the heights, and the Cross with 
which the world was enlightened will be manifested. There will be variance 
of men's will in future times, when this signal shall be brought. . . . 
Receive your barbarous bearded guests from the cast, who bring the signal of 
God, who comes to us in mercy and pity. The time of our life is coming. . . 
."

It would seem from the perusal of this prophecy that a genuine substratum of 
native tradition has been overlaid and coloured by the influence of the 
early Spanish missionaries. The terms of the announcement are much too 
exact, and the language employed is obviously Scriptural. But the native 
books of Chilan Balam, whence the prophecy is taken, are much less explicit, 
and the genuineness of their character is evinced by the idiomatic use of 
the Maya tongue, which, in the form they present it in, could have been 
written by none save those who had habitually employed it from infancy. As 
regards the prophetic nature of these deliverances it is known that the 
Chilan, or priest, was wont to utter publicly at the end of certain 
prolonged periods a prophecy forecasting the character of the similar period 
to come, and there is reason to believe that some distant rumours of the 
coming of the white man had reached the ears of several of the seers.

These vague intimations that the seas separated them from a great continent 
where dwelt beings like themselves seem to have been common to white and red 
men alike. And who shall say by what strange magic of telepathy they were 
inspired in the minds of the daring explorers and the ascetic priests who 
gave expression to them in act and utterance? The discovery of America was 
much more than a mere scientific process, and romance rather than the cold 
speculations of mediæval geography urged men to tempt the dim seas of the 
West in quest of golden islands seen in dreams.

The Type of Mexican Civilisation
The first civilised American people with whom the discoverers came into 
contact were those of the Nahua or ancient Mexican race. We use the term 
"civilised" advisedly, for although several authorities of standing have 
refused to regard the Mexicans as a people who had achieved such a state of 
culture as would entitle them to be classed among civilised communities, 
there is no doubt that they had advanced nearly as far as it was possible 
for them to proceed when their environment and the nature of the 
circumstances which handicapped them are taken into consideration. In 
architecture they had evolved a type of building, solid yet wonderfully 
graceful, which, if not so massive as the Egyptian and Assyrian, was yet 
more highly decorative. Their artistic outlook as expressed in their 
painting and pottery was more versatile and less conventional than that of 
the ancient people of the Orient, their social system was of a more advanced 
type, and a less rigorous attitude was evinced by the ruling caste toward 
the subject classes. Yet, on the other hand, the picture is darkened by the 
terrible if picturesque rites which attended their religious ceremonies, and 
the dread shadow of human sacrifice which eternally overhung their teeming 
populations. Nevertheless, the standard of morality was high, justice was 
even-handed, the forms of government were comparatively mild, and but for 
the fanaticism which demanded such troops of victims, we might justly 
compare the civilisation of ancient Mexico with that of the peoples of old 
China or India, if the literary activity of the Oriental states be 
discounted.

The Mexican Race
The race which was responsible for this varied and highly coloured 
civilisation was that known as the Nahua (Those who live by Rule), a title 
adopted by them to distinguish them from those tribes who still roamed in an 
unsettled condition over the contiguous plains of New Mexico and the more 
northerly tracts. This term was employed by them to designate the race as a 
whole, but it was composed of many diverse elements, the characteristics of 
which were rendered still more various by the adoption into one or other of 
the tribes which composed it of surrounding aboriginal peoples. Much 
controversy has raged round the question regarding the original home of the 
Nahua, but their migration legends consistently point to a northern origin; 
and when the close affinity between the art-forms and mythology of the 
present-day natives of British Columbia and those of the Nahua comes to be 
considered along with the very persistent legends of a prolonged pilgrimage 
from the North, where they dwelt in a place "by the water," the conclusion 
that the Nahua emanated from the region indicated is well-nigh irresistible. 
[See Payne, History of the New World called America, vol. ii. pp 373 et 
seq.]

In Nahua tradition the name of the locality whence the race commenced its 
wanderings is called Aztlan (The Place of Reeds), but this place-name is of 
little or no value as a guide to any given region, though probably every 
spot betwixt Behring Strait and Mexico has been identified with it by 
zealous antiquarians. Other names discovered in the migration legends are 
Tlapallan (The Country of Bright Colours) and Chicomoztoc (The Seven Caves), 
and these may perhaps be identified with New Mexico or Arizona.

Legends of Mexican Migration
All early writers on the history of Mexico agree that the Toltecs were the 
first of the several swarms of Nahua who streamed upon the Mexican plateau 
in ever-widcning waves. Concerning the reality of this people so little is 
known that many authorities of standina have regarded them as wholly 
mythical, while others profess to see in them a veritable race, the founders 
of Mexican civilisation. The author has already elaborated his theory of 
this difficult question elsewhere,' but will briefly refer to it when he 
comes to deal with the subject of the Toltec civilisation and the legends 
concerning it. For the present we must regard the Toltecs merely as a race 
alluded to in a migration myth as the first Nahua immigrants to the region 
of Mexico. Ixtlilxochitl, a native chronicler who flourished shortly after 
the Spanish conquest of Mexico, gives two separate accounts of the early 
Toltec migrations, the first of which goes back to the period of their 
arrival in the fabled land of Tlapallan, alluded to above. In this account 
Tlapallan is described as a region near the sea, which the Toltecs reached 
by voyaging southward, skirting the coasts of California.

This account must be received with the greatest caution. But we know that 
the natives of British Columbia have been expert in the use of the canoe 
from an early period, and that the Mexican god Quetzalcoatl, who is probably 
originally derived from a common source with their deity Yed, is represented 
as being skilled in the management of the craft. It is, therefore, not 
outside the bounds of possibility that the early swarms of Nahua immigrants 
made their way to Mexico by sea, but it is much more probable that their 
migrations took place by land, following the level country at the base of 
the Rocky Mountains.

The Toltec Upheaval
Like nearly all legendary immigrants, the Toltecs did not set out to 
colonise distant countries from any impulse of their own, but were the 
victims of internecine dissension in the homeland, and were expelled from 
the community to seek their fortunes elsewhere. Thus thrust forth, they set 
their faces southward, and reached Tlapallan in the year 1 Tecpatl (A.D. 
387). Passing the country of Xalisco, they effected a landing at Huatulco, 
and journeyed down the coast until they reached Tochtepec, whence they 
pushed inland to Tollantzinco. To enable them to make this journey they 
required no less than 104 years. Ixtlilxochitl furnishes another account of 
the Toltec migration in his Relaciones, a work dealing with the early 
history of the Mexican races. In this he recounts how the chiefs of 
Tlapallan, who had revolted against the royal power, were banished from that 
region inA. D. 439. Lingering near their ancient territory for the space of 
eight years, they then journeyed to Tlapallantzinco, where they halted for 
three years before setting out on a prolonged pilgrimage, which occupied the 
tribe for over a century, and in the course of which it halted at no less 
than thirteen different resting-places, six of which can be traced to 
stations on the Pacific coast, and the remainder to localities in the north 
of Mexico.

Artificial Nature of the Migration Myths
It is plain from internal evidence that these two legends of the Toltec 
migrations present an artificial aspect. But if we cannot credit them in 
detail, that is not to say that they do not describe in part an actual 
pilgrimage. They are specimens of numerous migration myths which are related 
concerning the various branches of the Mexican races. Few features of 
interest are presented in them, and they are chiefly remarkable for 
wearisome repetition and divergence in essential details.

Myths of the Toltecs
But we enter a much more fascinating domain when we come to peruse the myths 
regarding the Toltec kingdom and civilisation, for, before entering upon the 
origin or veritable history of the Toltec race, it will be better to 
consider the native legends concerning them. These exhibit an almost 
Oriental exuberance of imagination and colouring, and forcibly remind the 
reader of the gorgeous architectural and scenic descriptions in the 4rabian 
Nights. The principal sources of these legends are the histories of 
Zumarraga and Ixtlilxochitl. The latter is by no means a satisfactory 
authority, but he has succeeded in investing the traditions of his native 
land with no inconsiderable degree of charm. The Toltecs, he says, founded 
the magnificent city of Tollan in the year 566 of the Incarnation. This 
city, the site of which is now occupied by the modern town of Tula, was 
situated north-west of the mountains which bound the Mexican valley. Thither 
were the Toltecs guided by the powerful necromancet Hueymatzin (Great Hand), 
and under his direction they decided to build a city upon the site of what 
bad been their place of bivouac. For six years they toiled at the building 
of Tollan, and magnificent edifices, palaces, and temples arose, the whole 
forming a capital of a splendour unparalleled in the New World. The valley 
wherein it stood was known as the "Place of Fruits," in allusion to its 
great fertility. The surrounding rivers teemed with fish, and the hills 
which encircled this delectable site sheltered large herds of game. But as 
yet the Toltecs were without a ruler, and in the seventh year of their 
occupation of the city the assembled chieftains took counsel together, and 
resolved to surrender their power into the hands of a monarch whom the 
people might elect. The choice fell upon Chalchiuh Tlatonac (Shining 
Precious Stone), who reigned for fifty-two years.

Legends of Toltec Artistry
Happily settled in their new country, and ruled over by a king whom they 
could regard with reverence, the Toltecs made rapid progress in the various 
arts, and their city began to be celebrated far and wide for the excellence 
of its craftsmen and the beauty of its architecture and pottery. The name of 
"Toltec," in fact, came to be regarded by the surrounding peoples as 
synonymous with "artist," and as a kind of hall-mark which guaranteed the 
superiority of any article of Toltec workmanship. Everything in and about 
the city was eloquent of the taste and artistry of its founders. The very 
walls were encrusted with rare stones, and their masonry was so beautifully 
chiselled and laid as to resemble the choicest mosaic. One of the edifices 
of which the inhabitants of Tollan were most justly proud was the temple 
wherein their high-priest officiated. This building was a very gem of 
architectural art and mural decoration. It contained four apartments. The 
walls of the first were inlaid with gold, the second with precious stones of 
every description, the third with beautiful sea-shells of all conceivable 
hues and of the most brilliant and tender shades encrusted in bricks of 
silver, which sparkled in the sun in such a manner as to dazzle the eyes of 
beholders. The fourth apartment was formed of a brilliant red stone, 
ornamented with shells.

The House of Feathers
Still more fantastic and weirdly beautiful was another edifice, "The House 
of Feathers." This also possessed four apartments, one decorated with 
feathers of a brilliant yellow, another with the radiant and sparkling hues 
of the Blue Bird. These were woven into a kind of tapestry, and placed 
against the walls in graceful hangings and festoons. An apartment described 
as of entrancing beauty was that in which the decorative scheme consisted of 
plumage of the purest and most dazzling white. The remaining chamber was 
hung with feathers of a brilliant red, plucked from the most beautiful 
birds.

Huemac the Wicked
A succession of more or less able kings succeeded the founder of the Toltec 
monarchy, until in A.D. 994 Huemac II ascended the throne of Tollan. He 
ruled first with wisdom, and paid great attention to the duties of the state 
and religion. But later he fell from the high place he had made for himself 
in the regard of the people by his faithless deception of them and his 
intemperate and licentious habits. The provinces rose in revolt, and many 
signs and gloomy omens foretold the downfall of the city. Toveyo, a cunning 
sorcerer, Collected a great concourse of people near Tollan, and by dint of 
beating upon a magic drum until the darkest hours of the night, forced them 
to dance to its sound until, exhausted by their efforts, they fell headlong 
over a dizzy precipice into a deep ravine, where they were turned into 
stone. Toveyo also maliciously destroyed a stone bridge, so that thousands 
of people fell into the river beneath and were drowned. The neighbouring 
volcanoes burst into eruption, presenting a frightful aspect, and grisly 
apparitions could be seen among the flames threatening the city with 
terrible gestures of menace.

The rulers of Tollan resolved to lose no time in placating the gods, whom 
they decided from the portents must have conceived the most violent wrath 
against their capital. They therefore ordained a reat sacrifice of war-
captives. But upon the first orthe victims being placed upon the altar a 
still more terrible catastrophe occurred. In the method of sacrifice common 
to the Nahua race the breast of a youth was opened for the purpose of 
extracting the heart, but no such organ could the officiating priest 
perceive. Moreover the veins of the victim were bloodless. Such a deadly 
odour was exhaled from the corpse that a terrible pestilence arose, which 
caused the death of thousands of Toltecs. Huemac, the unrighteous monarch 
who had brought all this suffering upon his folk, was confronted in the 
forest by the Tlalocs, or gods of moisture, and humbly petitioned these 
deities to spare him, and not to take from him his wealth and rank. But the 
go,is were disgusted at the callous selfishness displayed in his desires, 
and departed, threatening the Toltec race with six years of plagues.

The Plagues of the Toltecs
In the next winter such a severe frost visited the land that all crops and 
plants were killed. A summer of torrid heat followed, so intense in its 
suffocating fierceness that the streams, were dried up and the very rocks 
were melted. Then heavy rain-storms descended, which flooded the streets and 
ways, and terrible tempests swept through the land. Vast numbers of 
loathsome toads invaded the valley, consuming the refuse left by the 
destructive frost and heat, and entering the very houses of the people. In 
the following year a terrible drought caused the death of thousands from 
starvation, and the ensuing winter was again a marvel of severity. Locusts 
descended in cloud-like swarms, and hail- and thunder-storms completed the 
wreck. During these visitations nine-tenths of the people perished, and all 
artistic endeavour ceased because of the awful struggle for food.

King Acxitl
With the cessation of these inflictions the wicked Huemac resolved upon a 
more upright course of life, and became most assiduous for the welfare and 
proper government of his people. But he had announced that Acxitl, his 
illegitimate son, should succeed him, and had further resolved to abdicate 
at once in favour of this youth. With the Toltecs, as with most primitive 
peoples, the early kings were regarded as divine, and the attempt to place 
on the throne one who was not of the royal blood was looked upon as a 
serious offence against the gods. A revolt ensued, but its two principal 
leaders were bought over by promises of preferment. Acxitl ascended the 
throne, and for a time ruled wisely. But he soon, like his father, gave way 
to a life of dissipation, and succeeded in setting a bad example to the 
members of his court and to the priesthood, the vicious spirit communicating 
itself to all classes of his subjects and permeating every rank of society. 
The iniquities of the people of the capital and the enormities practised by 
the royal favourites caused such scandal in the outlying provinces that at 
length they broke into open revolt, and Huehuetzin, chief of an eastern 
viceroyalty, joined to himself two other malcontent lords and marched upon 
the city of Tollan at the head of a strong force. Acxitl could not muster an 
army sufficiently powerful to repel the rebels, and was forced to resort to 
the expedient of buying them off with rich presents, thus patching up a 
truce. But the fate of Tollan was in the balance. Hordes of rude Chichimec 
savages, profiting by the civil broils in the Toltec state, invaded the lake 
region of Anahuac, or Mexico, and settled upon its fruitful soil. The end 
was in sight!

A Terrible Visitation
The wrath of the gods increased instead of diminishing, and in order to 
appease them a great convention of the wise men of the realm met at 
Teotihuacan, the sacred city of the Toltecs. But during their deliberations 
a giant of immense proportions rushed into their midst, and, seizing upon 
them by scores with his bony hands, hurled them to the ground, dashing their 
brains out. In this manner he slew great numbers, and when the panic-
stricken folk imagined themselves delivered from him he returned in a 
different guise and slew many more. Again the grisly monster appeared, this 
time taking the form of a beautiful child. The people, fascinated by its 
loveliness, ran to observe it more closely, only to discover that its head 
was a mass of corruption, the stench from which was so is fatal that many 
were killed outright. The fiend who had thus plagued the Toltecs at length 
deigned to inform them that the gods would listen no longer to their 
prayers, but had fully resolved to destroy them root and branch, and he 
further counselled them to seek safety in flight.

Fall of the Toltec State
By this time the principal families of Tollan had deserted the country, 
taking refuge in neighbouring states. Once more Huehuetzin menaced Tollan, 
and by dint of almost superhuman efforts old King Huemac, who had left his 
retirement, raised a force sufficient to face the enemy. Acxitl's mother 
enlisted the services of the women of the city, and formed them into a 
regiment of Amazons. At the head of all was Acxitl, who divided his forces, 
despatching one portion to the front under his commander-in-chief, and 
forming the other into a reserve under his own leadership. During three 
years the king defended Tollan against the combined forces of the rebels and 
the semi-savage Chichimecs. At length the Toltecs, almost decimated, fled 
after a final desperate battle into the marshes of Lake Tezcuco and the 
fastnesses of the mountains. Their other cities were given over to 
destruction, and the Toltec empire was at an end.

The Chichimec Exodus
Meanwhile the rude Chichimecs of the north, who had for many years carried 
on a constant warfare with the Toltecs, were surprised that their enemies 
sought their borders no more, a practice which they had engaged in 
principally for the purpose of obtaining captives for sacrifice. In order to 
discover the reason for this suspicious quiet they sent out spies into 
Toltec territory, who returned with the amazing news that the Toltec domain 
for a distance of six hundred miles from the Chichimec frontier was a 
desert, the towns ruined and empty and their inhabitants scattered. Xolotl, 
the Chichimec king, summoned his chieftains to his capital, and, acquainting 
them with what the spies had said) proposed an expedition for the purpose of 
annexing the abandoned land. No less than 3,202,000 people composed this 
migration, and only 1,6oo,ooo remained in the Chichimec territory.

The Chichimecs occupied most of the ruined cities, many of which they 
rebuilt. Those Toltecs who remained became peaceful subjects, and through 
their knowledge of commerce and handicrafts amassed considerable wealth. A 
tribute was, however, demanded from them, which was peremptorily refused by 
Nauhyotl, the Toltec ruler of Colhuacan; but he was defeated and slain, and 
the Chichimec rule was at last supreme.

The Disappearance of the Toltecs
The transmitters of this legendary account give it as their belief which is 
shared by some authorities of standing, that the Toltecs, fleein-a from the 
civil broils of their city and the inroads of the Chichimecs, passed into 
Central America, where they became the founders of the civilisation of that 
country, and the architects of the many wonderful cities the ruins of which 
now litter its plains and are encountered in its forests. But it is time 
that we examined the claims put forward on behalf of Toltec civilisation and 
culture by the aid of more scientific methods.

Did the Toltecs Exist?
Some authorities have questioned the existence of the Toltecs, and have 
professed to see in them a race which had merely a mythical significance. 
They base this theory upon the circumstance that the duration of the reigns 
of the several Toltec monarchs is very frequently stated to have lasted for 
exactly fifty-two years, the duration of the great Mexican cycle of years 
which had been adopted so that the ritual calendar might coincide with the 
solar year. The circumstance is certainly suspicious, as is the fact that 
many of the names of the Toltec monarchs are also those of the principal 
Nahua deities, and this renders the whole dynastic list of very doubtful 
value. Dr. Brinton recognised in the Toltecs those children of the sun who, 
like their brethren in Peruvian mythology, were sent from heaven to civilise 
the human race, and his theory is by no means weakened by the circumstance 
that Quetzalcoatl, a deity of solar significance, is alluded to in Nahua 
myth as King of the Toltecs. Recent considerations and discoveries, however, 
have virtually forced students of the subject to admit the existence of the 
Toltecs as a race. The author has dealt with the question at some length 
elsewhere, [see Civilization of Ancient Mexico, chap ii] and is not of those 
who are free to admit the definite existence of the Toltecs from a 
historical point of view. The late Mr. Payne of Oxford, an authority 
entitled to every respect, gave it as his opinion that " the accounts of 
Toltec history current at the conquest contain a nucleus of substantial 
truth, and he writes convincingly: "To doubt that there once existed in 
Tollan an advancement superior to that which prevailed among the Nahuatlaca 
generally at the conquest, and that its people spread their advancement 
throughout Anahuac, and into the districts eastward and southward, would be 
to reject a belief universally entertained, and confirmed rather than shaken 
by the cfforts made in later times to construct for the Pueblo something in 
the nature of a history." [Payne, Hist. New World, vol ii. p. 430]

A Persistent Tradition
The theory of the present author concerning Toltec historical existence is 
rather more non-committal. He admits that a most persistent body of 
tradition as to their existence gained general credence among the Nahua, and 
that the date (1055) of their alleged dispersal admits of the approximate 
exactness and probability of this body of tradition at the time of the 
conquest. He also admits that the site of Tollan contains ruins which arc 
undoubtedly of a date earlier than that of the architecture of the Nahua as 
known at the conquest, and that numerous evidences of an older civilisation 
exist. He also believes that the early Nahua having within their racial 
recollection existed as savages, the time which elapsed between their 
barbarian condition and the more advanced state which they achieved was too 
brief to admit of evolution from savagery to culture. Hence they must have 
adopted an older civilisation, especially as through the veneer of 
civilisation possessed by them they exhibited every sign of gross barbarism.

A Nameless People
If this be true it would go to show that a people of comparatively high 
culture existed at a not very remote period on the Mexican tableland. But 
what their name was or their racial affinity the writer does not profess to 
know. Many modern American scholars of note have conferred upon them the 
name of "Toltecs," and speak freely of the "Toltec period" and of "Toltec 
art." It may appear pedantic to refuse to recognisc that the cultured people 
who dwelt in Mexico in pre-Nahua times were "the Toltecs." But in the face 
of the absence of genuine and authoritative native written records dealing 
with the question, the author finds himself compelled to remain unconvinced 
as to the exact designation of the mysterious older race which preceded the 
Nahua. There are not wanting authorities who appear to regard the pictorial 
chronicles of the Nahua as quite as worthy of credence as written records, 
but it must be clear that tradition or even history set down in pictorial 
form can never possess that degree of definiteness contained in a written 
account.

Toltec Art
As has been stated above, the Toltecs of tradition were chiefly remarkable 
for their intense love of art and their productions in its various branches. 
Ixtlilxochitl says that they worked in gold, silver, copper, tin, and lead, 
and as masons employed flint, porphyry, basalt, and obsidian. In the 
manufacture of jewellery and objets d'art they excelled, and the pottery of 
Cholula, of which specimens are frequently recovered, was of a high 
standard.

Other Aboriginal Peoples
Mexico contained other aboriginal races besides the Toltecs. Of these many 
and diverse peoples the most remarkable were the Otomi, who still occupy 
Guanajuato and Queretaro, and who, before the coming of the Nahua, probably 
spread over the entire valley of Mexico. In the south we find the Huasteca, 
a people speaking the same language as the Maya of Central America, and on 
the Mexican Gulf the Totonacs and Chontals. On the Pacific side of the 
country the Mixteca and Zapoteca, were responsible for a flourishing 
civilisation which exhibited many original characteristics, and which in 
some degree was a link between the cultures of Mexico and Central America. 
Traces of a still older population than any of these are still to be found 
in the more remote parts of Mexico, and the Mixe, Zaque, Kuicatec, and 
Popolcan are probably the remnants of prehistoric races of vast antiquity.

The Cliff-dwellers
It is probable that a race known as "the Cliff. dwellers," occupying the 
plateau country of Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, and Utah, and even 
extending in its ramifications to Mexico itself, was related ethnologically 
to the Nahua. The present-day Pueblo Indians dwelling to the north of Mexico 
most probably possess a leaven of Nahua blood. Ere the tribes who 
communicated this leaven to thewhole had intermingled with others, of 
various origin, it would appear that they occupied' with others those tracts 
of country now inhabited by the Pueblo Indians, and in the natural recesses 
and shallow caverns found in the faces of the cliffs erected dwellings and 
fortifications, displaying an architectural ability of no mean order. These 
communities extended as far south as the Gila river, the most southern 
affluent of the Colorado, and the remains they have left there appear to be 
of a later date architecturally than those situated farther north. These 
were found in ruins by the first Spanish explorers, and it is thought that 
their builders were eventually driven back to rejoin their kindred in the 
north. Fartner to the south in the caflons of the Piedras Verdes river in 
Chihuahua., Mexico, are cliff-dwellings corresponding in many respects with 
those of the Pueblo region, and Dr. Hrdlicka has examined others so far 
south as the State of Jalisco, in Central Mexico. These may be the ruins of 
dwellings erected either by the early Nahua or by some of the peoples 
relatively aboriginal to them, and may display the architectural features 
general among the Nahua prior to their adoption of other alien forms. Or 
else they may be the remains of dwellings similar to those of the 
Tarahumare, a still existing tribe of Mexico, who, according to Lumholtz, 
[Unknown Mexico, vol. i., 1902; also see Bulletin 30, Bureau of American 
Ethnology, p. 309] inhabit similar structures at the present day. It is 
clear from the architectural development of the cliff-dwellers that their 
civilisation developed generally from south to north, that this race was 
cognate to the early Nahua, and that it later withdrew to the north, or 
became fused with the general body of the Nahua peoples. It must not be 
understood, however, that the race arrived in the Mexican plateau before the 
Nahua, and the ruins of Jalisco and other mid-Mexican districts may merely 
be the remains of comparatively modern cliff-dwellings, an adaptation by 
mid-Mexican communities of the "Cliff-dweller" architecture, or a local 
development of it owing to the exigencies of early life in the district.

The Nahua Race
The Nahua peoples included all those tribes speaking the Nahuatlatolli 
(Nahua tongue), and occupied a sphere extending from the southern borders of 
New Mexico to the Isthmus of Tehuantepec on the south, or very much within 
the limits of the modern Republic ot Mexico. But this people must not be 
regarded as one race of homogeneous origin. A very brief account of their 
racial affinities must be sufficient here. The Chichimecs were probably 
related to the Otomi, whom we have alluded to as among the first-comers to 
the Mexican valley. They were traditionally supposed to have entered it at a 
period subsequent to the Toltec occupation. Their chief towns were Tezcuco 
and Tena, yucan, but they later allied themselves with the Nahua in a great 
confederacy, and adopted the Nahua language. There are circumstances which 
justify the assumption that on their entrance to the Mexican valley they 
consisted of a number of tribes loosely united, presenting in their general 
organisation a close resemblance to some of the composite tribes of modern 
American Indians.

The Aculhuaque
Next to them in point of order of tribal arrival were the 
Aculhuaque,orAcolhuans. The name means "tall" or strong" men, literally 
"People of the Broad Shoulder," or "Pushers," who made a way for themselves. 
Gomara states in his Conquista de Mexico that they arrived in the valley 
from Acolhuacan about A.D. 780, and founded the towns of Tollan, Colhuacan, 
and Mexico itself. The Acolhuans were pure Nahua, and may well have been the 
much-disputed Toltecs, for the Nahua people always insisted on the fact that 
the Toltecs were of the same stock as themselves, and spoke an older and 
purer form of the Nahua tongue. From the Acolhuans sprang the Tlascalans, 
the inveterate enemies of the Aztecs, who so heartily assisted Cortés in his 
invasion of the Aztec capital, Tenochtitlan, or Mexico.

The Tecpanecs
The Tecpanecs were a confederacy of purely Nahua tribes dwelling in towns 
situated upon the Lake of Tezcuco, the principal of which were Tlacopan and 
Azcapozalco. The name Tecpanec signifies that each settlement possessed its 
own chief's house, or tecpan. This tribe were almost certainly later Nahua 
immigrants who arrived in Mexico after the Acolhuans, and were great rivals 
to the Chichimec branch of the race.

The Aztecs
The Aztecâ or Aztecs, were a nomad tribe of doubtful origin, but probably of 
Nahua blood. Wandering over the Mexican plateau for generations, they at 
length settled in the marshlands near the Lake of Tezcuco, hard by Tlacopan. 
The name Aztecâ means " Crane People," and was bestowed upon the tribe by 
the Tecpanecs, probably because of the fact that, like cranes, they dwelt in 
a marshy neighbourhood. They founded the town of Tenochtitlan, or Mexico, 
and for a while paid tribute to the Tecpanecs. But later they became the 
most powerful allies of that people, whom they finally surpassed entirely in 
power and splendour.

The Aztec Character
The features of the Aztecs as represented in the various Mexican paintings 
are typically Indian, and argue a northern origin. The race was, and is, of 
average height, and the skin is of a dark brown hue. The Mexican is grave, 
taciturn, and melancholic, with a deeply rooted love of the mysterious, slow 
to anger, yet almost inhuman in the violence of his passions when aroused. 
He is usually gifted with a logical mind, quickness of apprehension, and an 
ability to regard the subtle side of things with great nicety. Patient and 
imitative, the ancient Mexican excelled in those arts which demanded such 
qualities in their execution. He had a real affection for the beautiful in 
nature and a passion for flowers, but the Aztec music lacked gaiety, and the 
national amusements were too often of a gloomy and ferocious character. The 
women are more vivacious than the men, but were in the days before the 
conquest very subservient to the wills of their husbands. We have already 
very briefly outlined the trend of Nahua civilisation, but it will be 
advisable to examine it a little more closely, for if the myths of this 
people are to be understood some knowledge of its life -and general culture 
is essential.

Legends of the Foundation of Mexico
At the period of the conquest of Mexico by Cortés the city presented an 
imposing appearance. Led to its neighbourhood by Huitzilopochtli, a 
traditional chief, afterwards deified as the god of war, there are several 
legends which account for the choice of its site by the Mexicans. The most 
popular of these relates how the nomadic Nahua beheld perched upon a cactus 
plant an eaale of Lreat size and majesty, grasping in its talons a huge 
serpent, and spreading its wings to catch the rays of the rising sun. The 
soothsayers or medicine-men of the tribe, readina a zood omen in the 
spectacle, advised the leaders of the-people to settle on the spot, and, 
hearkening to the voice of what they considered divine authority, they 
proceeded to drive piles into the marshy ground, and thus laid the 
foundation of the great city of Mexico.

An elaboration of this legend tells how the Aztecs had about the year 1325 
sought refuge upon the western shore of the Lake of Tezcuco, in an island 
aniong the marshes on which they found a stone on which forty years before 
one of their priests had sacrificed a prince of the name of Copal, whom they 
had made prisoner. A nopal plant [cactus] had sprung from an earth-filled 
crevice in this rude altar, and upon this the royal eagle alluded to in the 
former account had alighted, grasping the serpent in his talons. Beholding 
in this a good omen, and urged by a supernatural impulse which he could not 
explain, a priest of high rank dived into a pool close at hand, where he 
found himself face to face with Tlaloc, the god of waters. After an 
interview with the deity the priest obtained permission from him to found a 
city on the site, from the humble beginnings of which arose the metropolis 
of Mexico-Tenochtitlan.

Mexico at the Conquest
At the period of the conquest the city of Mexico had a circumference of no 
less than twelve miles, or nearly that of modern Berlin without its suburbs. 
It contained 60,000 houses, and its inhabitants were computed to number 
300,000. Many other towns, most of them nearly half as large, were grouped 
on the islands or on the margin orLake Tezcuco, so that the population of 
what might almost be called "Greater Mexico" must have amounted to several 
millions. The city was intersected by four great roadways or avenues built 
at right angles to one another, and laid four-square with the cardinal 
points. Situated as it was in the midst of a lake, it was traversed by 
numerous canals, which were used as thoroughfares for traffic. The four 
principal ways described above were extended across the lake as dykes or 
viaducts until they met its shores. The dwellings of the poorer classes were 
chiefly composed of adobes, but those of the nobility were built of a red 
porous stone quarried close by. They were usually of one story only, but 
occupied a goodly piece of ground and had flat roofs, many of which were 
covered with flowers. In general they were coated with a hard, white cement, 
which gave them an added resemblance to the Oriental type of building.

Towering high among these, and a little apart from the vast squares and 
market-places, were the teocallis, or temples. These were in reality not 
temples or covered-in buildings, but "high places," great pyramids of stone, 
built platform on platform, around which a staircase led to the summit, on 
which was usually erected a small shrine containing the tutelar deity to 
whom the teocalli had been raised. The great temple of Huitzilopochtli, the 
war-god, built by King Ahuizotl, was, besides being typical of all, by far 
the greatest of these votive piles. The enclosing walls of the building were 
4,800 feet in circumference, and strikingly decorated by carvings 
representing festoons of intertwined reptiles, from which circumstance they 
were called coetpantli (walls of serpents). A kind of gate-house on each 
side gave access to the enclosure. The teocalli, or great temple, inside the 
court was in the shape of a parallelogram, measuring 375 feet by 300 feet, 
and was built in six platforms, growing smaller in area as they descended. 
The mass of this structure was composed of a mixture of rubble, clay, and 
earth, covered with carefully worked stone slabs, cemented together with 
infinite care, and coated with a hard gypsum. A flight Of 340 steps circled 
round the terraces and led to the upper platform, on which were raised two 
three-storied towers 56 feet in height, in which stood the great statues of 
the tutelar deities and the jasper stones of sacrifice. These sanctuaries, 
say the old Conquistadores who entered them, had the appearance and odour of 
shambles, and human blood was bespattered every. where. In this weird chapel 
of horrors burned a fire the extinction of which it was supposed would have 
brought about the end of the Nahua power. It was tended with a care as 
scrupulous as that with which the Roman Vestals guarded their sacred flame. 
No less than 600 of these sacred braziers were kept alight in the city of 
Mexico alone.

A Pyramid of Skulls
The principal fane of Huitzilopochtli was surrounded by upwards of forty 
inferior teocallis and shrines. In the Tzompantli (Pyramid of Skulls) were 
collected the grisly relics of the countless victims to the implacable war-
god of the Aztecs, and in this horrid structure the Spanish conquerors 
counted no less than 136,000 human skulls. In the court or teopan which 
surrounded the temple were the dwellings of thousands of priests, whose 
duties included the scrupulous care of the temple precincts, and whose 
labours were minutely apportioned.

Nahua Architecture and Ruins
As we shall see later, Mexico is by no means so rich in architectural 
antiquities as Guatemala or Yucatan, the reason being that the growth of 
tropical forests has to a areat extent protected ancient stone edifices in 
the latter countries from destruction. The ruins discovered in the northern 
regions of the republic are of a ruder type than those which approach more 
nearly to the sphere of Maya influence, as, for example, those of Mitla, 
built by the Zapotecs, which exhibit such unmistakable signs of Maya 
influence that we prefer to describe them when dealing with the antiquities 
of that people.

Cyclopean Remains
In the mountains of Chihuahua, one of the most northerly provinces, is a 
celebrated group called the Casas Grandes (Large Houses), the walls of which 
are still about 30 feet in height. These approximate in general appearance 
to the buildings of more modern tribes in New Mexico and Arizona, and may be 
referred to such peoples rather than to the Nahua. At Quemada, in Zacatecas, 
massive ruins of Cyclopean appearance have been discovered. These consist of 
extensive terraces and broad stone causeways, teocallis which have weathered 
many centuries, and gigantic pillars, 18 feet in height and 17 feet in 
circumference. Walls 12 feet in thickness rise above the heaps of rubbish 
which litter the ground. These remains exhibit little connection with Nahua 
architecture to the north or south of them. They are more massive than 
either, and must have been constructed by some race which had made 
considerable strides in the art of building.

Teotihuacan
In the district of the Totonacs, to the north of Vera Cruz, we find many 
architectural remains of a highly interesting character. Here the teocalli 
or pyramidal type of building is occasionally crowned by a coveredin temple 
with the massive roof characteristic of Maya architecture. The most striking 
examples found in this region are the remains of Teotihuacan and Xochicalco. 
The former was the religious Mecca of the Nahua races, and in its proximity 
are still to be seen the teocallis of the sun and moon, surrounded by 
extensive burying-grounds where the devout of Anahuac were laid in the sure 
hope that if interred they would find entrance into the paradise of the sun. 
The teocalli of the moon has a base covering 426 feet and a height Of 137 
feet. That of the sun is of greater dimensions, with a base Of 735 feet and 
a height Of 203 feet. These pyramids were divided into four stories, three 
of which remain. On the summit of that of the sun stood a temple containing 
a great image of that luminary carved from a rough block of stone. In the 
breast was inlaid a star of the purest gold, seized afterwards as loot by 
the insatiable followers of Cortés. From the teocalli of the moon a path 
runs to where a little rivulet flanks the "Citadel." This path is known as 
"The Path of the Dead," from the circumstance that it is surrounded by some 
nine square miles of tombs and tumuli, and., indeed, forms a road through 
the great cemetery. The Citadel, thinks Charnay, was a vast tennis or 
tlachtli court, where thousands flocked to gaze at the national sport of the 
Nahua with a zest equal to that of the modern devotees of football. 
Teotihuacan was a flourishing centre contemporary with Tollan. It was 
destroyed, but was rebuilt by the Chichimec king Xolotll and preserved 
thenceforth its traditional sway as the focus of the Nahua national 
religion. Charnay identifies the architectural types discovered there with 
those of Tollan. The result of his labours in the vicinity included the 
unearthing of richly decorated pottery, vases, masks, and terra-cotta 
figures. He also excavated several large houses or palaces, some with 
chambers more than 730 feet in circumference, with walls over 7½ feet thick, 
into which were built rings and slabs to support torches and candles. The 
floors were tessellated in various rich designs, "like an Aubusson carpet." 
Charnay concluded that the monuments of Teotihuacan were partly standing at 
the time of the conquest.

The Hill of Flowers
Near Tezcuco is Xochicalco (The Hill of Flowers), a teocalli the sculpture 
of which is both beautiful and luxuriant in design. The porphyry quarries 
from which the great blocks, 12 feet in length, were cut lie many miles 
away. As late as 1755 the structure towered to a height of five stories, but 
the vandal has done his work only too well, and a few fragmentary carvings 
of exquisite design are all that to-day remain of one of Mexico's most 
magnificent pyramids.

Tollan
We have already indicated that on the site of the "Toltec" city of Tollan 
ruins have been discovered which prove that it was the centre of a 
civilisation of a type distinctly advanced. Charnay unearthed there gigantic 
fragments of caryatides, each some 7 feet high. He also found columns of two 
pieces, which were fitted together by means of mortise and tenon, bas-
reliefs of archaic figures of undoubted Nahua type, and many fragments of 
great antiquity. On the hill of Palpan, above Tollan, he found the ground-
plans of several houses with numerous apartments, frescoed, columned, and 
having benches and cisterns recalling the impluvium of a Roman villa. Water-
pipes were also actually unearthed, and a wealth of pottery, many pieces of 
which were like old Japanese china. The ground-plan or foundations of the 
houses unearthed at Palpan showed that they had been designed by practical 
architects, and had not been built in any merely haphazard fashion. The 
cement which covered the walls and floors was of excellent quality, and 
recalled that discovered in ancient Italian excavations. The roofs had been 
of wood, supported by pillars.

Picture-Writing
The Aztecs, and indeed the entire Nahua race., employed a system of writing 
of the type scientifically described as "pictographic," in which events, 
persons, and ideas were recorded by means of drawings and coloured sketches. 
These were executed on paper made from the agave plant, or were painted on 
the skins of animals. By these means not only history and the principles of 
the Nahua mythology were communicated from generation to generation, but the 
transactions of daily life, the accountings of merchants, and the purchase 
and ownership of land were placed on record. That a phonetic system was 
rapidly being approached is manifest from the method by which the Nahua 
scribes depicted the names of individuals or cities. These were represented 
by means of several objects, the names of which resembled that of the person 
for which they stood. The name of King Ixcoatl, for example, is represented 
by the drawing of a serpent (coatl) pierced by flint knives (iztli), and 
that of Motequauhzoma (Montezuma) by a mouse-trap (montli), an eagle 
(quauhtli), a lancet (zo), and a hand (maitl). The phonetic values employed 
by the scribes varied exceedingly, so that at times an entire syllable would 
be expressed by the painting of an object the name of which commenced with 
it. At other times only a letter would be represented by the same drawing. 
But the general intention of the scribes was undoubtedly more ideographic 
than phonetic; that is, they desired to convey their thoughts more by sketch 
than by sound.

Interpretation of the Hieroglyphs
These pinturas, as the Spanish conquerors designated them, offer no very 
great difficulty in their elucidation to modern experts, at least so far as 
the general trend of their contents is concerned. In this they are unlike 
the manuscripts of the Maya of Central America with which we shall make 
acquaintance further on. Their interpretation was largely traditional, and 
was learned by rote, being passed on by one generation of amamatini 
(readers) to another, and was by no means capable of elucidation by all and 
sundry.

Native Manuscripts
The pinturas or native manuscripts which remain to us are but few in number. 
Priestly fanaticism, which ordained their wholesale destruction, and the 
still more potent passage of time have so reduced them that each separate 
example is known to bibliophiles and Americanists the world over. In such as 
still exist we can observe great fullness of detail, representing for the 
most part festivals, sacrifices, tributes, and natural phenomena, such as 
eclipses and floods, and the death and accession of monarchs. These events, 
and the supernatural beings who were supposed to control them, were depicted 
in brilliant colours, executed by means of a brush of feathers.

The Interpretative Codices
Luckily for future students of Mexican history, the blind zeal which 
destroyed the majority of the Mexican manuscripts was frustrated by the 
enlightenment of certain European scholars, who regarded the wholesale 
destruction of the native records as little short of a calamity, and who 
took steps to seek out the few remaining native artists, from whom they 
procured copies of the more important paintings, the details of which were, 
of course, quite familiar to them. To those were added interpretations taken 
down from the lips of the native scribes themselves, so that no doubt might 
remain regarding the contents of the manuscripts. These are known as the 
"Interpretative Codices," and are of considerable assistance to the student 
of Mexican history and customs. Three only are in existence. The Oxford 
Codex, treasured in the Bodleian Library, is of a historical nature, and 
contains a full list of the lesser cities which were subservient to Mexico 
in its palmy days. The Paris or Tellerio-Remensis Codex, so called from 
having once been the property of Le Tellier, Archbishop of Rheims, embodies 
many facts concerning the early settlement of the various Nahua city-states. 
The Vatican MSS. deal chiefly with mythology and the intricacies of the 
Mexican calendar system. Such Mexican paintings as were unassisted by an 
interpretation are naturally of less value to present-day students of the 
lore of the Nahua. They are principally concerned with calendric matter, 
ritualistic data, and astrological computations or horoscopes.

The Mexican "Book of the Dead"
Perhaps the most remarkable and interesting manuscript in the Vatican 
collection is one the last pages of which represent the journey of the soul 
after death through the gloomy dangers of the Other-world. This has been 
called the Mexican "Book of the Dead." The corpse is depicted dressed for 
burial, the soul escaping from its earthly tenement by way of the mouth. The 
spirit is ushered into the presence of Tezcatlipoca, the Jupiter of the 
Aztec pantheon, by an attendant dressed in an ocelot skin, and stands naked 
with a wooden yoke round the neck before the deity, to receive sentence. The 
dead person is given over to the tests which precede entrance to the abode 
of the dead, the realm of Mictlan, and so that he may not have to meet the 
perils of the journey in a defenceless condition a sheaf of javelins is 
bestowed upon him. He first passes between two lofty peaks, which may fall 
and crush him if he cannot skilfully escape them. A terrible serpent then 
intercepts his path, and, if he succeeds in defeating this monster, the 
fierce alligator Xochitonal awaits him. Eight deserts and a corresponding 
number of mountains have then to be negotiated by the hapless spirit, and a 
whirlwind sharp as a sword, which cuts even through solid rocks, must be 
withstood. Accompanied by the shade of his favourite dog, the harassed ghost 
at length encounters the fierce Izpuzteque, a demon with the backward-bent 
legs of a cock, the evil Nextepehua, the fiend who scatters clouds of ashes, 
and many another grisly foe, until at last he wins to the gates of the Lord 
of Hell, before whom he does reverence, after which he is free to greet his 
friends who have gone before.

The Calendar System
As has been said, the calendar system was the source of all Mexican science, 
and regulated the recurrence of all religious rites and festivals. In fact, 
the entire mechanism of Nahua life was resident in its provisions. The type 
of time-division and computation exemplified in the Nahua calendar was also 
found among the Maya peoples of Yucatan and Guatemala and the Zapotec people 
of the boundary between the Nahua and Maya races. By which of these races it 
was first employed is unknown. But the Zapotec calendar exhibits signs or 
both Nahua and Maya influence, and from this it has been inferred that the 
calendar systems of these races have been evolved from it. It might with 
equal probability be argued that both Nahua and Maya art were offshoots of 
Zapotec art, because the characteristics of both are discovered in it, 
whereas the circumstance merely illustrates the very natural acceptance by a 
border people, who settled down to civilisation at a relatively later date, 
of the artistic tenets of the two greater peoples who environed them. The 
Nahua and Maya calendars were in all likelihood evolved from the calendar 
system of that civilised race which undoubtedly existed on the Mexican 
plateau prior to the coming of the later Nahua swarms, and which in general 
is loosely alluded to as the "Toltec."

The Mexican Year
The Mexican year was a cycle Of 365 days, without any intercalary addition 
or other correction. In course of time it almost lost its seasonal 
significance because of the omission of the extra hours included in the 
solar year, and furthermore many of its festivals and occasions were altered 
by high-priests and rulers to suit their convenience. The Mexican 
nexiuhilpilitztli (binding of years) contained fifty-two years, and ran in 
two separate cycles-one of fifty-two years Of 365 days each, and another of 
seventy-three groups of 260 days each. The first was of course the solar 
year, and embraced eighteen periods of twenty days each, called "months " by 
the old Spanish chroniclers, with five nemontemi (unlucky days) over and 
above. These days were not intercalated, but were included in the year, and 
merel overflowed the division of the year into periods of twenty days. The 
cycle of seventy-three groups of 260 days, subdivided into groups of 
thirteen days, was called the "birth-cycle."

Lunar Reckoning
People in a barbarous condition almost invariably reckon time by the period 
between the waxing and waning of the moon as distinct from the entire 
passage of a lunar revolution, and this period of twenty days will be found 
to be the basis in the time-reckoning of the Mexicans, who designated it 
cempohualli. Each day included in it was denoted by a sign, as "house", 
"snake", "wind", and so forth. Each cempohualli was subdivided into four 
periods of five days each, sometimes alluded to as "weeks" by the early 
Spanish writers, and these were known by the sign their middle or third day. 
These day-names ran on without reference to the length of the year. The year 
itself was designated by the name of the middle day of the week in which it 
began. Out of twenty day-names in the Mexican "month " it was inevitable 
that the four calli (house), tochtli (rabbit), acatl (reed), and tecpati 
(flint) should always recur in sequence because of the incidence of these 
days in the Mexican solar year. Four years made up a year of the sun. During 
the nemontemi (unlucky days) no work was done, as they were regarded as 
ominous and unwholesome.

We have seen that the civil year permitted the day-names to run on 
continuously rom one year to another. The ecclesiastical authorities, 
however, had a reckoning of their own, and made the year begin always on the 
first day of their calendar, no matter what sign denominated that day in the 
civil system.

Groups of Years
As has been indicated, the years were formed into groups. Thirteen years 
constituted a xiumalpilli (bundle), and four of these a nexiuhilpilitztli 
(complete binding of the years). Each year had thus a double aspect, first 
as an individual period of time, and secondly as a portion of the "year of 
the sun," and these were so numbered and named that each year in the series 
of fifty-two possessed a different description.

The Dread of the Last Day
With the conclusion of each period of fifty-two years a terrible dread came 
upon the Mexicans that the world would come to an end. A stated period of 
time had expired, a period which was regarded as fixed by divine command, 
and it had been ordained that on the completion of one of those series of 
fifty-two years earthly time would cease and the universe be demolished. For 
some time before the ceremony of toxilmolpilia (the binding up of the years) 
the Mexicans abandoned themselves to the utmost prostration, and the wicked 
went about in terrible fear. As the first day of the fifty-third year dawned 
the people narrowly observed the Pleiades, for if they passed the zenith 
time would procee and the world would be respited. The gods were placated or 
refreshed by the slaughter of the human victim, on whose still living breast 
a fire of wood was kindled by friction, the heart and body being consumed by 
the flames so lighted. As the planets of hope crossed the zenith loud 
acclamations resounded from the people, and the domestic hearths, which had 
been left cold and dead, were rekindled from the sacred fire which had 
consumed the sacrifice. Mankind was safe for another period.

The Birth-Cycle
The birth-cycle, as we have said, consisted of 260 days. It had originally 
been a lunar cycle of thirteen days, and once bore the names of thirteen 
moons. It formed part of the civil calendar, with which, however, it had 
nothing in common, as it was used for ecclesiastical purposes only. The 
lunar names were abandoned later, and the numbers one to thirteen adopted in 
their places.

Language of the Nahua
The Nahua language represented a very low state of culture. Speech is the 
general measure of the standard of thought of a people, and if we judged the 
civilisation of the Nahua by theirs, we should be justified in concluding 
that they had not yet emerged from barbarism. But we must recollect that the 
Nahua of the conquest period had speedily adopted the older civilisation 
which they had found awaiting them on their entrance to Mexico, and had 
retained their own primitive tongue. The older and more cultured people who 
had preceded them probably spoke a more polished dialect of the same 
lanzuage, but its influence had evidently but little on the rude Chichimecs 
and Aztecs. The Mexican tongue, like most American languages, belongs to the 
"incorporative" type, the genius of which is to unite all the related words 
in a sentence into one conglomerate term or word, merging the separate words 
of which it is composed one into another by altering their forms, and so 
welding them together as to express the whole in one word. It will be at 
once apparent that such a system was clumsy in the extreme, and led to the 
creation of words and names of the most barbarous appearance and sound. In a 
narrative of the Spanish discovery written by Chimalpahin, the native 
chronicler of Chalco, born in 1579, we have, for example, such a passage as 
the following: Oc chiucnauhxihuitl inic onen quilantimanca España camo niman 
ic yuh ca omacoc ihuelitiliztli inic niman ye chiuhcnauhxiuhtica, in oncan 
ohualla. This passage is chosen quite at random, and is an average specimen 
of literary Mexican of the sixteenth century. Its purport is, freely 
translated: "For nine years he [Columbus] remained in vain in Spain. Yea, 
for nine years there he waited for influence." The clumsy and cumbrous 
nature of the language could scarcely be better illustrated tnan by pointing 
out that chiucnauhxihuitl signifies "nine years"; quilantimanca, " he below 
remained"; and omacoc ihuelitiliztli, "he has got his powerfulness." It must 
be recollected that this specimen of Mexican was composed by a person who 
had had the benefit of a Spanish education, and is cast in literary form. 
What the spoken Mexican of preconquest times was like can be contemplated 
with misgiving in the grammars of the old Spanish missionaries, whose 
greatest glory is that they mastered such a language in the interests of 
their faith.

Aztec Science
The science of the Aztecs was, perhaps, one of the most picturesque sides of 
their civilisation. As with all peoples in a semi-barbarous state, it 
consisted chiefly in astrology and divination. Of the former the wonderful 
calendar system was the basis, and by its aid the priests, or those of them 
who were set apart for the study of the heavenly bodies, pretended to be 
able to tell the future of new-born infants and the progress of the dead in 
the other world. This they accomplished by weighing the influence of the 
planets and other luminaries one against another, and extracting the net 
result. Their art of divination consisted in drawing omens from the song and 
flight of birds, the appearance of grains of seed, feathers, and the 
entrails of animals, by which means they confidently predicted both public 
and private events.

Nahua Government
The limits of the Aztec Empire may be defined, if its tributary states are 
included, as extending over the territory comprised in the modern states of 
Mexico, Southern Vera Cruz, and Guerrero. Among the civilised peoples of 
this extensive tract the prevailing form of government was an absolute 
monarchy, although several of the smaller communities were republics. The 
law of succession, as with the Celts of Scotland, prescribed that the eldest 
surviving brother of the deceased monarch should be elected to his throne, 
and, failing him, the eldest nephew. But incompetent persons were almost 
invariably ignored by the elective body, although the choice was limited to 
one family. The ruler was generally selected both because of his military 
prowess and his ecclesiastical and political knowledge. Indeed, a Mexican 
monarch was nearly always a man of the highest culture and artistic 
refinement, and the ill-fated Montezuma was an example of the true type of 
Nahua sovereign. The council of the monarch was composed of the electors and 
other personages of importance in the realm. It undertook the government of 
the provinces, the financial affairs of the country, and other matters of 
national import. The nobility held all the highest military, judicial, and 
ecclesiastical offices. To each city and province judges were delegated who 
exercised criminal and civil jurisdiction, and whose opinion superseded even 
that of the Crown itself. Petty cases were settled by lesser officials, and 
a still inferior grade of officers acted as a species of police in the 
supervision of families.

Domestic Life
The domestic life of the Nahua was a peculiar admixture of simplicity and 
display. The mass of the people led a life of strenuous labour in the 
fields, and in the cities they wrought hard at many trades, among which may 
be specified building, metal-working, making robes and other articles of 
bright featherwork and quilted suits of armour, Jewellery, and small wares. 
Vendors of flowers, fruit, fish, and vegetables swarmed in the markets. The 
use of tobacco was general among the men of all classes. At banquets the 
women attended, although they were seated at separate tables. The 
entertainments of the upper class were marked by much magnificence, and the 
variety of dishes was considerable, including venison, turkey, many smaller 
birds, fish, a profusion of vegetables, and pastry, accompanied by sauces of 
delicate flavour. These were served in dishes of gold and silver. Pulque, a 
fermented drink dishes brewed from the agave, was the universal beverage. 
Cannibalism was indulged in usually on ceremonial occasions, and was 
surrounded by such refinements of the table as served only to render it the 
more repulsive in the eyes of Europeans. It has been stated that this 
revolting practice was engaged in owing solely to the tenets of the Nahua 
religion, which enjoined the slaughter of slaves or captives in the name of 
a deity, and their consumption with the idea that the consumers attained 
unity with that deity in the flesh. But there is good reason to suspect that 
the Nahua, deprived of the flesh of the larger domestic animals, practised 
deliberate cannibalism. It would appear that the older race which preceded 
them in the country were innocent of these horrible repasts.

A Mysterious Toltec Book
A piece of Nahua literature, the disappearance of which is surrounded by 
circumstances of the deepest mystery, is the Teo-Amoxtli (Divine Book), 
which is alleged by certain chroniclers to have been the work of the ancient 
Toltecs. Ixtlilxochitl, a native Mexican author, states that it was written 
by a Tezcucan wiseman, one Huematzin about the end of the seventh century, 
and that it described the pilgrimage of the Nahua from Asia, their laws, 
manners, and customs, and their religious tenets, science, and arts. In 1838 
the Baron de Waldeck stated in his Voyage Pittoresque that he bad it in his 
possession, and the Abbé Brasseur de Bourbourg identified it with.the Maya 
Dresden Codex and other native manuscripts Bustamante also states that the 
amamatini (chroniclers) of Tezcuco had a copy in their possession at the 
time of the taking of their city. But these appear to be mere surmises, and 
if the Teo-Amoxtli ever existed, which on the whole is not unlikely, it has 
probably never been seen by a European.

A Native Historian
One of the most interesting of the Mexican historians is Don Fernando de 
Alva Ixtlilxochitl., a halfbreed of royal Tezcucan descent. He was 
responsible for two notable works, entitled Historia Chichimeca (The History 
of the Chichimecs) and the Relaciones, a compilation of historical and semi-
historical incidents. He was cursed, or blessed, however, by a strong 
leaning toward the marvellous, and has coloured his narratives so highly 
that he would have us regard the Toltec or ancient Nahua civilisations as by 
far the most splendid and magnificent that ever existed. His descriptions of 
Tezcuco, if picturesque in the extreme, are manifestly the outpourings of a 
romantic and idealistic mind, which in its patriotic enthusiasm desired to 
vindicate the country of his birth from the stigma of savagery and to prove 
its equality with the great nations of antiquity. For this we have not the 
heart to quarrel with him. But we must be on our guard against accepting any 
of his statements unless we find strong corroboration of it in the pages of 
a more trustworthy and less biased author.

Nahua Topography
The geography of Mexico is by no means as familiar to Europeans as is that 
of the various countries of our own continent, and it is extremely easy for 
the reader who is unacquainted with Mexico and the puzzling orthography of 
its place-names to flounder among them, and during the perusal of such a 
volume as this to find himself in a hopeless maze of surmise as to the exact 
locality of the more famous centres of Mexican history. A few moments' study 
of this paragraph will enlighten him in this respect, and will save him much 
confusion further on. He will see from. the map (p. 330) that the city of 
Mexico, or Tenochtitlan, its native name, was situated upon an island in the 
Lake of Tezcuco. This lake has now partially dried up, and the modern city 
of Mexico is situated at a considerable distance from it. Tezcuco, the city 
second in importance, lies to the north-east of the lake, and is somewhat 
more isolated, the other pueblos (towns) clustering round the southern or 
western shores. To the north of Tezcuco is Teotihuacan, the sacred city of 
the gods. To the south-east of Mexico is Tlaxcallan, or Tlascala, the city 
which assisted Cortés against the Mexicans, and the inhabitants of which 
were the deadliest foes of the central Nahua power. To the north lie the 
sacred city of Cholula and Tula, or Tollan.

Distribution of the Nahua Tribes
Having become acquainted with the relative position of the Nahua cities, we 
may now consult for a moment the map which exhibits the geographical 
distribution of the various Nahua tribes, and which is self-explanatory (p. 
331).

Nahua History
A brief historical sketch or epitome of what is known of Nahua history as 
apart from mere tradition will further assist the reader in the 
comprehension of Mexican mythology. From the period of the settlement of the 
Nahua on an agricultural basis a system of feudal government had evolved, 
and at various epochs in the history of the country certain cities or groups 
of cities held a paramount sway. Subsequent to the "Toltec" period, which we 
have already described and discussed, we find the Acolhuans in supreme 
power, and ruling from their cities of Tollantzinco and Cholula a 
considerable tract of country. Later Cholula maintained an alliance with 
Tlascala and Huexotzinco.

Bloodless Battles
The maxim "Other climes, other manners" is nowhere better exemplified than 
by the curious annual strife betwixt the warriors of Mexico and Tlascala. 
Once a year they met on a prearranged battle-ground and engaged in combat, 
not with the intention of killing one another, but with the object of taking 
prisoners for sacrifice on the altars of their respective war-gods. The 
warrior seized his opponent and attempted to bear him off, the various 
groups pulling and tugging desperately at each other in the endeavour to 
seize the limbs of the unfortunate who had been first struck down, with the 
object of dragging him into durance or effecting his rescue. Once secured, 
theTlascaltec warrior was brought to Mexico in a cage, and first placed upon 
a stone slab, to which one of his feet was secured by a chain or thong. He 
was then given light weapons, more like playthings than warrior's gear, and 
confronted by one of the most celebrated Mexican warriors. Should he succeed 
in defeating six of these formidable antagonists, he was set free. But no 
sooner was he wounded than he was hurried to the altar of sacrifice, and his 
heart was torn out and offered to Huitzilopochtli, the implacable god of 
war.

The Tlascaltecs, having finally secured their position by a defeat of the 
Tecpanecs of Huexotzinco about A.D. 1384, sank into comparative obscurity 
save for their annual bout with the Mexicans.

The Lake Cities
The communities grouped round the various lakes in the valley of Mexico now 
command our attention. More than two score of these thriving communities 
flourished at the time of the conquest of Mexico, the most notable being 
those which occupied the borders of the Lake of Tezcuco. These cities 
grouped themselves round two nuclei, Azcapozalco and Tezcuco, between whom a 
fierce rivalry sprang up, which finally ended in the entire discomfiture ol 
Azcapozalco. From this event the real history of Mexico may be said to 
commence. Those cities which had allied themselves to Tezcuco finally 
overran the entire territory of Mexico from the Mexican Gulf to the Pacific.

Tezcuco
If, as some authorities declare, Tezcuco was originally Otomi in affinity, 
it was in later years the most typically Nahuan of all the lacustrine 
powers. But several other communities, the power of which was very nearly as 
great as that of Tezcuco, had assisted that city to supremacy. Among these 
was Xaltocan, a city-state of unquestionable Otomi origin, situated at the 
northern extremity of the lake. As we have seen from the statements of 
Ixtlilxochitl, a Tezcucan writer, his native city was in the forefront of 
Nahua civilisation at the time of the coming of the Spaniards, and if it was 
practically subservient to Mexico (Tenochtitlan) at that period it was by no 
means its inferior in the arts.

The Tecpanecs
The Tecpanecs, who dwelt in Tlacopan, Coyohuacan, and Huitzilopocho, were 
also typical Nahua. The name, as we have already explained, indicates that 
each settlement possessed its own tecpan (chief's house), and has no racial 
significance. Their state was probably founded about the twelfth century, 
although a chronology of no less than fifteen hundred years was claimed for 
it. This people composed a sort of buffer-state betwixt the Otomi on the 
north and other Nahua on the south.

The Aztecs
The menace of these northern Otomi had become acute when the Tecpanecs 
received reinforcements in the shape of the Aztecâ, or Aztecs, a people of 
Nahua blood., who came, according to their own accounts, from Aztlan (Crane 
Land). The name Aztecâ signifies "Crane People," and this has led to the 
assumption that they came from Chihuahua, where cranes abound. Doubts have 
been cast upon the Nahua origin of the Aztecâ. But these are by no means 
well founded, as the names of the early Aztec chieftains and kings are 
unquestionably Nahuan. This people on their arrival in Mexico were in a very 
inferior state of culture, and were probably little better than savages. We 
have already outlined some of the legends concerning the coming of the 
Aztecs to the land of Anahuac, or the valley of Mexico, but their true 
origin is uncertain, and it is likely that they wandered down from the north 
as other Nahua immigrants did before them, and as the Apache Indians still 
do to this day. By their own showing they had sojourned at several points en 
route, and were reduced to slavery by the chiefs of Colhuacan. They proved 
so truculent in their bondage, however, that they were released, and 
journeyed to Chapoultepec, which they quitted because of their dissensions 
with the Xaltocanecs. On their arrival in the district inhabited by the 
Tecpanecs a tribute was levied upon them, but nevertheless they flourished 
so exceedingly that the swamp villages which the Tecpanecs had permitted 
them to raise on the borders of the lake soon grew into thriving 
communities, and chiefs were provided for them from among the nobility of 
the Tecpanecs.

The Aztecs as Allies
By the aid of the Aztecs the Tecpanecs greatly extended their territorial 
possessions. City after city was added to their empire, and the allies 
finally invaded the Otomi country, which they speedily subdued. Those cities 
which had been founded by the Acolhuans on the fringes of Tezcuco also 
allied themselves with the Tecpanecs with the intention of freeing 
themselves from the yoke of the Chichimecs, whose hand was heavy upon them. 
The Chichimecs or Tezcucans made a stern resistance, and for a time the 
sovereignty of the Tecpanecs hung in the balance. But eventually they 
conquered, and Tezcuco was overthrown and given as a spoil to the Aztecs.

New Powers
Up to this time the Aztecs had paid a tribute to Azcapozalco, but now, 
strengthened by the successes of the late conflict, they withheld it, and 
requested permission to build an aqueduct from the shore for the purpose of 
carrying a supply of water into their city. This was refused by the 
Tecpanecs, and a policy ol isolation was brought to bear upon Mexico an 
embargo being placed upon its goods and intercourse with its people being 
forbidden. War followed, in which the Tecpanecs were defeated with great 
slaughter. After this event, which may be placed about the year 1428, the 
Aztecs gained round rapidly, and their march to the supremacy of the entire 
Mexican valley was almost undisputed. Allying themselves with Tezcuco and 
Tlacopan, the Mexicans overran many states far beyond the confines of the 
valley, and by the time of Montezuma I had extended their boundaries almost 
to the limits of the present republic. The Mexican merchant followed in the 
footsteps of the Mexican warrior, and the commercial expansion of the Aztecs 
rivalled their military fame. Clever traders, they were merciless in their 
exactions of tribute from the states they conquered, manufacturing the raw 
material paid to them by the subject cities into goods which they afterwards 
sold again to the tribes under their sway. Mexico became the chief market of 
the empire, as well as its political nucleus. Such was the condition of 
affairs when the Spaniards arrived in Anahuac. Their coming has been 
deplored by certain historians as hastening the destruction of a Western 
Eden. But bad as was their rule, it was probably mild when compared with the 
cruel and insatiable sway of the Aztecs over their unhappy dependents.

The Spaniards found a tyrannical despotism in the conquered provinces, and a 
faith the accessories of which were so fiendish that it cast a gloom over 
the entire national life. These they replaced by a milder vassalage and the 
earnest ministrations of a more enlightened priesthood.


CHAPTER II: MEXICAN MYTHOLOGY
Nahua Religion
THE religion of the ancient Mexicans was a polytheism or worship of a 
pantheon of deities, the general aspect of which presented similarities to 
the systems of Greece and Egypt. Original influences, however, were strong, 
and they are especially discernible in the institutions of ritualistic 
cannibalism and human sacrifice. Strange resemblances to Christian practice 
were observed in the Aztec mythology by the Spanish Conquistadores, who 
piously condemned the native customs of baptism, consubstantiation, and 
confession as frauds founded and perpetuated by diabolic agency.

A superficial examination of the Nahua religion might lead to the inference 
that within its scope and system no definite theological views were embraced 
and no ethical principles propounded, and that the entire mythology presents 
only the fantastic attitude of the barbarian mind toward the eternal 
verities. Such a conclusion would be both erroneous and unjust to a human 
intelligence of a type by no means debased. As a matter of fact, the Nahua 
displayed a theological advancement greatly superior to that of the Greeks 
or Romans, and quite on a level with that expressed by the Egyptians and 
Assyrians. Toward the period or the Spanish occupation the Mexican 
priesthood was undoubtedly advancing to the contemplation of the exaltation 
of one god, whose worship was fast excluding that of similar deities, and if 
our data are too imperfect to allow us to speak very fully in regard to this 
phase of religious advancement, we know at least that much of the Nahua 
ritual and many of the prayers preserved by the labours of the Spanish 
fathers are unquestionably genuine, and display the attainment of a high 
religious level.

Cosmology
Aztec theology postulated an eternity which, however, was not without its 
epochs. It was thought to be broken up into a number of aeons, each of which 
depended upon the period of duration of a separate "sun." No agreement is 
noticeable among authorities on Mexican mythology as to the number of these 
"suns," but it would appear as probable that the favourite tradition 
stipulated for four "suns " or epochs, each of which concluded with a 
national disaster-flood, famine, tempest, or fire. The present veon, they 
feared, might conclude upon the completion of every " sheaf " of fifty-two 
years, the " sheaf " being a merely arbitrary portion of an veon. The period 
of time from the first creation to the current aeon was variously computed 
as 15,228, 2386, or 1404 solar years, the discrepancy and doubt arising 
because of the equivocal nature of the numeral signs expressing the period 
in the pinturas or native paintings. As regards the sequence of "suns" there 
is no more agreement than there is regarding their number. The Codex 
Vaticanus states it to have been water, wind, fire, and famine. Humboldt 
gives it as hunger, fire, wind, and water; Boturini as water, famine, wind, 
and fire; and Gama as hunger, wind, fire, and water.

In all likelihood the adoption of tour ages arose from the sacred nature of 
that number. The myth doubtless shaped itself upon the tonalamatl (Mexican 
native calendar), the great repository of the wisdom of the Nahua race, 
which the priestly class regarded as its vade mecum, and which was closely 
consulted by it on every occasion. civil or religious.

The Sources of Mexican Mythology
Our knowledge of the mythology of the Mexicans is chiefly gained through the 
works of those Spaniards, lay and cleric, who entered the country along with 
or immediately subsequent to the Spanish Conquistadores. From several of 
these we have what might be called first-hand accounts of the theogony and 
ritual of the Nahua people. The most valuable compendium is that of Father 
Bernardino Sahagun, entitled A General History of the Afairs of New Spain, 
which was published from manuscript only in the middle of last century, 
though written in the first half of the sixteenth century. Sahagun arrived 
in Mexico eight years after the country had been reduced by the Spaniards to 
a condition of servitude. He obtained a thorough mastery of the Nahuatl 
tongue, and conceived a warm admiration for the native mind and a deep 
interest in the antiquities of the conquered people. His method of 
collecting facts concerning their mythology and history was as effective as 
it was ingenious. He held daily conferences with reliable Indians, and 
placed questions before them, to which they replied by symbolical paintings 
detailing the answers which he required. These he submitted to scholars who 
had been trained under his own supervision, and who, after consultation 
among), themselves, rendered him a criticism in Nahuatl of the 
hieroglyphical paintings he had placed at their disposal. Not content with 
this process, he subjected these replies to the criticism of a third body, 
after which the matter was included in his work. But ecclesiastical 
intolerance was destined to keep the work from publication for a couple of 
centuries. Afraid that such a volume would be successful in keeping alight 
the fires of paganism in Mexico, Sahagun's brethren refused him the 
assistance he required for its publication. But on his appealing to the 
Council of the Indies in Spain he was met with encouragement, and was 
ordered to translate his great work into Spanish, a task he undertook when 
over eighty years of age. He transmitted the work to Spain, and for three 
hundred years nothing more was heard of it.

The Romance of the Lost "Sahagun"
For generations antiquarians interested in the lore or ancient Mexico 
bemoaned its loss, until at length one Mufloz, more indefatigable than the 
rest, chanced to visit the crumbling library of the ancient convent of 
Tolosi, in Navarre. There, among time-worn manuscripts and tomes relating to 
the early fathers and the intricacies of canon law, he discovered the lost 
Sahagun! It was printed separately by Bustamante at Mexico and by Lord 
Kingsborough in his collection in 1830, and has been translated into French 
by M. Jourdanet. Thus the manuscript commenced in or after 1530 was given to 
the public after a lapse of no less than three hundred years!

Torquemada
Father Torquemada arrived in the New World about the middle of the sixteenth 
century, at which period he was still enabled to take from the lips of such 
of the Conquistadores as remained much curious information regarding the 
circumstances of their advent. His Monarchia Indiana was first published at 
Seville in 1615, and in it he made much use of the manuscript of Sahagun, 
not then published. At the same time his observations upon matters 
pertaining to the native religion are often illuminating and exhaustive.

In his Storia Antica del Messico the Abbé Clavigero, who published his work 
in 1780, did much to disperse the clouds of tradition which hung over 
Mexican history and mythology. The clarity of his style and the exactness of 
his information render his work exceedingly useful.

Antonio Gama, in his Descripcion Historica y Cronologica de las dos Piedras, 
poured a flood of light on Mexican antiquities. His work was published in 
1832. With him maybe said to have ceased the line of Mexican archxologists 
of the older school. Others worthy of being mentioned among the older 
writers on Mexican mythology (we are not here concerned with history) are 
Boturini, who, in his Idea de una Nueva Historia General de la America 
Septentrional, gives a vivid picture of native life and tradition, culled 
from first-hand communication with the people; Ixdilxochitl, a half-breed, 
whose mendacious works, the Relaciones and Historia Chichimeca., are yet 
valuable repositories of tradition; José de Acosta, whose Historia Natural y 
Moral de las Yndias was published at Seville in 1580; and Gomara, who, in 
his Historia General de las Indias (Madrid, 1749), rested upon the authority 
of the Conquistadores. Tezozomoc's Chronica Mexicana, reproduced in Lord 
Kingsborough's great work, is valuable as giving unique facts regarding the 
Aztec mythology, as is the Teatro Mexicana of Vetancurt, published at Mexico 
in 1697-98.

The Worship of One God
The ritual of this dead faith of another hemisphere abounds in expressions 
concerning the unity of the deity approaching very nearly to many of those 
we ourselves employ regarding God's attributes. The various classes of the 
priesthood were in the habit of addressing the several gods to whom they 
ministered as "omnipotent," "endless," "invisible," "the one god complete in 
perfection and unity," and "the Maker and Moulder of All." These 
appellations they applied not to one supreme being, but to the individual 
deities to whose service they were attached. It may be thought that such a 
practice would be fatal to the evolution of a single and universal god. But 
there is every reason to believe that Tezcatlipoca, the great god of the 
air, like the Hebrew Jahveh, also an air-god, was fast gaining precedence of 
all other deities, when the coming of the white man put in end to his 
chances of sovereignty.

Tezcatlipoca
Tezcatlipoca (Fiery Mirror) was undoubtedly the Jupiter of the Nahua 
pantheon. He carried a mirror or shield, from which he took his name, and in 
which he was supposed to see reflected the actions and deeds of mankind. The 
evolution of this god from the status of a spirit of wind or air to that of 
the supreme deity of the Aztec people presents many points of deep interest 
to students of mythology. Originally the personification of the air, the 
source both of the breath of life and of the tempest, Tezcatlipoca possessed 
all the attributes of a god who presided over these phenomena. As the tribal 
god of the Tezcucans who had led them into the Land of Promise, and had been 
instrumental in the defeat of both the gods and men of the elder race they 
dispossessed, Tezcatlipoca naturally advanced so speedily in popularity and 
public honour that it was little wonder that within a comparatively short 
space of time he came to be regarded as a god of fate and fortune, and as 
inseparably connected with the national destinies. Thus, from being the 
peculiar deity of a small band of Nahua immigrants, the prestige accruing 
from the rapid conquest made under his tutelary direction and the speedily 
disseminated tales of the prowess of those who worshipped him seemed to 
render him at once the most popular and the best feared god in Anahuac, 
therefore the one whose cult quickly overshadowed that of other and similar 
gods.

Tezcatlipoca, Overthrower of the Toltecs
We find Tezcatlipoca intimately associated with the legends which recount 
the overthrow of Tollan, the capital of the Toltecs. His chief adversary on 
the Toltec side is the god-king Quetzalcoatl, whose nature and reign we will 
consider later, but whom we will now merely regard as the enemy of 
Tezcatlipoca. The rivalry between these gods symbolises that which existed 
between the civilised Toltecs and the barbarian Nahua, and is well 
exemplified in the following myths.

Myths of Quetzalcoatl and Tezcatlipoca
In the days of Quetzalcoatl there was abundance of everything necessary for 
subsistence. The maize was plentiful, the calabashes were as thick as one's 
arm, and cotton grew in all colours without having to be dyed. A variety of 
birds of rich plumage filled the air with their songs, and gold, silver, and 
precious stones were abundant. In the reign of Quetzalcoad there was peace 
and plenty for all men.

But this blissful state was too fortunate, too happy to endure. Envious of 
the calm enjoyment of the god and his people the Toltecs, three wicked 
"necromancers" plotted their downfall. The reference is of course to the 
gods of the invading Nahua tribes, the deities Huitzilopochtli, Titlacahuan 
or Tezcatlipoca, and Tlacahuepan. These laid evil enchantments upon the city 
of Tollan, and Tezcatlipoca in particular took the lead in these envious 
conspiracies. Disguised as an aged man with white hair, he presented himself 
at the palace of Quetzalcoatl, where he said to the pages. in-waiting: "Pray 
present me to your master the king I desire to speak with him."

The pages advised him to retire, as Quetzalcoatl was indisposed and could 
see no one. He requested them, however, to tell the god that he was waiting 
outside. They did so, and procured his admittance.

On entering the chamber of Quetzalcoad the wily Tezcatlipoca simulated much 
sympathy with the suffering god-king. "How are you, my son?" he asked. "I 
have brought you a drug which you should drink, and which will put an end to 
the course of your malady."

"You are welcome, old man," replied Quetzalcoad.

I have known for many days that you would come. I am exceedingly indisposed. 
The malady affects my entire system, and I can use neither my hands nor 
feet."

Tezcatlipoca assured him that if he partook of the medicine which he had 
brought him he would immediately experience a great improvement in health. 
Quetzalcoatl drank the potion, and at once felt much revived. The cunning 
Tezcatlipoca pressed another and still another cup of the potion upon him, 
and as it was nothing but pulque, the wine of the country, he speedily 
became intoxicated, and was as wax in the hands of his adversary.

Tezcatlipoca and the Toltecs
Tezcatlipoca, in pursuance of his policy inimical to the Toltec state, took 
the form of an Indian of the name of Toueyo (Toveyo), and bent his steps to 
the palace of Uemac, chief of the Toltecs in temporal matters. This worthy 
had a daughter so fair that she was desired in marriage by many of the 
Toltecs, but all to no purpose, as her father refused her hand to one and 
alL The princess, beholding the false Toueyo passing her father's palace, 
fell deeply in love with him, and so tumultuous was her passion that she 
became seriously ill because of her longing for him. Uemac, hearing of her 
indisposition, bent his steps to her apartments, and inquired of her women 
the cause of her illness. They told him that it was occasioned by the sudden 
passion which had seized her for the Indian who had recently come that way. 
Uemac at once gave orders for the arrest of Toueyo, and he was haled before 
the temporal chief of Tollan.

"Whence come you?" inquired Uemac of his prisoner, who was very scantily 
attired.

"Lord, I am a stranger, and I have come to these parts to sell green paint," 
replied Tezcatlipoca.

"Why are you dressed in this fashion? Why do you not wear a cloak?" asked 
the chief.

"My lord, I follow the custom of my country," replied Tezcatlipoca.

"You have inspired a passion in the breast of my daughter," said Uemac. 
"What should be done to you for thus disgracing me?"

"Slay me; I care not," said the cunning Tezcatlipoca.

"Nay," replied Uemac, "for if I slay you my daughter will perish. Go to her 
and say that she may wed you and be happy."

Now the marriage of Toueyo, to the daughter of Uemac aroused much discontent 
among the Toltecs; and they murmured among themselves, and said: "Wherefore 
did Uemac give his daughter to this Toueyo?" Uemac, having got wind of these 
murmurings, resolved to distract the attention of the Toltecs by makina war 
upon the neiahbouringa state of Coatepec.

The Toltecs assembled armed for the fray, and having arrived at the country 
of the men of Coatepec they placed Toueyo in ambush with his body-servants, 
hoping that he would be slain by their adversaries. But Toueyo and his men 
killed a large number of the enemy and put them to flight. His triumph was 
celebrated by Uemac with much pomp. The knightly plumes were placed upon his 
head, and his body was painted with red and yellow-an honour reserved for 
those who distinguished themselves in battle.

Tezcatlipoca's next step was to announce a great feast in Tollan, to which 
all the people for miles around were invited. Great crowds assembled, and 
danced and sang in the city to the sound of the drum. Tezcatlipoca sang to 
them and forced them to accompany the rhythm of his song with their feet. 
Faster and faster the people danced, until the pace became so furious that 
they were driven to madness, lost their footing, and tumbled pell-mell down 
a deep ravine, where they were changed into rocks. Others in attempting to 
cross a stone bridge precipitated themselves into the water below, and were 
changed into stones.

On another occasion Tezcatlipoca presented himself as a valiant warrior 
named Tequiua, and invited all the inhabitants of Tollan and its environs to 
come to the flower-garden called Xochitla. When assembled there he attacked 
them with a hoe, and slew a great number, and others in panic crushed their 
comrades to death.

Tezcatlipoca and Tlacahuepan on another occasion repaired to the market-
place of Tollan, the former displaying upon the palm of his hand a small 
infant whom he caused to dance and to cut the most amusing capers. This 
infant was in reality Huitzilopochdi, the Nahua god of war. At this sight 
the Toltecs crowded upon one another for the purpose of getting a better 
view, and their eagerness resulted in many being crushed to death. So 
enraged were the Toltecs at this that upon the advice of Tlacahuepan they 
slew both Tezcatlipoca and Huitzilopochtli. When this had been done the 
bodies of the slain gods gave forth such a pernicious effluvia that 
thousands the Toltecs died of the pestilence. The god Tlacahuepan then 
advised them to cast out the bodies lest worse befell them., but on their 
attempting to do so they discovered their weight to be so great that they 
could not move them. Hundreds wound cords round the corpses, but the strands 
broke, and those who pulled upon them fell and died suddenly, tumbling one 
upon the other, and suffocating those upon whom they collapsed.

The Departure of Quetzalcoatl
The Toltecs were so tormented by the enchantments of Tezcatlipoca that it 
was soon apparent to them that their fortunes were on the wane and that the 
end of their empire was at hand. Quetzalcoatl, chagrined at the turn things 
had taken, resolved to quit Tollan and go to the country of Tlapallan, 
whence he had come on his civilising mission to Mexico. He burned all the 
houses which he had built, and buried his treasure of gold and precious 
stones in the deep valleys between the mountains. He changed the cacao-trees 
into mezquites, and he ordered all the birds of rich plumage and song to 
quit the valley of Anahuac and to follow him to a distance of more than a 
hundred leagues. On the road from Tollan he discovered a great tree at a 
point called Quauhtitlan. There he rested, and requested his pages to hand 
him a mirror. Regarding himself in the polished surface, he exclaimed, "I am 
old," and from that circumstance the spot was named Huehuequauhtitlan (Old 
Quauhtitlan). Proceeding on his way accompanied by musicians who played the 
flute, he walked until fatigue arrested his steps, and he seated himself 
upon a stone, on which he left the imprint of his hands. This place is 
called Temacpalco (The Impress of the Hands). At Coaapan he was met by the 
Nahua gods, who were inimical to him and to the Toltecs.

"Where do you go? they asked him. "Why do you leave your capital?

"I go to Tlapallan," replied Quetzalcoatl, "whence I came."

"For what reason?" persisted the enchanters.

My father the Sun has called me thence," replied Quetzalcoatl.

"Go, then, happily," they said, "but leave us the secret of your art, the 
secret of founding in silver, of working in precious stones and woods, of 
painting, and of feather-working, and other matters."

But Quetzalcoatl refused, and cast all his treasures into the fountain of 
Cozcaapa (Water of Precious Stones). At Cochtan he was met by another 
enchanter, who asked him whither he was bound, and on learning his 
destination proffered him a draught of wine. On tasting the vintage 
Quetzalcoatl was overcome with sleep. Continuing his journey in the morning, 
the god passed between a volcano and the Sierra Nevada (Mountain of Snow), 
where all the pages who accompanied him died of cold. He regretted this 
misfortune exceedingly, and wept, lamenting their fate with most bitter 
tears and mournful songs. On reaching the summit of Mount Poyauhtecatl he 
slid to the base. Arriving at the sea-shore, he embarked upon a raft of 
serpents, and was wafted away toward the land of Tlapallan.

It is obvious that these legends bear some resemblance to those of 
Ixtlilxochitl which recount the fall of the Toltecs. They are taken from 
Sahagun's work, Historya General de Nueva España, and are included as well 
for the sake of comparison as for their own intrinsic value.

Tezcatlipoca as Doomster
Tezcatlipoca was much more than a mere personification of wind, and if he 
was regarded as a life-giver he had also the power of destroying existence. 
In fact on occasion he appears as an inexorable death-dealer, and as such 
was styled Nezahualpilli (The Hungry Chief) and Yaotzin (The Enemy). Perhaps 
one of the names by which he was best known was Telpochtli (The Youthful 
Warrior), from the fact that his reserve of' strength, his vital force, 
never diminished, and that his youthful and boisterous vigour was apparent 
in the tempest.

Tezcatlipoca was usually depicted as holding in his right hand a dart placed 
in an atlatl (spear-thrower), and his mirror-shield with four spare darts in 
his left. This shield is the symbol of his power as judge of mankind and 
upholder of human justice.

The Aztecs pictured Tezcatlipoca as rioting along the highways in search of 
persons on whom to wreak his vengeance, as the wind of night rushes along 
the deserted roads with more seemingviolence than it does by day. Indeed one 
of his names, Yoalli Ehecatl, signifies "Night Wind." Benches of stone, 
shaped like those made for the dignitaries of the Mexican towns, were 
distributed along the highways for his especial use, that on these he might 
rest after his boisterous journeyings. These seats were concealed by green 
boughs, beneath which the god was supposed to lurk in wait for his victims. 
But if one of the persons he seized overcame him in the struggle he might 
ask whatever boon he desired, secure in the promise of the deity that it 
should be granted forthwith.

It was supposed that Tezcatlipoca had guided the Nahua, and especially the 
people of Tezcuco, from a more northerly clime to the valley of Mexico. But 
he was not a mere local deity of Tezcuco, his worship being widely 
celebrated throughout the country. His exalted position in the Mexican 
pantheon seems to have won for him especial reverence as a god of fate and 
fortune. The place he took as the head of the Nahua pantheon brought him 
many attributes which were quite foreign to his original character. Fear and 
a desire to exalt their tutelar deity will impel the devotees of a powerful 
god to credit him with any or every quality, so that there is nothing 
remarkable in the spectacle of the heaping of every possible attribute, 
human or divine, upon Tezcatlipoca when we recall the supreme position he 
occupied in Mexican mythology. His priestly caste far surpassed in power and 
in the breadth and activity of its propaganda the priesthoods of the other 
Mexican deities. To it is credited the invention of many of the usages of 
civilisation, and that it all but succeeded in making his worship universal 
is pretty clear, as has been shown. The other gods were worshipped for some 
special purpose, but the worship of Tezcatlipoca was regarded as compulsory, 
and to some extent as a safeguard against the destruction of the universe, a 
calamity the Nahua had been led tn believe might occur through his agency. 
He was known as Moneneque (The Claimer of Prayer), and in some of the 
representations of him an ear of gold was shown suspended from his hair, 
toward which small tongues of gold strained upward in appeal of prayer. In 
times of national danger, plague, or famine universal prayer was made to 
Tezcatlipoca. The heads of the community repaired to his teocalli (temple) 
accompanied by the people en masse, and all prayed earnestly together for 
his speedy intervention. The prayers to Tezcatlipoca still extant prove that 
the ancient Mexicans fully believed that he possessed the power of life and 
death, and many of them are couched in the most piteous terms.

The Teotleco Festival
The supreme position occupied by Tezcatlipoca in the Mexican religion is 
well exemplified in the festival of the Teotleco (Coming of the Gods), which 
is fully described in Sahagun's account of the Mexican festivals. Another 
peculiarity connected with his worship was that he was one of the few 
Mexican deities who had any relation to the expiation of sin. Sin was 
symbolised by the Nahua as excrement, and in various manuscripts 
Tezcatlipoca is represented as a turkey-cock to which ordure is being 
offered up.

Of the festival of the Teotleco Sahagun says In the twelfth month a festival 
was celebrated in honour of all the gods, who were said to have gone to some 
country I know not where. On the last day of the month a greater one was 
held, because the gods had returned. On the fifteenth day of this month the 
young boys and the servitors decked all the altars or oratories of the gods 
with boughs, as well as those which were in the houses, and the images which 
were set up by the wayside and at the cross-roads. This work was paid for in 
maize. Some received a basketful, and others only a few ears. On the 
eighteenth day the ever-youthful god Tlamatzincatl or Titlacahuan arrived. 
It was said that he marched better and arrived the first because he was 
strong and young. Food was offered him in his temple on that night. Every 
one drank, ate, and made merry. The old people especially celebrated the 
arrival of the god by drinking wine, and it was alleged that his feet were 
washed by these rejoicings. The last day of the month was marked by a great 
festival, on account of the belief that the whole or the gods arrived at 
that time. On the preceding night a quantity of flour was kneaded on a 
carpet into the shape of a cheese, it being supposed that the gods would 
leave a footprint thereon as a sign of their return. The chief attendant 
watched all night, going to and fro to see if the impression appeared. When 
he at last saw it he called out, 'The master has arrived,' and at once the 
priests of the temple began to sound the horns, trumpets., and other musical 
instruments used by them. Upon hearing this noise every one set forth to 
offer food in all the temples." The next day the aged gods were supposed to 
arrive, and young men disguised as monsters hurled victims into a huge 
sacrificial fire.

The Toxcatl Festival
The most remarkable festival in connection with Tezcatlipoca was the 
Toxcatl, held in the fifth month. On the day of this festival a youth was 
slain who for an entire year previously had been carefully instructed in the 
rôle of victim. He was selected from among the best war captives of the 
year, and must be without spot or blemish. He assumed the name, garb, and 
attributes of Tezcatlipoca himself, and was regarded with awe by the entire 
populace, who imagined him to be the earthly representative of the deity. He 
rested during the day, and ventured forth at night only, armed with the dart 
and shield of the god, to scour the roads. This practice was, of course, 
symbolical of the wind-god's progress over the nightbound hiahwavs. He 
carried also the whistle symbolical of the deity, and made with it a noise 
such as the weird wind of night makes when it hurries through the streets. 
To his arms and legs small bells were attached. He was followed by a retinue 
of pages, and at intervals rested upon the stone seats which were placed 
upon the highways for the convenience of Tezcatlipoca. Later in the year he 
was mated to four beautiful maidens of high birth, with whom he passed the 
time in amusement of every description. He was entertained at the tables of 
the nobility as the earthly representative of Tezcatlipoca, and his latter 
days were one constant round of feasting and excitement. At last the fatal 
day upon which he must be sacrificed arrived. He took a tearful farewell of 
the maidens whom he had espoused, and was carried to the teocalli of 
sacrifice, upon the sides of which he broke the musical instruments with 
which he had beguiled the time of his captivity. When he reached the summit 
he was received by the high-priest, who speedily made him one with the god 
whom he represented by tearing his heart out on the stone of sacrifice.

Huitzilopochth, the War,God
Huitzilopochtli occupied in the Aztec pantheon a place similar to that of 
Mars in the Roman. His origin is obscure, but the myth relating to it is 
distinctly original in character. It recounts how, under the shadow of the 
mountain of Coatepec, near the Toltec city of Tollan, there dwelt a pious 
widow called Coatlicue, the mother of a tribe of Indians called 
Centzonuitznaua) who had a daughter called Coyolxauhqui, and who daily 
repaired to a small hill with the intention of offering up prayers to the 
gods in a penitent spirit of piety. Whilst occupied in her devotions one day 
she was surprised by a small ball of brilliantly coloured feathers falling 
upon her from on high. She was pleased by the bright variety of its hues, 
and placed it in her bosom, intending to offer it up to the sun-god. Some 
time afterwards she learnt that she was to become the mother of another 
child. Her sons, hearing of this, rained abuse upon her, being incited to 
humiliate her in every possible way by their sister Coyolxauhqui.

Coatlicue went about in fear and anxiety; but the spirit of her unborn 
infant came and spoke to her and gave her words of encouragement, soothing 
her troubled heart. Her sons, however, were resolved to wipe out what they 
considered an insult to their race by the death of their mother, and took 
counsel with one another to slay her. They attired themselves in their war-
gear, and arranged their hair after the manner of warriors going to battle. 
But one of their number, Quauitlicac, relented, and confessed the perfidy of 
his brothers to the still unborn Huitzilopochtli, who replied to him: "O 
brother, hearken attentively to what I have to say to you. I am fully 
informed of what is about to happen." With the intention of slaying their 
mother, the Indians went in search of her. At their head marched their 
sister, Coyolxauhqui. They were armed to the teeth, and carried bundles of 
darts with which theyintended to kill the luckless Coatlicue.

Quauitlicac climbed the mountain to acquaint Huitzilopochtli with the news 
that his brothers were approaching to kill their mother.

"Mark well where they are at," replied the infant god. "To what place have 
they advanced?"

"To Tzompantitlan," responded Quauitlicac.

Later on Huitzilopochtli asked: "Where may they be now?"

"At Coaxalco", was the reply.

Once more Huitzilopochtli asked to what point his enemies had advanced.

"They are now at Petlac," Quauitlicac replied.

After a little while Quauitlicac informed Huitzilopochtli that the 
Centzonuitznaua were at hand under the leadership of Coyolxauhqui. At the 
moment of the enemy's arrival Huitzilopochtli was born, flourishing a shield 
and spear of a blue colour. He was painted, his head was surmounted by a 
panache, and his left leg was covered with feathers. He shattered 
Coyolxauhqui with a flash of serpentine lightning, and then gave chase to 
the Centzonuitznaua, whom he pursued four times round the mountain. They did 
not attempt to defend themselves, but fled incontinently. Many perished in 
the waters of the adjoining lake, to which they had rushed in their despair. 
All were slain save a few who escaped to a place called Uitzlampa, where 
they surrendered to Huitzilopochtli and gave up their arms.

The name Huitzilopochtli signifies "Humming-bird to the left from the 
circumstance that the god wore the feathers of the humming-bird, or colibri, 
on his left leg. From this it has been inferred that he was a humming-bird 
totem. The explanation of Huitzilopochtli's origin is a little deeper than 
this, however. Among the American tribes, especially those of the northern 
continent, the serpent is regarded with the deepest veneration as the symbol 
of wisdom and magic. From these sources come success in war. The serpent 
also typifies the lightning, the symbol of the divine spear, the apotheosis 
of warlike might. Fragments of serpents are regarded as powerful war-physic 
among many tribes. Atatarho, a mythical wizard-king of the Iroquois, was 
clothed with living serpents as with a robe, and his myth throws light on 
one of the names of Huitzilopochtli's mother, Coatlantona (Robe of 
Serpents). Huitzilopochtli's image was surrounded by serpents, and rested on 
serpent-shaped supporters. His sceptre was a single snake, and his great 
drum was of serpent-skin.

In American mythology the serpent is closely associated with the bird. Thus 
the name of the god Quetzalcoatl is translatable as "Feathered Serpent," and 
many similar cases where the conception of bird and serpent have been 
unified could be adduced. Huitzilopochtli is undoubtedly one of these. We 
may regard him as a god the primary conception of whom arose from the idea 
of the serpent, the symbol of warlike wisdom and might, the symbol of the 
warrior's dart or spear, and the humming-bird, the harbinger of summer, type 
of the season when the snake or lightning god has power over the crops.

Huitzilopochtli was usually represented as wearing on his head a waving 
panache or plume of hummingbirds' feathers. His face and limbs were striped 
with bars of blue, and in his right hand he carried four spears. His left 
hand bore his shield, on the surface of which were displayed five tufts of 
down, arranged in the form of a quincunx. The shield was made with reeds, 
covered with eagle's down. The spear he brandished was also tipped with 
tufts of down instead of flint. These weapons were placed in the hands of 
those who as captives engaged in the sacrificial fight, for in the Aztec 
mind Hultzilopochtli symbolised the warrior's death on the gladiatorial 
stone of combat. As has been said, Huitzilopochtli was war-god of the 
Aztecs, and was supposed to have led them to the site of Mexico from their 
original home in the north. The city of Mexico took its name from one of its 
districts, which was designated by a title of Huitzilopochtli's, Mexitli 
(Hare of the Aloes).

The War,God as Fertiliser
But Huitzilopochtli was not a war-god alone. As the serpent-god of lightning 
he had a connection with summer, the season of lightning, and therefore had 
dominion to some extent over the crops and fruits of the earth. The 
Algonquian Indians of North America believed that the rattlesnake could 
raise ruinous storms or grant favourable breezes. They alluded to it also as 
the symbol of life, for the serpent has a phallic significance because of 
its similarity to the symbol of generation and fructification. With some 
American tribes also, notably the Pueblo Indians of Arizona, the serpent has 
a solar significance, and with tail in mouth symbolises the annual round of 
the sun. The Nahua believed that Huitzilopochtli could grant them fair 
weather for the fructification of their crops, and they placed an image of 
Tlaloc, the rain-god, near him, so that, if necessary, the war-god could 
compel the rainmaker to exert his pluvial powers or to abstain from the 
creation of floods. We must, in considering the nature of this deity, bear 
well in mind the connection in the Nahua consciousness between the pantheon, 
war, and the food-supply. If war was not waged annually the gods must go 
without flesh food and perish, and if the gods succumbed the crops would 
fail, and famine would destroy the race. So it was small wonder that 
Huitzilopochtli was one of the chief gods of Mexico.

Huitzilopochtli's principal festival was the Toxcatl, celebrated immediately 
after the Toxcatl festival of Tezcatlipoca, to which it bore a strong 
resemblance. Festivals of the god were held in May and December, at the 
latter of which an imaze of him, moulded in dough kneaded with the blood of 
sacrificed children, was pierced by the presiding priest with an arrow-an 
act significant of the death of Huitzilopochtli until his resurrection in 
the next year.

Strangely enough, when the absolute supremacy of Tezcatlipoca is remembered, 
the high-priest of Huitzilopochtli, the Mexicatl Teohuatzin, was considered 
to be the religious head of the Mexican priesthood. The priests of 
Huitzilopochtli held office by right of descent, and their primate exacted 
absolute obedience from the priesthoods of all the other deities, being 
regarded as next to the monarch himself in power and dominion.

Tlaloc, the Rain,God
Tlaloc was the god of rain and moisture. In a country such as Mexico, where 
the success or failure of the crops depends entirely upon the plentiful 
nature or otherwise of the rainfall, he was, it will be readily granted, a 
deity of high importance. It was believed that he made his home in the 
mountains which surround the valley of Mexico, as these were the source of 
the local rainfall, and his popularity is vouched for by the fact that 
sculptured representations of him occur more often than those of any other 
of the Mexican deities. He is generally represented in a semi-recumbent 
attitude, with the upper part of the body raised upon the elbows, and the 
knees half drawn up, probably to represent the mountainous character of the 
country whence comes the rain. He was espoused to Chalchihuitlicue (Emerald 
Lady), who bore him a numerous progeny, the Tlalocs (Clouds). Many of the 
figures which represented him were carved from the green stone called 
chalchiuitl (jadeite), to typify the colour of water, and in some of these 
he was shown holding a a serpent of gold to typify the lightning, for water-
gods are often closely identified with the thunder, which hangs over the 
hills and accompanies heavy rains. Tlaloc, like his prototype, the Kiche god 
Hurakan, manifested himself in three forms, as the lightning-flash, the 
thunderbolt, and the thunder. Although his image faced the east, where he 
was supposed to have originated, he was worshipped as inhabiting the four 
cardinal points and every mountain-top. The colours of the four points of 
the compass, yellow, green, red, and blue, whence came the rain-bearing 
winds, entered into the composition of his costume, which was further 
crossed with streaks of silver, typifying the mountain torrents. A vase 
containing every description of grain was usually placed before his idol, an 
offering of the growth which it was hoped he would fructify. He dwelt in a 
many-watered paradise called Tlalocan (The Country of Tlaloc), a place of 
plenty and fruitfulness, where those who had been drowned or struck by 
lightning or had died from dropsical diseases enjoyed eternal bliss. Those 
of the common people who did not die such deaths went to the dark abode of 
Mictlan, the all-devouring and gloomy Lord of Death.

In the native manuscripts Tlaloc is usually portrayed as having a dark 
complexion, a large round eye, a row of tusks, and over the lips an angular 
blue stripe curved downward and rolled up at the ends. The latter character 
is supposed to have been evolved originally from the coils of two snakes, 
their mouths with long fangs in the upper jaw meeting in the middle of the 
upper lip. The snake, besides being symbolised by lightning in many American 
mythologies, is also symbolical of water, which is well typified in its 
sinuous movements.

Many maidens and children were annually sacrificed to Tlaloc. If the 
children wept it was regarded as a happy omen for a rainy season. The 
Etzalqualiztli (When they eat Bean Food) was his chief festival, and was 
held on a day approximating to May 13, about which date the rainy season 
usually commenced. Another festival in his honour, the Quauitleua, commenced 
the Mexican year on February 2. At the former festival the priests of Tlaloc 
plunged into a lake, imitating the sounds and movements of frogs, which, as 
denizens of water, were under the special protection of the god. 
Chalchihuitlicue, his wife, was often symbolised by the small image of a 
frog.

Sacrifices to Tlaloc
Human sacrifices also took place at certain points in the mountains where 
artificial ponds were consecrated to Tlaloc. Cemeteries were situated in 
their vicinity, and offerings to the god interred near the burial-place of 
the bodies of the victims slain in his service. His statue was placed on the 
highest mountain of Tezcuco, and an old writer mentions that five or six 
young children were annually offered to the god at various points, their 
hearts torn out, and their remains interred. The mountains Popocatepetl and 
Teocuinani were regarded as his special high places, and on the heights of 
the latter was built his temple, in which stood his image carved in green 
stone.

The Nahua believed that the constant production of food and rain induced a 
condition of senility in those deities whose duty it was to provide them. 
This they attempted to stave off, fearing that if they failed in so doing 
the gods would perish. They afforded them, accordingly, a period of rest and 
recuperation, and once in eight years a festival called the Atamalqualiztli 
(Fast of Porridge-balls and Water) was held, during which every one in the 
Nahua community returned for the time being to the conditions of savage 
life. Dressed in costumes representing all forms of animal and bird life, 
and mimicking the sounds made by the various creatures they typified, the 
people danced round the teocalli of Tlaloc for the purpose of diverting and 
entertaining him after his labours in producing the fertilising rains of the 
past eight years. A lake was filled with water-snakes and frogs, and into 
this the people plunged, catching the reptiles in their mouths and devouring 
them alive. The only grain food which might be partaken during this season 
of rest was thin water-porridge of maize.

Should one of the more prosperous peasants or yeomen deem a rainfall 
necessary to the growth of his crops, or should he fear a drought, he sought 
out one of the professional makers of dough or paste idols, whom he desired 
to mould one of Tlaloc. To this image offerings of maize-porridge and pulque 
were made. Throughout the night the farmer and his neighbours danced, 
shrieking and howling round the figure for the purpose of rousing Tlaloc 
from his droughtbringing slumbers. Next day was spent in quaffing huge 
libations of pulque, and in much-needed rest from the exertions of the 
previous night.

In Tlaloc it is easy to trace resemblances to a mythological conception 
widely prevalent among the indigenous American peoples. He is similar to 
such deities as the Hurakan of the Kiche of Guatemala, the Pillan of the 
aborigines of Chile, and Con, the thunder-god of the Collao of Peru. Only 
his thunderous powers are not so apparent as his rain-making abilities, and 
in this he differs somewhat from the gods alluded to.

Quetzalcoatl
It is highly probable that Quetzalcoatl was a deity of the pre-Nahua people 
of Mexico. He was regarded by the Aztec race as a god of somewhat alien 
character, and had but a limited following in Mexico, the city of 
Huitzilopochtli. In Cholula, however, and others of the older towns his 
worship flourished exceedingly. He was regarded as "The Father of the 
Toltecs," and, legend says, was the seventh and youngest son of the Toltec 
Abraham, Iztacmixcohuatl. Quetzalcoatl (whose name means "Feathered Serpent 
" or "Feathered Staff ") became, at a relatively early period, ruler of 
Tollan, and by his enlightened sway and his encouragement of the liberal 
arts did much to further the advancement of his people. His reign had lasted 
for a period sufficient to permit of his placing the cultivated arts upon a 
satisfactory basis when the country was visited by the cunning magicians 
Tezcatlipoca and Coyotlinaual, god of the Amantecas. Disentangled from its 
terms of myth, this statement may be taken to imply that bands of invading 
Nahua first began to appear within the Toltec territories. Tezcatlipoca, 
descending from the sky in the shape of a spider by way of a fine web, 
proffered him a draught of pulque, which so intoxicated him that the curse 
of lust descended upon him, and he forgot his chastity with Quetzalpetlatl. 
The doom pronounced upon him was the hard one of banishment, and he was 
compelled to forsake Anahuac. His exile wrought peculiar changes upon the 
face of the country. He secreted his treasures of gold and silver, burned 
his palaces, transformed the cacao-trees into mezquites, and banished all 
the birds from the neighbourhood of Tollan. The magicians, nonplussed at 
these unexpected happenings, begged him to return, but he refused on the 
ground that the sun required his presence. He proceeded to Tabasco, the 
fabled land of Tlapallan, and, embarking upon a raft made of serpents, 
floated away to the east. A slightly different version of this myth has 
already been given. Other accounts state that the king cast himself upon a 
funeral pyre and was consumed, and that the ashes arising from the 
conflagration flew upward and were changed into birds of brilliant plumage. 
His heart also soared into the sky, and became the morning star. The 
Mexicans averred that Quetzalcoatl died when the star became visible, and 
thus they bestowed upon him the title "Lord of the Dawn." They further said 
that when he died he was invisible for four days, and that for eight days he 
wandered in the underworld, after which time the morning star appeared, when 
he achieved resurrection, and ascended his throne as a god.

It is the contention of some authorities that the myth of Quetzalcoatl 
points to his status as god of the sun. That luminary, they say, begins his 
diurnal journey in the east, whence Quetzalcoatl returned as to his native 
home. It will be recalled that Montezuma and his subjects imagined that 
Cortés was no other than Quetzalcoatl, returned to his dominions, as an old 
prophecy declared he would do. But that he stood for the sun itself is 
highly improbable, as will be shown. First of all, however, it will be well 
to pay some attention to other theories concerning his origin.

Perhaps the most important of these is that which regards Quetzalcoatl as a 
god of the air. He is connected, say some, with the cardinal points, and 
wears the insignia of the cross, which symbolises them. Dr. Seler says of 
him: "He has a protruding, trumpet-like mouth, for the wind-god blows. . . . 
His figure suggests whirls and circles. Hence his temples were built in 
circular form. . . . The head of the wind-god stands for the second of the 
twenty day signs, which was called Ehecatl (Wind)." The same authority, 
however, in his essay on Mexican chronology, gives to Quetzalcoatl a dual 
nature, " the dual nature which seems to belong to the wind-god 
Quetzalcoatl) who now appears simply a wind-god, and again seems to show the 
true, characters of the old god of fire and light." [Bulletin 28 of the U.S. 
Bureau of Ethnology.]

Dr. Brinton perceived in Quetzalcoatl a similar dual nature. "He is both 
lord of the eastern light and of the winds, he writes (Myths of the New 
World, P. 214)- "Like all the dawn heroes, he too was represented as of 
white complexion, clothed in long, white robes, and, as many of the Aztec 
gods, with a full and flowing beard. . . . He had been overcome by 
Tezcatloca, the wind or spirit of night, who had descended from heaven by a 
spider's web, and presented his rival with a draught supposed to confer 
immortality, but in fact producing an intolerable longing for home. For the 
wind and the light both depart when the gloaming draws near, or when the 
clouds spread their dark and shadowy webs along the mountains, and pour the 
vivifying rain upon the fields."

The theory which derives Quetzalcoatl from a "culture-hero " who once 
actually existed is scarcely reconcilable with probability. It is more than 
likely that, as in the case of other mythical paladins, the legend of a 
mighty hero arose from the somewhat weakened idea of a great deity. Some of 
the early Spanish missionaries professed to see in Quetzalcoatl the Apostle 
St. Thomas, who had journeyed to America to effect its conversion!

The Man of the Sun
A more probable explanation of the origin of Quetzalcoatl and a more likely 
elucidation of his nature is that which would regard him as the Man of the 
Sun, who has quitted his abode for a season for the purpose of inculcating 
in mankind those arts which represent the first steps in civilisation, who 
fulfils his mission, and who, at a late period, is displaced by the deities 
of an invading race. Quetzalcoatl was represented as a traveller with staff 
in hand, and this is proof of his solar character, as is the statement that 
under his rule the fruits of the earth flourished more abundantly than at 
any subsequent period. The abundance of gold said to have been accumulated 
in his reign assists the theory, the precious metal being invariably 
associated with the sun by most barbarous peoples. In the native pinturas it 
is noticeable that the solar disc and semidisc are almost invariably found 
in connection with the feathered serpent as the symbolical attributes of 
Quetzalcoad. The Hopi Indians of Mexico at the present day symbolise the sun 
as a serpent, tail in mouth, and the ancient Mexicans introduced the solar 
disc in connection with small images of Quetzalcoatl, which they attached to 
the head-dress. In still other examples Quetzalcoatl is pictured as if 
emerging or stepping from the luminary, which is represented as his 
dwelling-place.

Several tribes tributary to the Aztecs were in the habit of imploring 
Quetzalcoatl in prayer to return and free them from the intolerable bondage 
of the conqueror. Notable among them were the Totonacs, who passionately 
believed that the sun, their father, would send a god who would free them 
from the Aztec yoke. On the coming of the Spaniards the European conquerors 
were hailed as the servants of Quetzalcoatl, thus in the eyes of the natives 
fulfilling the tradition that he would return.

Various Forms of Quetzalcoatl
Various conceptions of Quetzalcoad are noticeable in the mythology of the 
territories which extended from the north of Mexico to the marshes of 
Nicaragua. In Guatemala the Kiches recognised him as Gucumatz, and in 
Yucatan proper he was worshipped as Kukulcan, both of which names are but 
literal translations of his Mexican title of "Feathered Serpent" into Kiche 
and Mayan. That the three deities are one and the same there can be no 
shadow of doubt. Several authorities have seen in Kukulcan a "serpent-and-
rain god." He can only be such in so far as he is a solar god also. The cult 
of the feathered snake in Yucatan was unquestionably a branch of sun-
worship. In tropical latitudes the sun draws the clouds round him at noon. 
The rain falls from the clouds accompanied by thunder and lightning-the 
symbols of the divine serpent. Therefore the manifestations of the heavenly 
serpent were directly associated with the sun, and no statement that 
Kukulcan is a mere serpent-and-water god satisfactorily elucidates his 
characteristics.

Quetzalcoatl's Northern Origin
It is by no means improbable that Quetzalcoatl was of northern origin, and 
that on his adoption by southern peoples and tribes dwelling in tropical 
countries his characteristics were gradually and unconsciously altered in 
order to meet the exigencies of his environment. The mythology of the 
Indians of British Columbia, whence in all likelihood the Nahua originally 
came, is possessed of a central figure bearing a strong resemblance to 
Quetzalcoad. Thus the Thlingit tribe worship Yetl; the Quaquiutl Indians, 
Kanikilak; the Salish people of the coast, Kumsnöotl, Quäaqua, or Släalekam. 
It is noticeable that these divine beings are worshipped as the Man of the 
Sun, and totally apart from the luminary himself, as was Quetzalcoatl in 
Mexico. The Quaquiutl believe that before his settlement among them for the 
purpose of inculcating in the tribe the arts of life, the sun descended as a 
bird, and assumed a human shape. Kanikilak is his son, who, as his emissary, 
spreads the arts of civilisation over the world. So the Mexicans believed 
that Quetzalcoatl descended first of all in the form of a bird, and was 
ensnared in the fowler's net of the Toltec hero Hueymatzin.

The titles bestowed upon Quetzalcoatl by the Nahua show that in his solar 
significance he was god of the vault of the heavens, as well as merely son 
of the sun. He was alluded to as Ehecatl (The Air), Yolcuat (The 
Rattlesnake), Tohil (The Rumbler), Nanihehecatl (Lord of the Four Winds), 
Tlauizcalpantecutli (Lord of the Light of the Dawn). The whole heavenly 
vault was his, together with all its phenomena. This would seem to be in 
direct opposition to the theory that Tezcatlipoca was the supreme god of the 
Mexicans. But it must be borne in mind that Tezcatlipoca was the god of a 
later age, and of a fresh body of Nahua immigrants, and as such inimical to 
Quetzalcoatl, who was probably in a similar state of opposition to Itzamna, 
a Maya deity of Yucatan.

The Worship of Quetzalcoatl
The worship of Quetzalcoatl was in some degree antipathetic to that of the 
other Mexican deities, and his priests were a separate caste. Although human 
sacrifice was by no means so prevalent among his devotees, it is a mistake 
to aver, as some authorities have done, that it did not exist in connection 
with his worship. A more acceptable sacrifice to Quetzalcoatl appears to 
have been the blood of the celebrant or worshipper, shed by himself. When we 
come to consider the mythology of the Zapotecs, a people whose Customs and 
beliefs appear to have formed a species of link between the Mexican and 
Mayan civilisations, we shall find that their high-priests occasionally 
enacted the legend of Quetzalcoad in their own persons, and that their 
worship, which appears to have been based upon that of Quetzalcoatl, had as 
one of its most pronounced characteristics the shedding of blood. The 
celebrant or devotee drew blood from the vessels lying under the tongue or 
behind the ear by drawing across those tender parts a cord made from the 
thorn-covered fibres of the agave. The blood was smeared over the mouths of 
the idols. In this practice we can perceive an act analogous to the 
sacrificial substitution of the part for the whole, as obtaining in early 
Palestine and many other countries-a certain sign that tribal or racial 
opinion has contracted a disgust for human sacrifice, and has sought to 
evade. the anger of the gods by yielding to them a ortion of the blood of 
each worshipper, instead of sacrificing the life of one for the general 
weal.

The Maize-Gods of Mezico
A special group of deities called Centeotl presided over the agriculture of 
Mexico, each of whom personified one or other of the various aspects of the 
maize-plant. The chief goddess of maize, however, was Chicomecohuatl (Seven-
serpent), her name being an allusion to the fertilising power of water, 
which element the Mexicans symbolised by the serpent. As Xilonen she 
typified the xilote, or green ear of the maize. But it is probable that 
Chicomecohuatl was the creation of an older race, and that the Nahua new-
comers adopted or brought with them another growth-spirit, the"Earth-
mother," Teteoinnan (Mother of the Gods), or Tocitzin (Our Grandmother). 
This goddess had a son, Centeotl, a male maize-spirit. Sometimes the mother 
was also known as Centeotl, the generic name for the entire group, and this 
fact has led to some confusion in the minds of Americanists. But this does 
not mean that Chicomecohuatl was by any means neglected. Her spring 
festival, held on April 5, was known as Hueytozoztli (The Great Watch), and 
was accompanied by a general fast, when the dwellings of the Mexicans were 
decorated with bulrushes which had been sprinkled with blood drawn from the 
extremities of the inmates. The statues of the little tepitoton (household 
gods) were also decorated. The worshippers then proceeded to the maize-
fields, where they pulled the tender stalks of the growing maize, and, 
having decorated them with flowers, placed them in the calpulli (the common 
house of the village). A mock combat then took place before the altar of 
Chicomecohuatl. The girls of the village presented the goddess with bundles 
of maize of the previous season's harvesting, later restoring them to the 
granaries in order that they might be utilised for seed for the coming year. 
Chicomecohuatl was always represented among the household deities of the 
Mexicans, and on the occasion of her festival the family placed before the 
image a basket of provisions sur. mounted by a cooked frog, bearing on its 
back a piece of cornstalk stuffed with pounded maize and vegetables. This 
frog was symbolic of Chalchihuitlicue, wife of TIaloc, the rain-god, who 
assisted Chicomecohuatl in providg a bountiful harvest. In order that the 
soil might rther benefit, a frog, the symbol of water, was sacrificed, so 
that its vitality should recuperate that of the weary and much-burdened 
earth.

The Sacrifice of the Dancer
A more important festival of Chicomecohuatl, however, was the Xalaquia, 
which lasted from June 28 to July 14, commencing when the maize plant had 
attained its full growth. The women of the pueblo (village) wore their hair 
unbound, and shook and tossed it so that by sympathetic magic the maize 
might take the hint and grow correspondingly long. Chian pinolli was 
consumed in immense quantities, and maize porridge was eaten. Hilarious 
dances were nightly performed in the teopan (temple), the central figure in 
which was the Xalaquia, a female captive or slave, with face painted red and 
yellow to represent the colours of the maize-plant. She had previously under 
gone a long course of training in the dancing-school, and now, all unaware 
of the horrible fate awaiting her, she danced and pirouetted gaily among the 
rest. Throughout the duration of the stival she danced and on its expiring 
night she was accompanied in the dance by the women of the community, who 
circled round her, chanting the deeds of Chicomecohuatl. When daybreak 
appeared the company was joined by the chiefs and headmen, who, along with 
the exhausted and half-fainting victim, danced the solemn death-dance. The 
entire community then approached the teocalli (pyramid of sacrifice), and, 
its summit reached, the victim was stripped to a nude condition, the priest 
plunged a knife of flint into her bosom, and, tearing out the still 
palpitating heart, offered it up to Chicomecohuatl. In this manner the 
venerable goddess, weary with the labours of inducing growth in the maize-
plant, was supposed to be revivified and refreshed. Hence the name Xalaquia, 
which signifies "She who is clothed with the Sand." Until the death of the 
victim it was not lawful to partake of the new corn.

The general appearance of Chicomecohuatl was none too pleasing. Her image 
rests in the National Museum in Mexico, and is girdled with snakes. On the 
underside the symbolic frog is carved. The Americanists; of the eighteenth 
and early nineteenth centuries were unequal to the task of elucidating the 
origin of the figure, which they designated Teoyaominqui. The first to point 
out the error was Payne, in his History of the New World called America, 
Vol. i. p. 424. The passage in which he announces his discovery is of such 
real interest that it is worth transcribing fully.

An Antiquarian Mare's-Nest
"All the great idols of Mexico were thought to have been destroyed until 
this was disinterred among other relics in the course of making new drains 
in the Plaza Mayor of Mexico in August 1790. The discovery produced an 
immense sensation. The idol was dragged to the court of the University, and 
there set up; the Indians began to worship it and deck it with flowers; the 
antiquaries, with about the same degree of intelligence, to speculate about 
it. What most puzzled them was that the face and some other parts of the 
goddess are found in duplicate at the back or the figure; hence they 
concluded it to represent two gods in one, the principal of whom they 
further concluded to be a female, the other, indicated by the back, a male. 
The standard author on Mexican antiquities at that time was the Italian 
dilettante Boturini, of whom it may be said that he is better, but not much 
better, than nothing at all. From page 27 of his work the antiquaries 
learned that Huitzilopochtli was accompanied by the goddess Teoyaominqui, 
who was charged with collecting the souls of those slain in war and 
sacrifice. This was enough. The figure was at once named Teoyaominqui or 
Huitzilopochtli (The One plus the Other), and has been so called ever since. 
The antiquaries next elevated this imaginary goddess to the rank of the war-
god's wife. 'A soldier,' says Bardolph, 'is better accommodated than with a 
wife': a fortiori, so is a war-god. Besides, as Torquemada (vol, ii. p.47) 
says with perfect truth, the Mexicans did not think so grossly of the 
divinity as to have married gods or goddesses at all. The figure is 
undoubtedly a female. It has no vestige of any weapon about it, nor has it 
any limbs. It differs in every particular from the war-god Huitzilopochtli, 
every detail of which is perfectly well known. There never was any goddess 
called Teoyaominqui. This may be plausibly inferred from the fact that such 
a goddess is unknown not merely to Sahagun, Torquemada, Acosta, Tezozomoc, 
Duran, and Clavigero, but to all other writers except Boturini. The blunder 
of the last-named writer is easily explained. Antonio Leon y Gama, a Mexican 
astronomer, wrote an account of the discoveries Of 1790, in which, evidently 
puzzled by the name of Teoyaominqui, he quotes a manuscript in Mexican, said 
to have been written by an Indian of Tezcuco, who was born in 1528, to the 
effect that Teoyaotlatohua and Teoyaominqui were spirits who presided over 
the fifteenth of the twenty signs of the fortune-tellers' calendar, and that 
those born in this sign would be brave warriors, but would soon die. (As the 
fifteenth sign was quauhtli, this is likely enough.) When their hour had 
come the former spirit scented them out, the latter killed them. The rubbish 
printed about Huitzilopochtli, Teoyaominqui, and Mictlantecutli in 
connection with this statue would fill a respectable volume. The reason why 
the features were duplicated is obvious. The figure was carried in the midst 
of a large crowd. Probably it was considered to be an evil omen if the idol 
turned away its face from its worshippers; this the duplicate obviated. So 
when the dance was performed round the figure (cf. Janus). This duplication 
of the features, a characteristic of the very oldest gods, appears to be 
indicated when the numeral ome (two) is prefixed to the title of the deity. 
Thus the two ancestors and preservers of the race were called Ometecuhtli 
and Omecihuatl (two-chief, two-woman), ancient Toltec gods, who at the 
conquest become less prominent in the theology of Mexico, and who are best 
represented in that of the Mexican colony of Nicaragua."

The Offering to Centeotl
During her last hours the victim sacrificed at the Xalaquia wore a ritual 
dress made from the fibres of the aloe, and with this garment the maize-god 
Centeotl was clothed. Robed in this he temporarily represented the earth-
goddess, so that he might receive her sacrifice. The blood of victims was 
offered up to him in a vessel decorated with that brilliant and artistic 
featherwork which excited such admiration in the breasts of the connoisseurs 
and cesthetes of the Europe of the sixteenth century. Upon partaking of this 
blood-offering the deity emitted a groan so intense and terrifying that it 
has been left on record that such Spaniards as were present became panic-
stricken. This ceremony was followed by another, the nitiçapoloa (tasting of 
the soil), which consisted in raising a little earth on one finger to the 
mouth and eating it.

As has been said, Centeotl the son has been confounded with Centeotl the 
mother, who is in reality the earth-mother Teteoinnan. Each of these deities 
bad a teopan (temple) of his or her own, but they were closely allied as 
parent and child. But of the two, Centeotl the son was the more important. 
On the death of the sacrificed victim her skin was conveyed to the temple of 
Centeotl the son, and worn there in the succeeding ritual by the officiating 
priests. This gruesome dress is frequently depicted in the Aztec pinturas, 
where the skin of the hands, and in some instances the feet, of the victims 
can be seen dangling from the wrists and ankles of the priest.

Importance of the Food-Gods
To the Mexicans the deities of most importance to the community as a whole 
were undoubtedly the food-gods. In their emergence from the hunting to the 
agricultural state of life, when they began to exist almost solely upon the 
fruits of the earth, the Mexicans were quick to recognise that the old 
deities of the chase, such as Mixcoatl, could not now avail them or succour 
them in the same manner as the guardians of the crops and fertilisers of the 
soil. Gradually we see these gods, then, advance in power and influence 
until at the time of the Spanish invasion we find them paramount. Even the 
terrible war-god himself had an agricultural significance, as we have 
pointed out. A distinct bargain with the food-gods can be clearly traced, 
and is none the less obvious because it was never written or codified. The 
covenant was as binding to the native mind as any made betwixt god and man 
in ancient Palestine, and included mutual assistance as well as provision 
for mere alimentary supply. In no mythology is the understanding between god 
and man so clearly defined as in the Nahuan, and in none is its operation 
better exemplified.

Xipe
Xipe (The Flayed) was widely worshipped through,out Mexico, and is usually 
depicted in the pinturas as being attired in a flayed human skin. At his 
special festival, the "Man-flaying," the skins were removed from the victims 
and worn by the devotees of the god for the succeeding twenty days. He is 
usually represented as of a red colour. In the later days of the Aztec 
monarchy the kings and leaders of Mexico assumed the dress or classical 
garments of Xipe. This dress consisted of a crown made of feathers of the 
roseate spoonbill, the gilt timbrel, the jacket of spoonbill feathers, and 
an apron of green feathers lapping over one another in a tile-like pattern. 
In the Cozcatzin Codex we see a picture of King Axayacatl dressed as Xipe in 
a feather skirt, and having a tiger-skin scabbard to his sword. The hands of 
a flayed human skin also dangle over the monarch's wrists, and the feet fall 
over his feet like gaiters.

Xipe's shield is a round target covered with the rose-coloured feathers of 
the spoonbill, with concentric circles of a darker hue on the surface. There 
are examples of it divided into an upper and lower part, the former showing 
an emerald on a blue field, and the latter a tiger-skin design. Xipe was 
imagined as possessing three forms, the first that of the roseate spoon. 
bill, the second that of the blue cotinga, and the last that of a tiger, the 
three shapes perhaps corresponding to the regions of heaven, earth, and 
hell, or to the three elements, fire, earth, and water. The deities of many 
North American Indian tribes show similar variations in form and colour, 
which are supposed to follow as the divinity changes his dwelling to north, 
south, east, or west. But Xipe is seldom depicted in the pinturas in any 
other form but that of the red od) the form in which the Mexicans adopted 
him from the Yopi tribe of the Pacific slope. He is the god of human 
sacrifice par excellence, and may be regarded as a Yopi equivalent of 
Tezcatlipoca.

Nanaliuatl, or Nanauatzin
Nanahuatl (Poor Leper) presided over skin diseases, such as leprosy. It was 
thought that persons afflicted with these complaints were set apart by the 
moon for his service. In the Nahua tongue the words for "leprous" and 
"eczematous " also mean "divine." The myth of Nanahuatl tells how before the 
sun was created humanity dwelt in sable and horrid gloom. Only a human 
sacrifice could hasten the appearance of the luminary. Metztli (The Moon) 
led forth Nanahuatl as a sacrifice, and he was cast upon a funeral pyre, in 
the flames of which he was consumed. Metztli also cast herself upon the mass 
of flame, and with her death the sun rose above the horizon. There can be no 
doubt that the myth refers to the consuming of the starry or spotted night, 
and incidentally to the nightly death of the moon at the flaming hour of 
dawn.

Xolotl
Xolotl is of southern, possibly Zapotec, origin. He represents either fire 
rushing down from the heavens or light flaming upward. It is noticeable that 
in the ointuras the picture of the setting sun being devoured by the earth 
is nearly always placed opposite his image. He is probably identical with 
Nanahuatl, and appears as the representative of human sacrifice. He has also 
affinities with Xipe. On the whole Xolotl may be best described as a sun-god 
of the more southerly tribes. His head (quaxolvto was one of the most famous 
devices for warriors' use, as sacrifice among the Nahua was, as we have 
seen, closely associated with warfare.

Xolotl was a mythical figure quite foreign to the peoples of Anahuac or 
Mexico, who regarded him as something strange and monstrous. He is alluded 
to as the "God of Monstrosities, and, thinks Dr. Seler, the word 
"monstrosity" may suitably translate his name. He is depicted with empty 
eye-sockets, which circumstance is explained by the myth that when the gods 
determined to sacrifice themselves in order to give life and strength to the 
newly created sun, Xolotl withdrew, and wept so much that his eyes fell out 
of their sockets. This was the Mexican explanation of a Zapotec attribute. 
Xolotl was originally the "Lightning Beast" of the Maya or some other 
southern folk, and was represented by them as a dog, since that animal 
appeared to them to be the creature which he most resembled. But he was by 
no means a "natural" dog, hence their conception of him as unnatural. Dr. 
Seler is inclined to identify him with the tapir, and indeed Sahagun speaks 
of a strange animal-being, tlaca-xolotl, which has "a large snout, large 
teeth, hoofs like an ox, a thick hide, and reddish hair"-not a bad 
description of the tapir of Central America. Of course to the Mexicans the 
god Xolotl was no longer an animal, although he had evolved from one, and 
was imagined by them to have the form shown in the accompanying 
illustration.

The Fire-God
This deity was known in Mexico under various names, notably Tata (Our 
Father), Huehueteotl (Oldest of Gods), and Xiuhtecutli (Lord of the Year). 
He was represented as of the colour of fire, with a black face, a headdress 
of green feathers, and bearing on his back a yellow serpent, to typify the 
serpentine nature of fire. He also bore a mirror of gold to show his 
connection with the sun, from which all heat emanates. On rising in the 
morning all Mexican families made Xiuhtecutli an offering of a piece of 
bread and a drink. He was thus not only, like Vulcan, the god of 
thunderbolts and conflagrations, but also the milder deity of the domestic 
hearth. Once a year the fire in every Mexican house was extinguished, and 
rekindled by friction before the idol of Xiuhtecutli. When a Mexican baby 
was born it passed through a baptism of fire on the fourth day, up to which 
time a fire, lighted at the time of its birth, was kept burning in order to 
nourish its existence.

Mictlan
Mictlantecutli (Lord of Hades) was God of the Dead and of the grim and 
shadowy realm to which the souls of men repair after their mortal sojourn. 
He is represented in the pinturas as a grisly monster with capacious mouth, 
into which fall the spirits of the dead. His terrible abode was sometimes 
alluded to as Tlalxicco (Navel of the Earth), but the Mexicans in general 
seem to have thought that it was situated in the far north, which they 
regarded as a place of famine, desolation, and death. Here those who by the 
circumstances of their demise were unfitted to enter the paradise of Tlaloc-
namely, those who had not been drowned or had not died a warrior's death, 
or, in the case of women, had not died in childbed-passed a dreary and 
meaningless existence. Mictlan was surrounded by a species of demons called 
tzitzimimes, and had a spouse, Mictecaciuatl. When we come to discuss the 
analogous deity of the Maya we shall see that in all probability Mictlan was 
represented by the bat, the animal typical of the underworld. In a preceding 
paragraph dealing with the funerary customs we have described thejourney of 
the soul to the abode of Mictlan, and the ordeals through which the spirit 
of the defunct had to pass ere entering his realm (see p. 37).

Worship of the Planet Venus
The Mexicans designated the planet Venus Citlalpol (The Great Star) and 
Tlauizcalpantecutli (Lord of the Dawn). It seems to have been the only star 
worshipped by them, and was regarded with considerable veneration. Upon its 
rising they stopped up the chimneys of their houses, so that no harm of any 
kind might enter with its light. A column called Ilhuicatlan, meaning " In 
the Sky," stood in the court of the great temple of Mexico, and upon this a 
symbol of the planet was painted. On its reappearance during its usual 
circuit, captives were taken before this repre. sentation and sacrificed to 
it. It will be remembered that the myth of Quetzalcoatl states that the 
heart of that deity flew upward from the funeral pyre on which he was 
consumed and became the planet Venus. It is not easy to say whether or not 
this myth is anterior to the adoption of the worship of the planet by the 
Nahua, for it may be a tale of pre- or post-Nahuan growth. In the tonalamatl 
Tlauizcalpantecutli is representcd as lord of the ninth division of thirteen 
days, beginning with Ce Coatl (the sign of "One Serpent "). In several of 
the pinturas he is represented as having a white body with long red stripes, 
while round his eves is a deep black painting like a domino mask, bordered 
with small white circles. His lips are a bright vermilion. The red stripes 
are probably introduced to accentuate the whiteness of his body, which is 
under stood to symbolise the peculiar half-light which emanates from the 
planet. The black paint on the face, surrounding the eye, typifies the dark 
sky of night. In Mexican and Central American symbolism the eye often 
represents light, and here, surrounded by blackness as it is, it is perhaps 
almost hieroglyphic. As the star of evening, Tlauizcalpantecutli is some 
times shown with the face of a skull, to signify his descent into the 
underworld, whither he follows the sun. That the Mexicans and Maya carefully 
and accurately observed his periods of revolution is witnessed by the 
pinturas.

Sun-Worship
The sun was regarded by the Nahua, and indeed by all the Mexican and Central 
American peoples, as the supreme deity, or rather the principal source of 
subsistence and life. He was always alluded to as the teotl, the god, and 
his worship formed as it were a background to that of all the other gods. 
His Mexican name, lpalnemohuani (He by whom Men Live) shows that the 
Mexicans regarded him as the rimal source of being, and the heart, the 
symbol of life, was looked upon as his special sacrifice. Those who rose at 
sunrise to prepare food for the day held up to him on his appearance the 
hearts of animals they had slain for cooking, and even the hearts of the 
victims to Tezcatlipoca and Huitzilopochtli were first held up to the sun, 
as if he had a primary right to the sacrifice, before being cast into the 
bowl of copal which lay at the feet of the idol. It was supposed that the 
luminary rejoiced in offerings of blood, and that it constituted the only 
food which would render him sufficiently vigorous to undertake his daily 
journey through the heavens. He is often depicted in the pinturas as licking 
up the gore of the sacrificial victims with his long tongue-like rays. The 
sun must fare well if he was to continue to give life) light, and heat to 
mankind.

The Mexicans, as we have already seen, believed that the luminary they knew 
had been preceded by others, each of which had been quenched by some awful 
cataclysm of nature. Eternity had, in fact, been broken up into epochs, 
marked by the destruction of successive suns. In the period preceding that 
in whi they lived, a mighty deluge had deprived the sun of life, and some 
such catastrophe was apprehended at the end of every "sheaf" of fifty-two 
years. The old suns were dead, and the current sun was no more immortal than 
they. At the endof oneof the "sheaves" he too would succumb.

Sustaining the Sun
It was therefore necessary to sustain the sun by the daily food of human 
sacrifice, for by a tithe of human life alone would he be satisfied. 
Naturally a people holding such a belief would look elsewhere than within 
their own borders for the material wherewith to placate their deity. This 
could be most suitably found among the inhabitants of a neighbouring state. 
It thus became the business of the warrior class in the Aztec state to 
furnish forth the altars of the gods with human victims. The most suitable 
district of supply was the pueblo of Tlaxcallan, or Tlascala, the people of 
which were of cognate origin to the Aztecs. The communities had, although 
related, been separated for so many generations that they had begun to 
regard each other as traditional enemies, and on a given day in the year 
their forces met at an appointed spot for the purpose of engaging in a 
strife which should furnish one side or the other with a sufficiency of 
victims for the purpose of sacrifice. The warrior who captured the largest 
number of opponents alive was regarded as the champion of the day, and was 
awarded the chief honours of the combat. The sun was therefore the god of 
warriors, as he would give them victory in battle in order that they might 
supply him with food. The rites of this military worship of the luminary 
were held in the Quauhquauhtinchan (House of the Eagles), an armoury set 
apart for the regiment of that name. On March 17 and December 1 and 2, at 
the ceremonies known as Nauhollin (The Four Motions-alluding to the 
quivering appearance of the sun's rays), the warriors gathered in this hall 
for the purpose of despatching a messenger to their lord the sun. High up on 
the wall of the principal court was a great symbolic representation of the 
orb, painted upon a bright coloured cotton hanging. Before this copal and 
other Irragrant gums and spices were burned four times a day. The victim, a 
war-captive, was placed at the foot of a long staircase leading up to the 
Quauhxicalli (Cup of the Eagles), the name of the stone on which he was to 
be sacrificed. He was clothed in red striped with white and wore white 
plumes in his hair-colours symbolical of the sun-while he bore a staff 
decorated with feathers and a shield covered with tufts of cotton. He also 
carried a bundle of eagle's feathers and some paint on his shoulders, to 
enable the sun, to whom he was the emissary, to paint his face. He was then 
addressed by the officiating priest in the following terms: "Sir, we pray 
you go to our god the sun, and greet him on our behalf; tell him that his 
sons and warriors and chiefs and those who remain here beg of him to 
remember them and to favour them from that place where he is, and to receive 
this small offering which we send him. Give him this staff to help him on 
his journey, and this shield for his defence, and all the rest that you have 
in this bundle." The victim, having undertaken to carry the message to the 
sun-god, was then despatched upon his long journey.

A Quauhxicalli is preserved in the National Museum of Mexico. It consists of 
a basaltic mass, circular in form, on which are shown in sculpture a series 
of groups representing Mexican warriors receiving the submission of war-
captives. The prisoner tenders a flower to his captor, symbolical of the 
life he is about to offer up, for lives were the "flowers" offered to the 
gods, and the campaign in which these "blossoms" were captured was called 
Xochiyayotl (The War of Flowers). The warriors who receive the submission of 
the captives are represented in the act of tearing the plumes from their 
heads. These bas-reliefs occupy the sides of the stone. The face of it is 
covered by a great solar disc having eight rays, and the surface is hollowed 
out in the middle to form a receptacle for blood-the "cup" alluded to in the 
name of the stone. The Quauhxicalli must not be confounded with the 
temalacatl (spindle stone), to which the alien warrior who received a chance 
of life was secured. The gladiatorial combat gave the war-captive an 
opportunity to escape through superior address in arms. The temalacatl was 
somewhat higher than a man, and was provided with a platform at the top, in 
the middle of which was placed a great stone with a hole in it through which 
a rope was passed. To this the war-captive was secured, and if he could 
vanquish seven of his captors he was released. If he failed to do so he was 
at once sacrificed.

A Mexican Valhalla
The Mexican warriors believed that they continued in the service of the sun 
after death, and, like the Scandinavian heroes in Valhalla, that they were 
admitted to the dwelling of the god, where they shared all the delights of 
his diurnal round. The Mexican warrior dreaded to die in his bed, and craved 
an end on the field of battle. This explains the desperate nature of their 
resistance to the Spaniards under Cortés, whose officers stated that the 
Mexicans seemed to desire to die fighting. After death they believed that 
they would partake of the cannibal feasts offered up to the sun and imbibe 
the juice of flowers.

The Feast of Totec
The chief of the festivals to the sun was that held in spring at the vernal 
equinox, before the representation of a deity known as Totec (Our Great 
Chief). Although Totec was a solar deity he had been adopted from the people 
of an alien state, the Zapotecs of Zalisco, and is therefore scarcely to be 
regarded as the principal sun-god. His festival was celebrated by the 
symbolical slaughter of all the other gods for the purpose of providing 
sustenance to the sun, each of the gods being figuratively slain in the 
person of a victim. Totec was attired in the same manner as the warrior 
despatched twice a year to assure the sun of the loyalty of the Mexicans. 
The festival appears to have been primarily a seasonal one, as bunches of 
dried maize were offered to Totec. But its larger meaning is obvious. It 
was, indeed, a commemoration of the creation of the sun. This is proved by 
the description of the image of Totec, which was robed and equipped as the 
solar traveller, by the solar disc and tables of the sun's progress carved 
on the altar employed in the ceremony, and by the robes of the victims, who 
were dressed to represent dwellers in the sun-god's halls. Perhaps Totec, 
although of alien origin, was the only deity possessed by the Mexicans who 
directly represented the sun. As a borrowed god he would have but a minor 
position in the Mexican pantheon, but again as the only sun-god whom it was 
necessary to bring into prominence during a strictly solar festival he would 
be for the time, of course, a very important deity indeed.

Tepeyollotl
Tepeyollotl means Heart of the Mountain, and evidently alludes to a deity 
whom the Nahua connected with seismic disturbances and earthquakes. By the 
interpreter of the Codex Telleriano-Remensis he is called Tepeolotlec, an 
obvious distortion of his real name. The interpreter of the codex states 
that his name "refers to the condition of the earth after the flood. The 
sacrifices of these thirteen days were not good, and the literal translation 
of their name is 'dirt sacrifices.' They caused palsy and bad humours. . . . 
This Tepeolotlec was lord of these thirteen days. In them were celebrated 
the feast to the Jaguar, and the last four preceding days were days of 
fasting. . . . Tepeolotlec means the 'Lord of Beasts.' The four feast days 
were in honour of the Suchiquezal, who was the man that remained behind on 
the earth upon which we now live. This Tepeolotlec was the same as the echo 
of the voice when it re-echoes in a valley from one mountain to another. 
This name 'jaguar' is given to the earth because the jaguar is the boldest 
animal, and the echo which the voice awakens in the mountains is a survival 
of the flood, it is said."

From this we can see that Tepeyollotl is a deity of the earth pure and 
simple, a god of desert places. It is certain that he was not a Mexican god, 
or at least was not of Nahua origin, as he is mentioned by none of those 
writers who deal with Nahua traditions, and we must look for him among the 
Mixtecs and Zapotecs.

Macuilxochitl, or Xochipilli
This deity, whose names mean Five-Flower and Source of Flowers, was regarded 
as the patron of luck in gaming. He may have been adopted by the Nahua from 
the Zapotecs, but the converse may be equally true. The Zapotecs represented 
him with a design resembling a butterfly about the mouth, and a manycoloured 
face which looks out of the open jaws of a bird with a tall and erect crest. 
The worship of this god appears to have been very widespread. Sahagun says 
of him that a fête was held in his honour, which was preceded by a rigorous 
fast. The people covered themselves with ornaments and jewels symbolic of 
the deity, as if they desired to represent him, and dancing and singing 
roceeded gaily to the sound of the drum. Offerings of the blood of various 
animals followed, and specially prepared cakes were submitted to the god. 
This simple fare, however, was later followed by human sacrifices, rendered 
by the notables, who brought certain of their slaves for immolation. This 
completed the festival.

Father and Mother Gods
The Nahua believed that Ometecutli and Omeciuatl were the father and mother 
of the human species. The names signify Lords of Duality or Lords of the Two 
Sexes. They were also called Tonacatecutli and Tonacaciuatl (Lord and Lady 
of Our Flesh, or of Subsistence). They were in fact regarded as the sexual 
essence of the creative deity, or perhaps more correctly of deity in 
general. They occupied the first place in the Nahua calendar, to signify 
that they had existed from the beginning, and they are usually represented 
as being clothed in rich attire. Ometecutli (a literal translation of his 
name is Two-Lord) is sometimes identified with the sky and the fire-god, the 
female deity representing the earth or water-conceptions similar to those 
respecting Kronos and Gæa. We refer again to these supreme divinities in the 
following chapter (see p. 118).

The Pulque-Gods
When a man was intoxicated with the native Mexican drink of pulque, a liquor 
made from the juice of the Agave Americana, he was believed to be under the 
influence of a god or spirit. The commonest form under which the drink-god 
was worshipped was the rabbit, that animal being considered to be utterly 
devoid of sense. This particular divinity was known as Ometochtli. The scale 
of debauchery which it was desired to reach was indicated by the number of 
rabbits worshipped, the highest number, four hundred, representing the most 
extreme degree of intoxication. The chief pulque-gods apart from these were 
Patecatl and Tequechmecauiani. If the drunkard desired to escape the perils 
of accidental hanging during intoxication, it was necessary to sacrifice to 
the latter, but if death by drowning was apprehended Teatlahuiani, the deity 
who harried drunkards to a watery grave, was placated. If the debauchee 
wished his punishment not to exceed a headache, Quatlapanqui (The Head-
splitter) was sacrificed to, or else Papaztac (The Nerveless). Each trade or 
profession had its own Ometochtli, but for the aristocracy there was only 
one of these gods, Cohuatzincatl, a name signifying "He who has 
Grandparents." Several of these drink-gods had names which connected them 
with various localities; for example, Tepoxtecatl was the pulque-god of 
Tepoztlan. The calendar day Ometochtli, which means "Two-Rabbit," because of 
the symbol which accompanied it, was under the special protection of these 
gods, and the Mexicans believed that any one born on that day was almost 
inevitably doomed to become a drunkard. All the pulque-gods were closely 
associated with the soil, and with the earth-goddess. They wore the golden 
Huaxtec nose-ornament, the yaca-metztli, of crescent shape, which 
characterised the latter, and indeed this ornament was inscribed upon all 
articles sacred to the pulque-gods. Their faces were painted red and black, 
as were objects consecrated to them, their blankets and shields. After the 
Indians had harvested their maize they drank to intoxication, and invoked 
one or other of these gods. On the whole it is safe to infer that they were 
originally deities of local husbandry who imparted virtue to the soil as 
pulque imparted strength and courage to the warrior. The accompanying sketch 
of the god Tepoxtecatl (see p. 117) well illustrates the distinguishing 
characteristics of the pulque-god class. Here we can observe the face 
painted in two colours, the crescent-shaped nose-ornament, the bicoloured 
shield, the long necklace made from the malinalli herb, and the ear-
pendants.

It is of course clear that the drink-gods were of the same class as the 
food-gods-patrons of the fruitful soil-but it is strange that they should be 
male whilst the food-gods are mostly female.

The Goddesses of Mexico: Metztli
Metztli, or Yohualticitl (The Lady of Night), was the Mexican goddess of the 
moon. She had in reality two phases, one that of a beneficent protectress of 
harvests and promoter of growth in general, and the other that of a bringer 
of dampness, cold, and miasmic airs ghosts, mysterious shapes of the dim 
half-light of night and its oppressive silence.

To a people in the agricultural stage of civilisation the moon appears as 
the great recorder of harvests. But she has also supremacy over water, which 
is always connected by primitive peoples with the moon. Citatli (Moon) and 
Atl (Water) are constantly confounded in Nahua myth, and in many ways their 
characteristics were blended. It was Metztli who led forth Nanahuatl the 
Leprous to the pyre whereon he perished-a reference to the dawn, in which 
the starry sky of night is consumed in the fires of the rising sun.

Tlazolteotl
Tlazolteotl (God of Ordure), or Tlaelquani (Filth-eater), was called by the 
Mexicans the earth-goddess because she was the eradicator of sins, to whose 
priests the people went to make confession so that they might be absolved 
from their misdeeds. Sin was symbolised by the Mexicans as excrement. 
Confession covered only the sins of immorality. But if Tlazolteotl was the 
goddess of confession, she was also the patroness of desire and luxury. It 
was, however, as a deity whose chief office was the eradication of human sin 
that she was pre-eminent. The process by which this was supposed to be 
effected is quaintly described by Sahagun in the twelfth chapter of his 
first book. The penitent addressed the confessor as follows: "Sir, I desire 
to approach that most powerful god, the protector of all, that is to say, 
Tezcatlipoca. I desire to tell him my sins in secret." The confessor 
replied: "Be happy, my son: that which thou wishest to do will be to thy 
good and advantage." The confessor then opened the divinatory book known as 
the Tonalamatl (that is, the Book of the Calendar) and acquainted the 
applicant with the day which appeared the most suitable for his confession. 
The day having arrived, the penitent provided himself with a mat, copal gum 
to burn as incense, and wood whereon to burn it. If he was a person high in 
office the priest repaired to his house, but in the case of lesser people 
the confession took place in the dwelling of the priest. Having lighted the 
fire and burned the incense, the penitent addressed the fire in the 
following terms: "Thou, lord, who art the father and mother of the gods, and 
the most ancient of them all, thy servant, thy slave bows before thee. 
Weeping, he approaches thee in great distress. He comes plunged in grief, 
because he has been buried in sin, having backslidden, and partaken of those 
vices and evil delights which merit death. O master most compassionate, who 
art the upholder and defence of all, receive the penitence and anguish of 
thy slave and vassal."

This prayer having concluded, the confessor then turned to the penitent and 
thus addressed him: "My son, thou art come into the presence of that god who 
is the protector and upholder of all; thou art come to him to confess thy 
evil vices and thy hidden uncleannesses; thou art come to him to unbosom the 
secrets of thy heart. Take care that thou omit nothing from the catalogue of 
thy sins in the presence of our lord who is called Tczcatlipoca. It is 
certain that thou art before him who is invisible and impalpable, thou who 
art not worthy to be seen before him, or to speak with him. . . ."

The allusions to Tczcatlipoca are, of course, to him in the shape of 
Tlazolteotl. Having listened to a sermon by the confessor, the penitent then 
confessed his misdeeds, after which the confessor said: "My son, thou hast 
before our lord god confessed in his presence thy evil actions. I wish to 
say in his name that thou hast an obligation to make. At the time when the 
goddesses called Ciuapipiltin descend to earth during the celebration of the 
feast of the goddesses of carnal things, whom they name Ixcuinamc, thou 
shalt fast during four days, punishing thy stomach and thy mouth. When the 
day of the feast of the lxcuinamc arrives thou shalt scarify thy tongue with 
the small thorns of the osier [called teocaleacatl or tlazotl], and if that 
is not sufficient thou shalt do likewise to thine ears, the whole for 
penitence, for the remission of thy sin, and as a meritorious act. Thou wilt 
apply to thy tongue the middle of a spine of magucy, and thou wilt scarify 
thy shoulders. That done, thy sins will be pardoned."

If the sins of the penitent were not very grave the priest would enjoin upon 
him a fast of more or less prolonged nature. Only old men confessed crimes 
in veneribus, as the punishment for such was death, and younger men had no 
desire to risk the penalty involved, although the priests were enjoined to 
strict secrecy.

Father Burgoa describes very fully a ceremony of this kind which came under 
his notice in 1652 in the Zapotec village of San Francisco de Cajonos. He 
encountered on a tour of inspection an old native cacique, or chief, of 
great refinement of manners and of a stately presence, who dressed in costly 
garments after the Spanish fashion, and who was regarded by the Indians with 
much veneration. This man came to the priest for the purpose of reporting 
upon the progress in things spiritual and temporal in his village. Burgoa 
recognised his urbanity and wonderful command of the Spanish language, but 
perceived by certain signs that he had been taught to look for by long 
experience that the man was a pagan. He communicated his suspicions to the 
vicar of the village, but met with such assurances of the cacique's 
soundness of faith that he believed himself to be in error for once. Shortly 
afterwards, however, a wandering Spaniard perceived the chief in a retired 
place in the mountains performing idolatrous ceremonies, and aroused the 
monks, two of whom accompanied him to the spot where the cacique had been 
seen indulging in his heathenish practices. They found on the altar 
"feathers of many colours, sprinkled with blood which the Indians had drawn 
from the veins under their tongues and behind their ears, incense spoons and 
remains of copal, and in the middle a horrible stone figure, which was the 
god to whom they had offered this sacrifice in expiation of their sins, 
while they made their confessions to the blasphemous priests, and cast off 
their sins in the following manner: they had woven a kind of dish out of a 
strong herb, specially gathered for this purpose, and casting this before 
the priest, said to him that they came to beg mercy of their god, and pardon 
for their sins that they had committed during that year, and that they 
brought them all carefully enumerated. They then drew out of a cloth pairs 
of thin threads made of dry maize husks, that they had tied two by two in 
the middle with a knot, by which they represented their sins. They laid 
these threads on the dishes of grass, and over them pierced their veins, and 
let the blood trickle upon them, and the priest took these offerings to the 
idol, and in a long speech he begged the god to forgive these, his sons, 
their sins which were brought to him, aiid to permit them to be joyful and 
hold feasts to him as their god and lord. Then the priest came back to those 
who had confessed, delivered a long discourse on the ceremonies they had 
still to perform, and told them that the god had pardoned them and that they 
might be glad again and sin anew."

Chalchihuitlicue
This goddess was the wife of Tlaloc, the god of rain and moisture. The name 
means Lady of the Emerald Robe, in allusion to the colour of the element 
over which the deity partly presided. She was specially worshipped by the 
water-carriers of Mexico, and all those whose avocation brought them into 
contact with water. Her costume was peculiar and interesting. Round her neck 
she wore a wonderful collar of precious stones, from which hung a gold 
pendant. She was crowned with a coronet of blue paper, decorated with green 
feathers. Her eyebrows were of turquoise, set in as mosaic, and her garment 
was a nebulous blue-green in hue, recalling the tint of seawater in the 
tropics. The resemblance was heightened by a border of sea-flowers or water-
plants, one of which she also carried in her left hand, whilst in her right 
she bore a vase surmounted by a cross, emblematic of the four points of the 
compass whence comes the rain.

Mixcoatl
Mixcoatl was the Aztec god of the chase, and was probably a deity of the 
Otomi aborigines of Mexico. The name means Cloud Serpent, and this 
originated the idea that Mixcoatl was a representation of the tropical 
whirlwind. This is scarcely correct, however, as the hunter-god is 
identified with the tempest and thunder-cloud, and the lightning is supposed 
to represent his arrows. Like many other gods of the chase, he is figured as 
having the characteristics of a deer or rabbit. He is usually depicted as 
carrying a sheaf of arrows, to typify thunderbolts. It may be that Mixcoatl 
was an air and thunder deity of the Otomi, older in origin than either 
Quetzalcoatl or Tezcatlipoca, and that his inclusion in the Nahua pantheon 
becoming necessary in order to quieten Nahua susceptibilities, he received 
the status of god of the chase. But, on the other hand, the Mexicans, unlike 
the Peruvians, who adopted many foreign gods for political purposes, had 
little regard for the feelings of other races, and only accepted an alien 
deity into the native circle for some good reason, most probably because 
they noted the omission of the figure in their own divine system. Or, again, 
dread of a certain foreign god might force them to adopt him as their own in 
the hope of placating him. Their worship of Quetzalcoatl is perhaps an 
instance of this.

Camaxtli
This deity was the war-god of the Tlascalans, who were constantly in 
opposition to the Aztecs of Mexico. He was to the warriors of Tlascala 
practically what Huitzilopochtli was to those of Mexico. He was closely 
identified with Mixcoatl, and with the god of the morning star, whose 
colours are depicted on his face and body. But in all probability Camaxtli 
was a god of the chase, who in later times was adopted as a god of war 
because of his possession of the lightning dart, the symbol of divine 
warlike prowess. In the mythologies of North America we find similar hunter-
gods, who sometimes evolve into gods of war for a like reason, and again 
gods of the chase who have all the appearance and attributes of the 
creatures hunted.

Ixtlilton
Ixtlilton (The Little Black One) was the Mexican god of medicine and 
healing, and therefore was often alluded to as the brother of Macuilxochitl, 
the god of well-being or good luck. From the account of the general 
appearance of his temple-in edifice of painted boards-it would seem to have 
evolved from the primitive tent or lodge of the medicine-man, or shaman. It 
contained several water-jars called tlilatl (black water), the contents of 
which were administered to children in bad health. The parents of children 
who benefited from the treatment bestowed a feast on the deity, whose idol 
was carried to the residence of the grateful father, where ceremonial dances 
and oblations were made before it. It was then thought that Ixtlilton 
descended to the courtyard to open fresh jars of pulque liquor provided for 
the feasters, and the entertainment concluded by an examination by the Aztec 
Æsculapius of such of the pulque jars dedicated to his service as stood in 
the courtyard for everyday use. Should these be found in an unclean 
condition, it was understood that the master of the house was a man of evil 
life, and he was presented by the priest with a mask to hide his face from 
his scoffing friends.

Omacatl
Omacatl was the Mexican god of festivity and joy. The name signifies Two 
Reeds. He was worshipped chiefly by bon-vivants and the rich, who celebrated 
him in splendid feasts and orgies. The idol of the deity was invariably 
placed in the chamber where these functions were to take place, and the 
Aztecs were known to regard it as a heinous offence if anything derogatory 
to the god were performed during the convivial ceremony, or if any omission 
were made from the prescribed form which these gatherings usually took. It 
was thought that if the host had been in any way remiss Omacatl would appear 
to the startled guests, and in tones of great severity upbraid him who had 
given the feast, intimating that he would regard him no longer as a 
worshipper and would henceforth abandon him. A terrible malady, the symptoms 
of which were akin to those of falling-sickness, would shortly afterwards 
seize the guests; but as such symptoms are not unlike those connected with 
acute indigestion and other gastric troubles, it is probable that the 
gourmets who paid homage to the god of good cheer may have been suffering 
from a too strenuous instead of a lukewarm worship of him. But the idea of 
communion which underlay so many of the Mexican rites undoubtedly entered 
into the worship of Omacatl, for prior to a banquet in his honour those who 
took part in it formed a great bone out of maize paste, pretending that it 
was one of the bones of the deity whose merry rites they were about to 
engage in. This they devoured, washing it down with great draughts of 
pulque. The idol of Omacatl was provided with a recess in the region of the 
stomach, and into this provisions were stuffed. He was represented as a 
squatting figure, painted black and white, crowned with a paper coronet, and 
hung with coloured paper. A flower-fringed cloak and sceptre were the other 
symbols of royalty worn by this Mexican Dionysus.

Opochtli
Opochtli (The Left-handed) was the god sacred to fishers and bird-catchers. 
At one period of Aztec history he must have been a deity of considerable 
consequence, since for generations the Aztecs were marsh-dwellers and 
depended for their daily food on the fish netted in the lakes and the birds 
snared in the reeds. They credited the god with the invention of the harpoon 
or trident for spearing fish and the fishing-rod and bird-net. The fishermen 
and bird-catchers of Mexico held on occasion a special feast in honour of 
Opochtli, at which a certain liquor called octli was consumed. A procession 
was afterwards formed, in which marched old people who had dedicated 
themselves to the worship of the god, probably because they could obtain no 
other means of subsistence than that afforded by the vocation of which he 
was tutelar and patron. He was represented, as a man painted black, his head 
decorated with the plumes of native wild birds, and crowned by a paper 
coronet in the shape of a rose. He was clad in green paper which fell to the 
knee, and was shod with white sandals. In his left hand he held a shield 
painted red, having in the centre a white flower with four petals placed 
crosswise, and in his right hand he held a sceptre in the form of a cup.

Yacatecutli
Yacatecutli was the patron of travellers of the merchant class, who 
worshipped him by piling their staves together and sprinkling on the heap 
blood from their noses and ears. The staff of the traveller was his symbol, 
to which prayer was made and ofFerings of flowers and incense tendered.

The Aztec Priesthood
The Aztec priesthood was a hierarchy in whose hands resided a goodly portion 
of the power of the upper classes est)ecially that connected with education 
and endowment. The mere fact that its members possessed the power of 
selecting victims for sacrifice must have been sufficient to place them in 
an almost unassailable position, and their prophetic utterances, founded 
upon the art of divination-so great a feature in the life of the Aztec 
people, who depended upon it from the cradle to the grave-probably assisted 
them in maintaining their hold upon the popular imagination. But withal the 
evidence of unbiased Spanish ecclesiastics, such as Sahagun, tends to show 
that they utilised their influence for good, and soundly instructed the 
people under their charge in the cardinal virtues; "in short," says the 
venerable friar, "to perform the duties plainly pointed out by natural 
religion."

Priestly Revenues
The establishment of the national religion was, as in the case of the 
mediæval Church in Europe, based upon a land tenure from which the priestly 
class derived a substantial though, considering their numbers, by no means 
inordinate revenue. The principal temples possessed lands which sufficed for 
the maintenance of the priests attached to them. There was, besides, a 
system of first-fruits fixed by law for the priesthood, the surplusage 
therefrom being distributed among the poor.

Education
Education was entirely conducted by the priesthood, which undertook the task 
in a manner highly creditable to it, when consideration is given to 
surrounding conditions. Education was, indeed, highly organised. It was 
divided into primary and secondary grades. Boys were instructed by priests, 
girls by holy women or "nuns." The secondary schools were called calmecac, 
and were devoted to the higher branches of education, the curriculum 
including the deciphering of the pinturas, or manuscripts, astrology and 
divination, with a wealth of religious instruction.

Orders of the Priesthood
At the head of the Aztec priesthood stood the Mexicatl Teohuatzin (Mexican 
Lord of Divine Matters). He had a seat on the emperor's council, and 
possessed power which was second only to the royal authority. Next in rank 
to him was the highpriest of Quetzalcoatl, who dwelt in almost entire 
seclusion, and who had authority over his own caste only. This office was in 
all probability a relic from "Toltec" times. The priests of Quetzalcoatl 
were called by name after their tutelar deity. The lesser grades included 
the Tlenamacac (Ordinary Priests), who were habited in black, and wore their 
hair long, covering it with a kind of mantilla. The lowest order was that of 
the Lamacazton (Little Priests), youths who were graduating in the priestly 
office.

An Exacting Ritual
The priesthood enjoyed no easy existence, but led an austere life of 
fasting, penance, and prayer, with constant observance of an arduous and 
exacting ritual, which embraced sacrifice, the upkeep of perpetual fires, 
the chanting of holy songs to the gods, dances, and the superintendence of 
the ever-recurring festivals. They were required to rise during the night to 
render praise, and to maintain themselves in a condition of absolute 
cleanliness by means of constant ablutions. We have seen that blood-
offering-the substitution of the part for the whole-was a common method of 
sacrifice, and in this the priests engaged personally on frequent occasions. 
If the caste did not spare the people it certainly did not spare itself, and 
its outlook was perhaps only a shade more gloomy and fanatical than that of 
the Spanish hierarchy which succeeded it in the land.


CHAPTER III: MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF THE ANCIENT MEXICANS
The Mexican Idea of the Creation
"IN the year and in the day of the clouds," writes Garcia in his Origin de 
los Indias, professing to furnish the reader with a translation of an 
original Mixtec picture-manuscript, "before ever were years or days, the 
world lay in darkness. All things were orderless, and a water covered the 
slime and ooze that the earth then was." This picture is common to almost 
all American creation-stories. [See the author's article on "American 
Creation-Myths" in the Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics, vol. iv.] The 
red man in general believed the habitable globe to have been created from 
the slime which arose above the primeval waters, and there can be no doubt 
that the Nahua shared this belief. We encounter in Nahua myth two beings of 
a bisexual nature, known to the Aztecs as Ometecutli-Omeciuatl (Lords of 
Duality), who were represented as the deities dominating the genesis of 
things, the beginning of the world. We have already become acquainted with 
them in Chapter II (see p. 104), but we may recapitulate. These beings, 
whose individual names were Tonacatecutli and Tonacaciuatl (Lord and Lady of 
our Flesh), occupy the first place in the calendar, a circumstance which 
makes it plain that they were regarded as responsible for the origin of all 
created things. They were invariably represented as being clothed in rich, 
variegated garments, symbolical of light. Tonacatecutli, the male principle 
of creation or world-generation, is often identified with the sun- or fire-
god, but there is no reason to consider him as symbolical of anything but 
the sky. The firmament is almost universally regarded by American aboriginal 
peoples as the male principle of the cosmos, in contradistinction to the 
earth, which they think of as possessing feminine attributes, and which is 
undoubtedly personified in this instance by Tonacaciuatl.

In North American Indian myths we find the Father Sky brooding upon the 
Mother Earth, just as in early Greek creation-story we see the elements 
uniting, the firmament impregnating the soil and rendering it fruitful. To 
the savage mind the growth of crops and vegetation proceeds as much from the 
sky as from the earth. Untutored man beholds the fecundation of the soil by 
rain, and, seeing in everything the expression of an individual and personal 
impulse, regards the genesis of vegetable growth as analogous to human 
origin. To him, then, the sky is the life-giving male principle, the 
fertilising seed of which descends in rain. The earth is the receptive 
element which hatches that with which the sky has impregnated her.

Ixtlilxochitl's Legend of the Creation
One of the most complete creation-stories in Mexican mythology is that given 
by the half-blood Indian author Ixtlilxochitl, who, we cannot doubt, 
received it directly from native sources. He states that the Toltecs 
credited a certain Tloque Nahuaque (Lord of All Existence) with the creation 
of the universe, the stars, mountains, and animals. At the same time he made 
the first man and woman, from whom all the inhabitants of the earth are 
descended. This "first earth" was destroyed by the "water-sun." At the 
commencement of the next epoch the Toltecs appeared, and after many 
wanderings settled in Huehue Tlapallan (Very Old Tlapallan). Then followed 
the second catastrophe, that of the "wind-sun." The remainder of the legend 
recounts how mighty earthquakes shook the world and destroyed the earth-
giants. These earth-giants (Quinames) were analogous to the Greek Titans, 
and were a source of great uneasiness to the Toltecs. In the opinion of the 
old historians they were descended from the races who inhabited the more 
northerly portion of Mexico.

Creation-Story of the Mixtecs
It will be well to return for a moment to the creation story of the Mixtecs, 
which, if emanating from a somewhat isolated people in the extreme south of 
the Mexican Empire, at least affords us a vivid picture of what a folk 
closely related to the Nahua race regarded as a veritable account of the 
creative process. When the earth had arisen from the primeval waters, one 
day the deer-god, who bore the surname Puma-Snake, and the beautiful deer-
goddess, or Jaguar-Snake, appeared. They had human form, and with their 
great knowledge (that is, with their magic) they raised a high cliff over 
the water, and built on it fine palaces for their dwelling. On the summit of 
this cliff they laid a copper axe with the edge upward, and on this edge the 
heavens rested. The palaces stood in Upper Mixteca, close to Apoala, and the 
cliff was called Place where the Heavens Stood. The gods lived happily 
together for many centuries, when it chanced that two little boys were born 
to them, beautiful of form and skilled and experienced in the arts. From the 
days of their birth they were named Wind-Nine-Snake (Viento de Neuve 
Culebras) and Wind-Nine-Cave (Viento de Neuve Cavernas). Much care was given 
to their education, and they possessed the knowledge of how to change 
themselves into an eagle or a snake, to make themselves invisible, and even 
to pass through solid bodies.

After a time these youthful gods decided to make an offering and a sacrifice 
to their ancestors. Taking incense vessels made of clay, they filled them 
with tobacco, to which they set fire, allowing it to smoulder. The smoke 
rose heavenward, and that was the first offering (to the gods). Then they 
made a garden with shrubs and flowers, trees and fruit-bearing plants, and 
sweet-scented herbs. Adjoining this they made a grass-grown level place (un 
prado), and equipped it with everything necessary for sacrifice. The pious 
brothers lived contentedly on this piece of ground, tilled it, burned 
tobacco, and with prayers, vows, and promises they supplicated their 
ancestors to let the light appear, to let the water collect in certain 
places and the earth be freed from its covering (water), for they had no 
more than that little garden for their subsistence. In order to strengthen 
their prayer they pierced their ears and their tongues with pointed knives 
of flint, and sprinkled the blood on the trees and plants with a brush of 
willow twigs.

The deer-gods had more sons and daughters, but there came a flood in which 
many of these perished. After the catastrophe was over the god who is called 
the Creator of All Things formed the heavens and the earth, and restored the 
human race.

Zapotec Creation Myth
Among the Zapotecs, a people related to the Mixtecs, we find a similar 
conception of the creative process. Cozaana is mentioned as the creator and 
maker of all beasts in the valuable Zapotec dictionary of Father Juan de 
Cordova, and Huichaana as the creator of men and fishes. Thus we have two 
separate creations for men and animals. Cozaana would appear to apply to the 
sun as the creator of all beasts, but, strangely enough, is alluded to in 
Cordova's dictionary as "procreatrix," whilst he is undoubtedly a male 
deity. Huichaana, the creator of men and fishes, is, on the other hand, 
alluded to as "water," or "the element of water, and "goddess of 
generation." She is certainly the Zapotec female part of the creative 
agency. In the Mixtec creation-myth we can see the actual creator and the 
first pair of tribal gods, who were also considered the progenitors of 
animals-to the savage equal inhabitants of the world with himself. The names 
of the brothers Nine-Snake and Nine-Cave undoubtedly allude to light and 
darkness, day and night. It may be that these deities are the same as 
Quetzalcoatl and Xolotl (the latter a Zapotec deity), who were regarded as 
twins. In some ways Quetzalcoatl was looked upon as a creator, and in the 
Mexican calendar followed the Father and Mother, or original sexual deities, 
being placed in the second section as the creator of the world and man.

The Mexican Noah
Flood-myths, curiously enough, are of more common occurrence among the Nahua 
and kindred peoples than creation-myths. The Abbé Brasseur de Bourbourg has 
translated one from the Codex Chimalpopoca, a work in Nahuatl dating from 
the latter part of the sixteenth century. It recounts the doings of the 
Mexican Noah and his wife as follows:

"And this year was that of Ce-calli, and on the first day all was lost. The 
mountain itself was submerged in the water, and the water remained tranquil 
for fifty-two springs.

"Now toward the close of the year Titlacahuan had forewarned the man named 
Nata and his wife Nena, saying, 'Make no more pulque, but straightway hollow 
out a large cypress, and enter it when in the month Tozoztli the water shall 
approach the sky.' They entered it, and when Titlacahuan had closed the door 
he said, 'Thou shalt eat but a single ear of maize) and thy wife but one 
also.'

"As soon as they had finished eating, they went forth, and the water was 
tranquil; for the log did not move any more; and opening it they saw many 
fish.

"Then they built a fire, rubbing together pieces of wood, and they roasted 
fish. The gods Citallinicue and Citallatonac, looking below, exclaimed, 
'Divine Lord, what means that fire below? Why do they thus smoke the 
heavens?'

"Straightway descended Titlacahuan-Tezcatlipoca, and commenced to scold, 
saying, 'What is this fire doing here?' And seizing the fishes he moulded 
their hinder parts and changed their heads, and they were at once 
transformed into dogs."

The Myth of the Seven Caverns
But other legends apart from the creation-stories of the world pure and 
simple deal with the origin of mankind. The Aztecs believed that the first 
men emerged from a place known as Chicomoztoc (The Seven Caverns), located 
north of Mexico. Various writers have seen in these mythic recesses the 
fabulous "seven cities of Cibola" and the Casas Grandes, ruins of extensive 
character in the valley of the river Gila, and so forth. But the allusion to 
the magical number seven in the myth demonstrates that the entire story is 
purely imaginary and possesses no basis of fact. A similar story occurs 
among the myths of the Kiche of Guatemala and the Peruvians.

The Sacrificed Princess
Coming to semi-historical times, we find a variety of legends connected with 
the early story of the city of Mexico. These for the most part are of a 
weird and gloomy character, and throw much light on the dark fanaticism of a 
people which could immolate its children on the altars of implacable gods. 
It is told how after the Aztecs had built the city of Mexico they raised an 
altar to their war-god Huitzilopochtli. In general the lives rendered to 
this most sanguinary of deities were those of prisoners of war, but in times 
of public calamity he demanded the sacrifice of the noblest in the land. On 
one occasion his oracle required that a royal princess should be offered on 
the high altar. The Aztec king, either possessing no daughters of his own or 
hesitating to sacrifice them, sent an embassy to the monarch of Colhuacan to 
ask for one of his daughters to become the symbolical mother of 
Huitzilopochtli. The King of Colhuacan, suspecting nothing amiss, and highly 
flattered at the distinction, delivered up the girl, who was escorted to 
Mexico, where she was sacrificed with much pomp, her skin being flayed off 
to clothe the priest who represented the deity in the festival. The unhappy 
father was invited to this hideous orgy, ostensibly to witness his 
daughter's deification. In the gloomy chambers of the war-god's temple he 
was at first unable to mark the trend of the horrid ritual. But, given a 
torch of copal-gum, he saw the officiating priest clothed in his daughter's 
skin, receiving the homage of the worshippers. Recognising her features, and 
demented with grief and horror, he fled from the temple, a broken man, to 
spend the remainder of his days in mourning for his murdered child.

The Fugitive Prince
One turns with relief from such a sanguinary tale to the consideration of 
the pleasing semi-legendary accounts of Ixtlilxochitl regarding the 
civilisation of Tezcuco, Mexico's neighbour and ally. We have seen in the 
sketch of Nahua history which has been given how the Tecpanecs overcame the 
Acolhuans of Tezcuco and slew their king about the year 108. Nezahualcoyotl 
(Fasting Coyote), the heir to the Tezcucan throne, beheld the butchery of 
his royal father from the shelter of a tree close by, and succeeded in 
making his escape from the invaders. His subsequent thrilling adventures 
have been compared with those of the Young Pretender after the collapse of 
the "Forty-five" resistance. He had not enjoyed many days of freedom when he 
was captured by those who had set out in pursuit of him, and, being haled 
back to his native city, was cast into prison. He found a friend in the 
governor of the place, who owed his position to the prince's late father, 
and by means of his assistance he succeeded in once more escaping from the 
hostile Tecpanecs. For aiding Nezahualcoyotl, however, the governor promptly 
paid the penalty of death. The royal family of Mexico interceded for the 
hunted youth, and he was permitted to find an asylum at the Aztec court, 
whence he later proceeded to his own city of Tczcuco, occupying apartments 
in the palace where his father had once dwelt. For eight years he remained 
there, existing unnoticed on the bounty of the Tecpanec chief who had 
usurped the throne of his ancestors.

Maxtla the Fierce
In course of time the original Tecpanec conqueror was gathered to his 
fathers, and was succeeded by his son Maxtla, a ruler who could ill brook 
the studious prince, who had journeyed to the capital of the Tecpanecs to do 
him homage. He refused Nezahualcoyotl's advances of friendship, and the 
latter was warned by a favourably disposed courtier to take refuge in 
flight. This advice he adopted, and returned to Tczcuco, where, however, 
Maxtla set a snare for his life. A function which took place in the evening 
afforded the tyrant his chance. But the prince's preceptor frustrated the 
conspiracy, by means of substituting for his charge a youth who strikingly 
resembled him. This second failure exasperated Maxtla so much that he sent a 
military force to Tezcuco, with orders to despatch Nezahualcoyotl without 
delay. But the same vigilant person who had guarded the prince so well 
before became apprised of his danger and advised him to fly. To this advice, 
however, Nezahualcoyotl refused to listen, and resolved to await the 
approach of his enemies.

A Romantic Escape
When they arrived he was engaged in the Mexican ball-game of tlachtli. With 
great politeness he requested them to enter and to partake of food. Whilst 
they refreshed themselves he betook himself to another room, but his action 
excited no surprise, as he could be seen through the open doorway by which 
the apart. ments communicated with each other. A huge censer, however, stood 
in the vestibule, and the clouds of incense which arose from it hid his 
movements from those who had been sent to slay him. Thus obscured, he 
succeeded in entering a subterranean passage which led to a large disused 
water-pipe, through which he crawled and made his escape.

A Thrilling Pursuit
For a season Nezahualcoyotl evaded capture by hiding in the hut of a zealous 
adherent. The hut was searched, but the pursuers neglected to look below a 
heap of maguey fibre used for making cloth, under which he lay concealed. 
Furious at his enemy's escape, Maxtla now ordered a rigorous search, and a 
regular battue of the country round Tezcuco was arranged. A large reward was 
offered for the capture of Nezahual coyotl dead or alive, along with a fair 
estate and the hand of a noble lady, and the unhappy prince was forced to 
seek safety in the mountainous country between Tezcuco and Tlascala. He 
became a wretched outcast, a pariah lurking in caves and woods, prowling 
about after nightfall in order to satisfy his hunger, and seldom having a 
whole night's rest, because of the vigilance of his enemies. Hotly pursued 
by them he was compelled to seek some curious place concealment in order to 
save himself. On one occasion he was hidden by some friendly soldiers inside 
a large drum, and on another he was concealed beneath some chia stalks by a 
girl who was engaged in reaping them. The loyalty of the Tezcucan peasantry 
to their hunted prince was extraordinary, and rather than betray his 
whereabouts to the creatures of Maxtla they on many occasions suffered 
torture, and even death itself At a time when his affairs appeared most 
gloomy, however, Nezahualcoyotl experienced a change of fortune. The 
tyrannous Maxtla had rendered himself highly unpopular by his many 
oppressions, and the people in the territories he. had annexed were by no 
means contented under his rule.

The Defeat of Maxtla
These malcontents decided to band themselves together to defy the tyrant, 
and offered the command of the force thus raised to Nezahualcoyotl. This he 
accepted, and the Tecpanec usurper was totally defeated in a general 
engagement. Rcstored to the throne of his fathers, Nezahualcoyotl allied 
himself with Mexico, and with the assistance of its monarch completely 
routed the remaining force of Maxtla, who was seized in the baths of 
Azcapozalco, haled forth and sacrificed, and his city destroyed.

The Solon of Anahuac
Nezahualcoyotl profited by the hard experiences he had undergone, and proved 
a wise and just ruler. The code of laws framed by him was an exceedingly 
drastic one, but so wise and enlightened was his rule that on the whole he 
deserves the title which has been conferred upon him of "the Solon of 
Anahuac." He generously encouraged the arts, and established a Council of 
Music, the purpose of which was to supervise artistic endeavour of every 
description. In Nezahualcoyotl Mexico found, in all probability, her 
greatest native poet. An ode of his on the mutability of life displays much 
nobility of thought, and strikingly recalls the sentiments expressed in the 
verses of Omar Khayyám.

Nezahualcoyotl's Theology
Nezahualcoyotl is said to have erected a temple to the Unknown God, and to 
have shown a marked reference for the worship of one deity. In one Whis 
poems he is credited with expressing the following exalted sentiments: "Let 
us aspire to that heaven where all is eternal, and corruption cannot come. 
The horrors of the tomb are the cradle of the sun, and the dark shadows of 
death arc brilliant lights for the stars." Unfortunately these ideas cannot 
be verified as the undoubted sentiments of the royal bard of Tezcuco, and we 
are regretfully forced to regard the attribution as spurious. We must come 
to such a conclusion with very real disappointment, as to discover an 
untutored and spontaneous belief in one god in the midst of surroundings so 
little congenial to its growth would have been exceedingly valuable from 
several points of view.

The Poet Prince
We find Nezahualcoyotl's later days stained by an act which was unworthy of 
such a great monarch and wise man. His eldest son, the heir to the crown, 
entered into an intrigue with one of his father's wives, and dedicated many 
passionate poems to her, to which she replied with equal ardour. The 
poetical correspondence was brought before the king, who prized the lady 
highly because of her beauty. Outraged in his most sacred feelings, 
Nezahualcoyotl had the youth arraigned before the High Court, which passed 
sentence of death upon him-a sentence which his father permitted to be 
carried out. After his son's execution he shut himself up in his palace for 
some months, and gave orders that the doors and windows of the unhappy young 
man's residence should be built up so that never again might its walls echo 
to the sound of a human voice.

The Queen with a Hundred Lovers
In his History of the Chichimeca Ixtlilxochitl tells the following gruesome 
tale regarding the dreadful fate of a favourite wife of Nezahualpilli, the 
son of Nezahualcoyotl: When Axaiacatzin, King of Mexico, and other lords 
sent their daughters to King Nezahualpilli, for him to choose one to be his 
queen and lawful wife, whose son might succeed to the inheritance, she who 
had the highest claims among them, for nobility of birth and rank, was 
Chachiuhnenetzin, the young daughter of the Mexican king. She had been 
brought up by the monarch in a separate palace, with great pomp, and with 
numerous attendants, as became the daughter of so great a monarch. The 
number of servants attached to her household exceeded two thousand. Young as 
she was, she was exceedingly artful and vicious; so that, finding herself 
alone, and seeing that her people feared her on account of her rank and 
importance, she began to give way to an unlimited indulgence of her power. 
Whenever she saw a young man who pleased her fancy she gave secret orders 
that he should be brought to her, and shortly afterwards he would be put to 
death. She would then order a statue or effigy of his person to be made, 
and, adorning it with rich clothing, gold, and jewellery, place it in the 
apartment in which she lived. The number of statues of those whom she thus 
sacrificed was so great as to almost fill the room. When the king came to 
visit her, and inquired respecting these statues, she answered that they 
were her gods; and he, knowing how strict the Mexicans were in the worship 
of their false deities, believed her. But, as no iniquity can be long 
committed with entire secrecy, she was finally found out in this manner: 
Three of the young men, for some reason or other, she had left alive. Their 
names were Chicuhcoatl, Huitzilimitzin, and Maxtla, one of whom was lord of 
Tesoyucan and one of the grandees of the kingdom, and the other two nobles 
of high rank. It happened that one day the king recognised on the apparel of 
one of these a very precious jewel which he had given to the queen; and 
although he had no fear of treason on her part it gave him some uneasiness. 
Proceeding to visit her that night, her attendants told him she was asleep, 
supposing that the king would then return, as he had done at other times. 
But the affair of the jewel made him insist on entering the chamber in which 
she slept; and, going to wake her, he found only a statue in the bed, 
adorned with her hair, and closely resembling her. Seeing this, and noticing 
that the attendants around were in much trepidation and alarm, the king 
called his guards, and, assembling all the people of the house, made a 
general search for the queen, who was shortly found at an entertainment with 
the three young lords, who were arrested with her. The king referred the 
case to the judges of his court, in order that they might make an inquiry 
into the matter and examine the parties implicated. These discovered many 
individuals, servants of the queen, who had in some way or other been 
accessory to her crimes-workmen who had been engaged in making and adorning 
the statues, others who had aided in introducing the young men into the 
palace, and others, again, who had put them to death and concealed their 
bodies. The case having been sufficiently investigated, the king despatched 
ambassadors to the rulers of Mexico and Tlacopan, giving them information of 
the event, and signifying the day on which the punishment of the queen and 
her accomplices was to take place; and he likewise sent through the empire 
to summon all the lords to bring their wives and their daughters, however 
young they might be, to be witnesses of a punishment which he designed for a 
great example. He also made a truce with all the enemies of the empire, in 
order that they might come freely to see it. The time having arrived, the 
number of people gathered together was so great that, large as was the city 
of Tezcuco, they could scarcely all find room in it. The execution took 
place publicly, in sight of the whole city. The queen was put to the 
garrotte (a method of strangling by means of a rope twisted round a stick), 
as well as her three gallants; and, from their being persons of high birth, 
their bodies were burned, together with the effigies before mentioned. The 
other parties who had been accessory to the crimes) who numbered more than 
two thousand persons, were also put to the garrotte, and burned in a pit 
made for the purpose in a ravine near a temple of the Idol of Adulterers. 
All applauded so severe and exemplary a punishment, except the Mexican 
lords, the relatives of the queen, who were much incensed at so public an 
example, and, although for the time they concealed their resentment, 
meditated future revenge. It was not without reason, says the chronicler, 
that the king experienced this disgrace in his household, since he was thus 
punished for an unworthy subterfuge made use of by his father to obtain his 
mother as a wife!

This Nezahualpilli, the successor of Nezahualcoyotl, was a monarch of 
scientific tastes, and, as Torquemada states, had a primitive observatory 
erected in his palace.

The Golden Age of Tezcuco
The period embraced by the life of this monarch and his predecessor may be 
regarded as the Golden Age of Tezcuco, and as semi-mythical. The palace of 
Nezahualcoyotl, according to the account of Ixtlilxochitl, extended east and 
west for 1234 yards, and for 978 yards from north to south. Enclosed by a 
high wall, it contained two large courts, one used as the municipal market-
place, whilst the other was surrounded by administrative offices. A great 
hall was set apart for the special use of poets and men of talent, who held 
symposiums under its classic roof, or engaged in controversy in the 
surrounding corridors. The chronicles of the kingdom were also kept in this 
portion of the palace. The private apartments of the monarch adjoined this 
College of Bards. They were gorgeous in the extreme, and their description 
rivals that of the fabled Toltec city of Tollan. Rare stones and beautifully 
coloured plaster mouldings alternated with wonderful tapestries of splendid 
feather-work to make an enchanting display of florid decoration, and the 
gardens which surrounded this marvellous edifice were delightful retreats, 
where the lofty cedar and cypress overhung sparkling fountains and luxurious 
baths. Fish darted hither and thither in the ponds, and the aviaries echoed 
to the songs of birds of wonderful plumage.

A Fairy Villa
According to Ixtlilxochitl, the king's villa of Tezcotzinco was a residence 
which for sheer beauty had no equal in Persian romance, or in those dream-
tales of Araby which in childhood we feel to be true, and in later life 
regretfully admit can only be known again by sailing the sea of Poesy or 
penetrating the mist-locked continent of Dream. The account which we have 
from the garrulous half-blood reminds us of the stately pleasure-dome 
decreed by Kubla Khan on the turbulent banks of the sacred Alph. A conical 
eminence was laid out in hanging gardens reached by an airy flight of five 
hundred and twenty marble steps. Gigantic walls contained an immense 
reservoir of water, in the midst of which was islanded a great rock carved 
with hieroglyphs describing the principal events in the reign of 
Nezahualcoyotl. In each of three other reservoirs stood a marble statue of a 
woman, symbolical of one of the three provinces of Tezcuco. These great 
basins supplied the gardens beneath with a perennial flow of water, so 
directed as to leap in cascades over artificial rockeries or meander among 
mossy retreats with refreshing whisper, watering the roots of odoriferous 
shrubs and flowers and winding in and out of the shadow of, the cypress 
woods. Here and there pavilions of marble arose over porphyry baths, the 
highly polished stone of which reflected the bodies of the bathers. The 
villa itself stood amidst a wilderness of stately cedars, which shielded it 
from the torrid heat of the Mexican sun. The architectural design of this 
delightful edifice was light and airy in the extreme, and the perfume of the 
surrounding gardens filled the spacious apartments with the delicious 
incense of nature. In this paradise the Tezcucan monarch sought in the 
company of his wives repose from the oppression of rule, and passed the lazy 
hours in gamesome sport and dance. The surrounding woods afforded him the 
pleasures of the chase, and art and nature combined to render his rural 
retreat a centre of pleasant recreation as well as of repose and 
refreshment.

Disillusionment
That some such palace existed on the spot in question it would be absurd to 
deny, as its stupendous pillars and remains still litter the terraces of 
Tezcotzinco. But, alas! we must not listen to the vapourings of the 
untrustworthy Ixtlilxochitl, who claims to have seen the place. It will be 
better to turn to a more modern authority, who visited the site about 
seventy-five years ago, and who has given perhaps the best account of it. He 
says:

"Fragments of pottery, broken pieces of obsidian knives and arrows, pieces 
of stucco, shattered terraces, and old walls were thickly dispersed over its 
whole surface. We soon found further advance on horseback impracticable, 
and, attaching our patient steeds to the nopal bushes, we followed our 
Indian guide on foot, scrambling upwards over rock and through tangled 
brushwood. On gaining the narrow ridge which connects the conical hill with 
one at the rear, we found the remains of a wall and causeway; and, a little 
higher, reached a recess, where, at the foot of a small precipice, overhung 
with Indian fig and grass, the rock had been wrought by hand into a flat 
surface of large dimensions. In this perpendicular wall of rock a carved 
Toltec calendar existed formerly; but the Indians, finding the place visited 
occasionally by foreigners from the capital, took it into their heads that 
there must be a silver vein there, and straightway set to work to find it, 
obliterating the sculpture, and driving a level beyond it into the hard rock 
for several yards. From this recess a few minutes' climb brought us to the 
summit of the hill. The sun was on the point of setting over the mountains 
on the other side of the valley, and the view spread beneath our feet was 
most glorious. The whole of the lake of Tezcuco, and the country and 
mountains on both sides, lay stretched before us.

"But, however disposed, we dare not stop long to gaze and admire, but, 
descending a little obliquely, soon came to the so-called bath, two singular 
basins, of perhaps two feet and a half diameter, cut into a bastion-like 
solid rock, projecting from the general outline of the hill, and surrounded 
by smooth carved seats and grooves, as we supposed-for I own the whole 
appearance of the locality was perfectly inexplicable to me. I have a 
suspicion that many of these horizontal planes and grooves were contrivances 
to aid their astronomical observations, one like that I have mentioned 
having been discovered by de Gama at Chapultepec.

"As to Montezuma's Bath, it might be his foot-bath if you will, but it would 
be a moral impossibility for any monarch of larger dimensions than Oberon to 
take a duck in it.

"The mountain bears the marks of human industry to its very apex, many of 
the blocks of porphyry of which it is composed being quarried into smooth 
horizontal planes. It is impossible to say at present what portion of the 
surface is artificial or not, such is the state of confusion obscrvable in 
every part.

"By what means nations unacquainted with the use iron constructed works of 
such a smooth polish, in rocks of such hardness, it is extremely difficult 
to say. Many think tools of mixed tin and copper were employed; others, that 
patient friction was one of the main means resorted to. Whatever may have 
been the real appropriation of these inexplicable ruins,or the epoch of 
their construction, there can be no doubt but the whole of this hill, which 
I should suppose rises five or six hundred feet above the level of the 
plain, was covered with artificial works of one kind or another. They are 
doubtless rather of Toltec than of Aztec origin, and perhaps with still more 
probability attributable to a people of an age yet more remote."

The Noble Tlascalan
As may be imagined regarding a community where human sacrifice was rife, 
tales concerning those who were consigned to this dreadful fate were 
abundant. Perhaps the most striking of these is that relating to the noble 
Tlascalan warrior Tlalhuicole, who was captured in combat by the troops of 
Montezuma. Less than a year before the Spaniards arrived in Mexico war broke 
out between the Huexotzincans and the Tlascalans, to the former of whom the 
Aztecs acted as allies. On the battlefield there was captured by guile a 
very valiant Tlascalan leader called Tlalhuicole, so renowned for his 
prowess that the mere mention of his name was generally sufficient to deter 
any Mexican hero from attempting his capture. He was brought to Mexico in a 
cage, and presented to the Emperor Montezuma, who, on learning of his name 
and renown, gave him his liberty and overwhelmed him with honours. He 
further granted him permission to return to his own country, a boon he had 
never before extended to any captive. But Tlalhuicole refused his freedom, 
and replied that he would prefer to be sacrificed to the gods, according to 
the usual custom. Montezuma, who had the highest regard for him) and prized 
his life more than any sacrifice, would not consent to his immolation. At 
this juncture war broke out between Mexico and the Tarascans, and Montezuma 
announced the appointment of Tlalhuicole as chief of the cxpeditionary 
force. He accepted the command, marched against the Tarascans, and, having 
totally defeated them, returned to Mexico laden with an enormous booty and 
crowds of slaves. The city rang with his triumph. The emperor begged him to 
become a Mexican citizen, but he replied that on no account would he prove a 
traitor to his country. Montezuma then once more offered him his liberty, 
but he strenuously refused to return to Tlascala, having undergone the 
disgrace of defeat and capture. He begged Montezuma to terminate his unhappy 
existence by sacrificing him to the gods, thus ending the dishonour he felt 
in living on after having undergone defeat, and at the same time fulfilling 
the highest aspiration of his life-to die the death of a warrior on the 
stone of combat. Montezuma, himself the noblest pattern of Aztec chivalry, 
touched at his request, could not but agree with him that he had chosen the 
most fitting fate for a hero, and ordered him to be chained to the stone of 
combat, the blood-stained temalacatl. The most renowned of the Aztec 
warriors were pitted against him, and the emperor himself graced the 
sanguinary tournament with his presence. Tlalhuicole bore himself in the 
combat like a lion, slew eight warriors of renown, and wounded more than 
twenty. But at last he fell, covered with wounds, and was haled by the 
exulting priests to the altar of the terrible war-god Huitzilopochtli, to 
whom his heart was offered up.

The Haunting Mothers
It is only occasionally that we encounter either the gods or supernatural 
beings of any description in Mexican myth. But occasionally we catch sight 
of such beings as the Ciuapipiltin (Honoured Women), the spirits of those 
women who had died in childbed, a death highly venerated by the Mexicans, 
who regarded the woman who perished thus as the equal of a warrior who met 
his fate in battle. Strangely enough, these spirits were actively 
malevolent, probably because the moon-goddess (who was also the deity of 
evil exhalations) was evil in her tendencies, and they were regarded as 
possessing an affinity to her. It was supposed that they afflicted infants 
with various diseases, and Mexican parents took every precaution not to 
permit their offspring out of doors on the days when their influence was 
believed to be strong. They were said to haunt the cross-roads, and even to 
enter the bodies of weakly people, the better to work their evil will. The 
insane were supposed to be under their especial visitation. Temples were 
raised at the cross-roads in order to placate them, and loaves of bread, 
shaped like butterflies, were dedicated to them. They were represented as 
having faces of a dead white, and as blanching their arms and hands with a 
white powder known as tisatl. Their eyebrows were of a golden hue, and their 
raiment was that of Mexican ladies of the ruling class.

The Return of Papantzin
One of the weirdest legends in Mexican tradition recounts how Papantzin, the 
sister of Montezuma II, returned from her tomb to prophesy to her royal 
brother concerning his doom and the fall of his empire at the hands of the 
Spaniards. On taking up the reins of government Montezuma had married this 
lady to one of his most illustrious servants, the governor of Tlatelulco, 
and after his death it would appear that she continued to exercise his 
almost vice regal functions and to reside in his palace. In course of time 
she died, and her obsequies were attended by the emperor in person, 
accompanied by the greatest personages of his court and kingdom. The body 
was interred in a subterranean vault of his own palace, in close proximity 
to the royal baths, which stood in a sequestered part of the extensive 
grounds surrounding the royal residence. The entrance to the vault was 
secured by a stone slab of moderate weight, and when the numerous ceremonies 
prescribed for the interment of a royal personage had been completed the 
emperor and his suite retired. At daylight next morning one of the royal 
children, a little girl of some six years of age, having gone into the 
garden to seek her governess, espied the Princess Papan standing near the 
baths. The princess, who was her aunt, called to her, and requested her to 
bring her governess to her. The child did as she was bid, but her governess, 
thinking that imagination had played her a trick, paid little attention to 
what she said. As the child persisted in her statement, the governess at 
last followed her into the garden, where she saw Papan sitting on one of the 
steps of the baths. The sight of the supposed dead princess filled the woman 
with such terror that she fell down in a swoon. The child then went to her 
mother's apartment, and detailed to her what had happened. She at once 
proceeded to the baths with two of her attendants, and at sight of Papan was 
also seized with affright. But the princess reassured her, and asked to be 
allowed to accompany her to her apartments, and that the entire affair 
should for the present be kept absolutely secret. Later in the day she sent 
for Tiçotzicatzin, her majordomo, and requested him to inform the emperor 
that she desired to speak with him immediately on matters of the greatest 
importance. The man, terrified, begged to be excused from the mission, and 
Papan then gave orders that her uncle Nezahualpilli, King of Tezcuco, should 
be communicated with. That monarch, on receiving her request that he should 
come to her, hastened to the palace. The princess begged him to see the 
emperor without loss of time and to entreat him to come to her at once. 
Montezuma heard his story with surprise mingled with doubt. Hastening to his 
sister, he cried as he approached her: "Is it indeed you, my sister, or some 
evil demon who has taken your likeness?" "It is I indeed, your Majesty," she 
replied. Montezuma and the exalted personages who accompanied him then 
seated themselves, and a hush of expectation fell upon all as they were 
addressed by the princess in the following words:

"Listen attentively to what I am about to relate to you. You have seen me 
dead, buried, and now behold me alive again. By the authority of our 
ancestors, my brother, I am returned from the dwellings of the dead to 
prophesy to you certain things of prime importance.

Papantzin's Story
"At the moment after death I found myself in a spacious valley, which 
appeared to have neither commencement nor end, and was surrounded by lofty 
mountains. Near the middle I came upon a road with many branching paths. By 
the side of the valley there flowed a river of considerable size, the waters 
of which ran with a loud noise. By the borders of this I saw a young man 
clothed in a long robe, fastened with a diamond, and shining like the sun, 
his visage bright as a star. On his forehead was a sign in the figure of a 
cross. He had wings, the feathers of which gave forth the most wonderful and 
glowing reflections and colours. His eyes were as emeralds, and his glance 
was modest. He was fair, of beautiful aspect and imposing presence. He took 
me by the hand and said: 'Come hither. It is not yet time for you to cross 
the river. You possess the love of God, which is greater than you know or 
can comprehend.' He then conducted me through the valley, where I espied 
many heads and bones of dead men. I then beheld a number of black folk, 
horned, and with the feet of deer. They were engaged in building a house, 
which was nearly completed. Turning toward the east for a space, I beheld on 
the waters of the river a vast number of ships manned by a great host of men 
dressed differently from ourselves. Their eyes were of a clear grey, their 
complexions ruddy, they carried banners and ensigns in their hands and wore 
helmets on their heads. They called themselves 'Sons of the Sun.' The youth 
who conducted me and caused me to see all these things said that it was not 
yet the will of the gods that I should cross the river, but that I was to be 
reserved to behold the future with my own eyes, and to enjoy the benefits of 
the faith which these strangers brought with them; that the bones I beheld 
on the plain were those of my countrymen who had died in ignorance of that 
faith, and had consequently suffered great torments; that the house being 
builded by the black folk was an edifice prepared for those who would fall 
in battle with the seafaring strangers whom I had seen; and that I was 
destined to return to my compatriots to tell them of the true faith, and to 
announce to them what I had seen that they might profit thereby."

Montezuma hearkened to these matters in silence, and felt greatly troubled. 
He left his sister's presence without a word, and, regaining his own 
apartments, plunged into melancholy thoughts.

Papantzin's resurrection is one of the best authenticated incidents in 
Mexican history, and it is a curious fact that on the arrival of the Spanish 
Conquistadores one of the first persons to embrace Christianity and receive 
baptism at their hands was the Princess Papan.


CHAPTER IV: THE MAYA RACE AND MYTHOLOGY
The Maya
It was to the Maya-the people who occupied the territory between the isthmus 
of Tehuantepec and Nicaragua-that the civilisation of Central America owed 
most. The language they spoke was quite distinct from the Nahuatl spoken by 
the Nahua of Mexico, and in many respects their customs and habits were 
widely different from those of the people of Anahuac. It will be remembered 
that the latter were the heirs of an older civilisation, that, indeed, they 
had entered the valley of Mexico as savages, and that practically all they 
knew of the arts of culture was taught them by the remnants of the people 
whom they dispossessed. It was not thus with the Maya. Their arts and 
industries were of their own invention, and bore the stamp of an origin of 
considerable antiquity. They were, indeed, the supreme intellectual race of 
America, and on their coming into contact with the Nahua that people 
assimilated sufficient of their culture to raise them several grades in the 
scale of civilisation.

Were the Maya Toltecs?
It has already been stated that many antiquarians see in the Maya those 
Toltecs who because of the inroads of barbarous tribes quitted their native 
land of Anahuac and journeyed southward to seek a new home in Chiapas and 
Yucatan. It would be idle to attempt to uphold or refute such a theory in 
the absolute dearth of positive evidence for or against it. The 
architectural remains of the older race of Anahuac do not bear any striking 
likeness to Maya forms, and if the mythologies of the two peoples are in 
some particulars alike, that may wellbe accounted for by their mutual 
adoption of deities and religious customs. On the other hand) it is 
distinctly noteworthy that the cult of the god Quetzalcoatl, which was 
regarded in Mexico as of alien origin, had a considerable vogue among the 
Maya and their allied races.

The Maya Kingdom
On the arrival of the Spaniards (after the celebrated march of Cortés from 
Mexico to Central America) the Maya were divided into a number of subsidiary 
states which remind us somewhat of the numerous little kingdoms of 
Palestine. That these had hived off from an original and considerably 
greater state there is good evidence to show, but internal dissension had 
played havoc with the polity of the central government of this empire, the 
disintegration of wh ch had occurred at a remote period. In the semi-
historical legends of this people we catch glimpses of a great kingdom, 
occasionally alluded to as the "Kingdom of the Great Snake," or the empire 
of Xibalba, realms which have been identified with the ruined city-centres 
of Palenque and Mitla. These identifications must be regarded with caution, 
but the work of excavation will doubtless sooner or later assist theorists 
in coming to conclusions which will admit of nodoubt. The sphere of Maya 
civilisation and influence is prettywell marked,and embracesthe peninsula of 
Yucatan, Chiapas, to the isthmus of Tehuantepec on the north, and the whole 
of Guatemala to the boundaries of the present republic of San Salvador. The 
true nucleus of Maya civilisation, however, must be looked for in that part 
of Chiapas which skirts the banks of the Usumacinta river and in the valleys 
of its tributaries. Here Maya art and architecture reached a height of 
splendour unknown elsewhere, and in this district, too, the strange Maya 
system of writing had its most skilful exponents. Although the arts and 
industries of the several districts inhabited by people of Maya race 
exhibited many superficial differences, these are so small as to make us 
certain of the fact that the various areas inhabited by Maya stock had all 
drawn their inspiration toward civilisation from one common nucleus, and had 
equally passed through a uniform civilisation and drawn sap from an original 
culture-centre.

The Maya Dialects
Perhaps the most effectual method of distinguishing thevarious branches of 
the Maya people from one another consists in dividing them into linguistic 
groups. The various dialects spoken by the folk of Maya, origin, although 
they exhibit some considerable difference, yet display strongly that 
affinity of construction and resemblance in root which go to prove that they 
all emanate from one common mother-tongue. In Chiapas the Maya tongue itself 
is the current dialect, whilst in Guatemala no less than twenty-four 
dialects are in use, the principal of which are the Quiche, or Kiche, the 
Kakchiquel, the Zutugil, Coxoh Chol, and Pipil. These dialects and the folk 
who speak them are sufficient to engage our attention, as in them are 
enshrined the most remarkable myths and legends of the race, and by the men 
who used them were the greatest acts in Maya history achieved.

Whence came the Maya?
Whence came these folk, then, who raised a civilisation by no means inferior 
to that of ancient Egypt, which, if it had had scope, would have rivalled in 
its achievements the glory of old Assyria? We cannot tell. The mystery of 
its entrance into the land is as deep as the mystery of the ancient forests 
which now bury the remnants of its mighty monuments and enclose its temples 
in impenetrable gloom. Generations of antiquarians have attempted to trace 
the origin of this race to Egypt, Phnicia, China, Burma. But the manifest 
traces of indigenous American origin are present in all its works, and the 
writers who have beheld in these likenesses to the art of Asiatic or African 
peoples have been grievously misled by superficial resemblances which could 
not have betrayed any one who had studied Maya affinities deeply.

Civilisation of the Maya
At the risk of repetition it is essential to point out that civilisation, 
which was a newly acquired thing with the Nahua peoples, was not so with the 
Maya. They were indisputably an older race, possessing institutions which 
bore the marks of generations of use, whereas the Nahua had only too 
obviously just entered into their heritage of law and order. When we first 
catch sight of the Maya kingdoms they are in the process of disintegration. 
Such strong young blood as the virile folk of Anahuac possessed did not flow 
in the veins of the people of Yucatan and Guatemala. They were to the Nahua 
much as the ancient Assyrians were to the hosts of Israel at the entrance of 
the latter into national existence. That there was a substratum of ethnical 
and cultural relationship, however, it would be impossible to deny. The 
institutions, architecture, habits, even the racial cast of thought of the 
two peoples, bore such a general resemblance as to show that many affinities 
of blood and cultural relationship existed between them. But it will not do 
to insist too strongly upon these. It may be argued with great probability 
that these relationships and likenesses exist because of the influence of 
Maya civilisation upon Mexican alone, or from the inheritance by both 
Mexican and Maya people of a still older culture of which we are ignorant, 
and the proofs of which lie buried below the forests of Guatemala or the 
sands of Yucatan.

The Zapotecs
The influence of the Maya upon the Nahua was a process of exceeding 
slowness. The peoples who divided them one from another were themselves 
benefited by carrying Maya culture into Anahuac, or rather it might be said 
that they constituted a sort of filter through which the southern 
civilisation reached the northern. These peoples were the Zapotecs, the 
Mixtecs, and the Kuikatecs, by far the most important of whom were the 
first-mentioncd. They partook of the nature and civilisation of both races, 
and were in effect a border people who took from and gave to both Maya and 
Nahua, much as the Jews absorbed and disseminated the cultures of Egypt and 
Assyria. They were, however, of Nahua race, but their speech bears the 
strongest marks of having borrowed extensively from the Maya vocabulary. For 
many generations these people wandered in a nomadic condition from Maya to 
Nahua territory, thus absorbing the customs, speech, and mythology of each.

The Huasteca
But we should be wrong if we thought that the Maya had never attempted to 
expand, and had never sought new homes for their surplus population. That 
they had is proved by an outlying tribe of Maya, the Huasteca, having 
settled at the mouth of the Panuco, river, on the north coast of Mexico. The 
presence of this curious ethnological island has of course given rise to all 
sorts of queer theories concerning Toltec relationship, whereas it simply 
intimates that before the era of Nahua expansion the Maya had attempted to 
colonise the country to the north of their territories, but that their 
efforts in this direction had been cut short by the influx of savage Nahua, 
against whom they found themselves unable to contend.

The Type of Maya Civilisation
Did the civilisation of the Maya differ, then, in type from that of the 
Nahua, or was it merely a larger expression of that in vogue in Anahuac? We 
may take it that the Nahua civilisation characterised the culture of Central 
America in its youth, whilst that of the Maya displayed it in its bloom, and 
perhaps in its senility. The difference was neither essential nor radical, 
but may be said to have arisen for the most part from climatic and kindred 
causes. The climate of Anahuac is dry and temperate, that of Yucatan and 
Guatemala is tropical, and we shall find even such religious conceptions of 
the two peoples as were drawn from a common source varying from this very 
cause, and coloured by differences in temperature and rainfall.

Maya History
Before entering upon a consideration of the art, architecture, or mythology 
of this strange and highly interesting people it will be necessary to 
provide the reader with a brief sketch of their history. Such notices of 
this as exist in English are few, and their value doubtful. For the earlier 
history of the people of Maya stock we depend almost whclly upon tradition 
and architectural remains. The net result of the evidence wrung from these 
is that the Maya civilisation was one and homogeneous, and that all the 
separate states must have at one period passed through a uniform condition 
of culture, to which they were all equally debtors, and that this is 
sufficient ground for the belief that all were at one time beneath the sway 
of one central power. For the later history we possess the writings of the 
Spanish fathers, but not in such profusion as in the case of Mexico. In fact 
the trustworthy original authors who deal with Maya history can almost be 
counted on the fingers of one hand. We are further confused in perusing 
these, and, indeed, throughout the study of Maya history, by discovering 
that many of the sites of Maya cities are designated by Nahua names. This is 
due to the fact that the Spanish conquerors were guided in their conquest of 
the Maya territories by Nahua, who naturally applied Nahuatlac designations 
to those sites of which the Spaniards asked the names. These appellations 
clung to the places in question; hence the confusion, and the blundering 
theories which would read in these place-names relics of Aztec conquest.

The Nucleus of Maya Power
As has been said, the nucleus of Maya power and culture is probably to be 
found in that part of Chiapas which slopes down from the steep Cordilleras. 
Here the ruined sites of Palenque, Piedras Negras, and Ocosingo are eloquent 
of that opulence of imagination and loftiness of conception which go hand in 
hand with an advanced culture. The temples and palaces of this region bear 
the stamp of a dignity and consciousness of metropolitan power which are 
scarcely to be mistaken, so broad, so free is their architectural 
conception, so full to overflowing the display of the desire to surpass. But 
upon the necessities of religion and central organisation alone was this 
architectural artistry lavished. Its dignities were not profaned by its 
application to mere domestic uses, for, unless what were obviously palaces 
are excepted, not a single exam ple of Maya domestic building has survived. 
This is of course accounted for by the circumstance that the people were 
sharply divided into the aristocratic and labouring classes, the first of 
which was closely identified with religion or kingship, and was housed in 
the ecclesiastical or royal buildings, whilst those of less exalted rank 
were perforce content with the shelter afforded by a hut built of perishable 
materials, the traces of which have long since passed away. The temples 
were, in fact, the nuclei of the towns, the centres round which the Maya 
communities were grouped, much in the same manner as the cities of Europe in 
the Middle Ages clustered and grew around the shadow of some vast cathedral 
or sheltering stronghold.

Early Race Movements
We shall leave the consideration of Maya tradition until we come to speak of 
Maya myth proper, and attempt to glean from the chaos of legend some 
veritable facts connected with Maya history. According to a manuscript of 
Kuikatec origin recently discovered, it is probable that a Nahua invasion of 
the Maya states of Chiapas and Tabasco took place about the ninth century, 
of our era, and we must for the present regard that as the starting-point of 
Maya history. The South-western portions of the Maya territory were agitated 
about the same time by race movements, which turned northward toward 
Tehuantepec, and, flowing through Guatemala, came to rest in Acalan, on the 
borders of Yucatan, retarded, probably, by the inhospitable and waterless 
condition of that country. This Nahua invasion probably had the effect of 
driving the more peaceful Maya from their northerly settlements and forcing 
them farther south. Indeed, evidence is not wanting to show that the warlike 
Nahua pursued the pacific Maya into their new retreats, and for a space left 
them but little peace. This struggle it was which finally resulted in the 
breaking up of the Maya civilisation, which even at that relatively remote 
period had reached its apogee, its several races separating into numerous 
city-states, which bore a close political resemblance to those of Italy on 
the downfall of Rome. At this period, probably, began the cleavage between 
the Maya of Yucatan and those of Guatemala, which finally resolved itself 
into such differences of speech, faith, and architecture as almost to 
constitute them different peoples.

The Settlement of Yucatan
As the Celts of Wales and Scotland were driven into the less hospitable 
regions of their respective countries by the inroads of the Saxons, so was 
one branch of the Maya forced to seek shelter in the almost desert wastes of 
Yucatan. There can be no doubt that the Maya did not take to this barren and 
waterless land of their own accord. Thrifty and possessed of high 
agricultural attainments, this people would view with concern a removal to a 
sphere so forbidding after the rich and easily developed country they had 
inhabited for generations. But the inexorable Nahua were behindl and they 
were a peaceful folk, unused to the horrors of savage warfare. So, taking 
their courage in both hands, they wandered into the desert. Everything 
points to a late occupation of Yucatan by the Maya, and architectural effort 
exhibits deterioration, evidenced in a high conventionality of design and 
excess of ornamentation. Evidences of Nahua influence also are not wanting, 
a fact which is eloquent of the later period of contact which is known to 
have occurred between the peoples, and which alone is almost sufficient to 
fix the date of the settlement of the Maya in Yucatan. It must not be 
thought that the Maya in Yucatan formed one homogeneous state recognising a 
central authority. On the contrary, as is often the case with colonists) the 
several Maya bands of immigrants formed themselves into different states or 
kingdoms, each having its own separate traditions. It is thus a matter of 
the highest difficulty to so collate and criticise these traditions as to 
construct a history of the Maya race in Yucatan. As may be supposed, we find 
the various city-sites founded by divine beings who play a more or less 
important part in the Maya pantheon. Kukulcan, for example, is the first 
king of Mayapan, whilst Itzamna figures as the founder of the state of 
Itzamal. The gods were the spiritual leaders of these bands of Maya, just as 
Jehovah was the spiritual leader and guide of the Israelites in the desert. 
One is therefore not surprised to find in the Popol Vuh, the saga of the 
Kiche-Maya of Guatemala, that the god Tohil (The Rumbler) guided them to the 
site of the first Kiche city. Some writers on the subject appear to think 
that the incidents in such migration myths, especially the tutelage and 
guidance of the tribes by gods and the descriptions of desert scenery which 
they contain, suffice to stamp them as mere native versions of the Book of 
Exodus, or at the best myths sophisticated by missionary influence. The 
truth is that the conditions of migration undergone by the Maya were similar 
to those described in the Scriptures, and by no means merely reflect the 
Bible story, as short-sighted collators of both aver.

The Septs of Yucatan
The priest-kings of Mayapan, who claimed descent from Kukulcan or 
Quetzalcoatl, soon raised their state into a position of prominence among 
the surrounding cities. Those who had founded Chichen-Itza, and who were 
known as Itzaes, were, on the other hand, a caste of warriors who do not 
appear to have cherished the priestly function with such assiduity. The 
rulers of the Itzaes, who were known as the Tutul Xius, seem to have come, 
according to their traditions, from the western Maya states, perhaps from 
Nonohualco in Tabasco. Arriving from thence at the southern cxtremity of 
Yucatan, they founded the city of Ziyan Caan, on Lake Bacalar, which had a 
period of prosperity for at least a couple of generations. At the expiry of 
that period for some unaccountable reason they migrated northward, perhaps 
because at that particular time the incidence of power was shifting toward 
Northern Yucatan, and took up their abode in Chichen- Itza, eventually the 
sacred city of the Maya, which they founded.

The Cocomes
But they were not destined to remain undisturbed in their new sphere. The 
Cocomes of Mayapan, when at the height of their power, viewed with disfavour 
the settlement of the Tutul Xius. After it had flourished for a period of 
about 120 years it was overthrown by the Cocomes, who resolved it into a 
dependency, permitting the governors and a certain number of the people to 
depart elsewhere.

Flight of the Tutul Xius
Thus expelled, the Tutul Xius fled southward, whence they had oriainally 
come, and settled in Poton-chan or Champoton, where they reigned for nearly 
300 years. From this new centre, with the aid or Nahua mercenaries, they 
commenced an extension of territory northward, and entered into diplomatic 
relations with the heads of the other Maya states. It was at this time that 
they built Uxmal, and their power became so extensive that they reconquered 
the territory they had lost to the Cocomes. This on the whole appears to 
have been a period when the arts flourished under an enlightened policy, 
which knew how to make and keep friendly relations with surrounding states, 
and the splendid network of roads with which the country was covered and the 
many evidences of architectural excellence go to prove that the race had had 
leisure to achieve much in art and works of utility. Thus the city of 
Chichen-Itza was linked up with the island of Cozumel by a highway whereon 
thousands of pilgrims plodded to the temples of the gods of wind and 
moisture. From Itzamal, too, roads branched in every direction, in order 
that the people should have every facility for reaching the chief shrine of 
the country situated there. But the hand of the Cocomes was heavy upon the 
other Maya states which were tributary to, them. As in the Yucatan of to-
day, where the wretched henequen-picker leads the life of a veritable slave, 
a crushing system of helotage obtained. The Cocomes made heavy demands upon 
the Tutul Xius, who in their turn sweated the hapless folk under their sway 
past the bounds of human endurance. As in all tottering civilisations, the 
feeling of responsibility among the upper classes became dormant, and they 
abandoned themselves to the pleasures of life without thought of the morrow. 
Morality ceased to be regarded as a virtue, and rottenness was at the core 
of Maya life. Discontent quickly spread on every hand.

The Revolution In Mayapan
The sequel was, naturally, revolution. Ground down by the tyranny of a 
dissolute oligarchy, the subject states rose in revolt. The Cocomes 
surrounded themselves by Nahua mercenaries, who succeeded in beating off the 
first wave of revolt, led by the king or regulus or Uxmal, who was defeated, 
and whose people in their turn rose against him, a circumstance which ended 
in the abandonment of the city of Uxmal. Once more were the Tutul Xius 
forced to go on pilgrimage, and this time they founded the city of Mani, a 
mere shadow of the splendour of Uxmal and Chichen.

Hunac Eel
If the aristocracy of the Cocomcs was composed of weaklings, its ruler was 
made of sterner stuff. Hunac Eel, who exercised royal sway over this people, 
and held in subjection the lesser principalities of Yucatan, was not only a 
tyrant of harsh and vindictive temperament, but a statesman of judgement and 
experience, who courted the assistance of the neighbouring Nahua, whom he 
employed in his campaign against the new assailant of his absolutism, the 
ruler of Chichen-Itza. Mustering a mighty host of his vassals, Hunac Eel 
marched against the devoted city whose prince had dared to challenge his 
supremacy, and succeeded in inflicting a crushing defeat upon its 
inhabitants. But apparently the state was permitted to remain under the 
sovereignty of its native princes. The revolt, however, merely smouldered, 
and in the kingdom of Mayapan itself, the territory of the Cocomes, the 
fires of revolution began to blaze. This state of things continued for 
nearly a century. Then the crash came. The enemies of the Cocomes effected a 
junction. The people of Chichen Itza joined hands with the Tutul Xius, who 
had sought refuge in the central highlands of Yucatan and those city-states 
which clustered around the mother-city of Mayapan. A fierce concerted attack 
was made , beneath which the power of the Cocomes crumpled up completely. 
Not one stone was left standing upon another by the exasperated allies, who 
thus avenged the helotage of nearly 300 years. To this event the date 1436 
is assigned, but, like most dates in Maya history, considerable uncertainty 
must be attached to it.

The Last of the Cocomes
Only a remnant of the Cocomes survived. They had been absent in Nahua 
territory, attempting to raise fresh troops for the defence of Mayapan. 
These the victors spared, and they finally settled in Zotuta, in the centre 
of Yucatan, a region of almost impenetrable forest.

It would not appear that the city of Chichen-Itza, the prince of which was 
ever the head and front of the rebellion against the Cocomes, proficed in 
any way from the fall of the suzerain power. On the contrary, tradition has 
it that the town was abandoned by its inhabitants, and left to crumble into 
the ruinous state in which the Spaniards found it on their entrance into the 
country. The probability is that its people quitted it because of the 
repeated attacks made upon it by the Cocomes, who saw in it the chief 
obstacle to their universal sway; and this is supported by tradition, which 
tells that a prince of Chichen-Itza) worn out with conflict and internecine 
strife, left it to seek the cradle of the Maya race in the land of the 
setting sun. Indeed, it is further stated that this prince founded the city 
of Peten-Itza, on the lake of Peten, in Guatemala

The Maya Peoples of Guatemala
When the Maya peoples of Guatemala, the Kiches and. the Kakchiquels, first 
made their way into that territory, they probably found there a race of Maya 
origin of a type more advanced and possessed of more ancient traditions than 
themselves. By their connection with this folk they greatly benefited in the 
direction o. artistic achievement as well as in the industrial arts. 
Concerning these people we have a large body of tradition in the Popol Vuh, 
a native chronicle, the contents of which will be fully dealt with in the 
chapter relating to the Maya myths and legendary matter. We cannot deal with 
it as a veritable historical document, but there is little doubt that a 
basis of fact exists behind the tradition it contains. The difference 
between the language of these people and that of their brethren in Yucatan 
was, as has been said, one of dialect only, and a like slight distinction is 
found in their mythology, caused, doubtless, by the incidence of local 
conditions, and resulting in part from the difference between a level and 
comparatively waterless land and one of a semimountainous character covered 
with thick forests. We shall note further differences when we come to 
examine the art and architecture of the Maya race, and to compare those of 
its two most distinctive branches.

The Maya Tulan
It was to the city of Tulan, probably in Tabasco, that the Maya of Guatemala 
referred as being the starting point of all their migrations. We must not 
confound this place with the Tollan of the Mexican traditions. It is 
possible that the name may in both cases be derived from a root meaning a 
place from which a tribe set forth, a starting-place, but geographical 
connection there is none. From here Nima-Kiche, the great Kiche, started on 
his migration to the mountains, accompanied by his three brothers. Tulan, 
says the Popol Vuh, had been a place of misfortune to man, for he had 
suffered much from cold and hunger, and, as at the building of Babel, his 
speech was so confounded that the first four Kiches and their wives were 
unable to comprehend one another. Of course this is a native myth created to 
account for the difference in dialect between the various branches of the 
Maya folk, and can scarcely have any foundation in fact, as the change in 
dialect would be a very gradual process. The brothers, we are told, divided 
the land so that one received the districts of Mames and Pocomams, another 
Verapaz, and the third Chiapas, while Nima-Kiche obtained the country of the 
Kiches, Kakchiquels, and Tzutuhils. It would be extremely difficult to say 
whether or not this tradition rests on any veritable historical basis. If 
so, it refers to a period anterior to the Nahua irruption, for the districts 
alluded to as occupied by these tribes were not so divided among them at the 
coming of the Spaniards.

Doubtful Dynasties
As with the earlier dynasties of Egypt, considerable doubt surrounds the 
history of the early Kiche monarchs. Indeed, a period of such uncertainty 
occurs that even the number of kings who reigned is lost in the hopeless 
confusion of varying estimates. From this chaos emerge the facts that the 
Kiche monarchs held the supreme power among the peoples of Guatemala, that 
they were the contemporaries of the rulers of Mexico city, and that they 
were often elected from among the princes of the subject states. Acxopil, 
the successor of Nima-Kiche, invested his second son with the government of 
the Kakchiquels, and placed his youngest son over the Tzutuhils, whilst to 
his eldest son he left the throne of the Kiches. Icutemal, his eldest son, 
on succeeding his father, gifted the kingdom of Kakchiquel to his eldest 
son, displacing his own brother and thus mortally affronting him. The 
struggle which ensued lasted for generations, embittered the relations 
between these two branches of the Maya in Guatemala, and undermined their 
joint strength. Nahua mercenaries were employed in the struggle on both 
sides, and these introduced many of the uglinesses of Nahua life into Maya 
existence.

The Coming of the Spaniards
This condition of things lasted up to the time of the coming of the 
Spaniards. The Kakchiquels dated the commencement of a new chronology from 
the episode of the defeat of Cay Hun-Apu by them in 1492. They may have 
saved themselves the trouble; for the time was at hand when the calendars of 
their race were to be closed, and its records written in another script by 
another people. One by one, and chiefly by reason of their insane policy of 
allying themselves with the invader against their own kin, the old kingdoms 
of Guatemala fell as spoil to the daring Conquistadores, and their people 
passed beneath the yoke of Spain-bondsmen who were to beget countless 
generations of slaves.

The Riddle of Ancient Maya Writing
What may possibly be the most valuable sources of Maya history are, alas! 
sealed to us at present. We allude to the native Maya manuscripts and 
inscriptions, the writing of which cannot be deciphered by present-day 
scholars. Some of the old Spanish friars who lived in the times which 
directly succeeded the settlement of the country by the white man were able 
to read and even to write this script, but unfortunately they regarded it 
either as an invention of the Father of Evil or, as it was a native system, 
as a thing of no value. In a few generations all knowledge of how to 
decipher it was totally lost, and it remains to the modern world almost as a 
sealed book, although science has lavished all its wonderful machinery of 
logic and deduction upon it, and men of unquestioned ability have dedicated 
their lives to the problem of unravelling what must be regarded as one of 
the greatest and most mysterious riddles of which mankind ever attempted the 
solution.

The romance of the discovery of the key to the Egyptian hieroglyphic system 
of writing is well known. For centuries the symbols displayed upon the 
temples and monuments of the Nile country were so many meaningless pictures 
and signs to the learned folk of Europe, until the discovery of the Rosetta 
stone a hundred years ago made their elucidation possible. This stone bore 
the same inscription in Greek, demotic, and hieroglyphics, and so the 
discovery of the "alphabet" of the hidden script became a comparatively easy 
task. But Central America has no Rosetta stone, nor is it possible that such 
an aid to research can ever be found. Indeed, such "keys" as have been 
discovered or brought forward by scientists have proved for the most part 
unavailing.

The Maya Manuscripts
The principal Maya manuscripts which have escaped the ravages of time are 
the codices in the libraries of Dresden, Paris, and Madrid. These are known 
as the Codex Perezianus preserved in the Bibliothèque Nationale at Paris: 
the Dresden Codex, long regarded as an Aztec manuscript, and the Troano 
Codex, so called from one of its owners, Señor Tro y Ortolano, found at 
Madrid in 1865. These manuscripts deal principally with Maya mythology, but 
as they cannot be deciphered with any degree of accuracy they do not greatly 
assist our knowledge of the subject.

The System of the Writing
The "Tablet of the Cross" gives a good idea of the general appearance of the 
writing system of the ancient peoples of Central America. The style varies 
somewhat in most of the manuscripts and inscriptions, but it is generally 
admitted that all of the systems employed sprang originally from one common 
source. The square figures which appear as a tangle of faces and objects are 
said to be calculiform, or pebble shaped, a not inappropriate description, 
and it is known from ancient Spanish manuscripts that they were read from 
top to bottom, and two columns at a time. The Maya tongue, like all native 
American languages, was one which, in order to express an idea, gathered a 
whole phrase into a single word, and it has been thought that the several 
symbols or parts in each square or sketch go to make up such a compound 
expression.

The first key (so called) to the hicroglyphs of Central America was that of 
Bishop Landa, who about 1576 attempted to set down the Maya alphabet from 
native sources. He was highly unpopular with the natives, whose literary 
treasures he had almost completely destroyed, and who in revenge 
deliberately misled him as to the true significance of the various symbols.

The first real step toward reading the Maya writing was made in 1876 by Léon 
de Rosny, a French student of American antiquities, who succeeded in 
interpreting the signs which denote the four cardinal points. As has been 
the case in so many discoveries of importance the significance of these 
signs was simultaneously discovered by Professor Cyrus Thomas in America. In 
two of these four signs was found the symbol which meant "sun," almost, as 
de Rosny acknowledged, as a matter of course. However, the Maya word for" 
sun" (kin) also denotes "day," and it was later proved that this sign was 
also used with the latter meaning. The discovery of the sign stimulated 
further research to a great degree, and from the material now at their 
disposal Drs. Förstemann and Schellhas of Berlin were successful in 
discovering the sign for the moon and that for the Maya month of twenty 
days.

Clever Elucidations
In 1887 Dr. Seler discovered the sign for night (akbal), and in 1894 
Forstemann unriddled the symbols for "beginning" and "end." These are two 
heads, the first of which has the sign akbal, just mentioned, for an eye. 
Now akbal means, as well as "night," "the beginning of the month," and below 
the face which contains it can be seen footsteps, or spots which resemble 
their outline, signifying a forward movement. The sign in the second head 
means "seventh," which in Maya also signifies "the end." From the frequent 
contrast of these terms there can be little doubt that' their meaning is as 
stated.

"Union" is denoted by the sting of a rattlesnake, the coils of that reptile 
signifying to the Maya the idea of tying together. in contrast to this sign 
is the figure next to it, which represents a knife, and means "division" or 
"cutting." An important "letter" is the hand, which often occurs in both 
manuscripts and inscriptions. It is drawn sometimes in the act of grasping, 
with the thumb bent forward, and sometimes as pointing in a certain 
direction. The first seems to denote a tying together or joining, like the 
rattlesnake symbol, and the second Förstemann believes to represent a lapse 
of time. That it may represent futurity occurs as a more likely conjecture 
to the present writer.

The figure denoting the spring equinox was traced because of its obvious 
representation of a cloud from which three streams of water are falling upon 
the earth. The square at the top represents heaven. The obsidian knife 
underneath denotes a division or period of time cut off, as it were, from 
other periods of the year. That the sign means "spring " is verified by its 
position among the other signs of the seasons.

The sign for "week" was discovered by reason of its almost constant 
accompaniment of the sign for the number thirteen, the number of days in the 
Maya sacred week. The symbol of the bird's feather indicates the plural, and 
when affixed to certain signs signifies that the object indicated is 
multiplied. A bird's feather, when one thinks of it, is one of the most 
fitting symbols provided by nature to designate the plural, if the number of 
shoots on both sides of the stem are taken as meaning "many " or "two."

Water is depicted by the figure of a serpent, which reptile typifies the 
undulating nature of the element. The sign entitled "the sacrificial victim" 
is of deep human interest. The first portion of the symbol is the death-
bird, and the second shows a crouching and beaten captive, ready to be 
immolated to one of the terrible Maya deities whose sanguinary religion 
demanded human sacrifice. The drawing which means "the day of the new year," 
in the month Ceh, was unriddled by the following means: The sign in the 
upper left-hand corner denotes the word "sun" or "day," that in the upper 
right-hand corner is the sign for "year." In the lower right-hand corner is 
the sign for "division," and in the lower left. hand the sign for the Maya 
month Ceh, already known from the native calendars.

From its accompaniment of a figure known to be a deity of the four cardinal 
points, whence all American tribes believed the wind to come, the symbol 
entitled "wind" has been determined.

Methods of Study
The method employed by those engaged in the elucidation of these hieroglyphs 
is typical of modern science. The various signs and symbols are literally 
"worn out" by a process of indefatigable examination. For hours the student 
sits staring at a symbol, drinking in every detail, however infinitesimal, 
until the drawing and all its parts are wholly and separately photographed 
upon the tablets of his memory. He then compares the several portions of the 
symbol with similar portions in other signs the value of which is known. 
From these he may obtain a clue to the meaning of the whole. Thus proceeding 
from the known to the unknown) he advances logically toward a complete 
elucidation of all the hieroglyphs depicted in the various manuscripts and 
inscriptions.

The method by which Dr. Seler discovered the hieroglyphs or symbols relating 
to the various gods of the Maya was both simple and ingenious. He says: "The 
way in which this was accomplished is strikingly simple. It amounts 
essentially to that which in ordinary life we call 'memory of persons,' and 
follows almost naturally from a careful study of the manuscripts. For, by 
frequently looking tentatively at the representations, one learns by degrees 
to recognise promptly similar and familiar figures of gods by the 
characteristic impression they make as a whole or by certain details, and 
the same is true of the accompanying hieroglyphs."

The Maya Numeral System
If Bishop Landa was badly hoaxed regarding the alphabet of the Maya, he was 
successful in discovering and handing down their numeral system, which was 
on a very much higher basis than that of many civilised peoples, being, for 
exam le more practical and more fully evolved than that of ancient Rome. 
This system employed four signs altogether, the point for unity, a 
horizontal stroke for the number 5, and two signs for 20 and 0. Yet from 
these simple elements the Maya produced a method of computation which is 
perhaps as ingenious as anything which has ever been accomplished in the 
history of mathematics. In the Maya arithmetical system, as in ours, it is 
the position of the sign that gives it its value. The figures were placed in 
a vertical line, and one of them was employed as a decimal multiplier. The 
lowest figure of the column had the arithmetical value which it represented. 
The figures which appeared in the second, fourth, and each following place 
had twenty times the value of the preceding figures, while figures in the 
third place had eighteen times the value of those in the second place. This 
system admits of computation up to millions, and is one of the surest signs 
of Maya culture.

Much controversy has raged round the exact nature of the Maya hieroglyphs. 
Were they understood by the Indians themselves as representing ideas or 
merely pictures, or did they convey a given sound to the reader, as does our 
alphabet? To some extent controversy upon the point is futile, as those of 
the Spanish clergy who were able to learn the writing from the native Maya 
have confirmed its phonetic character, so that in reality each symbol must 
have conveyed a sound or sounds to the reader, not merely an idea or a 
picture. Recent research has amply proved this, so that the full elucidation 
of the long and painful puzzle on which so much learning and patience have 
been lavished may perhaps be at hand.

Mythology of the Maya
The Maya pantheon, although it bears a strong resemblance to that of the 
Nahua, differs from it in so many respects that it is easy to observe that 
at one period it must have been absolutely free from all Nahua influence. We 
may, then, provisionally accept the theory that at some relatively distant 
period the mythologies of the Nahua and Maya were influenced from one common 
centre, if they were not originally identical, but that later the inclusion 
in the cognate but divided systems of local deities and the superimposition 
of the deities and rites of immigrant peoples had caused such 
differentiation as to render somewhat vague the original likeness between 
them. In the Mexican mythology we have as a key-note the custom of human 
sacrifice. It has often been stated as exhibiting the superior status in 
civilisation of the Maya that their religion was free from the revolting 
practices which characterised the Nahua faith. This, however, is totally 
erroneous. Although the Maya were not nearly so prone to the practice of 
human sacrifice as were the Nahua, they frequently engaged in it, and the 
pictures which have been drawn of their bloodless offerings must not lead us 
to believe that they never indulged in this rite. It is known, for example, 
that they sacrificed maidens to the water-god at the period of the spring 
florescence, by casting them into a deep pool, where they were drowned.

Quetzalcoatl among the Maya
One of the most obvious of the mythological relationships between the Maya 
and Nahua is exhibited in the Maya cult of the god Quetzalcoatl. It seems to 
have been a general belief in Mexico that Quetzalcoatl was a god foreign to 
the soil; or at least relatively aboriginal to his rival Tezcatlipoca, if 
not to the Nahua themselves. It is amusing to see it stated by authorities 
of the highest standing that his worship was free from bloodshed. But it 
does not appear whether the sanguinary rites connected with the name of 
Quetzalcoatl in Mexico were undertaken by his priests of their own accord or 
at the instigation and pressure of the pontiff of Huitzilopochtli, under 
whose jurisdiction they were. The designation by which Quetzalcoatl was 
known to the Maya was Kukulcan, which signifies "Feathered Serpent," and is 
exactly translated by his Mexican name. In Guatemala he was called Gucumatz, 
which word is also identical in Kiche with his other native appellations. 
But the Kukulcan of the Maya appears to be dissimilar from Quetzalcoatl in 
several of his attributes. The difference in climate would probably account 
for most of these. In Mexico Quetzalcoatl, as we have seen, was not only the 
Man of the Sun, but the original wind-god of the country. The Kukulcan of 
the Maya has more the attributes of a thunder-god. In the tropical climate 
of Yucatan and Guatemala the sun at midday appears to draw the clouds around 
it in serpentine shapes. From these emanate thunder and lightning and the 
fertilising rain, so that Kukulcan would appear to have appealed to the Maya 
more as a god of the sky who wielded the thunderbolts than a god of the 
atmosphere proper like Quetzalcoatl, though several of the stelæ in Yucatan 
represent Kukulcan as he is portrayed in Mexico, with wind issuing from his 
mouth.

An Alphabet of Gods
The principal sources of our knowledge of the Maya deities are the Dresden, 
Madrid, and Paris codices alluded to previously, all of which contain many 
pictorial representations of the various members of the Maya pantheon. Of 
the very names of some of these gods we are so ignorant, and so difficult is 
the process of affixing to them the traditional names which are left to us 
as those of the Maya gods, that Dr. Paul Schellhas, a German student of Maya 
antiquities, has proposed that the figures of deities appearing in the Maya 
codiccs or manuscripts should be provisionally indicated by the letters of 
the alphabet. The figures of gods which thus occur are fifteen in number, 
and therefore take the letters of the alphabet from A to P, the letter J 
being omitted.

Difficulties of Comparison
Unluckily the accounts of Spanish authors concerning Maya mythology do not 
agree with the representations of the gods delineated in the codices. That 
the three codices have a mythology in common is certain. Again, great 
difficulty is found in comparing the deities of the codices with those 
represented by the carved and stucco bas-reliefs of the Maya region. It will 
thus be seen that very considerable difficulties beset the student in this 
mythological sphere. So few data have yet been collected regarding the Maya 
mythology that to dogmatise upon any subject connected with it would indeed 
be rash. But much has been accomplished in the past few decades, and 
evidence is slowly but surely accumulating from which sound conclusions can 
be drawn.

The Conflict between Light and Darkness
We witness in the Maya mythology a dualism almost as complete as that of 
ancient Persia-the conflict between light and darkness. Opposing each other 
we behold on the one hand the deities of the sun, the gods of warmth and 
light, of civilisation and the joy of life, and on the other the deities of 
darksome death, of night, gloom, and fear. From these primal conceptions of 
light and darkness all the mythologic forms of the Maya are evolved. When we 
catch the first recorded glimpses of Maya belief we recognise that at the 
period when it came under the purview of Europeans the gods of darkness were 
in the ascendant and a deep pessimism had spread over Maya thought and 
theology. Its joyful side was subordinated to the worship gloomy beings, the 
deities of death and hell, and if the cult or light was attended with such 
touching fidelity it was because the benign agencies who were worshipped in 
connection with it had promised not to desert mankind altogether, but to 
return at some future indefinite period and resume their sway of radiance 
and peace.

The Calendar
Like that of the Nahua, the Maya mythology was based almost entirely upon 
the calendar, which in its astronomic significance and duration was 
identical with that of the Mexicans. The ritual year of twenty "weeks " of 
thirteen days each was divided into four quarters, each of these being under 
the auspices of a different quarter of the heavens. Each "week" was under 
the supervision of a particular deity, as will be seen when we come to deal 
separately with the various gods.

Traditional Knowledge of the Gods
The heavenly bodies had important representation in the Maya pantheon. In 
Yucatan the sun-god was known as Kinich-ahau (Lord of the Face of the Sun). 
He was identified with the Fire-bird, or Arara, and was thus called Kinich-
Kakmo (Fire-bird; lit. Sun-bird). He was also the presiding genius of the 
north.

Itzamna, one of the most important of the Maya deities, was a moon-god, the 
father of gods and men. In him was typified the decay and recurrence of life 
in nature. His name was derived from the words he was supposed to have given 
to men regarding himself: "Itz en caan, itz en muyal" ("I am the dew of the 
heaven, I am the dew of the clouds "). He was tutelar deity of the west.

Chac, the rain-god, is the possessor of an elongated nose, not unlike the 
proboscis of a tapir, which of course is the spout whence comes the rain 
which he blows over the earth. He is one of the best represented gods on 
both manuscripts and monuments, and presides over the east. The black god 
Ekchuah was the god of merchants and cacao-planters. He is represented in 
the manuscripts several times.

Ix ch'el was the goddess of medicine, and Ix chebel yax was identified by 
the priest Hernandez with the Virgin Mary. There were also several deities, 
or rather genii, called Bacabs, who were the upholders of the heavens in the 
four quarters of the sky. The names of these were Kan, Muluc, Ix, and Cauac, 
representing the east, north, west, and south. Their symbolic colours were 
yellow, white, black, and red respectively. The corresponded in some degree 
to the four variants of the Mexican rain-god Tlaloc, for many of the 
American races believed that rain, the fertiliser of the soil, emanated from 
the four points of the compass. We shall find still other deities when we 
come to discuss the Popol Vuh, the saga-book of the Kiche, but it is 
difficult to say how far these were connected with the deities of the Maya 
of Yucatan, concerning whom we have little traditional knowledge, and it is 
better to deal with them separately, pointing out resemblances where these 
appear to exist.

Maya Polytheism
On the whole the Maya do not seem to have been burdened with an extensive 
pantheon, as were the Nahua, and their polytheism appears to have been of a 
limited character. Although they possessed a number of divinities, these 
were in a great measure only different forms of one and the same divine 
powerprobably localised forms of it. The various Maya tribes worshipped 
similar gods under different names. They recognised divine unity in the god 
Hunabku, who was invisible and supreme, but he does not bulk largely in 
their mythology, any more than does the universal All-Father in other early 
faiths. The sun is the great deity in Maya religion, and the myths which 
tell of the origin of the Maya people are purely solar. As the sun comes 
from the east, so the hero-gods who bring with them culture and 
enlightenment have an oriental origin. As Votan, as Kabil, the "Red Hand " 
who initiates the people into the arts of writing and architecture, these 
gods are civilising men of the sun as surely as is Quetzalcoatl.

The Bat-God
A sinister figure, the prince of the Maya legions of darkness, is the bat-
god, Zotzilaha Chimalman, who dwelt in the "House of Bats," a gruesome 
cavern on the way to the abodes of darkness and death. He is undoubtedly a 
relic of cave-worship pure and simple. "The Maya" says an old chronicler, 
"have an immoderate fear of death, and they seem to have given it a figure 
peculiarly repulsive." We shall find this deity alluded to in the Popol Vuh, 
under the name Camazotz, in close proximity to the Lords of Death and Hell, 
attempting to bar the journey of the hero-gods across these dreary realms. 
He is frequently met with on the Copan reliefs, and a Maya clan, the Ah-
zotzils, were called by his name. They were of Kakchiquel origin, and he was 
probably their totem.

Modern Research
We must now turn to the question of what modern research has done to 
elucidate the character of the various Maya deities. We have already seen 
that they have been provisionally named by the letters of the alphabet until 
such proof is forthcoming as will identify them with the traditional gods of 
the Maya, and we will now briefly examine what is known concerning them 
under their temporary designations.

God A
In the Dresden and other codices god A is represented as a figure with 
exposed vertebrx and skull-like countenance, with the marks of corruption on 
his body, and displaying every sign of mortality. On his head he wears a 
snail-symbol, the Aztec sign of birth, perhaps to typify the connection 
between birth and death. He also wears a pair of cross-bones. The hieroglyph 
which accompanies his figure represents a corpse's head with closed eyes, a 
skull, and a sacrificial knife. His symbol is that for the calendar day 
Cimi, which means death. He presides over the west, the home of the dead, 
the region toward which they invariably depart with the setting sun. That he 
is a death-god there can be no doubt, but of his name we are ignorant. He is 
probably identical with the Aztec god of death and hell, Mictlan, and is 
perhaps one of those Lords of Death and Hell who invite the heroes to the 
celebrated game of ball in the Kiche Popol Vuh, and hold them prisoners in 
their gloomy realm.

God B
God B is the deity who appears most frequently in the manuscripts. He has a 
long, truncated nose, like that of a tapir, and we find in him every sign of 
a grod of the elements. He walks the waters, wields fiery torches, and seats 
himself on the cruciform tree of the four winds which appears so frequently 
in American myth. He is evidently a culture-god or hero, as he is seen 
planting maize carrying tools, and going on a journey, a fact which 
establishes his solar connection. He is, in fact, Kukulcan or Quetzalcoatl, 
and on examining him we feel that at least there can be no doubt concerning 
his identity.

God C
Concerning god C matter is lacking, but he is evidently a god of the pole-
star, as in one of the codices he is surrounded by planetary signs and wears 
a nimbus of rays.

God D
God D is almost certainly a moon-god. He is represented as an aged man, with 
sunken cheeks and wrinkled forehead on which hangs the sign for night. His 
hieroglyph is surrounded by dots, to represent a starry sky, and is followed 
by the number 20, to show the duration of the moon. Like most moon deities 
he is connected with birth, for occasionally he wears the snail, symbol of 
parturition, on his head. It is probable that he is Itzamna, one of the 
greatest of Maya gods, who was regarded as the universal life-giver, and was 
probably of very ancient origin.

God E, The Maize-God
God E is another deity whom we have no difficulty in identifying. He wears 
the leafed car of maize as his head-dress. In fact, his head has been 
evolved out of the conventional drawings of the ear of maize, so we may say 
at once without any difficulty that he is a maize-god pure and simple, and a 
parallel with the Aztec maize-god Centeotl. Brinton calls this god Ghanan, 
and Schellhas thinks he may be identical with a deity Yurn Kaax, whose name 
means "Lord of the Harvest Fields."

God F
A close resemblance can be noticed between gods F and A, and it is thought 
that the latter resembles the Aztec Xipe, the god of human sacrifice. He is 
adorned with the same black lines running over the face and body, typifying 
gaping death-wounds.

God G, The Sun-God
In G we may be sure that we have found a sun-god par excellence. His 
hieroglyph is the sun-sign, kin. But we must be careful not to confound him 
with deities like Quetzalcoatl or Kukulcan. He is, like the Mexican Totec, 
the sun itself, and not the Man of the Sun, the civilising agent, who leaves 
his bright abode to dwell with man and introduce him to the arts of cultured 
existence. He is the luminary himself, whose only acceptable food is human 
blood, and who must be fed full with this terrible fare or perish, dragging 
the world of men with him into a fathomless abyss of gloom. We need not be 
surprised, therefore, to see god G occasionally wearing the symbols of 
death.

God H
God H would seem to have some relationship to the serpent, but what it may 
be is obscure, and no certain identification can be made.

Goddess I
I is a water-goddess, an old woman with wrinkled brown body and claw-like 
feet, wearing on her head a grisly snake twisted into a knot, to typify the 
serpent-like nature of water. She holds in her hands an earthenware pot from 
which water flows. We cannot say that she resembles the Mexican water-
goddess, Chalchihuitlicue, wife of Tlaloc, who was in most respects a deity 
of a beneficent character. I seems a personification or water in its more 
dreadful aspect of floods and waterspouts, as it must inevitably have 
appeared to the people of the more torrid regions of Central America, and 
that she was regarded as an agent of death is shown from her occasionally 
wearing the cross-bones of the death-god.

God K, "The God with the Ornamented Nose"
God K is scientifically known as "the god with the ornamented nose," and is 
probably closely related to god B. Concerning him no two authorities are at 
one, some regarding him as a storm-god, whose proboscis, like that of 
Kukulcan, is intended to represent the blast of the tempest. But we observe 
certain stellar signs in con. nection with K which would go to prove that he 
is, indeed, one of the Quetzalcoatl group. His features are constantly to be 
met with on the gateways and corners of the ruined shrines of Central 
America, and have led many "antiquarians " to believe in the existence of an 
elephant-headed god, whereas his trunk-like snout is merely a funnel through 
which he emitted the ales over which he had dominion, as a careful study of 
the pinturas shows, the wind being depicted issuing from the snout in 
question. At the same time, the snout may have been modelled on that of the 
tapir. "If the rain-god Chac is distinguished in the Maya manuscript by a 
peculiarly long nose curving over the mouth, and if in the other forms of 
the rain-god, to which, as it seems, the name of Balon Zacab belongs, the 
nose widens out and sends out shoots, I believe that the tapir which was 
employed identically with Chac, the Maya rain-god, furnished the model," 
says Dr. Seler. Is K, then, the same as Chac? Chac bears every sign of 
affinity with the Mexican rain-god Tlaloc, whose face was evolved from the 
coils of two snakes, and also some resemblance to the snouted features of B 
and K. But, again, the Mexican pictures of Quetzalcoatl are not at all like 
those of Tlaloc, so that there can be no affinity between Tlaloc and K. 
Therefore if the Mexican Tlaloc and the Maya Chac be identical, and Tlaloc 
differs from Quetzalcoatl, who in turn is identical with B and K, it is 
clear that Chac has nothing to do with K.

God L, The Old Black God
God L Dr. Schcllhas has designated "the Old Black God," from the 
circumstance that he is depicted as an old man with sunken face and 
toothless gums, the upper, or sometimes the lower, part of his features 
being covered with black paint. He is represented in the Dresden MS. only. 
Professor Cyrus Thomas, of New York, thinks that he is the god Ekchuah, who 
is traditionally described as black, but Schellhas fits this designation to 
god M. The more probable theory is that of Förstemann, who sees in L the god 
Votan, who is identical with the Aztec earth-god, Tepeyollotl. Both deities 
have similar face markings, and their dark hue is perhaps symbolical of the 
subterranean places where they were supposed to dwell.

God M, The Travellers' God
God M is a veritable black god, with reddish lips. On his head he bears a 
roped package resembling the loads carried by the Maya porter class, and he 
is found in violent opposition with F, the enemy of all who wander into the 
unknown wastes. A god of this description has been handed down by tradition 
under the name of Ekchuah, and his blackness is probably symbolical of the 
black or deeply bronzed skin of the porter class among the natives of 
Central America, who are constantly exposed to the sun. He would appear to 
be a parallel to the Aztec Yacatecutli, god of travelling merchants or 
chapmcn.

God N, The God of Unlucky Days
God N is identified by Schellhas with the demon Uayayab, who presided over 
the five unlucky days which it will be recollected came at the end of the 
Mexican and Maya year. He was known to the Maya as "He by whom the year is 
poisoned." After modelling his image in clay they carried it out of their 
villages, so that his baneful influence might not dwell therein.

Goddess O
Goddess O is represented as an old woman engaged in the avocation of 
spinning, and is probably a goddess of the domestic virtues, the tutelar of 
married females.

God P, The Frog,God
God P is shown with the body and fins of a frog on a blue background, 
evidently intended to represent water. Like all other frog-gods he is, of 
course, a deity of water, probably in its agricultural significance. We find 
him sowing seed and making furrows, and when we remember the important part 
played by frog deities in the agriculture of Anahuac we should have no 
difficulty in classing him with these. Seler asserts his identity with 
Kukulcan, but no reason except the circumstance of his being a rain-god can 
be advanced to establish the identity. He wears the year-sign on his head, 
probably with a seasonal reference.

Maya Architecture
It was in the wonderful architectural system which it developed without 
outside aid that the Maya people most individually expressed itself. As has 
been said, those buildings which still remain, and which have excited the 
admiration of generations of archxologists, are principally confined to 
examples of ecclesiastical and governmental architecture, the dwellings of 
the common people consisting merely of the flimsiest of wattle-and-daub 
structures, which would fall to pieces shortly after they were abandoned.

Buried in dense forests or mouldering on the sunexposed plains of Yucatan, 
Honduras, and Guatemala, the cities which boasted these edifices are for the 
most part situated away from modern trade routes, and are not a little 
difficult to come at. It is in Yucatan, the old home of the Cocomes and 
Tutul Xius, that the most perfect specimens of' Maya architecture are to be 
found, especially as regards its later development, and here, too, it may be 
witnessed in its decadent phase.

Methods of Building
The Maya buildings were almost always erected upon a mound or ku, either 
natural or artificial, generally the latter. In this we discover affinities 
with the Mexican teocalli type. Often these kus stood alone, without any 
superincumbent building save a small altar to prove their relation to the 
temple type of Anahuac. The typical Maya temple was built on a series of 
earth terraces arranged in exact parallel order, the buildings themselves 
forming the sides of a square. The mounds are generally concealed by plaster 
or faced with stone, the variety employed being usually a hard sandstone, of 
which the Maya had a good supply in the quarries of Chiapas and Honduras. 
Moderate in weight, the difficulty of transport was easily overcome, whilst 
large blocks could be readily quarried. It will thus be seen that the Maya 
had no substantial difficulties to surmount in connection with building the 
large edifices and temples they raised, except, perhaps, the lack of metal 
tools to shape and carve and quarry the stone which they used. And although 
they exhibit considerable ingenuity in such architectural methods as they 
employed, they were still surprisingly ignorant of some of the first 
essentials and principles of the art.

No Knowledge of the Arch
For example, they were totally ignorant of the principles upon which the 
arch is constructed. This difficulty they overcame by making each course of 
masonry overhang the one beneath it, after the method employed by a boy with 
a box of bricks, who finds that he can only make "doorways" by this means, 
or by the simple expedient-also employed by the Maya-of placing a slab 
horizontally upon two upright pillars. In consequence it will readily be 
seen that the superimposition of a second story upon such an insecure 
foundation was scarcely to be thought of, and that such support for the roof 
as towered above the doorway would necessarily require to be of the most 
substantial description. Indeed, this portion of the building often appears 
to be more than half the size of the rest of the edifice. This space gave 
the Maya builders a splendid chance for mural decoration, and it must be 
said they readily seized it and made the most of it, ornamental fagades 
being perhaps the most typical features in the relics of Maya architecture.

Pyramidal Structures
But the Maya possessed another type of building which permitted or their 
raising more than one story. This was the pyramidal type, or which many 
examples remain. The first story was built in the usual manner, and the 
second was raised by increasing the height of the mound at the back of the 
building until it was upon a level with the roof-another device well known 
to the boy with the box of bricks. In the centre of the space thus made 
another story could be erected, which was entered by a staircase outside the 
building. Hampered by their inability to build to any appreciable height, 
the Maya architects made up for the deficiency by constructing edifices of 
considerable length and breadth, the squat appearance of which is 
counterbalanced by the beautiful mural decoration of the sides and façade.

Definiteness of Design
He would be a merely superficial observer who would form the conclusion that 
these specimens of an architecture spontaneously evolved were put together 
without survey, design, or previous calculation. That as much thought 
entered into their construction as is lavished upon his work by a modern 
architect is proved by the manner in which the carved stones fit into one 
another. It would be absurd to suppose that these tremendous fgades 
bristling with scores of intricate designs could have been first placed in 
position and subsequently laden with the bas-reliefs they exhibit. It is 
plain that they were previously worked apart and separately from one entire 
design. Thus we see that the highest capabilities of the architect were 
essential in a measure to the erection of these imposing structures.

Architectural Districts
Although the mason-craft of the Maya peoples was essentially similar in all 
the regions populated by its various tribes and offshoots, there existed in 
the several localities occupied by them certain differences in construction 
and ornamentation which would almost justify us in dividing them into 
separate architectural spheres. In Chiapas, for example, we find the bas-
relief predominant, whether in stone or stucco. In Honduras we find a 
stiffness of design which implies an older type of architecture, along with 
caryatides and memorial pillars of human shape. In Guatemala, again, we find 
traces of the employment of wood. As the civilisation of the Maya cannot be 
well comprehended without some knowledge of their architecture, and as that 
art was unquestionably their national forte and the thing which most sharply 
distinguished them from the semisavage peoples that surrounded them, it will 
be well to consider it for a space as regards its better-known individual 
examples.

Fascination of the Subject
He would indeed be dull of imagination and of spirit who could enter into 
the consideration of such a subject as this without experiencing some thrill 
from the mystery which surrounds it. Although familiarised with the study of 
the Maya antiquities by reason of many years of close acquaintance with it, 
the author cannot approach the theme without a feeling of the most intense 
awe. We are considering the memorials of a race isolated for countless 
thousands of years from the rest of humanity-a race which by itself evolved 
a civilisation in every respect capable of comparison with those of ancient 
Egypt or Assyria. In these impenetrable forests and sun-baked plains mighty 
works were raised which tell of a culture of a lofty type. We are aware that 
the people who reared them entered into religious and perhaps pliflosophical 
considerations their interpretations of which place them upon a level with 
the most enlightened races of antiquity; but we have only stepped upon the 
margin of Maya history. What dread secrets, what scenes of orgic splendour 
have those carven walls witnessed? What solemn priestly conclave, what 
magnificence of rite, what marvels of initiation, have these forest temples 
known? These things we shall never learn. They are hidden from us in a gloom 
as palpable as that of the tree-encircled depths in which we find these 
shattered works of a once powerful hierarchy.

Mysterious Palenque
One of the most famous of these ancient centres of priestly domination is 
Palenque, situated in the modern state of Chiapas. This city was first 
brought into notice by Don José Calderon in 1774, when he discovered no less 
than eighteen palaces, twenty great buildings, and a hundred and sixty 
houses, which proves that in his day the primeval forest had not made such 
inroads upon the remaining buildings as it has during the past few 
generations. There is good evidence besides this that Palenque was standing 
at the time of Cortés' conquest of Yucatan. And here it will be well at once 
to dispel any conception the reader may have formed concerning the vast 
antiquity of these cities and the structures they contain. The very oldest 
of them cannot be of a date anterior to the thirteenth century, and few 
Americanists of repute would admit such an antiquity for them. There may be 
remains of a fragmentary nature here and there in Central America which are 
relatively more ancient. But no temple or edifice which remains standing can 
claim a greater antiquity.

Palenque is built in the form of an amphitheatre, and nestles on the lowest 
slopes of the Cordilleras. Standing on the central pyramid, the eye is met 
by a ring of ruined palaces and temples raised upon artificial terraces. Of 
these the principal and most imposing is the Palace, a pile reared upon a 
single platform, forming an irregular quadrilateral, with a double gallery 
on the cast, north, and west sides, surrounding an inner structure with a 
similar gallery and two courtyards. It is evident that there was little 
system or plan observed in the construction of this edifice, an unusual 
circumstance in Maya architecture. The dwelling apartments were situated on 
the southern side of the structure, and here there is absolute confusion, 
for buildings of all sorts and sizes jostle each other, and are reared on 
different levels.

Our interest is perhaps at first excited by three subterrancous apartments 
down a flight of gloomy steps. Here are -to be found three great stone 
tables, the edges of which are fretted with sculptured symbols. That these 
were altars admits of little doubt, although some visitors have not 
hesitated to call them dining tables! These constitute only one of the many 
puzzles in this building of 228 feet frontage, with a depth of 180 feet, 
which at the same time is only about 25 feet high!

On the north side of the Palace pyramid the façade of the Palace has 
crumbled into complete ruin, but some evidences of an entrance are still 
noticeable. There were probably fourteen doorways in all in the frontage, 
with a width of about 9 feet each, the piers of which were covered with 
figures in bas-relief. The inside of the galleries is also covered at 
intervals with similar designs, or medallions, many of which are probably 
representations of priests or priestesses who once dwelt within the classic 
shades and practised strange rites in the worship of gods long since 
forgotten. One of these is of a woman with delicate features and high-bred 
countenance, and the frame or rim surrounding it is decorated in a manner 
recalling the Louis XV style.

The east gallery is 114 feet long, the north 185 feet, and the west 102 
feet, so that, as remarked above, a lack of symmetry is apparent. The great 
court is reached by a Mayan arch which leads on to a staircase, on each side 
of which grotesque human figures of the Maya type are sculptured. Whom they 
are intended to portray or what rite they are engaged in it would indeed be 
difficult to say. That they are priests may be hazarded, for they appear to 
be dressed in the ecclesiastical maxtli (girdle), and ont seems to be 
decorated with the beads seen in the pictures of the death-god. Moreover, 
they are mitred.

The courtyard is exceedingly irregular in shape. To the south side is a 
small building which has assisted our knowledge of Maya mural decoration; 
especially valuable is the handsome frieze with which it is adorned, on 
which we observe the rather familiar feathered serpent (Kukulcan or 
Quetzalcoatl). Everywhere we notice the flat Maya head-a racial type, 
perhaps brought about by deformation of the cranium in youth. One of the 
most important parts of the Palace from an architectural point of view is 
the east front of the inner wing, which is perhaps the best preserved, and 
exhibits the most luxurious ornamentation. Two roofed galleries supported by 
six pillars covered with bas-reliefs are reached by a staircase on which 
hieroglyphic signs still remain. The reliefs in cement are still faintly to 
be discerned on the pillars, and must have been of- great beauty. They 
represent mythological characters in various attitudes. Above, seven 
enormous heads frown on the explorer in grim menace. The effect of the 
entire faqade is rich in the extreme, even in ruin, and from it we can 
obtain a faint idea of the splendours of this wonderful civilisation.

An Architectural Curiosity
One of the few towers to be seen among the ruins of Maya architecture stands 
at Palenque. It is square in shape and three stories in height, with sloping 
roof, and is not unlike the belfry of some little English village church.

The building we have been describing, although traditionally known as a 
"palace," was undoubtedly a great monastery or ecclesiastical habitation. 
Indeed, the entire city of Palenque was solely a priestly centre, a place of 
pilgrimage. The bas-reliefs with their representations of priests and 
acolytes prove this, as does the absence of warlike or monarchical subjects.

The Temple of Inscriptions
The Temple of Inscriptions, perched on an eminence some 40 feet high, is the 
largest edifice in Palenque. It has a façade 74 feet long by 25 feet deep, 
composed of a great gallery which runs along the entire front of the fane. 
The building has been named from the inscriptions with which certain 
flagstones in the central apartment are covered. Three other temples occupy 
a piece of rising ground close by. These are the Temple of the Sun, closely 
akin in type to many Japanese temple buildings; the Temple of the Cross, in 
which a wonderful altar-piece was discovered; and the Temple of the Cross 
No. II. In the Temple of the Cross the inscribed altar gave its name to the 
building. In the central slab is a cross of the American pattern, its roots 
springing from the hideous head of the goddess Chicomecohuatl, the Earth-
mother, or her Maya equivalent. Its branches stretch to where on the right 
and left stand two figures, evidently those of a priest and acolyte, 
performing some mysterious rite. On the apex of the tree is placed the 
sacred turkey, or "Emerald Fowl," to which offerings of maize paste are 
made. The whole is surrounded by inscriptions.

Aké and Itzamal
Thirty miles east of Merida lies Aké, the colossal and primeval ruins of 
which speak of early Maya occupation. Here are pyramids, tennis-courts, and 
gigantic pillars which once supported immense gallerics, all in a state of 
advanced ruin. Chief among these is the great pyramid and gallery, a mighty 
staircase rising toward lofty pillars, and somewhat reminiscent of 
Stonehenge. For what purpose it was constructed is quite unknown.

The House of Darkness
One ruin, tradition calls "The House of Darkness." Here no light enters save 
that which filters in by the open doorway. The vaulted roof is lost in a 
lofty gloom. So truly have the huge blocks of which the building is composed 
been laid that not even a needle could be inserted between them. The whole 
is coated with a hard plaster or cement

The Palace of Owls
The Knuc (Palace of Owls), where a beautiful frieze of diamond-shaped stones 
intermingling with spheres may be observed, is noteworthy. All here is 
undoubtedly of the first Yucatec era, the time when the Maya first overran 
the country.

At Itzamal the chief object of interest is the great pyramid of Kinich-Kakmo 
(The Sun's Face with Fiery Rays), the base of which covers an area of nearly 
650 square feet. To this shrine thousands were wont to come in times of 
panic or famine, and from the summit, where was housed the glittering idol, 
the smoke of sacrifice ascended to the cloudless sky, whilst a multitude of 
white-robed priests and augurs chanted and prophesied. To the south of this 
mighty pile stand the ruins of the Ppapp-Hol-Chac (The House of Heads and 
Lightnings), the abode of the chief priest.

Itzamna's Fane
At Itzamal, too, stood one of the chief temples of the great god Itzamna, 
the legendary founder of the Maya mpire. Standing on a lofty pyramid, four 
roads radiated from it, leading to Tabasco, Guatemala, and Chiapas; and here 
they brought the halt, the maimed, and the blind, aye, even the dead, for 
succour and resurrection, such faith had they in the mighty power of Kab-ul 
(The Miraculous Hand), as they designated the deity. The fourth road ran to 
the sacred isle of Cozumel, where first the men of Spain found the Maya 
cross, and supposed it to prove that St. Thomas had discovered the American 
continent in early times, and had converted the natives to a Christianity 
which had become debased.

Bearded Gods
To the west arose another pyramid, on the summit of which was built the 
palace of Hunpictok (The Commander-in-chief of Eight Thousand Flints), in 
allusion, probably, to the god of lightning, Hurakan, whose gigantic face, 
once dominating the basement wall, has now disappeared. This face possessed 
huge mustachios, appendages unknown to the Maya race; and, indeed, we arc 
struck with the frequency with which Mexican and Mayan gods and heroes are 
adorned with beards and other hirsute ornaments both on the monuments and in 
the manuscripts. Was the original governing class a bearded race? It is 
scarcely probable. Whence, then, the ever-recurring beard and moustache? 
These may have been developed in the priestly class by constant ceremonial 
shaving, which often produces a thin beard in the Mongolians-as witness the 
modern Japanese, who in imitating a custom of the West often succeed in 
producing quite respectable beards.

A Colossal Head
Not far away is to be found a gigantic head, probably that of the god 
Itzamna. It is 13 feet in height, and the features were formed by first 
roughly tracing them in rubble, and afterwards coating the whole with 
plaster. The figure is surrounded by spirals, symbols of wind or speech. On 
the opposite side of the pyramid alluded to above is found a wonderful bas-
relief representing a tiger couchant, with a human head of the Maya type, 
probably depicting one of the early ancestors of the Maya, Balam-Quitze 
(Tiger with the Sweet Smile), of whom we read in the Popol Vuh.

Chichen-Itza
At Chichen-Itza, in Yucatan, the chief wonder is the gigantic pyramid-temple 
known as El Castillo. It is reached by a steep flight of steps, and from it 
the vast ruins of Chichen radiate in a circular manner. To the east is the 
market-place, to the north a mighty temple, and a tennis-court, perhaps the 
best example of its kind in Yucatan, whilst to the west stand the Nunnery 
and the Chichan-Chob, or prison. Concerning Chichen-Itza Cogolludo tells the 
following story: "A king of Chichen called Canek fell desperately in love 
with a young princess, who, whether she did not return his affection or 
whether she was compelled to obey a parental mandate, married a more 
powerful Yucatec cacique. The discarded lover, unable to bear his loss, and 
moved by love and despair, armed his dependents and suddenly fell upon his 
successful rival. Then the gaiety of the feast was exchanged for the din of 
war, and amidst the confusion the Chichen prince disappeared, carrying off 
the beautiful bride. But conscious that his power was less than his rival's, 
and fearing his vengeance, he fled the country with most of his vassals." It 
is a historical fact that the inhabitants of Chichen abandoned their city, 
but whether for the reason given in this story or not cannot be discovered.

The Nunnery
The Nunnery at Chichen is a building of great beauty of outline and 
decoration, the frieze above the doorway and the fretted ornamentation of 
the upper story exciting the admiration of most writers on the subject. Here 
dwelt the sacred women, the chief of whom, like their male prototypes, were 
dedicated to Kukulcan and regarded with much reverence. The base of the 
building is occupied by eight large figures, and over the door is the 
representation of a priest with a panache, whilst a row of gigantic heads 
crowns the north façade. Here, too, are figures of the wind-god, with 
projecting lips, which many generations of antiquarians took for heads of 
elephants with waving trunks! The entire building is one of the gems of 
Central American architecture, and delights the eye of archæologist and 
artist alike. In El Castillo are found wonderful bas-reliefs depicting 
bearded men, evidently the priests of Quetzalcoatl, himself bearded, and to 
the practised eye one of these would appear to be wearing a false hirsute 
appendage, as kings were wont to do in ancient Egypt. Were these beards 
artificial and symbolical?

The "Writing in the Dark"
The Akab-sib (Writing in the Dark) is a bas-relief found on the lintel of an 
inner door at the extremity of the building. It represents a figure seated 
before a vase, with outstretched forefinger, and whence it got its 
traditional appellation it would be hard to say, unless the person 
represented is supposed to be in the act of writing. The figure is 
surrounded by inscriptions. At Chichen were found a statue of TIaloc, the 
god of rain or moisture, and immense torsos representing Kukulcan. There 
also was a terrible well into which men were cast in time of drought as a 
propitiation to the rain-god.

Kabah
At Kabah there is a marvellous frontage which strikingly recalls that of a 
North American Indian totem-house in its fantastic wealth of detail. The 
ruins are scattered over a large area, and must all have been at one time 
painted in brilliant colours. Here two horses' heads in stone were 
unearthed, showing that the natives had copied faithfully the steeds of the 
conquering Spaniards. Nothing is known of the history of Kabah, but its 
neighbour, Uxmal, fifteen miles distant, is much more famous.

Uxmal
The imposing pile of the Casa del Gobernador (Governor's Palace, so called) 
at Uxmal is perhaps the best known and described of all the aboriginal 
buildings of Central America. It occupies three successive colossal 
terraces, and its frieze runs in a line of 325 feet, and is divided into 
panels, each of which frames a gigantic head of priest or deity. The 
striking thing concerning this edifice is that although it has been 
abandoned for over three hundred years it is still almost as fresh 
architecturally as when it left the builder's hands. Here and there a lintel 
has fallen, or stones have been removed in a spirit of vandalism to assist 
in the erection of a neighbouring hacienda, but on the whole we possess in 
it the most unspoiled piece of Yucatec building in existence. On the side of 
the palace where stands the main entrance, directly over the gateway, is the 
most wonderful fretwork and ornamentation, carried out in high relief, above 
which soar three eagles in hewn stone, surmounted by a plumed human head. In 
the plinth are three heads, which in type recall the Roman, surrounded by 
inscriptions. A clear proof of the comparative lateness of the period in 
which Uxmal was built is found in the circumstance that all the lintels over 
the doorways are of wood, of which much still exists in a good state of 
preservation. Many of the joists of the roofs were also of timber, and were 
fitted into the stonework by means of specially carved ends.

The Dwarf's House
There is also a nunnery which forcibly recalls that at Chichen, and is quite 
as elaborate and flamboyant in its architectural design. But the real 
mystery at Uxmal is the Casa del Adivino (The Prophet's House), also locally 
known as "The Dwarf's House." It consists of two portions, one of which is 
on the summit of an artificial pyramid, whilst the other, a small but 
beautifully finished chapel, is situated lower down facing the town. The 
loftier building is reached by an exceedingly steep staircase, and bears 
every evidence of having been used as a sanctuary, for here were discovered 
cacao and copal, recently burnt, by Cogolludo as late as 1656, which is good 
evidence that the Yucatecs did not all at once abandon their ancient faith 
at the promptings of the Spanish fathers.

The Legend of the Dwarf
In his Travels in Yucatan Stephens has a legend relating to this house which 
may well be given in his own words: "An old woman," he says, "lived alone in 
her hut, rarely leaving her chimney-corner. She was much distressed at 
having no children, and in her grief one day took an egg, wrapped it up 
carefully in cotton cloth, and put it in a corner of her hut. She looked 
every day in great anxiety, but no change in the egg was observable. One 
morning, however, she found the shell broken, and a lovely tiny creature was 
stretching out its arms to her. The old woman was in raptures. She took it 
to her heart, gave it a nurse, and was so careful of it that at the end of a 
year the baby walked and talked as well as a grown-up man. But he stopped 
growing. The good old woman in her joy and delight exclaimed that the baby 
should be a great chief. One day she told him to go to the kin 's palace and 
engage him in a trial of strength. The dwarf begged hard not to be sent on 
such an enterprise. But the old woman insisted on his going, and he was 
obliged to obey. When ushered into the presence of the sovereign he thrcw 
down his gauntlet. The latter smiled, and asked him to lift a stone of three 
arobes (75 lb.). The child returned crying to his mother, who sent him back, 
saying, 'If the king can lift the stone, you can lift it too.' The king did 
take it up, but so did the dwarf. His strength was tried in many other ways, 
but all the king did was as easily done by the dwarf. Wroth at being outdone 
by so puny a creature, the prince told the dwarf that unless he built a 
palace loftier than any in the city he should die. The affrighted dwarf 
returned to the old woman, who bade him not to despair, and the next morning 
they both awoke in the palace which is still standing. The king saw the 
palace with amazement. He instantly sent for the dwarf, and desired him to 
collect two bundles of cogoiol (a kind of hard wood), with one of which he 
would strike the dwarf on the head) and consent to be struck in return by 
his tiny adversary. The latter again returned to his mother moaning and 
lamenting. But the old woman cheered him up, and, placing a tortilla on his 
head, sent him back to the king. The trial took place in the presence of all 
the state grandees. The king broke the whole of his bundle on the dwarf's 
head without hurting him in the least, seeing which he wished to save his 
own head from the impending ordeal; but his word had been passed before his 
assembled court, and he could not well refuse. The dwarf struck, and at the 
second blow the king's skull was broken to pieces. The spectators 
immediately proclaimed the victorious dwarf their sovereign. After this the 
old woman disappeared. But in the village of Mani, fifty miles distant, is a 
deep well leading to a subtcrraneous passage which extends as far as Merida. 
In this passage is an old woman sitting on the bank of a river shaded by a 
great tree, having a serpent by her side. She sells water in small 
quantities, accepting no money, for she must have human beings, innocent 
babies, which are devoured by the serpent. This old woman is the dwarf's 
mother."

The interpretation of this myth is by no means difficult. The old woman is 
undoubtedly the rain-Goddess, the dwarf the Man of the Sun who emerges from 
the cosmic egg. In Yucatan dwarfs were sacred to the sun-god, and were 
occasionally sacrificed to him, for reasons which appear obscure.

The Mound of Sacrifice
Another building at Uxmal the associations of which render it of more than 
passing interest is the Pyramid of Sacrifice, an edifice built on the plan 
of the Mexican teocalli. Indeed, it is probably of Aztec origin, and may 
even have been erected by the mercenaries who during the fifteenth century 
swarmed from Mexico into Yucatan and Guatemala to take service with the 
rival chieftains who carried on civil war in those states. Beside this is 
another mound which was crowned by a very beautiful temple, now in an 
advanced state of ruin. The "Pigeon House" is an ornate pile with pinnacles 
pierced by large openings which probably served as dovecotes. The entire 
architecture of Uxmal displays a type more primitive than that met elsewhere 
in Yucatan. There is documentary evidence to prove that so late as 1673 the 
Indians still worshipped in the ruins of Uxmal, where they burnt copal, and 
performed "other detestable sacrifices." So that even a hundred and fifty 
years of Spanish rule had not sufficed to wean the natives from the worship 
of the older gods to whom their fathers had for generations bowed down. This 
would also seem conclusive evidence that the ruins of Uxmal at least were 
the work of the existing race.

The Phantom City
In his Travels in Central America Stephens recounts a fascinating story told 
him by a priest of Santa Cruz del Quiche, to the effect that four days' 
journey from that place a great Indian city was to be seen, densely 
populated, and preserving the ancient civilisation of the natives. He had, 
indeed, beheld it from the summit of a cliff, shining in glorious whiteness 
many leagues away. This was perhaps Lorillard City, discovered by Suarez, 
and afterwards by Charnay. In general type Lorillard closely resembles 
Palenque. Here was found a wonderfully executed stone idol, which Charnay 
thought represented a different racial type from that seen in the other 
Central American cities. The chief finds of interest in this ancient city 
were the intricate bas-reliefs, one over the central door of a temple, 
probably a symbolic representation of Quetzalcoatl, who holds the rain-
cross, in both hands, and is seen vis-à-vis with an acolyte, also holding 
the symbol, though it is possible that the individual represented may have 
been the high-priest of Quetzalcoatl or Kukulcan. Another bas-relief 
represents a priest sacrificing to Kukulcan by passing a rope of maguey 
fibre over his tongue for the purpose of drawing blood -an instance of the 
substitution in sacrifice of the part for the whole.

The Horse-God
At Peten-Itza, Cortés left his horse, which had fallen sick, to the care of 
the Indians. The animal died under their mismanagement and because of the 
food offered it, and the terrified natives, fancying it a divine being, 
raised an image of it, and called it Izimin Chac (Thunder and Lightning), 
because they had seen its rider discharge a firearm, and they imagined that 
the flash and the report had proceeded from the creature. The sight of the 
idol aroused such wrath in the zealous bosom of a certain Spanish monk that 
he broke it with a huge stone-and, but for the interference of the cacique, 
would have suffered death for his temerity. Peten was a city "filled with 
idols," as was Tayasal, close at hand, where in the seventeenth century no 
less than nine new temples were built, which goes to prove that the native 
religion was by no means extinct. One of these new temples, according to 
Villagutierre, had a Spanish balcony of hewn stone! In the Temple of the Sun 
at Tikal, an adjoining city, is a wonderful altar panel, representing in 
unknown deity, and here also are many of those marvellously carved idols of 
which Stephens gives such capital illustrations in his fascinating book.

Copan
Copan, one of the most interesting of these wondrous city-centres., the name 
of which has, indeed, become almost a household word, is in the same 
district as the towns just described, and abounds chiefly in monolithic 
images. It yielded after a desperate struggle to Hernandez de Chaves, one of 
Alvarado's lieutenants, in 1530. The monolithic images so abundantly 
represented here are evolved from the stelx and the bas relief, and are not 
statues in the proper sense of the term, as they are not completely cut away 
from the stone background out of which they were carved. An altar found at 
Copan exhibits real skill in sculpture, the head-dresses, ornaments, and 
expressions of the eight figures carved on its sides being elaborate in the 
extreme and exceedingly lifelike. Here again we notice a fresh racial type, 
which goes to prove that one race alone cannot have been responsible for 
these marvellous ruined cities and all that they contain and signify. We 
have to imagine a shifting of races and a fluctuation of peoples in Central 
America such as we know took place in Europe and Asia before we can rightly 
understand the ethnological problems of the civilised sphere of the New 
World, and any theory which does not take due account of such conditions is 
doomed to failure.

Mitla
We now come to the last of these stupendous remnants of a vanished 
civilisation-Mitla, by no means the least of the works of civilised man in 
Central America. At the period of the conquest the city occupied a wide 
area, but at the present time only six palaces and three ruined pyramids are 
left standing. The great palace is a vast edifice in the shape of the letter 
T, and measures 130 feet in its greater dimension, with an apartment of a 
like size. Six monolithic columns which supported the roof still stand in 
gigantic isolation, but the roof itself has long fallen in. A dark passage 
leads to the inner court, and the walls of this are covered with mosaic work 
in panels which recalls somewhat the pattern known as the "Greek fret." The 
lintels over the doorways are of huge blocks of stone nearly eighteen feet 
long. Of this building Viollet-le-Duc says: "The monuments of Greece and 
Rome in their best time can alone compare with the splendour of this great 
edifice."

A Place of Sepulture
The ruins at Mitla bear no resemblance to those of Mexico or Yucatan, either 
as regards architecture or ornamentation, for whereas the Yucatec buildings 
possess overlapping walls, the palaces of Mitla consist of perpendicular 
walls intended to support flat roofs. Of these structures the second and 
fourth palaces alone are in such a state of preservation as to permit of 
general description. The second palace shows by its sculptured lintel and 
two inner columns that the same arrangement was observed in its construction 
as in the great palacejust described. The fourth palace has on its southern 
faqade oblong panels and interesting caryatides or pillars in the shape of 
human figures. These palaces consisted of four upper apartments, finely 
sculptured, and a like number of rooms on the lower story, which was 
occupied by the high-priest, and to which the king came to mourn on the 
demise of a relative. Here, too, the priests were entombed, and in an 
adjoining room the idols were kept. Into a huge underground chamber the 
bodies of eminent warriors and sacrificial victims were cast. Attempts have 
been made to identify Mitla with Mictlan, the Mexican Hades, and there is 
every reason to suppose that the identification is correct. It must be borne 
in mind that Mictlan was as much a place of the dead as a place of 
punishment, as was the Greek Hades, and therefore might reasonably, signify 
a place of sepulture, such as Mitla undoubtedly was. The following passages 
from the old historians of Mitla, Torquemada and Burgoa, throw much light on 
this aspect of the city, and besides are full of the most intense interest 
and curious information, so that they may be given in extenso. But before 
passing on to them we should for a moment glance at Seler's suggestion that 
the American race imagined that their ancestors had originally issued from 
the underworld through certain caverns into the light of day, and that this 
was the reason why Mitla was not only a burial-place but a sanctuary.

An Old Description of Mitla
Of Mitla Father Torquemada writes:

"When some monks of my order, the Franciscan, passed, preaching and 
shriving, through the province of Zapoteca, whose capital city is 
Tehuantepec, they came to a village which was called Mictlan, that is, 
Underworld [Hell]. Besides mentioning the large number of people in the 
village they told of buildings which were prouder and more magnificent than 
any which they had hitherto seen in New Spain. Among them was a temple of 
the evil spirit and living-rooms for his demoniacal servants, and among 
other fine things there was a hall with ornamented panels, which were 
constructed of stone in a variety of arabesques and other very remarkable 
designs. There were doorways there, each one of which was built of but three 
stones, two upright at the sides and one across them, in such a manner that, 
although these doorways were very high and broad, the stones sufficed for 
their entire construction. They were so thick and broad that we were assured 
there were few like them. There was another hall in these buildings, or 
rectangular temples, which was erected entirely on round stone pillars, very 
high and very thick, so thick that two grown men could scarcely encircle 
them with their arms, nor could one of them reach the finger-tips of the 
other. These pillars were all in one piece, and, it was said, the whole 
shaft of a pillar measured 5 ells from top to bottom, and they were very 
much like those of the Church of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome, very 
skilfully made and polished."

Father Burgoa gives a more exact description. He says:

"The Palace of the Living and of the Dead was built for the use of this 
person [the high-priest of the Zapotecs]. . . . They built this magnificent 
house or pantheon in the shape of a rectangle, with portions rising above 
the earth and portions built down into the earth, the latter in the hole or 
cavity which was found below the surface of the earth, and ingeniously made 
the chambers of equal size by the manner of joining them, leaving a spacious 
court in the middle; and in order to secure four equal chambers they 
accomplished what barbarian heathen (as they were) could only achieve by the 
powers and skill of an architect. It is not known in what stone-pit they 
quarried the pillars, which are so thick that two men can scarcely encircle 
them with their arms. These are, to be sure, mere shafts without capital or 
pedestal, but they are wonderfully regular and smooth, and they are about 5 
ells high and in one piece. These served to support the roof, which consists 
of stone slabs instead of beams. The slabs are about 2 ells long, 1 ell 
broad, and half an ell thick, extending from pillar to pillar. The pillars 
stand in a row, one behind the other, in order to receive the weight. The 
stone slabs are so regular and so exactly fitted that, without any mortar or 
cement, at the joints they resemble mortised beams. The four rooms, which 
are very spacious, are arranged in exactly the same way and covered with the 
same kind of roofing. But in the construction of the walls the greatest 
architects of the earth have been surpassed, as I have not found this kind 
of architecture described either among the Egyptians or among the Greeks, 
for they begin at the base with a narrow outline and, as the structure rises 
in height, spread out in wide copings at the top, so that the upper part 
exceeds the base in breadth and looks as if it would fall over. The inner 
side of the walls consists of a mortar or stucco of such hardness that no 
one knows with what kind of liquid it could have been mixed. The outside is 
of such extraordinary workmanship that on a masonry wall about an ell in 
height there are placed stone slabs with a projecting edge, which form the 
support for an endless number of small white stones, the smallest of which 
are a sixth of an ell long, half as broad, and a quarter as thick, and which 
are as smooth and regular as if they had all come from one mould. They had 
so many of these stones that, setting them in, one beside the other, they 
formed with them a large number of different beautiful geometric designs, 
each an ell broad and running the whole length of the wall, each varying in 
pattern up to the crowning piece, which was the finest of all. And what has 
always seemed inexplicable to the greatest architects is the adjustment of 
these little stones without a single handful of mortar, and the fact that 
without tools, with nothing but hard stones and sand, they could achieve 
such solid work that, though the whole structure is very old and no one 
knows who made it, it has been preserved until the present day.

Human Sacrifice at Mitla
"I carefully examined these monuments some thirty years ago in the chambers 
above ground, which are constructed of the same size and in the same way as 
those below ground, and, though single pieces were in ruins because some 
stones had become loosened, there was still much to admire. The doorways 
were very large, the sides of each being of single stones of the same 
thickness as the wall, and the lintel was made out of another stone which 
held the two lower ones together at the top. There were four chambers above 
ground and four below. The latter were arranged according to their purpose 
in such a way that one front chamber served as chapel and sanctuary for the 
idols) which were placed on a great stone which served as an altar. And for 
the more important feasts which they celebrated with sacrifices, or at the 
burial of a king or great lord, the high-priest instructed the lesser 
priests or the subordinate temple officials who served him to prepare the 
chapel and his vestments and a large quantity of the incense used by them. 
And then he descended with a great retinue, while none of the common people 
saw him or dared to look in his face, convinced that if they did so they 
would fall dead to the earth as a punishment for their boldness. And when he 
entered the chapel they put on him a long white cotton garment made like an 
alb, and over that a garment shaped like a dalmatic, which was embroidered 
with pictures of wild beasts and birds; and they put a cap on his head, and 
on his feet a kind of shoe woven of many coloured feathers. And when he had 
put on these garments he walked with solemn mien and measured step to the 
altar, bowed low before the idols, renewed the incense, and then in quite 
unintelligible murmurs he began to converse with these images, these 
depositories of infernal spirits, and continued in this sort of prayer with 
hideous grimaces and writhings, uttering inarticulate sounds, which filled 
all present with fear and terror, till he came out of that diabolical trance 
and told those standing around the lies and fabrications which the spirit 
had imparted to him or which he had invented himself. When human beings were 
sacrificed the ceremonies were multiplied, and the assistants of the high-
priest stretched the victim out upon a large stone, baring his breast, which 
they tore open with a great stone knife, while the body writhed in fearful 
convulsions, and they laid the heart bare, ripping it out, and with it the 
soul, which the devil took, while they carried the heart to the high-priest 
that he might offer it to the idols by holding it to their mouths, among 
other ceremonies; and the body was thrown into the burial-place of their 
'blessed,' as they called them. And if after the sacrifice he felt inclined 
to detain those who begged any favour he sent them word by the subordinate 
priests not to leave their houses till their gods were appeased, and he 
commanded them to do penance meanwhile, to fast and to speak with no woman, 
so that, until this father of sin had interceded for the absolution of the 
penitents and had declared the gods appeased, they did not dare to cross 
their thresholds.

"The second (underground) chamber was the burial-place of these high-
priests, the third that of the kings of Theozapotlan, whom they brought 
hither rich y dressed in their best attire, feathers, jewels, golden 
necklaces, and precious stones, placing a shield in the left hand and a 
javelin in the right, just as they used them in war. And at their burial 
rites great mourning prevailed; the instruments which were played made 
mournful sounds; and with loud wailing and continuous sobbing they chanted 
the life and exploits of their lord until they laid him on the structure 
which they had prepared or this purpose.

Living Sacrifices
"The last (underground) chamber had a second door at the rear, which led to 
a dark and gruesome room. This was closed with a stone slab, which occupied 
the whole entrance. Through this door they, threw the bodies of the victims 
and of the great lords and chieftains who had fallen in battle, and they 
brought them from the spot where they fell, even when it was very far off, 
to this burial-place; and so great was the barbarous infatuation of those 
Indians that, in the belief of the happy life which awaited them, many who 
were oppressed by diseases or hardships begged this infamous priest to 
accept them as living sacrifices and allow them to enter through that portal 
and roam about in the dark interior of the mountain, to seek the feasting-
places of their forefathers. And when any one obtained this favour the 
servants of the high-priest led him thither with special ceremonies, and 
after they allowed him to enter through the small door they rolled the stone 
before it again and took leave of him, and the unhappy man, wandering in 
that abyss of darkness, died of hunger and thirst, beginning already in life 
the pain of his damnation, and on account of this horrible abyss they called 
this village Liyobaa.

The Cavern of Death
"When later there fell upon these people the light of the Gospel, its 
servants took much trouble to instruct them, and to find out whether this 
error, common to all these nations, still prevailed; and they learned from 
the stories which had been handed down that all were convinced that this 
damp cavern extended more than thirty leagues underground, and that its roof 
was supported by pillars. And there were people, zealous prelates anxious 
for knowledge, who, in order to convince these ignorant people of their 
error, went into this cave accompanied by a large number of people bearing 
lighted torches and firebrands, and descended several large steps. And they 
soon came upon many great buttresses which formed a kind of street. They had 
prudently brought a quantity of rope with them to use as guiding-lines, that 
they might not lose themselves in this confusing labyrinth. And the 
putrefaction and the bad odour and the dampness of the earth were very 
great, and there was also a cold wind which blew out their torches. And 
after they had gone a short distance, fearing to be overpowered by the 
stench, or to step on poisonous reptiles, of which some had been seen, they 
resolved to go out again, and to completely wall up this back door of hell. 
The four buildings above ground were the only ones which still remained 
open, and they had a court and chambers like those underground; and the 
ruins of these have lasted even to the present day.

Palace of the High-Priest
"One of the rooms above ground was the palace of the high-priest, where he 
sat and slept, for the apartment offered room and opportunity for 
everything. The throne was like a high cushion, with a high back to lean 
ainst, all of tiger-skin, stuffed entirely with delicate afeathers, or with 
fine grass which was used for this purpose. The other seats were smaller, 
even when the king came to visit him. The authority of this devilish priest 
was so great that there was no one who dared to cross the court, and to 
avoid this the other three chambers had doors in the rear, through which 
even the kings entered. For this purpose they had alleys and passage-ways on 
the outside above and below, by which people could enter and go out when 
they came to see the high-priest. . . .

"The second chamber above ground was that of the priests and the assistants 
of the high-priest. The third was that of the king when he came. The fourth 
was that of the other chieftains and captains, and though the space was 
small for so great a number, and for so many different families, yet they 
accommodated themselves to each other out of respect for the place, and 
avoided dissensions and factions. Furthermore, there was no other 
administration of justice in this place than that of the high-priest, to 
whose unlimited power all bowed.

Furniture of the Temples
"All the rooms were clean, and well furnished with mats. It was not the 
custom to sleep on bedsteads, however great a lord might be. They used very 
tastefully braided mats, which were spread on the floor, and soft skins of 
animals and delicate fabrics for coverings. Their food consisted usually of 
animals killed in the hunt-deer, rabbits, armadillos, &c., and also birds, 
which they killed with snares or arrows. The bread, made of their maize, was 
white and well kneaded. Their drinks were always cold, made of ground 
chocolate, which was mixed with water and pounded maize. Other drinks were 
made of pulpy and of crushed fruits, which were then mixed with the 
intoxicating drink prepared from the agave; for since the common people were 
forbidden the use of intoxicating drinks, there was always an abundance of 
these on hand."


CHAPTER V: MYTHS OF THE MAYA
Mythology of the Maya
OUR knowledge of the mythology of the Maya is by no means so full and 
comprehensive as in the case of Mexican mythology. Traditions are few and 
obscure, and the hieroglyphic matter is closed to us. But one great mine of 
Maya-Kiche mythology exists which furnishes us with much information 
regarding Kiche cosmogony and pseudo-history, with here and there an 
interesting allusion to the various deities of the Kiche pantheon. This is 
the Popol Vuh, a volume in which a little real history is mingled with much 
mythology. It was composed in the form in which we now possess it by a 
Christianised native of Guatemala in the seventeenth century, and copied in 
Kiche, in which it was originally written, by one Francisco Ximenes, a monk, 
who also added to it a Spanish translation.

The Lost "Popol Vuh"
For generations antiquarians interested in this wonderful compilation were 
aware that it existed somewhere in Guatemala, and many were the regrets 
expressed regarding their inability to unearth it. A certain Don Felix 
Cabrera had made use of it early in the nineteenth century, but the 
whereabouts of the copy he had seen could not be discovered. A Dr. C. 
Scherzer, of Austria, resolved, if possible, to discover it, and paid a 
visit to Guatemala in 1854 for that purpose. After a diligent search he 
succeeded in finding the lost manuscript in the University of San Carlos in 
the city of Guatemala. Ximenes, the copyist, had placed it in the library of 
the convent of Chichicastenango. whence it passed to the San Carlos library 
in 1830

Genuine Character of the Work
Much doubt has been cast upon the genuine character of the Popol Vuh, 
principally by persons who were almost if not entirely ignorant of the 
problems of preColumbian history in America. Its genuine character, however, 
is by no means difficult to prove. It has been stated that it is a mere 
réchauffé of the known facts of Maya history coloured by Biblical knowledge, 
a native version of the Christian Bible. But such a theory will not stand 
when it is shown that the matter it contains squares with the accepted facts 
of Mexican mythology, upon which the Popol Vuh throws considerable light. 
Moreover, the entire work bears the stamp of being a purely native 
compilation, and has a flavour of great antiquity. Our knowledge of the 
general principles of mythology, too, prepares us for the unqualified 
acceptance of the material of the Popol Vuh, or we find there the stories 
and tales, the conceptions and ideas connected with early religion which are 
the property of no one people, but of all peoples and races in an early 
social state.

Likeness to other Pseudo-Histories
We find in this interesting book a likeness to many other works of early 
times. The Popol Vuh is, indeed, of the same genre and class as the 
Heimskringla of Snorre, the history of Saxo Grammaticus, the Chinese history 
in the Five Books, the Japanese Nihongi, and many other similar 
compilations. But it surpasses all these in pure interest because it is the 
only native American work that has come down to us from pre-Columbian times.

The name "Popol Vuh " means "The Collection of Written Leaves," which proves 
that the book must have contained traditional matter reduced to writing at a 
very early period. It is, indeed, a compilation of mythological character, 
interspersed with pseudo-history, which, as the account reaches modern 
times, shades off into pure history and tells the deeds of authentic 
personages. The Ianguage in which it was written, the Kiche, was a dialect 
of the Maya-Kiche tongue spoken at the time of the conquest in Guatemala, 
Honduras, and San Salvador, and still the tongue of the native populations 
in these districts.

The Creation Story
The beginning of this interesting book is taken up with the Kiche story of 
the creation, and what occurred directly subsequent to that event. We are 
told that the god Hurakan, the mighty wind, a deity in whom we can discern a 
Kiche equivalent to Tezcatlipoca, passed over the universe, still wrapped in 
gloom. He called out "Earth", and the solid land appeared. Then the chief 
gods took counsel among themselves as to what should next be made. These 
were Hurakan, Gucumatz or Quetzalcoatl, and Xpiyacoc and Xmucane, the mother 
and father gods. They agreed that animals should be created. This was 
accomplished, and they next turned their attention to the framing of man. 
They made a number of mannikins carved out of wood. But these were 
irreverent and angered the gods, who resolved to bring about their downfall. 
Then Hurakan (The Heart of Heaven) caused the waters to be swollen, and a 
mighty flood came upon the mannikins. Also a thick resinous rain descended 
upon them. The bird Xecotcovach tore out their eyes, the bird Camulatz cut 
off their heads, the bird Cotzbalarn devoured their flesh, the bird 
Tecumbalam broke their bones and sinews and ground them into powder. Then 
all sorts of beings, great and small, abused the mannikins. The household 
utensils and domestic animals jeered at them, and made game of them in their 
plight. The dogs and hens said: "Very badly have you treated us and you have 
bitten us. Now we bite you in turn." The millstones said: "Very much were we 
tormented by you, and daily, daily, night and day, it was squeak, screech, 
screech, holi, holi, huqi, huqi, for your sake. Now you shall feel our 
strength, and we shall grind your flesh and make meal of your bodies. " And 
the dogs growled at the unhappy images because they had not been fed, and 
tore them with their teeth. The cups and platters said: "Pain and misery you 
gave us, smoking our tops and sides, cooking us over the fire, burning and 
hurting us as if we had no feeling. Now it is your turn, and you shall 
burn." The unfortunate mannikins ran hither and thither in their despair. 
They mounted upon the roofs of the houses, but the houses crumbled beneath 
their feet; they tried to climb to the tops of the trees, but the trees 
hurled them down; they were even repulsed by the caves, which closed before 
them. Thus this ill-starred race was finally destroyed and overthrown, and 
the only vestiges of them which remain are certain of their progeny, the 
little monkeys which dwell in the woods.

Vukub-Cakix, the Great Macaw
Ere the earth was quite recovered from the wrathful flood which had 
descended upon it there lived a being orgulous and full of pride, called 
Vukub-Cakix (Seventimes-the-colour-of-fire-the Kiche name for the great 
macaw bird). His teeth were of emerald, and other parts of him shone with 
the brilliance of gold and silver. In short, it is evident that he was a 
sun-and-moon god of prehistoric times. He boasted dreadfully, and his 
conduct so irritated the other gods that they resolved upon his destruction. 
His two sons, Zipacna and Cabrakan (Cockspur or Earth-heaper, and 
Earthquake), were earthquake-gods of the type of the Jotuns of Scandinavian 
myth or the Titans of Greek legend. These also were prideful and arrogant, 
and to cause their downfall the gods despatched the heavenly twins Hun-Apu 
and Xbalanque to earth, with instructions to chastise the trio.

Vukub-Cakix prided himself upon his possession of the wonderful nanze-tree, 
the tapal, bearing a fruit round, yellow, and aromatic, upon which he 
breakfasted every morning. One morning he mounted to its summit, whence he 
could best espy the choicest fruits, when he was surprised and infuriated to 
observe that two strangers had arrived there before him, and had almost 
denuded the tree of its produce. On seeing Vukub, Hun-Apu raised a blow-pipe 
to his mouth and blew a dart at the giant. It struck him on the mouth, and 
he fell from the top of the tree to the ground. Hun-Apu leapt down upon 
Vukub and grappled with him, but the giant in terrible anger seized the god 
by the arm and wrenched it from the body. He then returned to his house, 
where he was met by his wife, Chimalmat, who inquired for what reason he 
roared with pain. In reply he pointed to his mouth, and so full of anger was 
he against Hun-Apu that he took the arm he had wrenched from him and hung it 
over a blazing fire. He then threw himself down to bemoan his injuries, 
consoling himself, however, with the idea that he had avenged himself upon 
the disturbers of his peace.

Whilst Vukub-Cakix moaned and howled with the dreadful pain which he felt in 
his jaw and teeth (for the dart which had pierced him was probably poisoned) 
the arm of Hun-Apu hung over the fire, and was turned round and round and 
basted by Vukub's spouse, Chimalmat. The sun-god rained bitter imprecations 
upon the interlopers who had penetrated to his paradise and had caused him 
such woe, and he gave vent to dire threats of what would happen if he 
succeeded in getting them into his power.

But Hun-Apu and Xbalanque were not minded that Vukub-Cakix should escape so 
easily, and the recovery of Hun-Apu's arm must be made at all hazards. So 
they went to consult two great and wise magicians, Xpiyacoc and Xmucane, in 
whom we see two of the original Kiche creative deities, who advised them to 
proceed with them in disguise to the dwelling of Vukub, if they wished to 
recover the lost arm. The old magicians resolved to disguise themselves as 
doctors, and dressed Hun-Apu and Xbalanque in other garments to represent 
their sons.

Shortly they arrived at the mansion of Vukub, and while still some way off 
they could hear his groans and cries. Presenting themselves at the door, 
they accosted him. They told him that they had heard some one crying out in 
pain, and that as famous doctors they considered it their duty to ask who 
was suffering.

Vukub appeared quite satisfied, but closely questioned the old wizards 
concerning the two young men who accompanied them.

"They are our sons," they replied.

"Good," said Vukub. " Do you think you will be able to cure me?"

"We have no doubt whatever upon that head."

answered Xpiyacoc. "You have sustained very bad injuries to your mouth and 
eyes."

"The demons who shot me with an arrow from their, blow-pipe are the cause of 
my sufferings," said Vukub. "If you are able to cure me I shall reward you 
richly."

"Your Highness has many bad teeth, which must be removed," said the wily old 
magician. "Also the balls of your eyes appear to me to be diseased."

Vukub appeared highly alarmed, but the magicians speedily reassured him.

"It is necessary," said Xpiyacoc, "that we remove your teeth, but we will 
take care to replace them with grains of maize, which you will find much 
more agreeable in every way."

The unsuspicious giant agreed to the operation, and very quickly Xpiyacoc, 
with the help of Xmucane, removed his teeth of emerald, and replaced them by 
grains of white maize. A change quickly came over the Titan. His brilliancy 
speedily vanished, and when they removed the balls of his eyes he sank into 
insensibility and died.

All this time the wife of Vukub was turning Hun-Apu's arm over the fire, but 
Hun-Apu snatched the limb from above the brazier, and with the help of the 
magicians replaced it upon his shoulder. The discomfiture of Vukub was then 
complete. The party left his dwelling feeling that their mission had been 
accomplished.

The Earth-Giants
But in reality it was only partially accomplished, because Vukub's two sons, 
Zipacna and Cabrakan, still remained to be dealt with. Zipacna was daily 
employed in heaping up mountains, while Cabrakan, his brother, shook them in 
earthquake. The vengeance of Hun-Apu and Xbalanque was first directed 
against Zipacna, and they conspired with a band of young men to bring about 
his death.

The young men, four hundred in number, pretended to be engaged in building a 
house. They cut down a large tree, which they made believe was to be the 
rooftree of their dwelling, and waited in a part of the forest through which 
they knew Zipacna must pass. After a while they could hear the giant 
crashing through the trees. He came into sight, and when he saw them 
standing round the giant tree-trunk, which they could not lift, he seemed 
very much amused.

"What have you there, O little ones?" he said laughing.

"Only a tree, your Highness, which we have felled for the roof-tree of a new 
house we are building."

"Cannot you carry it?" asked the giant disdainfully.

"No, your Highness," they made answer; "it is much too heavy to be lifted 
even by our united efforts."

With a good-natured laugh the Titan stooped and lifted the great trunk upon 
his shoulder. Then, bidding them lead the way, he trudged through the 
forest, evidently not disconcerted in the least by his great burden. Now the 
young men, incited by Hun-Apu and Xbalanque, had dug a great ditch, which 
they pretended was to serve for the foundation of their new house. Into this 
they requested Zipacna to descend, and, scenting no mischief, the giant 
readily complied. On his reaching the bottom his treacherous acquaintances 
cast huge trunks of trees upon him, but on hearing them coming down he 
quickly took refuge in a small side tunnel which the youths had constructed 
to serve as a cellar beneath their house.

Imagining the giant to be killed, they began at once to express their 
delight by singing and dancing, and to lend colour to his stratagem Zipacna 
despatched several friendly ants to the surface with strands of hair, which 
the young men concluded had been taken from his dead body. Assured by the 
seeming proof of his death, the youths proceeded to build their house upon 
the trec-trunks which they imagined covered Zipacna's body, and, producing a 
quantity of pulque, they began to make merry over the end of their enemy. 
For some hours their new dwelling rang with revelry.

All this time Zipacna, quietly hidden below, was listening to the hubbub and 
waiting his chance to revenge himself upon those who had entrapped him.

Suddenly arising in his giant might, he cast the house and all its inmates 
high in the air. The dwelling was utterly demolished, and the band of youths 
were hurled with such force into the sky that they remained there, and in 
the stars we call the Pleiades we can still discern them wearily waiting an 
opportunity to return to earth.

The Undoing of Zipacna
But Hun-Apu and Xbalanquc, grieved that their comrades had so perished, 
resolved that Zipacna must not be permitted to escape so easily. He, 
carrying the mountains by night, sought his food by day on the shore of the 
river, where he wandered catching fish and crabs. The brothers made a large 
artificial crab, which they placed in a cavern at the bottom of a ravine. 
They then cunningly undermined a huge mountain, and awaited events. Very 
soon they saw Zipacna wandering along the side of the river, and asked him 
where he was going.

"Oh, I am only seeking my daily food," replied the giant.

"And what may that consist of asked the brothers.

"Only of fish and crabs," replied Zipacna.

"Oh, there is a crab down yonder," said the crafty brothers, pointing to the 
bottom of the ravine. "We espied it as we came along. Truly, it is a great 
crab, and will furnish you with a capital breakfast."

Splendid! " cried Zipacna, with glistening eyes. "I must have it at once," 
and with one bound he leapt down to where the cunningly contrived crab lay 
in the cavern.

No sooner had he reached it than Hun-Apu and Xbalanque cast the mountain 
upon him; but so desperate were his efforts to get free that the brothers 
feared he might rid himself of the immense weight of earth under which he 
was buried, and to make sure of his fate they turned him into stone. Thus at 
the foot of Mount Meahuan, near Vera Paz, perished the proud Mountain-Maker.

The Discomfiture of Cabrakan
Now only the third of this family of boasters remained, and he was the most 
proud of any.

"I am the Overturner of Mountains!" said he.

But Hun-Apu and Xbalanque had made up their minds that not one of the race 
of Vukub should be left alive.

At the moment when they were plotting the over. throw of Cabrakan he was 
occupied in moving mountains. He seized the mountains by their bases and, 
exerting his mighty strength, cast them into the air; and of the smaller 
mountains he took no account at all. While he was so employed he met the 
brothers, who greeted him cordially.

"Good day, Cabrakan," said they. " What may you be doing? "

"Bah! nothing at all," replied the giant. " Cannot you see that I am 
throwing the mountains about, which is my usual occupation? And who may you 
be that ask such stupid questions? What arc your names?"

"We have no names " replied they. "We are only hunters, and here we have our 
blow-pipes, with which we shoot the birds that live in these mountains. So 
you see that we do not require names, as we meet no one."

Cabrakan looked at the brothers disdainfully, and was about to depart when 
they said to him: "Stay; we should like to behold these mountain-throwing 
feats of yours.

This aroused the pride of Cabrakan.

"Well, since you wish it," said he, "I will show you how I can move a really 
great mountain. Now, choose the one you would like to see me destroy, and 
before you are aware of it I shall have reduced it to dust."

Hun-Apu looked around him, and espyingy a great peak pointed toward it. 11 
Do you think you could overthrow that mountain?" he asked.

"Without the least difficulty," replied Cabrakan, with a great laugh. "Let 
us go toward it."

"But first you must cat," said Hun-Apu. "You have had no food since morning, 
and so great a feat can hardly be accomplished fasting."

The giant smacked his lips. "You are right" he said, with a hungry look. 
Cabrakan was one of those people who are always hungry. "But what have you 
to give me?"

"We have nothing with us," said Hun-Apu.

"Umph!" growled Cabrakan, "you are a pretty fellow. You ask me what I will 
have to eat, and then tell me you have nothing," and in his anger he seized 
one of the smaller mountains and threw it into the sea, so that the waves 
splashed up to the sky.

"Come," said Hun-Apu, "don't get angry. We have our blow-pipes with us, and 
will shoot a bird for your dinner."

On hearing this Cabrakan grew somewhat quieter. "Why did you not say so at 
first? " he growled.

"But be quick, because I am hungry."

Just at that moment a large bird passed overhead, and Hun-Apu and Xbalanque 
raised their blow-pipes to their mouths. The darts sped swiftly upward, and 
both of them struck the bird, which came tumbling down through the air, 
falling at the feet of Cabrakan.

"Wonderful, wonderful!" cried the giant. "You are clever fellows indeed, 
and, seizing the dead bird, he was going to eat it raw when Hun-Apu stopped 
him.

Wait a moment, said he. "It will be much nicer when cooked," and, rubbing 
two sticks together, he ordered Xbalanque to gather some dry wood, so that a 
fire was soon blazing.

The bird was then suspended over the fire, and in a short time a savoury 
odour mounted to the nostrils of the giant, who stood watching the cooking 
with hungry eyes and watering lips.

Before placing the bird over the fire to cook, however, Hun-Apu had smeared 
its feathers with a thick coating of mud. The Indians in some parts of 
Central America still do this, so that when the mud dries with the heat of 
the fire the feathers will come off with it, leaving the flesh of the bird 
quite ready to eat. But Hun-Apu had done this with a purpose. The mud that 
he spread on the feathers was that of a poisoned earth, called tizate, the 
elements of which sank deeply into the flesh of the bird.

When the savoury mess was cooked, he handed it to Cabrakan, who speedily 
devoured it.

"Now" said Hun-Apu, "let us go toward that great mountain and see if you can 
lift it as you boast."

But already Cabrakan began to feel strange pangs.

"What is this?" said he, passing his hand across his brow. "I do not seem to 
see the mountain you mean.

"Nonsense," said Hun-Apu. Yonder it is, see, to the east there."

"My eyes seem dim this morning," replied the giant.

"No, it is not that," said Hun-Apu. "You have boasted that you could lift 
this mountain, and now you are afraid to try."

"I tell you," said Cabrakan, "that I have difficulty in seeing. Will you 
lead me to the mountain? "

"Certainly," said Hun-Apu, giving him his hand, and with several strides 
they were at the foot of the eminence.

" Now," said Hun-Apu, "see what you can do, boaster."

Cabrakan gazed stupidly at the great mass in front of him. His knees shook 
together so that the sound was like the beating of a war-drum, and the sweat 
poured from his forehead and ran in a little stream down the side of the 
mountain.

"Come," cried Hun-Apu derisively, "are you going to lift the mountain or 
not?"

"He cannot," sneered Xbalanque. "I knew he could not."

Cabrakan shook himself into a final effort to regain his senses, but all to 
no purpose. The poison rushed through his blood, and with a groan he fell 
dead before the brothers.

Thus perished the last of the earth-giants of Guatemala, whom Hun-Apu and 
Xbalanque had been sent to destroy.

The Second Book
The second book of the Popol Vuh outlines the history of the hero-gods Hun-
Apu and Xbalanque. We are told that Xpiyacoc and Xmucane, the father and 
mother gods, had two sons, Hunhun-Apu and Vukub-Hunapu, the first of whom 
had by his wife Xbakiyalo two sons, Hunbatz and Hunchouen. The weakness of 
the whole family was the native game or ball, possibly the Mexican-Mayan 
game of tlachtli, a sort of hockey. To this pastime the natives of Central 
America were greatly addicted, and numerous remains of tlachtli courts are 
to be found in the ruined cities of Yucatan and Guatemala. The object of the 
game was to "putt" the ball through a small hole in a circular stone or 
goal, and the player who succeeded in doing this might demand from the 
audience all their clothes and jewels. The game, as we have said, was 
exceedingly popular in ancient Central America, and there is good reason to 
believe that inter-city matches took place between the various city-states, 
and were accompanied by a partisanship and rivalry as keen as that which 
finds expression among the crowd at our principal football matches to-day.

A Challenge from Hades
On one occasion Hunhun-Apu and Vukub-Hunapu played a game of ball which in 
its progress took them into the vicinity of the realm of Xibalba (the Kiche 
Hades). The rulers of that drear abode, imagining that they had a chance of 
capturing the brothers, extended a challenge to them to play them at ball, 
and this challenge Hun-Came and Vukub-Came, the sovereigns of the Kiche 
Hell, despatched by four messengers in the shape of owls. The brothers 
accepted the challenge, and, bidding farewell to their mother Xmucane and 
their respective sons and nephews, followed the feathered messengers down 
the long hill which led to the Underworld.

The Fooling of the Brethren
The American Indian is grave and taciturn. If there is one thing he fears 
and dislikes more than another it is ridicule. To his austere and haughty 
spirit it appears as something derogratory to his dignity, a slur upon his 
manhood. The hero-brothers had not been long in Xibalba when they discovered 
that it was the intention of the Lords of Hades to fool them and subject 
them to every species of indignity. After crossing a river of blood, they 
came to the palace of the Lords of Xibalba, where they espied two seated 
figures in front of them. Thinking that they recognised in them Hun-Came and 
Vukub-Came, they saluted them in a becoming manner, only to discover to 
their mortification that they were addressing fifurcs of wood. This incident 
excited the ribald jeers o the Xibalbans, who scoffed at the brothers. Next 
they were invited to sit on the seat of honour, which they found to their 
dismay to be a red-hot stone, a circumstance which caused unbounded 
amusement to the inhabitants of the Underworld. Then they were imprisoned in 
the House of Gloom, where they were sacrificed and buried. The head of 
Hunhun-Apu was, however, suspended from a tree, upon the branches of which 
grew a crop of gourds so like the dreadful trophy as to be indistinguishable 
from it. The fiat went forth that no one in Xibalba must eat of the fruit of 
that tree. But the Lords of Xibalba had reckoned without feminine curiosity 
and its unconquerable love of the forbidden.

The Princess Xquiq
One day-if day ever penetrated to that gloomy and unwholesome place-a 
princess of Xibalba called Xquiq (Blood), daughter of Cuchumaquiq, a 
notability of Xibalba, passed under the tree, and, observing the desirable 
fruit with which it was covered, stretched out her hand to pluck one of the 
gourds. Into the outstretched palm the head of Hunhun-Apu spat, and told 
Xquiq that she would become a mother. Before she returned home, however, the 
hero-god assured her that no harm would come to her, and that she must not 
be afraid. In a few months' time the princess's father heard of her 
adventure, and she was doomed to be slain, the royal messengers of Xibalba, 
the owls, receiving commands to despatch her and to bring back her heart in 
a vase. But on the way she overcame the scruples of the owls by splendid 
promises, and they substituted for her heart the coagulated sap of the 
bloodwort plant.

The Birth of Hun-Apu and Xbalanque
Xmucane, left at home, looked after the welfare of the young Hunbatz and 
Hunchouen, and thither, at the instigation of the head of Hunhun-Apu, went 
Xquiq for protection. At first Xmucane would not credit her story, but upon 
Xquiq appealing to the gods a miracle was performed on her behalf, and she 
was permitted to gather a basket of maize where no maize grew to prove the 
authenticity of her claim. As a princess of the Underworld, it is not 
surprising that she should be connected with such a phenomenon, as it is 
from deities of that region that we usually expect the phenomena of growth 
to proceed. Shortly afterwards, when she had won the good graces of the aged 
Xmucane, her twin sons were born, the Hun-Apu and Xbalanque whom we have 
already met as the central figures of the first book.

The Divine Children
But the divine children were both noisy and mischievous. They tormented 
their venerable grandmother with their shrill uproar and tricky behaviour. 
At last Xmucane, unable to put up with their habits, turned them out of 
doors. They took to an outdoor life with surprising case, and soon became 
expert hunters and skilful in the use of the serbatana (blow-pipe), with 
which they shot birds and small animals. They were badly treated by their 
half-brothers Hunbatz and Hunchouen, who, jealous of their fame as hunters, 
annoyed them in every possible manner. But the divine children retaliated by 
turning their tormentors into hideous apes. The sudden change in the appearn 
of her grandsons caused Xmucane the most profound grief and dismay, and she 
begged that they who had brightened her home with their singing and flute-
playing might not be condemned to such a dreadful fate. She was informed by 
the divine brothers that if she could behold their antics unmoved by mirth 
her wish would be granted. But the capers they cut and their grimaces caused 
her such merriment that on three separate occasions she was unable to 
restrain her laughter, and the men-monkeys took their leave.

The Magic Tools
The childhood of Hun-Apu and Xbalanque was full of such episodes as might be 
expected from these beings. We find, for example, that on attempting to 
clear a milpa (maize plantation) they employed magic tools which could be 
trusted to undertake a good day's work whilst they were absent at the chase. 
Returning at night, they smeared soil over their hands and faces, for the 
purpose of deluding Xmucane into the belief that they had been toiling all 
day in the fields. But the wild beasts met in conclave during the night, and 
replaced all the roots and shrubs which the magic tools had cleared away. 
The twins recognised the work of the various animals) and placed a large net 
on the ground, so that if the creatures came to the spot on the following 
night they might be caught in its folds. They did come, but all made good 
their escape save the rat. The rabbit and deer lost their tails, however, 
and that is why these animals possess no caudal appendages! The rat, in 
gratitude for their sparing its life, told the brothers the history of their 
father and uncle, of their heroic efforts against the powers of Xibalba, and 
of the existence of a set of clubs and balls with which they might play 
tlachtli on the ballground at Ninxor-Carchah, where Hunhun-Apu and Vukub-
Hunapu had played before them.

The Second Challenge
But the watchful Hun-Came and Vukub-Came soon heard that the sons and 
nephews of their first victims had adopted the game which had led these last 
into the clutches of the cunning Xibalbans, and they resolved to send a 
similar challenge to Hun-Apu and Xbalanque, thinking that the twins were 
unaware of the fate of Hunhun-Apu and Vukub-Hunapu. They therefore 
despatched messengers to the home of Xmucane with a challenge to play them 
at the ball-game, and Xmucane, alarmed by the nature of the message, sent a 
louse to warn her grandsons. The louse, unable to proceed as quickly as he 
wished, permitted himself to be swallowed by a toad, the toad by a serpent, 
and the serpent by the bird Voc, the messenger O Hurakan. At the end of the 
journey the other animals duly liberated each other, but the toad could not 
rid himself of the louse, who had in reality hidden himself in the toad's 
gums, and had not been swallowed at all. At last the message was delivered, 
and the twins returned to the abode of Xmucane, to bid farewell to their 
grandmother and mother. Before leaving they each planted a cane in the midst 
of the hut, saying that it would wither if any fatal accident befell them.

The Tricksters Tricked
They then proceeded to Xibalba, on the road trodden by Hunhun-Apu and Vukub-
Hunapu, and passed the river of blood.as the others had done. But they 
adopted the precaution of despatching ahead an animal called Xan as a sort 
of spy or scout. They commanded this animal to prick all the Xibalbans with 
a hair from Hun-Apu's leg, in order that they might discover which of them 
were made of wood, and incidentally learn the names of the others as they 
addressed one another when pricked by the hair. They were thus enabled to 
ignore the wooden images on their arrival at Xibalba, and they carefully 
avoided the red-hot stone. Nor did the ordeal of the House of Gloom affright 
them, and they passed through it scatheless. The inhabitants of the 
Underworld were both amazed and furious with disappointment. To add to their 
annoyance, they were badly beaten in the game of ball which followed. The 
Lords of Hell then requested the twins to bring them four bouquets of 
flowers from the royal garden of Xibalba, at the same time commanding the 
gardeners to keep good watch over the flowers so thaf none of them might be 
removed. But the brothers called to their aid a swarm of ants, who succeeded 
in returning with the flowers. The anger of the Xibalbans increased to a 
white fury, and they incarcerated Hun-Apu and Xbalanque in the House of 
Lances, a dread abode where demons armed with sharp spears thrust at them 
fiercely. But they bribed the lancers and escaped. The Xibalbans slit the 
beaks of the owls who guarded the royal gardens, and howled in fury.

The Houses of the Ordeals
They were next thrust into the House of Cold. Here they escaped a dreadful 
death from freezing by warming themselves with burning pine-cones. Into the 
House of Tigers and the House of Fire they were thrown for a night each, but 
escaped from both. But they were not so lucky in the House of Bats. As they 
threaded this place of terror, Camazotz, Ruler of the Bats, descended upon 
them with a whirring of leathern wings, and with one sweep of his sword-like 
claws cutoff Hun-Apu's head. (See Mictlan, pp. 95, 96.) But a tortoise which 
chanced to pass the severed neck of the hero's prostrate body and came into 
contact with it was immediately turned into a head, and Hun-Apu arose from 
his terrible experience not a whit the worse.

These various houses in which the brothers were forced to pass a certain 
time forcibly recall to our minds the several circles of Dante's Hell. 
Xibalba was to the Kiche not a place of punishment, but a dark place of 
horror and myriad dangers. No wonder the Maya had what Landa calls " an 
immoderate fear of death" if they believed that after it they would be 
transported to such a dread abode!

With the object of proving their immortal nature to their adversaries, Hun-
Apu and Xbalanque, first arranging for their resurrection with two 
sorcerers, Xulu and Pacaw, stretched themselves upon a bier and died. Their 
bones were ground to powder and thrown into the river. They then went 
through a kind of evolutionary process, appearing on the fifth day after 
their deaths as men-fishes and on the sixth as old men, ragged and 
tatterdemalion in appearance, killing and restoring each other to life. At 
the request of the princes of Xibalba, they burned the royal palace and 
restored it to its pristine splendour, killed and resuscitated the king's 
dog, and cut a man in pieces, bringing him to life again. The Lords of Hell 
were curious about the sensation of death, and asked to be killed and 
resuscitated. The first portion of their request the hero-brothers speedily 
granted, but did not deem it necessary to pay any regard to the second.

Throwing off all disguise, the brothers assembled the now thoroughly cowed 
princes of Xibalba, and announced their intention of punishing them for 
their animosity against themselves, their father and uncle. They were 
forbidden to partake in the noble and classic game of ball-a great indignity 
in the eyes of Maya of the higher caste-they were condemned to menial tasks, 
and they were to have sway over the beasts of the forest alone. After this 
their power rapidly waned. These princes of the Underworld are described as 
being owl-like, with faces painted black and white, as symbolical of their 
duplicity and faithless disposition.

As some reward for the dreadful indignities they had undergone, the souls of 
Hunhun-Apu and Vukub-Hunapu, the first adventurers into the darksome region 
of Xibalba, were translated to the skies, and became the sun and moon, and 
with this apotheosis the second book ends.

We can have no difficulty, in the light of comparative mythology, in seeing 
in the matter of this book a version of "the harrying of hell" common to 
many mythologies. In many primitive faiths a hero or heroes dares the 
countless dangers of Hades in order to prove to the savage mind that the 
terrors of death can be overcome. In Algonquian mythology Blue-Jay makes 
game of the Dead Folk whom his sister Ioi has married, and Balder passes 
through the Scandinavian Helheim. The god must first descend into the abyss 
and must emerge triumphant if humble folk are to possess assurance of 
immortality.

The Reality of Myth
It is from such matter as that found in the second book of the Popol Vuh 
that we are enabled to discern how real myth can be on occasion. It is 
obvious, as has been pointed out, that the dread of death in the savage mind 
may give rise to such a conception of its vanquishment as appears in the 
Popol Vuh. But there is reason to suspect that other elements have also 
entered into the composition of the myth. It is well known that an invading 
race, driving before them the remnants of a con uered people, are prone to 
regard these in the course of a few generations as almost supernatural and 
as denizens of a sphere more or less infernal. Their reasons for this are 
not difficult of comprehension. To begin with, a difference in ceremonial 
ritual gives rise to the belief that the inimical race practises magic. The 
enemy is seldom seen, and, if perceived, quickly takes cover or "vanishes." 
The majority of aboriginal races were often earth- or cave-dwellers, like 
the Picts of Scotland, and such the originals of the Xibalbans probably 
were.

The invading Maya-Kiche, encountering such a folk in the cavernous recesses 
of the hill-slopes of Guatemala, would naturally refer them to the 
Underworld. The cliff-dwellings of Mexico and Colorado exhibit manifest 
signs of the existence of such a cave-dwelling race. In the latter state is 
the Cliff Palace Caflon, a huge natural recess, within which a small city 
was actually built, which still remains in excellent preservation. In some 
such semi-subterranean recess, then, may the city of "Xibalba" have stood.

The Xibalbans
We can see., too, that the Xibalbans were not merely a plutonic race. 
Xibalba is not a Hell, a place of punishment for sin, but a place of the 
dead, and its inhabitants were scarcely "devils," nor evil gods. The 
transcriber of the Popol Vuh says of them: "In the old times they did not 
have much power. They were but annoyers and opposers of men, and, in truth, 
they were not regarded as gods." The word Xibalba is derived from a root 
meaning "to fear," from which comes the name for a ghost or phantom. Xibalba 
was thus the "Place of Phantoms."

The Third Book
The opening of the third book finds the gods once more deliberating as to 
the creation of man. Four men are evolved as the result of these 
deliberations. These beings were moulded from a paste of yellow and white 
maize, and were named Balam-Quitze (Tiger with the Sweet Smile), Balam-Agab 
(Tiger of the Night), Mahacutah (The Distinguished Name), and lqi-Balam 
(Tiger of the Moon).

But the god Hurakan who had formed them was not overpleased with his 
handiwork, for these beings were too much like the gods themselves. The gods 
once more took counsel, and agreed that man must be less perfect and possess 
less knowledge than this new race. He must not become as a god. So Hurakan 
breathed a cloud over their eyes in order that they might only see a portion 
of the earth, whereas before they had been able to see the whole round 
sphere of the world. After this the four men were plunged into a deep sleep, 
and four women were created, who were given them as wives. These were Caha-
Paluma (Falling Water), Choima (Beautiful Water), Tzununiha (House of the 
Water), and Cakixa (Water of Parrots, or Brilliant Water), who were espoused 
to the men in the respective order given above.

These eight persons were the ancestors of the Kiche only, after which were 
created the forerunners of the other peoples. At this time there was no sun, 
and comparative darkness lay over the face of the earth. Men knew not the 
art of worship, but blindly lifted their eyes to heaven and prayed the 
Creator to send them quiet lives and the light of day. But no sun came, and 
dispeace entered their hearts. So they journeyed to a place called Tulan-
Zuiva (The Seven Caves)-practically the same as Chicomoztoc in the Aztec 
mythand there gods were vouchsafed to them. The names of these were Tohil, 
whom Balam-Quitze recelved; Avilix, whom Balam-Agab received; and Hacavitz, 
granted to Mahacutah. lqi-Balarn received a god, but as he had no family his 
worship and knowledge died out.

The Granting of Fire
Grievously did the Kiche feel the want of fire in the sunless world they 
inhabited, but this the god Tohil (The Rumbler, the Fire-god) quickly 
provided them with. However, a mighty rain descended and extinguishcd all 
the fires in the land. These, however, were always supplied again by Tohil, 
who had only to strike his feet together to produce fire. In this figure 
there is no difficulty in seeing a fully developed thunder-god.

The Kiche Babel
Tulan-Zuiva was a place or great misfortune to the Kiche, for here the race 
suffered alienation in its different branches by reason of a confounding of 
their speech, which recalls the story of Babel. Owing to this the first four 
men were no longer able to comprehend each other, and determined to leave 
the place of their mischance and to seek the leadership of the god Tohil 
into another and more fortunate sphere. In this journey they met with 
innumerable hardships. Theyn had to cross many lofty mountains, and on one 
occasion had to make a long détour across the bed of the ocean, the waters 
of which were miraculously divided to permit of their passage. At last they 
arrived at a mountain which they called Hacavitz, after one of their 
deities, and here they remained, for it had been foretold that here they 
should see the sun. At last the luminary appeared. Men and beasts went wild 
with delight. although his beams were by no means strong, and he appeared 
more like a reflection in a mirror than the strong sun of later days whose 
fiery beams speedily sucked up the blood of victims on the altar. As he 
showed his face the three tribal gods of the Kiche were turned into stone, 
as were the gods or totems connected with the wild animals. Then arose the 
first Kiche town, or permanent dwelling-place.

The Last Days of the First Men
Time passed, and the first men of the Kiche race grew old. Visions came to 
them, in which they were exhorted by the gods to render human sacrifices, 
and in order to obey the divine injunctions they raided the neighbouring 
lands, the folk of which made a spirited resistance. But in a great battle 
the Kiche were miraculously assisted by a horde of wasps and hornets, which 
flew in the faces of their foes, stinging and blinding them, so that they 
could not wield weapon nor see to make any efFectivc resistance. After this 
battle the surrounding races became tributary to them.

Death of the First Men
Now the first men felt that their death-day was nigh, and they called their 
kin and dependents around them to hear their dying words. In the grief of 
their souls they chanted the song "Kamucu," the song "We see," that they had 
sung so joyfully when they had first seen the light of day. Then they parted 
from their wives and sons one by one. And of a sudden they were not, and in 
their place was a great bundle, which was never opened. It was called the " 
Majesty Enveloped." So died the first men of the Kiche.

In this book it is clear that we have to deal with the problem which the 
origin and creation of man presented to the Maya-Kiche mind. The several 
myths connected with it bear a close resemblance to those of other American 
peoples. In the mythology of the American Indian it is rare to find an Adam, 
a single figure set solitary in a world without companionship of some sort. 
Man is almost invariably the child of Mother Earth, and emerges from some 
cavern or subterranean country fully grown and fully equipped for the upper 
earth-life. We find this type of myth in the m thologies of the Aztecs, 
Peruvians, Choctaws, Blackfeet Indians, and those of many other American 
tribes.

American Migrations
We also find in the story of the Kiche migration a striking similarity to 
the migration myths of other American races. But in the Kiche myth we can 
trace a definite racial movement from the cold north to the warm south. The 
sun is not at first born. There is darkness. When he does appear he is weak 
and his beams are dull and watery like those of the luminary in a northern 
clime. Again, there are allusions to the crossing of rivers by means of 
"shining sand " which covered them, which might reasonably be held to imply 
the presence upon them of ice. In this connection we may quote from an Aztec 
migration myth which appears almost a parallel to the Kiche story.

"This is the beginning of the record of the coming of the Mexicans from the 
place called Aztlan. It is by means of the water that they came this way, 
being four tribes, and in coming they rowed in boats. They built their huts 
on piles at the place called the grotto of Quincveyan. It is there from 
which the eight tribes issued. The first tribe is that of the Huexotzincos., 
the second the Chalcas, the third the Xochimilcos, the fourth the 
Cuitlavacas, the fifth the Mallinalcas, the sixth the Chichimecas, the 
seventh the Tepanecas, the eighth the Matlatzincas. It is there where they 
were founded in Colhuacan. They were the colonists of it since they landed 
there, coming from Aztlan. . . . It is there that they soon afterwards went 
away from, carrying with them their god Vitzillopochtli. . . . There the 
eight tribes opened up our road by water."

The "Wallum Olum," or painted calendar records, of the Leni-Lenape Indians 
contain a similar myth.

"After the flood," says the story,"the Lenape with the manly turtle beings 
dwelt close together at the cave house and dwelling of Talli. . . . They saw 
that the snake-land was bright and wealthy. Having all agreed, they went 
over the water of the frozen sea to possess the land. It was wonderful when 
they all went over the smooth deep water of the frozen sea at the gap of the 
snake sea in the great ocean."

Do these myths contain any essence of the truth? Do they refer to an actual 
migration when the ancestors of certain American tribes crossed the frozen 
ocean of the Kamchatka Strait and descended from the sunless north and the 
boreal night of these subArctic regions to a more genial clime? Can such a 
tradition have been preserved throughout the countless ages which must have 
passed between the arrival of proto-Mongolian man in America and the writing 
or composition of the several legends cited? Surely not. But may there not 
have been later migrations from the north? May not hordes of folk distantly 
akin to the first Americans have swept across the frozen strait, and within 
a few generations have made their way into the warmer regions, as we know 
the Nahua did? The Scandinavian vikings who reached north-eastern America in 
the tenth century found there a race totally distinct from the Red Man, and 
more approaching the Esquimaux, whom they designated Skrellingr, or "Chips," 
so small and misshapen were they. Such a description could hardly have been 
applied to the North American Indian as we know him. From the legends of the 
Red race of North America we may infer that they remained for a number of 
generations in the Far West of the North American continent before they 
migrated eastward. And a guess might be hazarded to the effect that, 
arriving in America somewhere about the dawn of the Christian era, they 
spread slowly in a south-easterly direction, arriving in the eastern parts 
of North America about the end of the eleventh century, or even a little 
later. This would mean that such a legend as that which we have just perused 
would only require to have survived a thousand years, provided the Popol Vuh 
was first composed about the eleventh century, as appears probable. But such 
speculations are somewhat dangerous in the face of an almost complete lack 
of evidence, and must be met with the utmost caution and treated as surmises 
only.

Cosmogony of the "Popol Vuh"
We have now completed our brief survey of the mythological portion of the 
Popol Vuh, and it will be well at this point to make some inquiries into the 
origin and nature of the various gods, heroes, and similar personages who 
fill its pages. Before doing so, however, let us glance at the creation-myth 
which we find detailed in the first book. We can see by internal evidence 
that this must be the result of the fusion of more than one creation-story. 
We find in the myth that mention is made of a number of beings each of whom 
appears to exercise in some manner the functions of a creator or "moulder." 
These beings also appear to have similar attributes. There is evidently here 
the reconciliation of early rival faiths. We know that this occurred in 
Peruvian cosmogony, which is notoriously composite, and many another 
mythology, European and Asiatic, exhibits a like phenomenon. Even in the 
creation-story as given in Genesis we can discover the fusion of two 
separate accounts from the allusion to the creative power as both "Jahveh " 
and " Elohim," the plural ending of the second name proving the presence of 
polytheistic as well as monotheistic conceptions.

Antiquity of the "Popol Vuh"
These considerations lead to the assumption that the Popol Vuh is a 
mythological collection of very considerable antiquity, as the fusion of 
religious beliefs is a comparatively slow process. It is, of course, in the 
absence of other data, impossible to fix the date of its origin, even 
approximately. We possess only the one version of this interesting work, so 
that we are compelled to confine ourselves to the consideration of that 
alone, and are without the assistance which philology would lend us by a 
comparison of two versions of different dates.

The Father-Mother Gods
We discover a pair of dual beings concerned in the Kiche creation. These are 
Xpiyacoc and Xmucane, the Father-Mother deities, and are obviously Kiche 
equivalents to the Mexican Ometecutli-Omeciuatl, whom we have already 
noticed (pp. 103-4). The former is the male fructifier, whilst the name of 
the latter signifies " Female Vigour." These deities were probably regarded 
as hermaphroditic, as numerous North American Indian gods appear to be, and 
may be analogous to the "Father Sky" and "Mother Earth " of so many 
mythologies.

Gucumatz
We also find Gucumatz concerned in the Kiche scheme of creation. He was a 
Maya-Kiche form of the Mexican Quetzalcoatl, or perhaps the converse was the 
case. The name signifies, like its Nahua equivalent, "Serpent with Green 
Feathers."

Hurakan
Hurakan) the wind-god, " He who hurls below," whose name perhaps signifies 
"The One-legged," is probably the same as the Nahua Tezcatlipoca. It has 
been suzeested that the word "hurricane " has been evolved rrom the name of 
this god, but the derivation seems rather too fortuitous to be real. Hurakan 
had the assistance of three sub-gods, Cakulha-Hurakan (Lightning), Chipi-
Cakulha (Lightning-flash), and Raxa-Cakulha (Track of the Lightning).

Hun-Apu and Xbalanque
Hun-Apu and Xbalanque, the hero-gods, appear to have the attributes of demi-
gods in general. The name Hun-Apu means " Master " or "Magician," and 
Xbalanque "Little Tiger." We find many such figures in American myth, which 
is rich in hero-gods.

Vukub-Cakix and his Sons
Vukub-Cakix and his progeny are, of course, earth-giants like the Titans of 
Greek mytnology or the Jötuns of Scandinavian story. The removal of the 
emerald teeth of Vukub-Cakix and their replacement by grains of maize would 
seem to be a mythical interpretation or allegory of the removal of the 
virgin turf of the earth and its replacement by maize-seed. Therefore it is 
possible that Vukub-Cakix is an earth-god, and not a prehistoric sun-and-
moon god, as stated by Dr. Seler.

Metrical Origin of the "Popol Vuh"
There is reason to believe that the Popol Vuh was originally a metrical 
composition. This would assist the hypothesis of its antiquity, on the 
ground that it was for generations recited before being reduced to writing. 
Passages here and there exhibit a decided metrical tendency, and one 
undoubtedly applies to a descriptive dance symbolical of sunrise. It is as 
follows:

"'Ama x-u ch'ux ri Vuch?'
'Ve,' x-cha ri mama.
Ta chi xaquinic.
Quate ta chi gecumarchic.
Cahmul xaquin ri mama.
'Ca xaquin-Vuch,' ca cha vinak vacamic."
This may be rendered freely:

"'Is the dawn about to be?'
Yes,' answered the old man.
Then he spread apart his legs.
Again the darkness appeared.
Four times the old man spread his legs.
'Now the opossum spreads his legs,' Say the people."
It is obvious that many of these lines possess the well-known quality of 
savage dance-poetry, which displays itself in a rhythm of one long foot 
followed by two short ones. We know that the Kiche were very fond of 
ceremonial dances, and of repeating long chants which they called nugum 
tzih, or "garlands of words," and the Popol Vuh, along with other matter, 
probably contained many of these.

Pseudo-History of the Kiche
The fourth book of the Popol Vuh contains the pseudo-history of the Kiche 
kings. It is obviously greatly confused, and it would be difficult to say 
how much of it originally belonged to the Popol Vuh and how much had been 
added or invented by its latest compiler. One cannot discriminate between 
saga and history, or between monarchs and gods, the real and the fabulous. 
Interminable conflicts are the theme of most of the book, and many 
migrations are recounted.

Queen Móo
Whilst dealing with Maya pseudo-history it will be well to glance for a 
moment at the theories of the late Augustus Le Plongeon, who lived and 
carried on excavations in Yucatan for many years. Dr. Le Plongeon was 
obsessed with the idea that the ancient Maya spread their civilisation all 
over the habitable globe, and that they were the originators of the 
Egyptian, Palestinian, and Hindu civilisations, besides many others. He 
furthermore believed himself to be the true elucidator of the Maya system of 
hieroglyphs, which in his estimation were practically identical with the 
Egyptian. We will not attempt to refute his theories, as they are based on 
ignorance of the laws which govern philology, anthropology, and mythology. 
But he possessed a thorough knowledge of the Maya tongue, and his 
acquaintance with Maya customs was extensive and peculiar. One of his ideas 
was that a certain hall among the ruins of Chichen-Itza had been built b a 
Queen Móo, a Maya princess who after the tragic fate of her brother-husband 
and the catastrophe which ended in the sinking of the continent of Atlantis 
fled to Egypt, where she founded the ancient Egyptian civilisation. It would 
be easy to refute this theory. But the tale as told by Dr. Le Plongeon 
possesses a sufficiency of romantic interest to warrant its being rescued 
from the little-known volume in which he published it. [Queen Móo and the 
Egyptian Sphinx (London, 1896).]

We do not learn from Dr. Le Plongeon's book by what course of reasoning he 
came to discover that the name of his heroine was the rather uneuphonious 
one of Móo. Probably he arrived at it by the same process as that by which 
he discovered that certain Mayan architectural ornaments were in reality 
Egyptian letters. But it will be better to let him tell his story in his own 
words. It is as follows

The Funeral Chamber
"As we are about to enter the funeral chamber hallowed by the love of the 
sister-wife, Queen Móo, the beauty of the carvings on the zapote beam that 
forms the lintel of the doorway calls our attention. Here is represented the 
antagonism of the brothers Aac and Coh, that led to the murder ot the latter 
by the former. Carved on the lintel are the names of these personages, 
represented by their totems-a leopard head for Coh, and a boar head as well 
as a turtle for Aac, this word meaning both boar and turtle in Maya. Aac is 
pictured within the disk of the sun, his protective deity which he 
worshipped, according to mural inscriptions at Uxmal. Full of anger he faces 
his brother. In his right hand there is a badge ornamented with feathers and 
flowers. The threatening way in which this is held suggests a concealed 
weapon. . . . The face of Coh also expresses anger. With him is the 
feathered serpent, emblematic of royalty, thence of the country, more often 
represented as a winged serpent protecting Coh. In his left hand he holds 
his weapon down, whilst his right hand clasps his badge of authority, with 
which he covers his breasts as for protection, and demanding the respect due 
to his rank. . . .

"Passing between the figures of armed chieftains sculptured on the iambs of 
the doorway, and seeming like sentinels guarding the entrance of the funeral 
chamber, we notice one wearing a headdress similar to the crown of Lower 
Egypt, which formed part of the pshent of the Egyptian monarchs.

The Frescoes
"The frescoes in the funeral chamber of Prince Coh's Memorial Hall, painted 
in water-colours taken from the vegetable kingdom, are divided into a series 
of tableaux separated by blue lines. The plinths, the angles of the room, 
and the edges of the ceiling, being likewise painted blue, indicate that 
this was intended for a funeral chamber. . . . The first scene represents 
Queen Móo while yet a child. She is seated on the back of a peccary, or 
American wild boar, under the royal umbrella of feathers, emblem of royalty 
in Mayach, as it was in India, Chaldea, and other places. She is consulting 
a h-men, or wise man; listening with profound attention to the decrees of 
fate as revealed by the cracking of the shell of an armadillo exposed to a 
slow fire on a brazier, the condensing on it of the vapour, and the various 
tints it assumes. This mode of divination is one of the customs of the 
Mayas. . . .

The Soothsayers
"In front of the young Queen Móo, and facing her, is seated the soothsayer, 
evidently a priest of high rank, judging from the colours, blue and yellow, 
of the feathers of his ceremonial mantle. He reads the decrees of fate on 
the snell of the armadillo, and the scroll issuing from his throat says what 
they are. By him stands the winged serpent, emblem and protective genius of 
the Maya Empire. His head is turned towards the royal banner, which he seems 
to caress. His satisfaction is reflected in the mild and pleased expression 
of his face. Behind the priest, the position of whose hand is the same as 
that of Catholic priests in blessing their congregation, and the 
significance of which is well known to occultists, are the ladies-inwaiting 
of the young Queen.

The Royal Bride
"In another tableau we again see Queen Móo, no longer a child, but a comely 
young woman. She is not seated under the royal umbrella or banner, but she 
is once more in the presence of the h-men, whose face is concealed by a mask 
representing an owl's head. She, pretty and coquettish, has many admirers, 
who vie with each other for the honour of her hand. In company with one of 
her wooers she comes to consult the priest, accompanied by an old lady, her 
grandmother probably, and her female attendants. According to custom the old 
lady is the spokeswoman. She states to the priest that the young man, he who 
sits on a low stool between two female attendants desires to marry the 
Queen. The priest's attendant, seated also on a stool, back of all, acts as 
crier, and repeats in a loud voice the speech of the old lady.

Móo's Refusal
"The young Queen refuses the offer. The refusal is indicated by the 
direction of the scroll issuing from her mouth. It is turned backward, 
instead of forward towards the priest, as would be the case if she assented 
to the marriage. The h-men explains that Moo, being a daughter of the royal 
family, by law and custom must marry one of her brothers. The youth listens 
to the decision with due respect to the priest, as shown by his arm being 
placed across his breast, the left hand resting on the right shoulder. He 
does not accept the refusal in a meek spirit, however. His clenched fist, 
his foot raised as in the act of stamping, betoken anger and disappointment, 
while the attendant behind him expostulates, counselling patience and 
resignation, judging by the position and expression of her lefthand palm 
upward.

The Rejected Suitor
"In another tableau we see the same individual whose offer of marriage was 
rejected by the young Queen in consultation with a nubchi, or prophet, a 
priest whose exalted rank is indicated by his headdress, and the triple 
breastplate he wears over his mantle of feathers. The consulter, evidently a 
person of importance, has come attended by his hachetail, or confidential 
friend, who sits behind him on a cushion. The expression on the face of the 
said consulter shows that he does not accept patiently the decrees of fate, 
although conveyed by the interpreter in as conciliatory a manner as 
possible. The adverse decision of the gods is manifested by the sharp 
projecting centre part of the scroll, but it is wrapped in words as 
persuasive and consoling, preceded by as smooth a preamble as the rich and 
beautiful Maya language pernrits and makes easy. His fricrid is addressing 
the prophet's assistant. Reflecting the thoughts of his lord, he declares 
that the nubehi's fine discourse and his pretended reading of the will of 
the gods are all nonsense, and exclaims 'Pshaw!' which contemptuous 
exclamation is pictured by the yellow scroll, pointed at both ends, escaping 
from his nose like a sneeze. The answer of the priest's assistant, evidenced 
by the gravity of his features, the assertive position of his hand, and the 
bluntness of his speech, is evidently 'It is so!'

Aac's Fierce Wooing
"Her brother Aac is madly in love with Móo. He is portrayed approaching the 
interpreter of the will of the gods, divested of his garments in token of 
humility in presence of their majesty and of submission to their decrees. He 
comes full of arrogance, arrayed in gorgeous attire, and with regal pomp. He 
comes not as a suppliant to ask and accept counsel, but haughty, he makes 
bold to dictate. He is angered at the refusal of the priest to accede to his 
demand for his sister Móo's hand, to whose totem, an armadillo on this 
occasion, he points imperiously. It was on an armadillo's shell that the 
fates wrote her destiny when consulted by the performance of the Pou 
ceremony. The yellow flames of wrath darting from all over his person, the 
sharp yellow scroll issuing from his mouth, symbolise Aac's feelings. The 
pontiff, however, is unmoved by them. In the name of the gods with serene 
mien he denies the request of the proud noble man, as his speech indicates. 
The winged serpent, genius of the country, that stands erect and ireful by 
Aac, is also wroth at his pretensions, and shows in its features and by 
sending its dart through Aac's royal banner a decided opposition to them, 
expressed by the ends of his speech being turned backwards, some of them 
terminating abruptly, others in sharp points.

Prince Cob
"Prince Coh sits behind the priest as one of his attendants. He witnesses 
the scene, hears the calm negative answer, sees the anger of his brother and 
rival, smiles at his impotence, is happy at his discomfiture. Behind him, 
however, sits a spy who will repeat his words, report his actions to his 
enemy. He listens, he watches. The high-priest himself, Cay, their elder 
brother, sees the storm that is brewing behind the dissensions of Coh and 
Aac. He trembles at the thought of the misfortunes that will surely befall 
the dynasty of the Cans, of the ruin and misery of the country that will 
certainly follow. Divested of his priestly raiment, he comes nude and humble 
as it is proper for men in the presence of the gods, to ask their advice how 
best to avoid the impending calamities. The chief of the auspices is in the 
act of reading their decrees on the palpitating entrails of a fish. The sad 
expression on his face, that of humble resignation on that of the pontiff of 
deferential astonishment on that of the assistant, speak of the inevitable 
misfortunes which are to come in the near future.

"We pass over interesting battle scenes . . . in which the defenders have 
been defeated by the Mayas. Coh will return to his queen loaded with spoils 
that he will lay at her feet with his glory, which is also hers.

The Murder of Cob
"We next see him in a terrible altercation with his brother Aac. The figures 
in that scene are nearly life size, but so much disfigured and broken as to 
make it impossible to obtain good tracings. Coh is portrayed without 
weapons, his fists clenched, looking menacingly at his foe, who holds three 
spears, typical of the three wounds he inflicted in his brother's back when 
he killed him treacherously. Coh is now laid out, being prepared for 
cremation. His body has been opened at the ribs to extract the viscera and 
heart, which, after being charred, are to be preserved in a stone urn with 
cinnabar, where the writer found them in 18 7 S. His sister-wife, Queen Móo, 
in sad contemplation of the remain-, of the beloved, . . . kneels at his 
feet. . . . The winged serpent, protective genius of the country, is 
pictured without a head. The ruler of the country has been slain. He is 
dead. The people are without a chief."

The Widowhood of Móo
The widowhood of Móo is then said to be portrayed in subsequent pictures. 
Other suitors, among them Aac, make their proposals to her, but she refuses 
them all. "Aac's pride being humiliated, his love turned to hatred. His only 
wish henceforth was to usurp the supreme power, to wage war against the 
friend of his childhood. He made religious disagreement the pretext. He 
proclaimed that the worship of the sun was to be superior to that of the 
winged serpent, the genius of the country; also to that of the worship of 
ancestors, typified by the feathered serpent, with horns and a flame or halo 
on the head. . . . Prompted by such evil passions, he put himself at the 
head of his own vassals, and attacked those who had remained faithful to 
Queen Móo and to Prince Coh's memory. At first Moo's adherents successfully 
opposed her foes. The contending parties, forgetting in the strife that they 
were children of the same soil, blinded by their prejudices, let their 
passions have the better of their reason. At last Queen Móo fell a prisoner 
in the hands of her enemy.

The Manuscript Troano
Dr. Le Plongeon here assumes that the story is taken up by the Manuscript 
Troano. As no one is able to decipher this manuscript completely, he is 
pretty safe in nis assertion. Here is what the pintura alluded to says 
regarding Queen Móo, according to our author:

"The people of Mayach having been whipped into submission and cowed., no 
longer opposing much resistance, the lord seized her by the hair, and, in 
common with others, caused her to suffer from blows. This happened on the 
ninth day of the tenth month of the year Kan. Being completely routed, she 
passed to the opposite sea-coast in the southern parts of the country, which 
had already suffered much injury."

Here we shall leave the Queen, and those who have been sufficiently 
credulous to create and believe in her and her companions. We do not aver 
that the illustrations on the walls of the temple at Chichen do not allude 
to some such incident, or series of incidents, as Dr. Le Plongeon describes, 
but to bestow names upon the dramatis persone in the face of almost complete 
inability to read the Maya script and a total dearth of accompanying 
historical manuscripts is merely futile, and we must regard Dr. Le 
Plongeon's narrative as a quite fanciful rendering of probability. At the 
same time, the light which he throws-if some obviously unscientific remarks 
be deducted-on the customs of the Maya renders his account of considerable 
interest, and that must be our excuse for presenting it here at some length.


CHAPTER VI: THE CIVILISATION OF OLD PERU
Old Peru
IF the civilisation of ancient Peru did not achieve the standard of general 
culture reached by the Mexicans and Maya, it did not fall far short of the 
attainment of these peoples. But the degrading despotism under which the 
peasantry groaned in Inca times, and the brutal and sanguinary tyranny of 
the Apu-Ccapac Incas, make the rulers of Mexico at their worst appear as 
enlightened when compared with the Peruvian governing classes. The Quichua-
Aymara race which inhabited Peru was inferior to the Mexican in general 
mental culture, if not in mental capacity, is is proved by its inability to 
invent any method of written communication or any adequate time-reckoning. 
In imitative art, too, the Peruvians were weak, save in pottery and rude 
modelling, and their religion savoured much more of the materialistic, and 
was altogether of a lower cultus.

The Country
The country in which the interesting civilisation of the Inca race was 
evolved presents physical features which profoundly affected the history of 
the race. In fact, it is probable that in no country in the world has the 
configuration of the land so modified the events in the life of the people 
dwelling within its borders. The chain of the Andes divides into two 
branches near the boundary between Bolivia and Chile, and, with the 
Cordillera de la Costa, encloses at a height of over 3000 feet the 
Desaguadero, a vast tableland with an area equal to France. To the north of 
this is Cuzco, the ancient capital of the Incas, to the south Potosi, the 
most elevated town in the world, whilst between them lies Lake Titicaca, the 
largest body of fresh water in South America. The whole country is dreary 
and desolate in the extreme. Cereals cannot ripen, and animals arc rare. Yet 
it was in these desolate regions that the powerful and highly organised 
empire of Peru arose-an empire extending over an area 3000 miles long by 400 
broad.

The Andeans
The prehistoric natives of the Andean region had evolved a civilisation long 
before the days of the Inca dynasties, and the cyclopean ruins of their 
edifices are to be found at intervals scattered over a wide field on the 
slopes of the range under the shadow of which they dwelt. Their most 
extraordinary achievement was probably the city of Tiahuanaco, on the 
southern shore of Lake Titicaca, built at a level 13,000 feet above the sea, 
occupying nearly half an acre in extent, and constructed of enormous 
megalithic blocks of trachytic rock. The great doorway, carved out of a 
single block of rock, is 7 feet in height by 131 feet wide, and 1½ feet 
thick. The upper portion of this massive portal is carved with symbolic 
figures. In the centre is a figure in high relief, the head surrounded by 
solar rays, and in each hand a sceptre, the end of which terminates in the 
head of a condor. This figure is flanked on either side by three tiers of 
kneeling suppliants, each of whom is winged and bears a sceptre similar in 
design to the central ones. Elsewhere are mighty blocks of stone, some 36 
feet long, remains of enormous walls, standing monoliths, and in earlier 
times colossal statues were seen on the site. When the Spanish conquerors 
arrived no tradition remained regarding the founders of these structures, 
and their origin still remains a mystery; but that they represent the 
remains of the capital of some mighty prehistoric kingdom is practically 
admitted.

A Strange Site
The greatest mystery of all regarding the ruins at Tiahuanaco is the 
selection of the site. For what reason did the prehistoric rulers of Peru 
build here? The surroundings are totally unsuitable for the raising of such 
edifices, and the tableland upon which they are placed is at once desolate 
and difficult of access. The snow-line is contiguous, and breathing at such 
a height is no easy matter. There is no reason to suppose that climatic 
conditions in the day of these colossal builders were different from those 
which obtain at the present time. In face of these facts the position of 
Tiahuanaco remains an insoluble riddle.

Sacsahuaman and Ollantay
Other remains of these prehistoric people are found in various parts of 
Peru. At Sacsahuaman, perched on a hill above the city of Cuzco, is an 
immense fortified work six hundred yards long, built in three lines of wall 
consisting of enormous stones, some of which are twen tyseven feet in 
length. Pissac is also the site of wonderful ruined masonry and an ancient 
observatory. At Ollantay-tampu, forty-five miles to the north of Cuzco, is 
another of these gigantic fortresses, built to defend the valley of the 
Yucay. This stronghold is constructed for the most part of red porphyry, and 
its walls average twenty-five feet in height. The great cliff on which 
Ollantay is perched is covered from end to end with stupendous walls which 
zigzag from point to point of it like the salient angles of some modern 
fortalice. At intervals are placed round towers of stone provided with 
loopholes, from which doubtless arrows were discharged at the enemy. This 
outwork embraces a series of terraces, world-famous because of their 
gigantic outline and the problem of the use to which they were put. It is 
now practically agreed that these terraces were employed for the production 
of maize, in order that during a prolonged investment the beleaguered troops 
and country-folk might not want for a sufficiency of provender. The stone of 
which this fortress was built was quarried at a distance of seven miles, in 
a spot upwards of three thousand feet above the valley, and was dragged up 
the steep declivity of Ollantay by sheer human strength. The nicety with 
which the stones were fitted is marvellous.

The Dramatic Legend of Ollantay
Among the dramatic works with which the ancient Incas were credited is that 
of Apu-Ollanta, which may recount the veritable story of a chieftain after 
whom the great stronghold was named. It was probably divided into scenes and 
supplied with stage directions at a later period, but the dialogue and son-
as are truly aboriginal. The period is that of the reign of the Inca 
Yupanqui Pachacutic., one of the most celebrated of the Peruvian monarchs. 
The central figure of the drama is a chieftain named Ollanta, who conceived 
a violent passion for a daughter of the Inca named Curi-Coyllur (Joyful 
Star). This passion was deemed unlawful, as no mere subject who was not of 
the blood-royal might aspire to the hand of a daughter of the Inca. As the 
play opens we overhear a dialogue between Ollanta and his man-servant Piqui-
Chaqui (Flea-footed), who supplies what modern stage-managers would 
designate the "comic relief" They are talking of Ollanta's love for the 
princess, when they are confronted by the high-priest of the Sun, who tries 
to dissuade the rash chieftain from the dangerous course he is taking by 
means of a miracle. In the next scene Curi-Coyllur is seen in company with 
her mother, sorrowing over the absence of her lover. A harvest song is here 
followed by a love ditty of undoubtedly ancient origin. The third scene 
represents Ollanta's interview with the Inca in which he pleads his suit and 
is slighted by the scornful monarch. Ollanta defies the king in a resounding 
speech, with which the first act concludes. In the first scene of the second 
act we are informed that the disappointed chieftain has raised the standard 
of rebellion, and the second scene is taken up with the military 
preparations consequent upon the announcement of a general rising. In the 
third scene Rumihaui as general of the royal forces admits defeat by the 
rebels.

The Love Story of Curi-Coyllur
Curi-Coyllur gives birth to a daughter, and is imprisoned in the darksome 
Convent of Virgins. Her child, Yma Sumac (How Beautiful), is brought up in 
the same building, but is ignorant of the near presence of her mother. The 
little girl tells her guardian of groans and lamentations which she has 
heard in the convent garden, and of the tumultuous emotions with which these 
sad sounds fill her heart. The Inca Pachacutic's death is announced., and 
the accession of his son, Yupanqui. Rebellion breaks out once more, and the 
suppression of the malcontents is again entrusted to Rumi-fiaui. That 
leader, having tasted defeat already, resorts to cunning. He conceals his 
men in a valley close by, and presents himself covered with blood before 
Ollanta, who is at the head of the rebels. He states that he has been 
barbarously used by the royal troops, and that he desires to join the 
rebels. He takes part with Ollanta and his men in a drunken frolic, in which 
he incites them to drink heavily, and when they arc overcome with liquor he 
brings up his troops and makes them prisoners.

Mother and Child
Yma Sumac, the beautiful little daughter of CuriCoyllur, requests her 
guardian, Pitu Salla, so pitifully to be allowed to visit her mother in her 
dungeon that the woman consents, and mother and child are united. Ollanta is 
brought as a prisoner before the new Inca, who pardons him. At that juncture 
Yma Sumac enters hurriedly, and begs the monarch to free her mother, Curi-
Coyllur. The Inca proceeds to the prison, restores the princess to her 
lover, and the drama concludes with the Inca bestowing his blessing upon the 
pair.

The play was first put into written form in the seventeenth century, has 
often been printed, and is now recognised as a genuine aboriginal 
production.

The Races of Peru
Many races went to make up the Peruvian people as they existed when first 
discovered by the conquering Spaniards. From the south came a civilising 
race which probably found a number of allied tribes, each existing 
separately in its own little valley, speaking a different dialect, or even 
language, from its neighbours, and in many instances employing different 
customs. Although tradition alleged that these invaders came from the north 
by sea within historical times, the more probable theory of their origin is 
one which states that they had followed the course of the affluents of the 
Amazon to the valleys where they dwelt when the more enlightened folk from 
the south came upon them. The remains of this aboriginal people-for, though 
they spoke diverse languages, the probability is that they were of one or 
not more than two stocks-are still found scattered over the coastal valleys 
in pyramidal mounds and adobe-built dwellings.

The Coming of the Incas
The arrival of the dominant race rudely broke in upon the peaceful existence 
of the aboriginal folk. This race, the Quichua-Aymara, probably had its 
place of origin in the Altaplanicie highlands of Bolivia, the eastern 
cordillera of the Andes. This they designated Tucuman (World's End), just as 
the Kiche of Guatemala were wont to describe the land of their origin as Ki 
Pixab (Corner of the Earth). The present republic of Argentina was at a 
remote period covered by a vast, partially land-locked sea, and beside the 
shores of this the ancestors of the Quichua-Aymara race may have settled as 
fishers and fowlers. They found a more permanent settlement on the shores of 
Lake Titicaca, where their traditions state that they made considerable 
advances in the arts of civilisation. It was, indeed, from Titicaca that the 
sun emerged from the sacred rock where he had erstwhile hidden himself. 
Here, too, the llama and paco were domesticated and agricultural life 
initiated, or perfected. The arts of irrigation and terrace-building-so 
marked as features of Peruvian civilisation-were also invented in this 
region, and the basis of a composite advancement laid.

The Quichua-Aymara
This people consisted of two groups, the Quichua and Aymara, so called from 
the two kindred tongues spoken by each respectively. These possess a common 
grammatical structure, and a great number of words are common to both. They 
are in reality varying forms of one speech. From the valley of Titicaca the 
Aymara spread from the source of the Amazon river to the higher parts of the 
Andes range, so that in course of time they exhibited those qualities which 
stamp the mountaineer in every age and clime. The Quichua, on the other 
hand, occupied the warm valleys beyond the river Apurimac, to the north-west 
of the Aymara-speaking people-a tract equal to the central portion of the 
modern republic of Peru. The name "Quichua " implies a warm valley or 
sphere, in contradistinction to the "Yunca," or tropical districts of the 
coast and low lands.

The Four Peoples
The metropolitan folk or Cuzco considered Peru to be divided into four 
sections-that of the Colla-suyu, with the valley of Titicaca as its centre, 
and stretching from the Bolivian highlands to Cuzco; the Conti-suyu, between 
the Colla-suyu and the ocean; the Quichua Chinchay-suyu, of the north-west; 
and the Anti-suyu, of the montaña region. The Inca people, coming suddenly 
into these lands, annexed them with surprising rapidity, and, making the 
aboriginal tribes dependent upon their rule, spread themselves over the face 
of the country. Thus the ancient chroniclers. But it is obvious that such 
rapid conquest was a practical impossibility, and it is now understood that 
the Inca power was consolidated only some hundred years before the coming of 
Pizarro.

The Coming of Manco Ccapac
Peruvian myth has its Quetzalcoatl in Manco Ccapac, a veritable son of the 
sun. The Life-aiver. observing the deplorable condition of mankind, who 
seemed to exist for war and feasting alone, despatched his son, Manco 
Ccapac, and his sister-wife, Mama Oullo Huaca, to earth for the purpose of 
instructing the degraded peoples in the arts of civilised life. The heavenly 
pair came to earth in the neighbourhood of Lake Titicaca, and were provided 
with a golden wedge which they were assured would sink into the earth at the 
precise spot on which they should commence their missionary labours. This 
phenomenon occurred at Cuzco, where the wedge disappeared. The derivation of 
the name Cuzco, which means "Navel" or, in more modern terms, "Hub of the 
Universe," proves that it was regarded as a great culture-centre. On this 
spot the civilising a ents pitched their camp, gathering the uncultured folk 
ofthe country around them. Whilst Manco taught the men the arts of 
agriculture, Mama Oullo instructed the women in those of weaving and 
spinning. Great numbers gathered in the vicinity of Cuzco, and the 
foundations of a city were laid. Under the mild rule of the heavenly pair 
the land of Peru abounded in every desirable thing, like the Eden of 
Genesis. The legend of Manco Ccapac as we have it from an old Spanish source 
is worth giving. It is as follows: "There [in Tiahuanaco] the creator began 
to raise up the people and nations that are in that region, making one of 
each nation in clay, and painting the dresses that each one was to wear; 
those that were to wear their hair, with hair, and those that were to be 
shorn, with hair cut. And to each nation was given the language that was to 
be spoken, and the songs to be sung, and the seeds and food that they were 
to sow. When the creator had finished painting and making the said nations 
and figures of clay, he gave life and soul to each one, as well man as 
woman, and ordered that they should pass under the earth. Thence each nation 
came up in the places to which he ordered them to go. Thus they say that 
some came out of caves, others issued from hills, others from fountains, 
others from the trunks of trees. From this cause and others, and owing to 
having come forth and multiplied from those places, and to having had the 
beginning of their lineage in them, they made huacas [sacred things] and 
places of worship of them, in memory of the origin of their lineage. Thus 
each nation uses the dress with which they invest their huana; and they say 
that the first that was born in that place was there turned into stone. 
Others say that they were turned into falcons, condors, and other animals 
and birds. Hence the huacas they use are in different shapes."

The Peruvian Creation-Story
The Incan Peruvians believed that all things emanated from Pachacamac, the 
all-pervading spirit, who provided the plants and animals (which they 
believed to be pro. duced from the earth) with "souls." The earth itself 
they designated Pachacamama (Earth-Mother). Here we observe that Pachacamac 
was more the maker and moulder than the originator of matter, a view common 
to many American mythologies. Pachacamac it was who breathed the breath of 
life into man, but the Peruvian conception of him was only evolved in later 
Inca times, and by no means existed in the early days of Inca rule, although 
he was probably worshipped before this under another and less exalted shape. 
The mere exercise of will or thought was sufficient, according to the 
Peruvians, to accomplish the creative act. In the prayers to the creator, 
and in other portions of Inca rite, we read such expressions as "Let a man 
be," "Let a woman be," and "The creative word," which go to prove that the 
Peruvian consciousness had fully grasped the idea of a creator capable of 
evolving matter out of nothingness. Occasionally we find the sun acting as a 
kind of demiurge or sub-creator. He it is who in later legend founds the 
city of Cuzco, and sends thither three eggs composed of gold, silver, and 
copper, from which spring the three classes of Peruvians, kings, priests, 
and slaves. The inevitable deluge occurs, after which we find the 
prehistoric town of Tiahuanaco regarded as the theatre of a new creation of 
man. Here the creator made man, and separated him into nations, making one 
of each nation out of the clay of the earth, painting the dresses that each 
was to wear, and endowing them with national songs, languages, seeds to sow 
suitable to the environment of each, and food such as they would require. 
Then he gave the peoples life and soul, and commanded them to enter the 
bowels of the earth, whence they came upward in the places where be ordered 
them to go. Perhaps this is one of the most complete ("wholesale" would be a 
better word) creation myths in existence, and we can glean from its very 
completeness that it is by no means of simple origin, but of great 
complexity. It is obviously an attempt to harmonise several conflicting 
creation-stories, notably those in which the people are spoken of as 
emanating from caves, and the later one of the creation of men at 
Tiahuanaco, probably suggested to the Incas by the immense ruins at that 
place, for which they could not otherwise account.

Local Creation-Myths
In some of the more isolated valleys of Peru we discover local creation-
myths. For example, in the coastal valley of Irma Pachacamac was not 
considered to be the creator of the sun, but to be himself a descendant of 
it. The first human beings created by him were speedily separated, as the 
man died of hunger, but the woman supported herself by living on roots. The 
sun took compassion upon her and gave her a son whom Pachacamac slew and 
buried. But from his teeth there grew maize, from his ribs the long white 
roots of the manioc plant, and from his flesh various esculent plants.

The Character of Inca Civilisation
Apart from the treatment which they meted out to the subject races under 
their sway, the rule of the Inca monarchs was enlightened and contained the 
elements of high civilisation. It is scarcely clear whether the Inca race 
arrived in the country at such a date as would have permitted them to profit 
by adopting the arts and sciences of the Andean people who preceded them. 
But it may be affirmed that their arrival considerably post-dated the fall 
of the megalithic empire of the Andeans, so that in reality their 
civilisation was of their own manufacture. As architects they were by no 
means the inferiors of the prehistoric race, if the examples of their art 
did not bulk so massively, and the engineering skill with which they pushed 
long, straight tunnels through vast mountains and bridged seemingly 
impassable gorges still excites the wonder of modern expcrts. They also made 
long, straight roads after the most improved macadamised model. Their 
temples and palaces were adorned with gold and silver images and ornaments; 
sumptuous baths supplied witb hot and cold water by means of pipes laid in 
the earth were to be found in the mansions of the nobility, and much luxury 
and real comfort prevailed.

An Absolute Theocracy
The empire of Peru was the most absolute theocracy the world has ever seen. 
The Inca was the direct representative of the sun upon earth, the head of a 
socio-religious edifice intricate and highly organised. This colossal 
bureaucracy had ramifications into the very homes of the people. The Inca 
was represented in the provinces by governors of the blood-royal. Officials 
were placea above ten thousand families, a thousand families, and even ten 
families, upon the principle that the rays of the sun enter everywhere, and 
that therefore the light of the Inca must penetrate to every corner of the 
empire. There was no such thing as personal freedom. Every man, woman, and 
child was numbered, branded, and under surveillance as much as were the 
llamas in the royal herds. Individual effort or enterprise was unheard of. 
Some writers have stated that a system of state socialism obtained in Peru. 
If so, then state surveillance in Central Russia might also be branded as 
socialism. A man's life was planned for him by the authorities from the age 
of five years, and even the woman whom he was to marry was selected for him 
by the Government officials. The age at which the people should marry was 
fixed at not earlier than twenty-four years for a man and eighteen for a 
woman. Coloured ribbons worn round the head indicated the place of a 
person's birth or the province to which he belonged.

A Golden Temple
One of the most remarkable monuments of the Peruvian civilisation was the 
Coricancha (Town of Gold) at Cuzco, the principal fane of the sun-god. Its 
inner and outer walls were covered with plates of pure gold. Situated upon 
an eminence eighty feet high, the temple looked down upon gardens filled, 
according to the conquering Spaniards, with treasures of gold and silver. 
The animals., insects, the very trees, say the chroniclers, were of the 
precious metals, as were the spades, hoes, and other implements employed for 
keeping the ground in cultivation. Through the pleasances rippled the river 
Huatenay. Such was the glittering Intipampa (Field of the Sun). That the 
story is true, at least in part, is proved by the traveller Squier, who 
speaks of having seen in several houses in Cuzco sheets of gold preserved as 
relics which came from the Temple of the Sun. These, he says, were scarcely 
as thick as paper, and were stripped off the walls of the Coricancha by the 
exultant Spanish soldiery.

The Great Altar
But this house of gold had but a roof of thatch! The Peruvians were ignorant 
of the principle of the arch, or else considered the feature unsuitable, for 
some reason best known to their architects. The doorways were formed of huge 
monoliths, and the entire aspect of the building was cyclopean. The interior 
displayed an ornate richness which impressed even the Spaniards, who had 
seen the wealth of many lands and Oriental kingdoms, and the gold-lust must 
have swelled within their hearts at sight of the great altar, behind which 
was a huge plate of the shining metal engraved with the features of the sun-
god. The surface of this plate was enriched by a thousand gems, the 
scintillation of which was, according to eye-witnesses, almost 
insupportable. Around this dazzling sphere were seated the mummified corpses 
of the Inca kings, each on his throne, with sceptre in hand.

Planetary Temples
Surrounding the Coricancha several lesser temples clustered, all of them 
dedicated to one or other of the planetary bodies-to the moon, to Cuycha, 
the rainbow, to Chasca, the planet Venus. In the temple of the moon, the 
mythic mother of the Inca dynasty, a great plate of silver, like the golden 
one which represented the face of the sun-god, depicted the features of the 
moon-goddess, and around this the mummies of the Inca queens sat in a 
semicircle, like their spouses in the greater neighbouring fane. In the 
rainbow temple of Cuycha the seven-hued arch of heaven was depicted by a 
great arc of gold skilfully tempered or painted in suitable colours. All the 
utensils in these temples were of gold or silver. In the principal building 
twelve large jars of silver held the sacred grain, and even the pipes which 
conducted the water-supply through the earth to the sanctuary were of 
silver. Pedro Pizarro himself, besides other credible eye-witnesses, vouched 
for these facts. The colossal representation of the sun became the property 
of a certain Mancio Serra de Leguicano, a reckless cavalier and noted 
gambler, who lost it on a single throw of the dice! Such was the spirit of 
the adventurers who conquered this golden realm for the crown of Spain. The 
walls of the Coricancha arc still standing, and this marvellous shrine of 
the chief luminary of heaven, the great god of the Peruvians, is now a 
Christian church.

The Mummies of Peru
The fact that the ancient Peruvians had a method of mummification has 
tempted many "antiquarians " to infer therefrom that they had some 
connection with ancient Egypt. These theories are so numerous as to give the 
unsophisticated reader the idea that a regular system of immigration was 
carried on between Egypt and America. As a matter of fact the method of 
mummification in vogue in Peru was entirely different from that employed by 
the ancient Egyptians.

Peruvian mummies arc met with at apparently all stages of the history of the 
native races. Megalithic tombs and monuments contain them in the doubled-up 
posture so common among early peoples all over the world. These megalithic 
tombs, or chulpas, as they are termed, are composed of a mass of rough 
stones and clay, faced with huge blocks of trachyte or basalt, so put 
together as to form a cist, in which the mummy was placed. The door 
invariably faces the east, so that it may catch the gleams of the rising 
sun-a proof of the prevalence of sun-worship. Squier alludes to one more 
than 24 feet high. An opening 18 inches square gave access to the sepulchral 
chamber, which was 11 feet square by 13 feet high. But the tomb had been 
entered before, and after getting in with much difficulty the explorer was 
forced to retreat empty-handed.

Many of these chulpas are circular, and painted in gay primary colours. 
They. are very numerous in Bolivia, an old Peruvian province, and in the 
basin of Lake Titicaca they abound. The dead were wrapped in llama-skins, on 
which the outlines of the eyes and mouth were carefully marked. The corpse 
was then arrayed in other garments, and the door of the tomb walled up. In 
some parts of Peru the dead were mummified and placed in the dwelling-houses 
beside the living. In the rarefied air of the plateaus the bodies rapidly 
became innocuous, and the custom was not the insanitary one we might imagine 
it to be.

On the Pacific coast the method of mummification was somewhat different. The 
body was reduced to a complete state of desiccation, and was deposited in a 
tomb constructed of stone or adobe. Vases intended to hold maize or chicha 
liquor were placed beside the corpse, and copper hatchets, mirrors of 
polished stone, earrings, and bracelets have been discovered in these 
burial-places. Some of the remains are wrapped in rich cloth, and vases of 
gold and silver were placed beside them. Golden plaques are often discovered 
in the mouths, probably symbolic of the sun. The bodies exhibit no traces of 
embalming, and are usually in a sitting posture. Some of them have evidently 
been dried before inhumation, whilst others are covered with a resinous 
substance. They are generally accompanied by the various articles used 
during life; the men have their weapons and ornaments, women their household 
implements, and children their toys. The dryness of the climate, as in 
Egypt, keeps these relics in a wonderful state of preservation. In the grave 
of a woman were found not only vases of every shape, but also some cloth she 
had commenced to weave, which her death had perhaps prevented her from 
completing. Herlight brown hair was carefully combed and plaited, and the 
legs from the ankle to the knee were painted red, after the fashion in vogue 
among Peruvian beauties, while little bladders of toilet-powder and gums 
were thoughtfully placed beside her for her use in the life to come.

Laws and Customs
The legal code of the Incas was severe in the extreme. Murderers and 
adulterers were punished by death, and the unpardonable sin appears to have 
been blasphemy against the sun, or his earthly representative, the Inca. The 
Virgin of the Sun (or nun) who broke her vow was buried alive, and the 
village from whence she came was razed to the ground. Flogging was 
administered for minor offences. A peculiar and very trying punishment must 
have been that of carrying a heavy stone for a certain time.

On marriage a home was aportioned to each couple, and land assigned to them 
sufficient for their support. When a child was born a separate allowance was 
given it-one fanega for a boy, and half that amount for a girl, the fanega 
being equal to the area which could be sown with a hundred pounds of maize. 
There is something repulsive in the Inca code, with its grandmotherly 
legislation; and if this tyranny was beneficent, it was devised merely to 
serve its own ends and hound on the unhappy people under its control like 
dumb, driven cattle. The outlook of the average native was limited in the 
extreme. The Inca class of priests and warriors retained every vestige of 
authority; and that they employed their power unmercifully to grind down the 
millions beneath them was a sufficient excuse for the Spanish Conquistadores 
in dispossessing them of the empire they had so harshly administered.

The public ground was divided afresh every year according to the number of 
the members of each family, and agrarian laws were strictly fixed. Private 
property did not exist among the people of the lower classes, who merely 
farmed the lot which each year was placed at their disposal. Besides this, 
the people had perforce to cultivate the lands sacred to the Inca, and only 
the aged and the sick could evade this duty.

The Peruvian Calendar
The standard chronology known to the Peru of the Incas was a simple lunar 
reckoning. But the four principal points in the sun's course were denoted by 
means of the intihuatana, a device consisting of a large rock surmounted by 
a small cone, the shadow of which, falling on certain notches on the stone 
below, marked the date of the great sun-festivals. The Peruvians, however, 
had no definite calendar. At Cuzco, the capital, the solstices were gauged 
by pillars called pachacta unanchac, or indicators-of time, which were 
placed in four groups (two pillars to a group) on promontories, two in the 
direction of sunrise and two in that of sunset, to mark the extreme points 
of the sun's rising and setting. By this means they were enabled to 
distinguish the arrival and departure of the solstices, during which the sun 
never went beyond the middle pair of pillars. The Inca astronomer's 
approximation to the year was 360 days, which were divided into twelve moons 
of thirty days each. These moons were not calendar months in the correct 
sense, but simply a succession of lunations, which commenced with the winter 
solstice. This method, which must ultimately have proved confusing, does not 
seem to have been altered to co-ordinate with the reckoning of the 
succession of years. The names of the twelve moons, which had some reference 
to the daily life of the Peruvian, were as follows:

Huchuy Pucuy Quilla (Small Growing Moon), approximately January.

Hatun Pucuy Quilla (Great Growing Moon), approximately February.

Pancar Pucuy Quilla (Flower-growing Moon), approximately March.

Ayrihua Quilla (Twin Ears Moon), approximately April.

Aymuray Quilla (Harvest Moon), approximately May.

Auray Cusqui Quilla (Breaking Soil), approximately June.

Chahua Huarqui Quilia (Irrigation Moon), approximately July.

Tarpuy Quilla (Sowing Moon), approximately August.

Ccoya Raymi Quilla (Moon of the Moon Feast), approximately September.

Uma Raymi Quilla (Moon of the Feast of the Province of Uma), approximately 
October.

Ayamarca Raymi Quilla (Moon of the Feast of the Province of Ayamarca), 
approximately November.

Ccapac Raymi Quilla (Moon of the Great Feast of the Sun), approximately 
December.

The Festivals
That the Peruvian standard of time, as with all American people, was taken 
from the natural course of the moon is known chiefly from the fact that the 
principal religious festivals began on the new moon following a solstice or 
equinox. The ceremonies conncctcd with the greatest festival, the Ccapac 
Raymi, were made to date near the lunar phases, the two stages commencing 
with the ninth day of the December moon and twenty-first day, or last 
quarter. But while these lunar phases indicated certain festivals, it very 
often happened that the civil authorities followed a reckoning of their own, 
in preference to accepting ecclesiastical rule. Considerable significance 
was attached to each month by the Peruvians regarding the nature of their 
festivals. The solstices and cquinoxes were the occasions of established 
ceremonies. The arrival of the winter solstice, which in Peru occurs in 
June, was celebrated by the Intip Raymi (Great Feast of the Sun). The 
principal Peruvian feast, which took place at the summer solstice, when the 
new year was supposed to begin, was the national feast of the great god 
Pachacamac, and was called capac Raymi. Molina, Fernandez, and Garcilasso, 
however, date the new year from the winter solstice. The third festival of 
the Inca year, the Ccapac Situa, or Ccoya Raymi (Moon Feast), which is 
signalled by the beginning of the rainy season, occurred in September. In 
general character these festivals appear to have been simple, and even 
childlike. The sacrifice of animals taken from sacred herds of llamas was 
doubtless a principal feature of the ceremony, accompanied by the offering 
up of maguey, or maize spirit, and followed by the performance of symbolic 
dances.

The Llama
The llama was the chief domestic animal of Peru. All llamas were the 
property of the Inca. Like the camel, its distant relative, this creature 
can subsist for long periods upon little nourishment, and it is suitable for 
the carriage of moderate loads. Each year a certain amount of llama wool was 
given to the Peruvian family, according to the number of women it contained, 
and these wove it into garments, whatever was over being stored away in the 
public cloth-magazines for the general use. The large flocks of llamas and 
alpacas also afforded a supply of meat for the people such as the Mexicans 
never possessed. Naturally much attention was given to the breeding of these 
animals, and the alpaca was as carefully regarded by the Peruvian as the 
sheep by the farmer of to-day. The guanacos and vicuñas, wild animals of the 
llama or auchenia family, were also sources of food- and wool-supply.

Architecture of the Incas
The art in which the Incan Peruvians displayed the greatest advance was that 
of architecture. The earlier style of Inca building shows that it was 
closely modelled, as has already been pointed out, on that of the megalithic 
masons of the Tiahuanaco district, but the later style shows stones laid in 
regular courses, varying in length. No cement or mortar of any kind was 
employed, the structure depending for stability upon the accuracy with which 
the stones were fitted to each other. An enormous amount of labour must have 
been expended upon this part of the work, for in the monuments of Peruvian 
architecture which still exist it is impossible to insert even a needle 
between the stones of which they are composed. The palaces and temples were 
built around a courtyard, and most of the principal buildings had a hall of 
considerable dimensions attached to them, which, like the baronial halls of 
the England of the Middle Ages, served for feasting or ceremony. In this 
style is built the front of the palace on the Colcampata, overlooking the 
city of Cuzco, under the fortress which is supposed to have been the 
dwelling of Manco Ccapac, the first Inca. Palaces at Yucay and Chinchero are 
also of this type.

Unsurpassed Workmanship
In an illuminating passage upon Inca architecture Sir Clements Markham., the 
greatest living authority upon matters Peruvian, says:

"In Cuzco the stone used is a dark trachyte, and the coarse grain secured 
greater adhesion between the blocks. The workmanship is unsurpassed, and the 
world has nothing to show in the way of stone-cutting and fitting to equal 
the skill and accuracy displayed in the Ynca structures of Cuzco. No cement 
is used, and the larger stones are in the lowest row, each ascending course 
being narrower, which presents a most pleasing effect. The edifices were 
built round a court, upon which the rooms opened, and some of the great 
halls were 200 paces long by 60 wide, the height being 35 to 40 feet, 
besides the spring of the roof. The roofs were thatch; and we are able to 
form an idea of their construction from one which is still preserved, after 
a lapse of three centuries. This is on a circular building called the 
Sondor-huasi, at Azangaro, and it shows that even thatch in the hands of 
tasteful builders will make a sightly roof for imposing edifices, and that 
the interior ornament of such a roo may be exceedingly beautiful."

The Temple of Viracocha
The temple of Viracocha, at Cacha, in the valley of the Vilcamayu, is built 
on a plan different from that of any other sacred building in Peru. Its 
ruins consist of a wall of adobe or clay 40 feet high and 330 long, built on 
stone foundations 8 feet in height. The roof was supported on twenty-five 
columns, and the width of the structure was 87 feet. It was a place of 
pilgrimage, and the caravanserais where the Faithful were wont to be housed 
still stand around the ruined fane.

Titicaca
The most sacred of the Peruvian shrines, however, was Titicaca, an island on 
the lake of that name. The island of Coati, hard by, enjoyed an equal 
reverence. Terraced platforms on the ormer, reached by flights of steps, 
support two buildings provided for the use of pilgrims about to proceed to 
Coati. On Titicaca there are the ruins of an extensive palace which commands 
a splendid view of the surrounding barren country. A great bath or tank is 
situated half-way down a long range of terraces supported by cut stone 
masonry, and the Pool, 40 feet long by 10, and 5 feet deep, has similar 
walls on three sides. Below this tank the water is made to irrigate terrace 
after terrace until it falls into the lake.

Coati
The island of Coati is about six miles distant. The principal building is on 
one of the loftiest of seven terraces, once radiant with flowers and shrubs, 
and filled with rich loam transported from a more fertile region. It is 
placed on three sides of a square, 183 feet long by 80, and is of stone laid 
in clay and coated with plaster. "It has," says Markham, "thirty-five 
chambers, only one of which is faced with hewn stones. The ornament on the 
faqade consists of elaborate niches, which agreeably break the monotony of 
the wall, and above them runs a projecting cornice. The walls were painted 
yellow, and the niches red; and there was a high-pitched roof, broken here 
and there by gables. The two largest chambers are 20 long by 12, and loftier 
than the rest, each with a great niche in the wall facing the entrance. 
These were probably the holy places or shrines of the temple. The beautiful 
series of terraces falls ofF from the esplanade of the temple to the shores 
of the lake."

Mysterious Chimu
The coast folk, of a different race from the Incas, had their centre of 
civilisation near the city of Truxillo, on the plain of Chimu. Here the 
ruins of a great city litter the plain for many acres. Arising from the mass 
of ruin, at intervals stand huacas, or artificial hills. The city was 
supplied with water by means of small canals, which also served to irrigate 
the gardens. The mounds alluded to were used for sepulture, and the largest, 
at Moche, is 800 feet long by 470 feet in breadth, and 200 feet in height. 
It is constructed of adobes. Besides serving the purpose of a cemetery, this 
mound probably supported a large temple on its summit.

The Palace
A vast palace occupied a commanding position. Its great hall was ioo feet 
long by 52 broad, and its walls were covered with a highly ornate series of 
arabesques in relief done in stucco, like the fretwork on the walls of 
Palenque. Another hall close at hand is ornamented in coloured stucco, and 
from it branch off many small rooms, which were evidently dormitories. From 
the first hall a long corridor leads to secret storehouses, where many 
vessels of gold and silver have been discovered hidden away, as if to secure 
them either from rnarauding bands or the gaze of the vulgar. All of these 
structures are hollowed out of a vast mound covering several acres, so that 
the entire building may be said to be partially subterranean in character. 
"About a hundred yards to the westward of this palace there was a sepulchral 
mound where many relics were discovered. The bodies were wrapped in cloths, 
woven in ornamental figures and patterns of different colours. On some of 
the cloths were sewn plates of silver, and they were edged with borders of 
feathers, the silver being occasionally cut in the shape of fishes. Among 
the ruins of the city there are great rectangular areas enclosed by massive 
walls, and containing courts, streets, dwellings, and reservoirs for water. 
The largest is about a mile south of the mound-palace, and is 550 yards long 
by 400. The outer wall is about 30 feet high, io feet thick at the base, 
with sides inclining toward each other. Some of the interior walls are 
highly ornamented in stuccoed patterns; and in one part there is an edifice 
containing forty-five chambers or cells, in five rows of nine each, which is 
supposed to have been a prison. The enclosure also contained a reservoir 450 
feet long by 195 broad, and 60 feet deep."

The Civilisation of Chimu
The ruins of Chimu are undoubtedly the outcome of a superior standard of 
civilisation. The buildings are elaborate, as are their internal 
arrangements. The extent of the city is great, and the art displayed in the 
manufacture of the utensils discovered within it and the taste evinced in 
the numerous wall-patterns show that a people of advanced culture inhabited 
it. The jeweller's work is in high relief, and the pottery and plaques found 
exhibit much artistic excellence.

Pachacamac
The famous ruins of the temple and city of Pachacamac, near the valley of 
Lurin, to the south of Lima, overlook the Pacific Ocean from a height of 500 
feet. Four vast terraces still bear mighty perpendicular walls, at one time 
painted red. Here was found the only perfect Peruvian arch, built of large 
adobe bricks-a proof that the Peruvian mind did not stand still in matters 
architectural at least.

Irrigation Works
It was in works of irrigation, however., that the race exhibited its 
greatest engineering genius. In the valley of Nasca the Incas cut deep 
trenches to reinforce the irrigating power of a small river, and carried the 
system high up into the mountains, in order that the rainfall coming 
therefrom might be conducted into the needful channel. Lower down the valley 
the main watercourse is deflected into many branches, which irrigate each 
estate by feeding the small surface streams. This system adequately serves 
the fifteen estates of Nasca to-day! Another high-level canal for the 
irrigation of pasture-lands was led for more than a hundred and fifty miles 
along the eastern slope of the central cordillera.

A Singular Discovery
In Peru, as in Mexico, it is probable that the cross was employed as a 
symbol of the four winds. An account of the expedition of Fuentes to the 
valley of Chichas recounts the discovery of a wooden cross as follows: 
[Skinner's State of Perm, p. 313 (1805).]

"When the settlers who accompanied Fuentes in his glorious expedition 
approached the valley they found a wooden cross, hidden, as if purposely, in 
the most intricate part of the mountains. As there is not anything more 
flattering to the vanity of a credulous man than to be enabled to bring 
forward his testimony in the relation of a prodigy, the devotion of these 
good conquerors was kindled to such a degree by the discovery of this sacred 
memorial that they instantly hailed it as miraculous and divine. They 
accordingly carried it in procession to the town, and placed it in the 
church belonging to the convent of San Francisco ) where it is still 
worshipped. It appears next to impossible that there should not, at that 
time, have been any individual among them sufficiently enlightened to combat 
such a persuasion, since, in reality, there was nothing miraculous in the 
finding of this cross, there having been other Christian settlers, before 
the arrival of Fuentes, in the same valley. The opinion., notwithstanding, 
that the discovery was altogether miraculous, instead of having been 
abandoned at the commencement, was confirmed still more and more with the 
progress of time. The Jesuits Antonio Ruiz and Pedro Lozano, in their 
respective histories of the missions of Paraguay, &c., undertook to 
demonstrate that the Apostle St. Thomas had been in America. This thesis, 
which was so novel, and so well calculated to draw the public attention, 
required, more than any other, the aid of the most power of reasons, and of 
the most irrefragable documents, to be able to maintain itself, even in an 
hypothetical sense; but nothing of all this was brought forward. Certain 
miserable conjectures, prepossession, and personal interest, supplied the 
place of truth and criticism. The form of a human foot, which they fancied 
they saw imprinted on the rock, and the different fables of this description 
invented by ignorance at every step, were the sole foundations on which all 
the relations on this subject were made to repose. The one touching the 
peregrinations of St. Thomas from Brazil to Quito must be deemed apocryphal, 
when it is considered that the above reverend fathers describe the Apostle 
with the staff in the hand, the black cassock girt about the waist, and all 
the other trappings which distinguish the missionaries of the society. The 
credit which these histories obtained at the commencement was equal to that 
bestowed on the cross of Tarija, which remained in the predicament of being 
the one St. Thomas had planted in person, in the continent of America."

The Chibchas
A people called the Chibchas dwelt at a very high point of the Andes range. 
They were brave and industrious, and possessed a culture of their own. They 
defended themselves against much stronger native races, but after the 
Spanish conquest their country was included in New Granada, and is now part 
or the United States of Colombia. Less experienced than the Peruvians or 
Aztecs, they could, however, weave and dye, carve and engrave, make roads, 
build temples, and work in stone, wood, and metals. They also worked in 
pottery and jewellery, making silver pendants and collars of shells and 
collars of precious stones. They were a wealthy folk, and their Spanish 
conquerors obtained much spoil. Little is known concerning them or their 
language, and there is not much of interest in the traditions relating to 
them.

Their mythology was simple. They believed the moon was the wife of Bochica, 
who represented the sun, and as she tried to destroy men Bochica only 
allowed her to give light during the night. When the aborigines were in a 
condition of barbarism Bochica taught them and civilised them. The legends 
about Bochica resemble in many points those about Quetzalcoad or Manco 
Ccapac, as well as those relating to the founder of Buddhism and the first 
Inca of Peru. The Chibchas offered human sacrifices to their gods at certain 
intervals, and kept the wretched victim for some years in preparation for 
his doom. They venerated greatly the Lake of Quatavita, and are supposed to 
have flung their treasures into it when they were conquered. Although many 
attempts have been made to recover these, little of value has been found.

The Chibchas appear to have given allegiance to two leaders, one the Zippa, 
who lived at Bogota, the other the Zoque, who lived at Hunsa, now Tunja. 
These chiefs ruled supreme. Like the Incas, they could only have one lawful 
wife, and their sons did not succeed them-their power passed, as in some 
Central African tribes, to the eldest son of the sister.

When the Zippa died, sweet-smelling resin took the place of his internal 
parts, and the body was put in a wooden coffin, with sheets of gold for 
ornamentation. The coffin was hidden in an unknown sepulchre, and these 
tombs have never been discovered-at least, so say the Spaniards. Their 
weapons, garments, objects of daily use, even jars of chicha, were buried 
with these chiefs. It is very likely that a cave where rows of mummies 
richly dressed were found, and many jewels, was the secret burying-place of 
the Zippas and the Zoques. To these folk death meant only a continuation of 
the life on earth.

A Severe Legal Code
The laws of the Chibchas were severe-death was meted out to the murderer, 
and bodily punishment for stealing. A coward was made to look like a woman 
and do her work while to an unfaithful wife was administered a dose of red 
pepper, which, if swallowed, released the culprit from the penalty of death 
and entitled her to an apology from her husband. The Chibchas made no use of 
cattle, and lived on honey. Their houses were built of clay, and were set in 
the midst of an enclosure guarded by watch-towers. The roofs were of a 
conical shape, covered with reed mats, and skilfully interlaced rushes were 
used to close the openings.

The Chibchas were skilful in working bronze, lead, copper, tin, gold, and 
silver, but not iron. The Saint Germain Museum has many specimens of gold 
and silver articles made by these people. M. Uricaechea, has still more 
uncommon specimens in his collection, such as two golden masks of the human 
face larger than life, and a great number of statuettes of men, and images 
of monkeys and frogs.

The Chibchas traded with what they made, exporting the rock salt they found 
in their own country and receiving in exchange cereals with which to 
cultivate their own poor soil. They also made curious little ornaments which 
might have passed for money, but they are not supposed to have understood 
coinage. They had few stone columns-only large granite rocks covered with 
huge figures of tigers and crocodiles. Humboldt mentions these, and two very 
high columns, covered with sculpture, at the junction of the Carare and 
Magdalena, greatly revered by the natives, were raised probably by the 
Chibchas.

A Strange Mnemonic System
On the arrival of the Spaniards the Peruvians were unacquainted with any 
system of writing or numeration. The only means of recording events they 
possessed was that provided by quipos, knotted pieces of string or hide of 
varying length and colour. According to the length or colour of these cords 
the significance of the record varied; it was sometimes historical and 
sometimes mathematical. Quipos relating to the history of the Incas were 
carefully preserved by an officer called Quipo Camayol-literally, "The 
Guardian of the Quipos." The greater number were destroyed as monuments of 
idolatry by the fanatical Spanish monks who came over with the 
Conquistadores, but their loss is by no means important, as no study, 
however profound, could possibly unriddle the system upon which they were 
based. The Peruvians, however, long continued to use them in secret.

Practical Use of the Quipos
The Marquis de Nadaillac has placed on record a use to which the quipos were 
put in more modern times. He says: "A great revolt against the Spaniards was 
organised in 1792. As was found out later, the revolt had been organised by 
means of messengers carrying a piece of wood in which were enclosed threads 
the ends of which were formed of red, black, blue, or white fringes. The 
black thread had four knots, which signified that the messenger had started 
from Vladura, the residence of the chief of the conspiracy, four days after 
full moon. The white thread had ten knots, which signified that the revolt 
would break out ten days after the arrival of the messenger. The person to 
whom the keeper was sent had in his turn to make a knot in the red thread if 
he agreed to join the confederates; in the red and blue threads, on the 
contrary, if he refused." It was by means of these quipos that the Incas 
transmitted their instructions. On all the roads starting from the capital, 
at distances rarely exceeding five miles, rose tambos, or stations for the 
chasquis or couriers, who went from one post to another. The orders of the 
Inca thus became disseminated with great rapidity. Orders which emanated 
directly from the sovereign were marked with a red thread of the royal 
llantu (mantle), and nothing, as historians assure us, could equal the 
respect with which these messages were received.

The Incas as Craftsmen
The Incan Peruvians had made some progress in the metallurgic, ceramic, and 
textile arts. By washing the sands of the rivers of Caravaya they obtained 
large quantities of gold, and they extracted silver from the ore by means of 
blast-furnaces. Copper also was abundant, and was employed to manufacture 
bronze, of which most of their implements were made. Although it is 
difficult to know at what period their mining operations were carried on, it 
is evident that they could only have learned the art through long 
experience. Many proofs are to be found of their skill in jewellery, and 
amongst these are wonderful statuettes which they made from an amalgam of 
gold and mercury, afterwards exposed to great heat. A number of curious 
little ornaments made of various substances, with a little hole bored 
through them, were frequently found under the huacas-probably talismans. The 
finest handiwork of the Incas was undoubtedly in jewellery; but 
unfortunately most of the examples of their work in this craft were melted 
down to assuage the insatiable avarice of the Spanish conquerors, and are 
therefore for ever lost to us. The spade and chisel employed in olden times 
by the Peruvians are much the same as the people use now, but some of their 
tools were clumsy. Their javelins, tomahawks, and other military arms were 
very futile weapons. Some found near the mines of Pasco were made of stone.

The spinning, weaving, and dyeing of the Peruvians were unequalled in 
aboriginal America, their cloths and tapestries being both graceful in 
design and strong in texture.

Stamps of bark or earthenware were employed to fix designs upon their 
woollen stuffs, and feathers were added to the garments made from these, the 
combination producing a gay effect much admired by the Spaniards. The 
British Museum possesses some good specimens of these manufactures.

Pottery
The Peruvians excelled in the potter's art. The pottery was baked in a kiln, 
and was varied in colour, red, black, and grey being the favourite shades. 
It was varnished outside, and the vases were moulded in two pieces and 
joined before heating. Much of the work is of great grace and elegance, and 
the shapes of animals were very skilfully imitated. Many drinking cups of 
elegant design have been discovered, and some vases are of considerable 
size, measuring over three feet in height. A simple geometric pattern is 
usually employed for decoration, but sometimes rows of birds and insects 
figure in the ceramics. The pottery of the coast veople is more rich and 
varied than that of the Inca race proper, and among its types we find vases 
moulded in the form of human faces, many of them exhibiting so much 
character that we are forced to conclude that they arc veritable portraits. 
Fine stone dishes are often found as well as platters of wood, and these 
frequently bear as ornament tasteful carvings representing serpents. On 
several cups and vases are painted representations of battles between the 
Inca forces and the savages of the eastern forests using bows and arrows; 
below wander the animals of the forest region, a brightly painted group.

The Archæological Museum of Madrid gives a representation of very varied 
kinds of Peruvian pottery, including some specimens modelled upon a series 
of plants, interesting to botanists. The Louvre collections have one or two 
interesting examples ot earthenware, as well as the Ethnographical Museum of 
St. Petersburg, and in all these collections there are types which are 
believed to be peculiar to the Old World.

The Trocadero Museum has a very curious specimen with two necks called the 
"Salvador." A drawing on the vase represents a man with a tomahawk. The 
Peruvians, like the Mexicans, also made musical instruments out of 
earthenware, and heavy ornaments, principally for the ear.

Historical Sketch of the Incan Peruvians
The Inca dominion, as the Spaniards found it, was instituted only about a 
century before the coming ot the white man. Before that time Inca sway held 
good over scattered portions of the country, but had not extended over the 
entire territory which in later times was connected with the Inca name. That 
it was founded on the wreck of a more ancient power which once existed in 
the district of Chinchay-suyu there can be little doubt. This power was 
wielded over a space bounded by the lake of Chinchay-cocha on the north and 
Abancay on the south, and extended to the Pacific at the valley of Chincha. 
It was constituted by an alliance of tribes under the leadership of the 
chief of Pucara, in the Huanca country. A branch of this confederacy, the 
Chanca, pushing southward in a general movement, encountered the Inca people 
or Colla-suyu, who, under their leader, Pachacutic, a young but determined 
chieftain, defeated the invaders in a decisive battle near Cuzco. In 
consequence of this defeat the Chanca deserted their former allies and made 
common cause with their victors. Together the armies made a determined 
attack on the Huanca alliance, which they broke up, and conquered the 
northern districts of the Chinchay-suyu. Thus Central Peru fell to the Inca 
arms.

The Inca Monarchs
Inca history, or rather tradition, as we must call it in the light of an 
unparalleled lack of original documentary evidence, spoke of a series of 
eleven monarchs from Manco Ccapac to Huaina Ccapac, who died shortly before 
the Spanish conquest. These had reigned for a collective period of nearly 
350 years. The evidence that these chiefs had reigned was of the best, for 
their mummified bodies were preserved in the great Temple of the Sun at 
Cuzco, already described. There they received the same daily service as when 
in the flesh. Their private herds of llamas and slaves were still understood 
to belong to them, and food and drink were placed before them at stated 
intervals. Clothes were made for them, and they were carried about in 
palanquins as if for daily exercise. The descendants of each at periodical 
intervals feasted on the produce of their ancestor's private estate, and his 
mummy was set in the ccntre of the diners and treated as the principal 
guest.

The First Incas
After Manco Ccapac and his immediate successor, Sinchi Roca (Wise Chief), 
Lloque Yupanqui comes third in the series. He died while his son was still a 
child. Concerning Mayta Ccapac, who commenced his reign while yet a minor, 
but little is known. He was followed by Ccapac Yupanqui, who defeated the 
Conti-suyu, who had grown alarmed at the great power recently attained by 
Cuzco. The Inca and his men were attacked whilst about to offer sacrifice. A 
second attempt to sack Cuzco and divide its spoil and the women attached to 
the great Temple of the Sun likewise ended in the total discomfiture of the 
jealous invaders. With Inca Roca, the next Inca, a new dynasty commences, 
but it is well-nigh impossible to trace the connection between it and the 
preceding one. Of the origin of Inca Roca nothing is related save that he 
claimed descent from Manco Ccapac. Roca, instead of waiting to be attacked 
in his own dominions, boldly confronted the Conti-suyu in their own 
territory, defeated them decisively at Pumatampu, and compelled them to 
yield him tribute. His successor, Yahuarhuaccac, initiated a similar 
campaign against the Colla. suyu people, against whom he had the assistance 
of the conquered Conti-suyu. But at a feast which he held in Cuzco before 
setting out he was attacked by his allies, and fled to the Coricancha, or 
Golden Temple of the Sun, for refuge, along with his wives. Resistance was 
unavailing, and the Inca and many of his favourites were slaughtered. The 
allied tribes which had overrun Central Peru now threatened Cuzco, and had 
they advanced with promptitude the Inca dynasty would have been wiped out 
and the city reduced to ruins. A strong man was at hand, however, who was 
capable of dealing with the extremely dangerous situation which had arisen. 
This was Viracocha, a chieftain chosen by the vote of the assembled warriors 
of Cuzco. By a prudent conciliation of the Conti-suyu and Collasuyu he 
established a confederation which not only put an end to all threats of 
invasion, but so menaced the invaders that they were glad to return to their 
own territory and place it in a suitable state of defence.

Viracocha the Great
With Viracocha the Great, or "Godlike," the period of true Inca ascendancy 
commences. He was the real founder of the enlarged Inca dominion. He was 
elected Inca on his personal merits, and during a vigorous reign succeeded 
in making the influence or Cuzco felt in the contiguous southern regions. In 
his old age he retired to his country seats at Yucay and Xaquixahuana, and 
left the conduct of the realm to his son and successor, Urco-Inca, a weak-
minded voluptuary, who neglected his royal duties, and was superseded by his 
younger brother, Pachacutic, a famous character in Inca history.

The Plain of Blood
The commencement of Pachacutic's reign witnessed one of the most sanguinary 
battles in the history of Peru. Hastu-huaraca., chief of the Antahuayllas, 
in the Chanca country, invaded the Inca territory, and encamped on the hills 
of Carmenca, which overlooks Cuzco. Pachacutic held a parley with him, but 
all to no purpose, for the powerful invader was deter. mined to humble the 
Inca dynasty to the dust. Battle was speedily joined. The first day's figbt 
was indecisive, but on the succeeding day Pachacutic won a great victory, 
the larger part of the invading force being left dead on the field of 
battle, and Hastuhuaraca retreating with five hundred followers only. The 
battle of Yahuar-pampa (Plain of Blood) was the turning-point in Peruvian 
history. The young Inca, formerly known as Yupanqui, was now called 
Pachacutic (He who changes the World). The warriors of the south made full 
submission to him, and came in crowds to offer him their services and seek 
his alliance and friendship, and he shortly found himself supreme in the 
territories over which his predecessors had exercised merely a nominal 
control.

The Conquest of Middle Peru
Hastu-huaraca, who had been commissioned by the allied tribesmen of 
Chinchay-suyu to reduce the Incas, now threw in his lot with them, and 
together conqueror and conquered proceeded to the liberation of the district 
of Chinchay-suyu from the tyranny of the Huanca alliance. The reduction of 
the southern portion of that territory was speedily accomplished. In the 
valley of Xauxa the invaders came upon the army of the Huanca, on which they 
inflicted a final defeat. The Inca spared and liberated the prisoners of 
war, who were numerous. Once more, at Tarma, were the Huanca beaten, after 
which all resistance appears to have been overcome. The city-state of Cuzco 
was now the dominant power throughout the whole of Central Peru, a territory 
300 miles in length, whilst it exercised a kind of suzerainty over a 
district of equal extent toward the south-east, which it shortly converted 
into actual dominion.

Fusion of Races
This conquest of Central Peru led to the fusing of the Quichua-speaking 
tribes on the left bank of the Apurimac with the Aymara-speaking folk on the 
right bank, with the result that the more numerous Quichua speedily gained 
linguistic ascendancy over their brethren the Aymara. Subsequently to this 
the peoples of Southern and Central Peru, led by Inca headmen, swept in a 
great wave of migration over Cerro de Pasco, where they met with little or 
no resistance, and Pachacutic lived to be lord over a dominion extending for 
a thousand miles to the northward, and founder of a great Inca colony south 
of the equator almost identical in outline with the republic of Ecuador.

Two Branches of the Incas
These conquests, or rather race-movements, split up the Inca people into two 
separate portions, the respective centres of which were well-nigh a thousand 
miles apart. The centre of the northern district was at Turnipampa, 
Riopampa, and Quito at different periods. The political separation of these 
areas was only a question of time. Geographical conditions almost totally 
divided the two portions of the empire, a sparsely populated stretch of 
country 400 miles in extent lying between them (see map, P. 333.)

The Laws of Pachacutic
Pachacutic united to his fame as a warrior the reputation of a wise and 
liberal ruler. He built the great Temple of the Sun at Cuzco, probably on 
the site of a still older building, and established in its walls the convent 
in which five hundred maidens were set apart for the service of the god. He 
also, it is said ' instituted the great rite of the Ccapac-cocha, at which 
maize, cloth, llamas, and children were sacrificed in honour of the sun-god. 
He devised a kind of census, by which governors were compelled periodically 
to render an account of the population under their rule. This statement was 
made by means of quipos. Agriculture was his peculiar care, and he was 
stringent in the enforcement of laws regarding the tilling of the soil, the 
foundation and upkeep of stores and granaries, and the regulation of labour 
in general. As an architect he took upon himself the task of personally 
designing the principal buildings of the city of Cuzco, which were rebuilt 
under his instructions and in accordance with models moulded from clay by 
his own hands. He appears to have had a passion for order, and to him we may 
be justified in tracing the rigorous and almost grandmotherly system under 
which the Peruvians were living at the time of the arrival of their Spanish 
conquerors. To Pachacutic, too, is assigned the raising of the immense 
fortress of Sacsahuaman, already described. He further instituted the order 
of knighthood known as Auqui, or "Warrior,"' entrance to which was granted 
to suitable applicants at the great feast of Ccapac Raymi, or Festival of 
the Sun. He also named the succession of moons, and erected the pillars on 
the hill of Carmenca by which the season of solstice was found. In short, 
all law and order which had a place in the Peruvian social economy were 
attributed to him, and we may designate him the Alfred of his race.

Tupac-Yupanqui
Pachacutic's son, Tupac-Yupanqui, for some time before his father's death 
acted as his lieutenant. His name signifies " Bright " or "Shining." His 
activity extended to every portion of the Inca dominion, the borders of 
which he enlarged, suppressing revolts, sub. jugating tribes not wholly 
brought within the pale of Inca influence, and generally completing the work 
so ably begun bv his father.

"The Gibbet"
A spirit of cruelty, and excess such as was unknown to Pachacutic marked the 
military exploits of Tupac. In the valley of Huarco, near the Pacific coast, 
for example, he was repulsed by the natives, who were well supplied with 
food and stores of all sorts, and whose town was well fortified and very 
strongly situated. Tupac constructed an immense camp, or rather town, the 
outlines of which recalled those of his capital of Cuzco, on a hill opposite 
the city, and here he calmly sat down to watch the gradual starvation of the 
enemy. This siege continued for three years, until the wretched defenders, 
driven to despair through want of food, capitulated, relying on the 
assurance of their conqueror that they should become a part of the Inca 
nation and that their daughters should become the wives of Inca youths. The 
submission of their chiefs having been made, Tupac ordered a general 
massacre of the warriors and principal civilians. At the conquest the 
Spaniardr could still see the immense heaps of bones which littered the spot 
where this heartless holocaust took place, and the name Huarco (The Gibbet) 
became indissolubly associated with the district.

Huaina Ccapac
Tupac died in 1493, and was succeeded by his son Huaina Ccapac (The Young 
Chief). Huaina was about twenty-two years of age at the time of his father's 
death, and although the late Inca had named Ccapac-Huari, his son by another 
wife, as his successor, the claims of Huaina were recognised. His reign was 
peaceful, and was marked by wise administrative improvements and engineering 
effort. At the same time he was busily employed in holding the savage 
peoples who surrounded his empire in check. He favoured the northern colony, 
and rebuilt Tumipampa, but resided at Quito. Here he dwelt for some years 
with a favourite son by a wife of the lower class, named Tupac-atau-huallpa 
(The Sun makes Good Fortune). Huaina was the victim of an epidemic raging in 
Peru at the time. He was greatly feared by his subjects, and was the last 
Inca who held undisputed sway over the entire dominion. Like Nezahualcoyotl 
in Mexico, he attempted to set up the worship of one god in Peru, to the 
detriment of all other huacas, or sacred beings.

The Inca Civil War
On the death of Huaina his two sons, Huascar and Atauhuallpa, [This is the 
name by which he is generally alluded to in Peruvian history.] strove for 
the crown. Before his demise Huaina had divided his dominion between his two 
sons, but it was said that he had wrested Quito from a certain chieftain 
whose daughter he had married, and by whom he had Atauhuallpa, who was 
therefore rightful heir to that province. The other son, Huascar, or Tupac-
cusi-huallpa (The Sun makes Joy), was born to his principal sister-wife-for, 
according to Inca custom, the monarchs of Peru, like those of certain 
Egyptian dynasties, filled with pride of race, and unwilling to mingle their 
blood with that of plebeians, took spouses from among their sisters. This is 
the story as given by many Spanish chroniclers, but it has no foundation in 
fact. Atauhuallpa was in reality the son of a woman of the people, and 
Huascar was not the son of Huaina's sister-wife, but of a wife of less 
intimate relationship. Therefore both sons were on an equality as regards 
descent. Huascar, however, was nearer the throne by virtue of his mother's 
status, which was that of a royal princess, whereas the mother of 
Atauhuallpa was not officially recognised. Huascar by his excesses and his 
outrages on religion and public decency aroused the people to revolt against 
his power, and Atauhuallpa, discerning his opportunity in this émeute, made 
a determined attack on the royal forces, and succeeded in driving them 
slowly back, until at last Turnipampa was razed to the ground, and shortly 
afterwards the important southerly fortress of Caxamarca fell into the hands 
of the rebels.

A Dramatic Situation
Atauhuallpa. remained at Caxamarca, and despatched the bulk of his forces 
into the enemy's country. These drove the warriors of Huascar back until the 
upper courses of the Apurimac were reached. Huascar fled from Cuzco, but was 
captured, and carried a prisoner with his mother, wife, and children to 
Atauhuallpa. Not many days afterwards news of the landing of the Spaniards 
was received by the rebel Inca. The downfall of the Peruvian Empire was at 
hand.

A Worthless Despotism
If the blessings of a well-regulated government were dispensed by the Incas, 
these benefits were assuredly counterbalanced by the degrading despotism 
which accompanied them. The political organisation of the Peruvian Empire 
was in every sense more complete than that of Mexico. But in a state where 
individual effort and liberty are entirely crushed even such an effective 
organisation as the Peruvian can avail the people little, and is merely a 
device for the support of a calculated tyranny.


CHAPTER VII; THE MYTHOLOGY OF PERU
The Religion of Ancient Peru
THE religion of the ancient Peruvians had obviously developed in a much 
shorter time than that of the Mexicans. The more ancient character inherent 
in it was displayed in the presence of deities many of which were little 
better than mere totems, and although a definite monotheism or worship of 
one god appears to have been reached, it was not by the efforts of the 
priestly caste that this was achieved, but rather by the will of the Inca 
Pachacutic, who seems to have been a monarch gifted with rare insight and 
ability-a man much after the type of the Mexican Nezahualcoyotl.

In Inca times the religion of the people was solely directed by the state, 
and regulated in such a manner that independent theological thought was 
permitted no outlet. But it must not be inferred from this that no change 
had ever come over the spirit of Peruvian religion. As a matter of fact 
sweeping changes had been effected, but these had been solely the work of 
the Inca race, the leaders of which had amalgamated the various faiths of 
the peoples whom they had conquered into one official belief.

Totemism
Garcilasso el Inca de la Vega, an early Spanish writer on matters Peruvian, 
states that tradition ran that in ante-Inca times every district, family, 
and village possessed its own god, each different from the others. These 
gods were usually such objects as trees, mountains, flowers, herbs, caves, 
large stones, pieces of jasper, and animals. The jaguar, puma, and bear were 
worshipped for their strength and fierceness, the monkey and fox for their 
cunning, the condor for its size and because several tribes believed 
themselves to be descended from it. The screech-owl was worshipped for its 
beauty, and the common owl for its power of seeing in the dark. Serpents, 
particularly the larger and more dangerous varieties, were especially 
regarded with reverence.

Although Payne classes all these gods together as totems, it is plain that 
those of the first class-the flowers, herbs, caves, and pieces of jasper-are 
merely fetishes. A fetish is an object in which the savage believes to be 
resident a spirit which, by its magic, will assist him in his undertakings. 
A totem is an object or an animal, usually the latter, with which the people 
of a tribe believe themselves to be connected by ties of blood and from 
which they are descended. It later becomes the type or symbol of the tribe.

Paccariscas
Lakes, springs, rocks, mountains, precipices, and caves were all regarded by 
the various Peruvian tribes as paccariscas-places whence their ancestors had 
originally issued to the upper world. The paccarisca was usually saluted 
with the cry, "Thou art my birthplace, thou art my life-spring. Guard me 
from evil, O Paccarisca!" In the holy spot a spirit was supposed to dwell 
which served the tribe as a kind of oracle. Naturally the paccarisca was 
looked upon with extreme reverence. It became, indeed, a sort of life-centre 
for the tribe, from which they were very unwilling to be separated.

Worship of Stones
The worship of stones appears to have been almost as universal in ancient 
Peru as it was in ancient Palestine. Man in his primitive state believes 
stones to be the framework of the earth, its bony structure. He considers 
himself to have emerged from some cave-in fact, from the entrails of the 
earth. Nearly all American creation-myths regard man as thus emanating from 
the bowels of the great terrestrial mother. Rocks which were thus chosen as 
paccariscas are found, among many other places, at Callca, in the valley of 
the Yucay, and at Titicaca there is a great mass of red sandstone on the top 
of a high ridge with almost inaccessible slopes and dark, gloomy recesses 
where the sun was thought to have hidden himself at the time of the great 
deluge which covered all the earth. The rock of Titicaca was, in fact, the 
great paccarisca of the sun itself.

We are thus not surprised to find that many standing stones were worshipped 
in Peru in aboriginal times. Thus Arriaga states that rocks of great size 
which bore some resemblance to the human figure were imagined to have been 
at one time gigantic men or spirits who, because they disobeyed the creative 
power, were turned into stone. According to another account they were said 
to have suffered this punishment for refusincr to listen to the words of 
Thonapa, the son of the creator, who, like Quetzalcoad or Manco Ccapac, had 
taken upon himself the guise of a wandering Indian, so that he might have an 
opportunity of bringing the arts of civilisation to the aborigines. At 
Tiahuanaco a certain group of stones was said to represent all that remained 
of the villagers of that place, who, instead of paying fitting attention to 
the wisc counsel which Thonapa the Civiliser bestowed upon them, continued 
to dance and drink in scorn of the teachings he had brought to them.

Again, some stones were said to have become men, as in the old Greek 
creation-legend of Deucalion and Pyrrha. In the legend of Ccapac Inca 
Pachacutic, when Cuzco was attacked in force by the Chancas an Indian 
erected stones to which he attached shields and weapons so that they should 
appear to represent so many warriors in hiding. Pachacutic, in great need of 
assistance, cried to them with such vehemence to come to his help that they 
became men, and rendered him splendid service.

Huacas
Whatever was sacred, of sacred origin, or of the nature of a relic the 
Peruvians designated a huaca, from the root huacan, to howl, native worship 
invariably taking the form of a kind of howl, or weird, dirge-like wailing. 
All objects of reverence were known as huacas, although those of a higher 
class were also alluded to as viracochas. The Peruvians had, naturally, many 
forms of huaca, the most popular of which were those of the fetish class 
which could be carried about by the individual. These were usually stones or 
pebbles, many of which were carved and painted, and some made to represent 
human beings. The llama and the ear of maize were perhaps the most usual 
forms of these sacred objects. Some of them had an agricultural 
significance. In order that irrigation might proceed favourably a huaca was 
placed at intervals in proximity to the acequias, or irrigation canals, 
which was supposed to prevent them leaking or otherwise failing to supply a 
sufficiency of moisture to the parched maize-fields. Huacas of this sort 
were known as ccompas, and were regarded as deities of great importance, as 
the foodsupply of the community was thought to be wholly dependent upon 
their assistance. Other huacas of a similar kind were called chichics and 
huancas, and these prcsided over the fortunes of the maize, and ensured that 
a sufficient supply of rain should be forthcoming. Great numbers of these 
agricultural fetishes were destroyed by the zealous commissary Hernandez de 
Avendaño.

The Mamas
Spirits which were supposed to be instrumental in forcing the growth of the 
maize or other plants were the mamas. We find a similar conception among 
many Brazilian tribes to-day, so that the idea appears to have been a widely 
accepted one in South American countries. The Peruvians called such agencies 
"mothers," adding to the generic name that of the plant or herb with which 
they were specially associated. Thus acsumama was the potato-mother, 
quinuamama the quinua-mother, saramama the maize-mother, and cocamama the 
mother of the coca-shrub. Of these the saramama was naturally the most 
important, governing as it did the principal source of the food-supply of 
the community. Sometimes an image of the saramama was carved in stone, in 
the shape of an car of maize. The saramama was also worshipped in the form 
of a doll, or huantay. sara, made out of stalks of maize, renewed at each 
harvest, much as the idols of the great corn-mother of Mexico were 
manufactured at each harvest-season. After having been made, the image was 
watched over for three nights, and then sacrifice was done to it. The priest 
or medicine-man of the tribe would then inquire of it whether or not it was 
capable of existing until that time in the next year. If its spirit replied 
in the affirmative it was permitted to remain where it was until the 
following harvest. If not it was removed, burnt, and another figure took its 
place, to which similar questions were put.

The Huamantantac
Connected with agriculture in some degree was the Huamantantac (He who 
causes the Cormorants to gather themselves together). This was the agency 
responsible for the gathering of sea-birds, resulting in the deposits of 
guano to be found along the Peruvian coast which are so valuable in the 
cultivation of the maize-plant. He was regarded as a most beneficent spirit, 
and was sacrificed to with exceeding fervour.

Huaris
The huaris, or "great ones," were the ancestors of the aristocrats of a 
tribe, and were regarded as specially favourable toward agricultural effort, 
possibly because the land had at one time belonged to them personally. They 
were sometimes alluded to as the "gods of strength," and were sacrificed to 
by libations of chicha. Ancestors in general were deeply revered, and had an 
agricultural significance, in that considerable tracts of land were tilled 
in order that they might be supplied with suitable food and drink offerings. 
As the number of ancestors increased more and more land was brought into 
cultivation, and the hapless people had their toil added to immeasurably by 
these constant demands upon them.

Huillcas
The huillcas were huacas which partook of the nature of oracles. Many of 
these were serpents, trees, and rivers, the noises made by which appeared to 
the primitive Peruvians-as, indeed, they do to primitive folk all over the 
world-to be of the quality of articulate speech. Both the Huillcamayu and 
the Apurimac rivers at Cuzco were huillca oracles of this kind, as their 
names, "Huillca-river " and "Great Speaker," denote. These oracles often set 
the mandate of the Inca himself at defiance, occasionally supporting popular 
opinion against his policy.

The Oracles of the Andes
The Peruvian Indians of the Andes range within recent generations continued 
to adhere to the superstitions they had inherited from their fathers. A rare 
and interesting account of these says that they "admit an evil being, the 
inhabitant of the centre of the earth, whom they consider as the author of 
their misfortunes, and at the mention of whose name they tremble. The most 
shrewd among them take advantage of this belief to obtain respect, and 
represent themselves as his delegates. Under the denomination of mohanes, or 
agoreros, they are consulted even on the most trivial occasions. They 
preside over the intrigues of love, the health of the community, and the 
taking of the field. Whatever repeatedly occurs to defeat their prognostics, 
falls on themselves; and they are wont ta pay for their deceptions very 
dearly. They chew a species of vegetable called piripiti, and throw it into 
the air, accompanying this act by certain recitals and incantations, to 
injure some, to benefit others, to procure rain and the inundation of the 
rivers, or, on the other hand, to occasion settled weather, and a plentiful 
store of agricultural productions. Any such result, having been casually 
verified on a single occasion, suffices to confirm the Indians in their 
faith, although they may have been cheated a thousand times. Fully persuaded 
that they cannot resist the influence of the piripiri, as soon as they know 
that they have been solicited in love by its means, they fix their eyes on 
the impassioned object, and discover a thousand amiable traits, either real 
or fanciful, which indifference had before concealed from their view. But 
the principal power, efficacy, and it may be said misfortune of the mohanes 
consist in the cure of the sick. Every malady is ascribed to theit 
enchantments, and means are instantly taken to ascertain by whom the 
mischief may have been wrought. For this purpose, the nearest relative takes 
a quantity of the juice of floripondium, and suddenly falls intoxicated by 
the violence of the plant. He is placed in a fit posture to prevent 
suffocation, and on his coming to himself, at the end of three days, the 
mohane who has the greatest resemblance to the sorcerer he saw in his 
visions is to undertake the cure, or if, in the interim, the sick man has 
perished, it is customary to subject him to the same fate. When not any 
sorcerer occurs in the visions, the first mohane they encounter has the 
misfortune to represent his image." [Skinner, State of Peru, p. 275]

Lake-Worship in Peru
At Lake Titicaca the Peruvians believed the inhabitants of the earth, 
animals as well as men, to have been fashioned by the creator, and the 
district was thus sacrosanct in their eyes. The people of the Collao called 
it Mamacota (Mother-water), because it furnished them with supplies of food. 
Two great idols were connected with this worship. One called Copacahuana was 
made of a bluish-green stone shaped like a fish with a human head, and was 
placed in a commanding position on the shores of the lake. On the arrival of 
the Spaniards so deeply rooted was the worship of this goddess that they 
could only suppress it by raising an image of the Virgin in place of the 
idol. The Christian emblem remains to this day. Mamacota was venerated as 
the giver of fish, with which the lake abounded. The other image, Copacati 
(Serpent-stone), represented the element of water as embodied in the lake 
itself in the form of an image wreathed in serpents, which in America are 
nearly always symbolical of water.

The Lost Island
A strange legend is recounted of this lake-goddess. She was chiefly 
worshipped as the giver of rain, but Huaina Ccapac, who had modern ideas and 
journeyed through the country casting down huacas had determined to raise on 
an island of Lake Titicaca a temple to Yatiri (The Ruler), the Aymara name 
of the god Pachacamac in his form of Pachayachachic. He commenced by raising 
the new shrine on the island of Titicaca itself. But the deity when called 
upon refused to vouchsafe any reply to his worshippers or priests. Huaina 
then commanded that the shrine should be transferred to the island of 
Apinguela. But the same thing happened there. He then inaugurated a temple 
on the island of Paapiti, and lavished upon it many sacrifices of llamas, 
children, and precious metals. But the offended tutelary goddess of the 
lake, irritated beyond endurance by this invasion of her ancient domain, 
lashed the watery waste into such a frenzy of storm that the island and the 
shrine which covered it disappeared beneath the waves and were never 
thereafter beheld by mortal eye.

The Thunder God of Peru
The rain-and-thunder god of Peru was worshipped in various parts of the 
country under various names. Among the Collao he was known as Con, and in 
that part of the Inca dominions now known as Bolivia he was called 
Churoquella. Near the cordilleras of the coast he was probably known as 
Pariacaca, who expelled the huaca of the district by dreadful tempests, 
hurling rain and hail at him for three days and ni hts in such quantities as 
to form the great lake of Pariacaca. Burnt llamas were offered to him. But 
the Incas, discontented with this local worship, which by no means suited 
their system of central government, determined to create one thunder-deity 
to whom all the tribes in the empire must bow as the only god of his class. 
We are not aware what his name was, but we know from mythological evidence 
that he was a mixture of all the other gods of thunder in the Peruvian 
Empire, first because he invariably occupied the third place in the triad of 
greater deities, the creator, sun, and thunder, all of whom were more or 
less amalgamations of provincial and metropolitan gods, and secondly because 
a great image of him was erected in the Coricancha at Cuzco, in which he was 
represented in human form, wearing a headdress which concealed his face, 
symbolic of the clouds, which ever veil the thunder-god's head. He had a 
special temple of his own, moreover, and was assigned a share in the sacred 
lands by the Inca Pachacutic. He was accompanied by a figure of his sister, 
who carried jars of water. An unknown Quichuan poet composed on the myth the 
following graceful little poem, which was translated by the late Daniel 
Garrison Brinton, an enthusiastic Americanist and professor of American 
archæology in the University of Pennsylvania:

Bounteous Princess,
Lo, thy brother
Breaks thy vessel
Now in fragments.
From the blow come
Thunder, lightning,
Strokes of lightning;
And thou, Princess,
Tak'st the water,
With it rainest,
And the hail or
Snow dispensest,
Viracocha,
World-constructor.

It will be observed that the translator here employs the name Viracocha as 
if it were that of the deity. But it was merely a general expression in use 
for a more than usually sacred being. Brinton, commenting upon the legend, 
says: "In this pretty waif that has floated down to us from the wreck of a 
literature now for ever lost there is more than one point to attract the 
notice of the antiquary. He may find in it a hint to decipher those names of 
divinities so common in Peruvian legends, Contici and Illatici. Both mean 
'the Thunder Vase,' and both doubtless refer to the conception here 
displayed of the phenomena of the thunderstorm." Alluding to Peruvian 
thunder-myth elsewhere, he says in an illuminating passage: "Throughout the 
realms of the Incas the Peruvians venerated as maker of all things and ruler 
of the firmament the god Ataguju. The legend was that from him proceeded the 
first of mortals, the man Guamansuri, who descended to the earth and there 
wedded the sister of certain Guachimines, rayless ones or Darklings, who 
then possessed it. They destroyed him, but their sister gave birth to twin 
sons, Apocatequil and Piguerao. The former was the more powerful. By 
touching the corpse of his mother he brought her to life, he drove off and 
slew the Guachimines, and, directed by Ataguju, released the race of Indians 
from the soil by turning it up with a spade of gold. For this reason they 
adored him as their maker. He it was, they thought, who produced the thunder 
and the lightning by hurling stones with his sling. And the thunderbolts 
that fall, said they, are his children. Few villages were willing to be 
without one or more of these. They were in appearance small, round stones, 
but had the admirable properties of securing fertility to the fields, 
protecting from lightning, and, by a transition easy to understand, were 
also adored as gods of fire as well material as of the passions, and were 
capable of kindling the dangerous flames of desire in the most frigid 
bosoms. Therefore they were in great esteem as love-charms. Apocatequil's 
statue was erected on the mountains, with that of his mother on one hand and 
his brother on the other. 'He was Prince of Evil, and the most respected god 
of the Peruvians. From Quito to Cuzco not an Indian but would give all he 
possessed to conciliate him. Five priests, two stewards, and a crowd of 
slaves served his image. And his chief temple was surrounded by a very 
considerable village, whose inhabitants had no other occupation but to wait 
on him.'" In memory of these brothers twins in Peru were always deemed 
sacred to the lightning.

There is an instance on record of how the huillca could refuse on occasion 
to recognise even royalty itself. Manco, the Inca who had been given the 
kingly power by Pizarro, offered a sacrifice to one of these oracular 
shrines. The oracle refused to recognise him, through the medium of its 
guardian priest, stating that Manco was not the rightful Inca. Manco there. 
fore caused the oracle, which was in the shape of a rock, to be thrown down, 
whereupon its guardian spirit emerged in the form of a parrot and flew away. 
It is probable that the bird thus liberated had been taught by the priests 
to answer to the questions of those who came to consult the shrine. But we 
learn that on Manco commanding that the parrot should be pursued it sought 
another rock, which opened to receive it, and the spirit of the huillca was 
transferred to this new abode.

The Great God Pachacamac
Later Peruvian mythology recognised only three gods of the first rank, the 
earth, the thunder, and the creative agency. Pachacamac, the great spirit of 
earth, derived his name from a word pacha, which may be best trans, lated as 
"things." In its sense of visible things it is equivalent to "world," 
applied to things which happen in succession it denotes "time," and to 
things connected with persons "property," especially clothes. The world of 
visible things is thus Mamapacha (Earth-Mother), under which name the 
ancient Peruvians worshipped the earth. Pachacamac, on the other hand, is 
not the earth itself, the soil, but the spirit which animates all things 
that emerge therefrom. From him proceed the spirits of the plants and 
animals which come from the earth. Pachamama is the motherspirit of the 
mountains, rocks, and plains, Pachacamac the father-spirit of the grain-
bearing plants, animals, birds, and man. In some localities Pachacamac and 
Pachamama were worshipped as divine mates. Possibly this practice was 
universal in early times, gradually lapsing into desuetude in later days. 
Pachamama was in another phase intended to denote the land immediately 
contiguous to a settlement, on which the inhabitants depended for their 
food-supply.

Peruvian Creation-Stories
It is easy to see how such a conception as Pachacamac, the spirit of 
animated nature, would become one with the idea of a universal or even a 
partial creator. That there was a pre-existing conception of a creative 
agency can be proved from the existence of the Peruvian name Conticsi-
viracocha (He who gives Origin, or Beginning). This conception and that of 
Pachacamac must at some comparatively early period have clashed, and been 
amalgamated probably with ease when it was seen how nearly akin were the two 
ideas. Indeed, Pachacamac was alternatively known as Pacharurac, the "maker" 
of all things-sure proof of his amalgamation with the conception of the 
creative agency. As such he had his symbol in the great Coricancha at Cuzco, 
an oval plate of gold, suspended between those of the sun and the moon, and 
placed vertically, it may be hazarded with some probability, to represent in 
symbol that universal matrix from which emanated all things. Elsewhere in 
Cuzco the creator was represented by a stone statue in human form.

Pachayachachic
In later Inca days this idea of a creator assumed that of a direct ruler of 
the universe, known as Pachayachachic. This change was probably due to the 
influence of the Inca Pachacutic, who is known to have made several other 
doctrinal innovations in Peruvian theology. He commanded a great new temple 
to the creator-god to be built at the north angle of the city of Cuzco, in 
which he placed a statue of pure gold, of the size of a boy of ten years of 
age. The small size was to facilitate its removal, as Peruvian worship was 
nearly always carried out in the open air, In form it represented a man with 
his right arm elevated, the hand partially closed and the forefinger and 
thumb raised, as if in the act of uttering the creative word. To this god 
large possessions and revenues were assigned, for previously service 
rendered to him had been voluntary only.

Ideas of Creation
It is from aboriginal sources as preserved by the first Spanish colonists 
that we glean our knowledge of what the Incas believed the creative process 
to consist. By means of his word (ñisca) the creator, a spirit, powerful and 
opulent, made all things. We are provided with the formulæ of his very words 
by the Peruvian prayers still extant: "Let earth and heaven be," "Let a man 
be; let a woman be," "Let there be day," "Let there be night," "Let the 
light shine." The sun is here regarded as the creative agency, and the 
ruling caste as the objects of a special act of creation.

Pacari Tampu
Pacari Tampu (House of the Dawn) was the place of origin, according to the 
later Inca theology, of four brothers and sisters who initiated the four 
Peruvian systems of worship. The eldest climbed a neighbouring mountain, and 
cast stones to the four points of the compass, thus indicating that he 
claimed all the land within sight. But his youngest brother succeeded in 
enticing him into a cave, which he sealed up with a great stone, thus 
imprisoning him for ever. He next persuaded his second brother to ascend a 
lofty mountain, from which he cast him, changing him into a stone in his 
descent. On beholding the fate of his brethren the third member of the 
quartette fled. It is obvious that we have here a legend concocted by the 
later Inca priesthood to account for the evolution of Peruvian religion in 
its different stages. The first brother would appear to represent the oldest 
religion in Peru, that of the paccariscas, the second that of a fetishistic 
stone worship, the third perhaps that of Viracocha, and the last sun-worship 
pure and simple. There was, however, an "official" legend, which stated that 
the sun had three sons, Viracocha, Pachacamac, and Manco Ccapac. To the last 
the dominion of mankind was given, whilst the others were concerned with the 
workings of the universe. This politic arrangement placed all the power, 
temporal and spiritual, in the hands of the reputed descendants of Manco 
Ccapac the Incas.

Worship of the Sea
The ancient Peruvians worshipped the sea as well as the earth, the folk 
inland regarding it as a menacing deity, whilst the people of the coast 
reverenced it as a god of benevolence, calling it Mama-cocha, or Mother-sea, 
as it yielded them subsistence in the form of fish on which they chiefly 
lived. They worshipped the whale, fairly common on that coast, because of 
its enormous size, and various districts regarded with adoration the species 
of fish most abundant there. This worship can have partaken in no sense of 
the nature of totemism, as the system forbade that the totem animal should 
be eaten. It was imagined that the prototype of each variety of fish dwelt 
in the upper world, just as many tribes of North American Indians believe 
that the eponymous ancestors of certain animals dwell at the four points of 
the compass or in the sky above them. This great fish-god engendered the 
others of his species, and sent them into the waters of the deep that they 
might exist there until taken for the use of man. Birds, too, had their 
eponymous counterparts among the stars, as had animals. Indeed, among many 
of the South American races, ancient and modern, the constellations were 
called after certain beasts and birds.

Viracocha
The Aymara-Quichua race worshipped Viracocha as a great culture hero. They 
did not offer him sacrifices or tribute, as they thought that he, being 
creator and possessor of all things, needed nothing from men, so they only 
gave him worship. After him they idolised the sun. They believed, indeed, 
that Viracocha had made both sun and moon, after emerging from Lake 
Titicaca, and that then he made the earth and peopled it. On his travels 
westward from the lake he was sometimes assailed by men, but he revenged 
himself by sending terrible storms upon them and destroying their property, 
so they humbled themselves and acknowledged him as their lord. He forgave 
them and taught them everything, obtaining from them the name of 
Pachayachachic. In the end he disappeared in the western ocean. He either 
created or there were born with him four beings who, according to mythical 
beliefs, civilised Peru. To them he assigned the four quarters of the earth, 
and they are thus known as the our winds, north, south, east, and west. One 
legend avers they came from the cave Pacari, the Lodging of the Dawn.

Sun-Worship in Peru
The name "Inca" means "People of the Sun," which luminary the Incas regarded 
as their creator. But they did not worship him totemically-that is, they did 
not claim him as a progenitor, although they regarded him as possessing the 
attributes of a man. And here we may observe a difference between Mexican 
and Peruvian sun-worship, For whereas the Nahua primarily regarded the orb 
as the abode of the Man of the Sun, who came to earth in the shape of 
Quetzalcoatl, the Peruvians looked upon the sun itself as the deity. The 
Inca race did not identify their ancestors as children of the sun until a 
comparatively late date. Sun-worship was introduced by the Inca Pachacutic, 
who averred that the sun appeared to him in a dream and addressed him as his 
child. Until that time the worship of the sun had always been strictly 
subordinated to that of the creator, and the deity appeared only as second 
in the trinity of creator, sun, and thunder. But permanent provision was 
made for sacrifices to the sun before the other deities were so recognised, 
and as the conquests of the Incas grew wider and that provision extended to 
the new territories they came to be known as "the Lands of the Sun, the 
natives observing the dedication of a part of the country to the luminary, 
and concluding therefrom that it applied to the whole. The material reality 
of the sun would enormously assist his cult among a people who were too 
barbarous to appreciate an unseen god, and this colonial conception reacting 
upon the mother-land would undoubtedly inspire the military class with a 
resolve to strengthen a worship so popular in the conquered provinces, and 
of which they were in great measure the protagonists and missionaries.

The Sun's Possessions
In every Peruvian village the sun had considerable possessions. His estates 
resembled those of a territorial chieftain, and consisted of a dwelling-
house, a chacra, or portion of land, flocks of llamas and pacos, and a 
number of women dedicated to his service. The cultivation of the soil within 
the solar enclosure devolved upon the inhabitants of the neighbouring 
village, the produce of their toil being stored in the inti-huasi, or sun's 
house. The Women of the Sun prepared the daily food and drink of the 
luminary, which consisted of maize and chicha. They also spun wool and wove 
it into fine stuff, which was burned in order that it might ascend to the 
celestial regions, where the deity could make use of it. Each village 
reserved a portion of its solar produce for the great festival at Cuzco, and 
it was carried thither on the backs of llamas which were destined for 
sacrifice.

Inca Occupation of Titicaca
The Rock of Titicaca, the renowned place of the sun's origin, naturally 
became an important centre of his worship. The date at which the worship of 
the sun originated at this famous rock is extremely remote, but we may 
safely assume that it was long before the conquest of the Collao by the Apu-
Ccapac-Inca Pachacutic, and that reverence for the luminary as a war-god by 
the Colla chiefs was noticed by Tupac, who in suppressing the revolt 
concluded that the local observance at the rock had some relationship to the 
disturbance. It is, however, certain that Tupac proceeded after the 
reconquest to establish at this natural centre of sun-worship solar rites on 
a new basis, with the evident intention of securing on behalf of the Incas 
of Cuzco such exclusive benefit as might accrue from the complete possession 
of the sun's paccarisca. According to a native account, a venerable colla 
(or hermit), consecrated to the service of the sun, had proceeded on foot 
from Titicaca to Cuzco for the purpose of commending this ancient seat of 
sun-worship to the notice of Tupac. The consequence was that Apu-Ccapac-
Inca, after visiting the island and inquiring into the ancient local 
customs, re-established them in a more regular form. His accounts can hardly 
be accepted in face of the facts which have been gathered. Rather did it 
naturally follow that Titicaca became subservient to Tupac after the revolt 
of the Collao had been quelled. Henceforth the worship of the sun at the 
place of his origin was entrusted to Incas resident in the place, and was 
celebrated with Inca rites. The island was converted into a solar estate and 
the aboriginal inhabitants removed. The land was cultivated and the slopes 
of the hills levelled, maize was sown and the soil consecrated, the grain 
being regarded as the gift of the sun. This work produced considerable 
change in the island. Where once was waste and idleness there was now 
fertility and industry. The harvests were skilfully apportioned, so much 
being reserved for sacrificial purposes, the remainder being sent to Cuzco, 
partly to be sown in the chacras, or estates of the sun, throughout Peru, 
partly to be preserved in the granary of the Inca and the huacas as a symbol 
that there would be abundant crops in the future and that the grain already 
stored would be preserved. A building of the Women of the Sun was erected 
about a mile from the rock, so that the produce might be available for 
sacrifices. For their maintenance, tribute of potatoes, ocas, and quinua was 
levied upon the inhabitants of the villages on the shores of the lake, and 
of maize upon the people of the neighbouring valleys.

Pilgrimages to Titicaca
Titicaca at the time of the conquest was probably more frequented than 
Pachacamac itself. These two places were held to be the cardinal shrines of 
the two great huacas, the creator and the sun respectively. A special reason 
for pilgrimage to Titicaca was to sacrifice to the sun, as the source of 
physical energy and the giver of long life; and he was especially worshipped 
by the aged, who believed he had preserved their lives.

Then followed the migration of pilgrims to Titicaca, for whose shelter 
houses were built at Capacahuana, and large stores of maize were provided 
for their use. The ceremonial connected with the sacred rites of the rock 
was rigorously observed. The pilgrim ere embarking on the raft which 
conveyed him to the island must first confess his sins to a huillac (a 
seaker to an object of worship); then further confessions were required at 
each of the three sculptured doors which had successively to be passed 
before reaching the sacred rock. The first door (Puma-puncu) was surmounted 
by the figure of a puma; the others (Quenti-puncu and Pillco-puncu) were 
ornamented with feathers of the different species of birds commonly 
sacrificed to the sun. Having passed the last portal, the traveller beheld 
at a distance of two hundred paces the sacred rock itself, the summit 
glittering with gold-leaf. He was permitted to proceed no further, for only 
the officials were allowed entry into it. The pilgrim on departing received 
a few grains of the sacred maize grown on the island. These he kept with 
care and placed with his own store, believing they would preserve his stock. 
The confidence the Indian placed in the virtue of the Titicaca maize may be 
judged from the prevalent belief that the possessor of a single grain would 
not suffer from starvation during the whole of his life.

Sacrifices to the New Sun
The Intip-Raymi, or Great Festival of the Sun, was celebrated by the Incas 
at Cuzco at the winter solstice. In connection with it the Tarpuntaita-cuma, 
or sacrificing Incas, were charged with a remarkable duty, the worshippers 
journeying eastward to meet one of these functionaries on his way. On the 
principal hill-tops between Cuzco and Huillcanuta, on the road to the rock 
of Titicaca, burnt offerings of llamas, coca, and maize were made at the 
feast to greet the arrival of the young sun from his ancient birthplace. 
Molina has enumerated more than twenty of these places of sacrifice. The 
striking picture of the celebration of the solar sacrifice on these bleak 
mountains in the depth of the Peruvian winter has, it seems, no parallel in 
the religious rites of the ancient Americans. Quitting their thatched houses 
at early dawn, the worshippers left the valley below, carrying the 
sacrificial knife and brazier, and conducting the white llama, heavily laden 
with fuel, maize, and coca leaves, wrapped in fine cloth, to the spot where 
the sacrifice was to be made. When sunrise appeared the pile was lighted. 
The victim was slain and thrown upon it. The scene then presented a striking 
contrast to the bleak surrounding wilderness. As the flames grew in strength 
and the smoke rose higher and thicker the clear atmosphere was gradually 
illuminated from the east. When the sun advanced above the horizon the 
sacrifice was at its height. But for the crackling of the flames and the 
murmur of a babbling stream on its way down the hill to join the river 
below, the silence had hitherto been unbroken. As the sun rose the Incas 
marched slowly round the burning mass, plucking the wool from the scorched 
carcase, and chanting monotonously: "O Creator, Sun and Thunder, be for ever 
young! Multiply the people; let them ever be in peace!"

The Citoc Raymi
The most picturesque if not the most important solar festival was that of 
the Citoc Raymi (Gradually Increasing Sun), held in June, when nine days 
were given up to the ceremonial. A rigorous fast was observed for three days 
previous to the event, during which no fire must be kindled. On the fourth 
day the Inca, accompanied by the people en masse, proceeded to the great 
square of Cuzco to hail the rising sun, which they awaited in silence. On 
its appearance they greeted it with a joyous tumult, and joining in 
procession, marched to the Golden Temple of the Sun, where llamas were 
sacrificed, and a new fire was kindled by means of an arched mirror, 
followed by sacrificial offerings of grain, flowers, animals, and aromatic 
gums. This festival may be taken as typical of all the seasonal 
celebrations. The Inca calendar was purely agricultural in its basis, and 
marked in its great festivals the renewal or abandonment of the labours of 
the field. Its astronomical observations were not more advanced than those 
of the calendars of many American races otherwise inferior in civilisation.

Human Sacrifice in Peru
Writers ignorant of their subject have often dwelt upon the absence of human 
sacrifice in ancient Peru, and have not hesitated to draw comparisons 
between Mexico and the empire of the Incas in this respect, usually not 
complimentary to the former. Such statements are contradicted by the 
clearest evidence. Human sacrifice was certainly not nearly so prevalent in 
Peru, but that it was regular and by no means rare is well authenticated. 
Female victims to the sun were taken from the great class of Acllacuna 
(Selected Ones), a general tribute of female children regularly levied 
throughout the Inca Empire. Beautiful girls were taken from their parents at 
the age of eight by the Inca officials, and were handed over to certain 
female trainers called mamacuna (mothers). These matrons systematically 
trained their protégées in housewifery and ritual. Residences or convents 
called aclla-huasi (houses of the Selected) were provided for them in the 
principal cities.

Methods of Medicine-Men
A quaint account of the methods of the medicinemen of the Indians of the 
Peruvian Andes probably illustrates the manner in which the superstitions of 
a barbarian people evolve into a more stately ritual.

"It cannot be denied," it states, "that the mohanes [priests] have, by 
practice and tradition, acquired a knowledge of many plants and poisons, 
with which they effect surprising cures on the one hand, and do much 
mischief on the other, but the mania of ascribing the whole to a 
preternatural virtue occasions them to blend with their practice a thousand 
charms and superstitions. The most customary method of cure is to place two 
hammocks close to each other, either in the dwelling, or in the open air: in 
one of them the patient lies extended, and in the other the mohane, or 
agorero. The latter, in contact with the sick man, begins by rocking 
himself, and then proceeds, by a strain in falsetto, to call on the birds, 
quadrupeds, and fishes to give health to the patient. From time to time he 
rises on his seat, and makes a thousand extravagant gestures over the sick 
man, to whom he applies his powders and herbs, or sucks the wounded or 
diseased parts. If the malady augments, the agorero, having been joined by 
many of the people, chants a short hymn, addressed to the soul of the 
patient, with this burden: 'Thou must not go, thou must not go.' In 
repeating this he is joined by the people, until at length a terrible 
clamour is raised, and augmented in proportion as the sick man becomes still 
fainter and fainter, to the end that it may reach his ears. When all the 
charms are unavailing, and death approaches, the mohane leaps from his 
hammock, and betakes himself to flight, amid the multitude of sticks, 
stones, and clods of earth which are showered on him. Successively all those 
who belong to the nation assemble, and, dividing themselves into bands, each 
of them (if he who is in his last agonies is a warrior) approaches him, 
saying: 'Whither goest thou? Why dost thou leave us? With whom shall we 
proceed to the aucas [the enemies]?' They then relate to him the heroical 
deeds he has performed, the number of those he has slain, and the pleasures 
he leaves behind him. This is practised in different tones while some raise 
the voice, it is lowered by others and the poor sick man is obliged to 
support these importunities without a murmur, until the first symptoms of 
approaching dissolution manifest themselves. Then it is that he is 
surrounded by a multitude of females, some of whom forcibly close the mouth 
and eyes, others envelop him in the hammock, oppressing him with the whole 
of their weight, and causing him to expire before his time, and others, 
lastly, run to extinguish the candle, and dissipate the smoke, that the 
soul, not being able to perceive the hole through which it may escape, may 
remain entangled in the structure of the roof. That this may be speedily 
effected, and to prevent its return to the interior of the dwelling, they 
surround the entrances with filth, by the stench of which it may be 
expelled.

Death by Suffocation
"As soon as the dying man is suffocated by the closing of the mouth, 
nostrils, &c., and wrapt up in the covering of his bed, the most circumspect 
Indian, whether male or female, takes him in the arms in the best manner 
possible, and gives a gentle shriek, which echoes to the bitter lamentations 
of the immediate relatives, and to the cries of a thousand old women 
collected for the occasion. As long as this dismal howl subsists, the latter 
are subjected to a constant fatigue, raising the palm of the hand to wipe 
away the tears, and lowering it to dry it on the ground. The result of this 
alternate action is, that a circle of earth, which gives them a most hideous 
appearance, is collected about the eyelids and brows, and they do not wash 
themselves until the mourning is over. These first clamours conclude by 
several good pots of masato, to assuage the thirst of sorrow, and the 
company next proceed to make a great clatter among the utensils of the 
deceased: some break the kettles, and others the earthen pots, while others, 
again, burn the apparel, to the end that his memory may be the sooner 
forgotten. If the defunct has been a cacique, or powerful warrior, his 
exequies are performed after the manner of the Romans: they last for many 
days, all the people weeping in concert for a considerable space of time, at 
daybreak, at noon, in the evening, and at midnight. When the appointed hour 
arrives, the mournful music begins in front of the house of the wife and 
relatives, the heroical deeds of the deceased being chanted to the sound of 
instruments. All the inhabitants of the vicinity unite in chorus from within 
their houses, some chirping like birds, others howling like tigers, and the 
greater part of them chattering like monkeys, or croaking like frogs. They 
constantly leave off by having recourse to the masato, and by the 
destruction of whatever the deceased may have left behind him, the burning 
of his dwelling being that which concludes the ceremonies. Among some of the 
Indians, the nearest relatives cut off their hair as a token of their grief, 
agreeably to the practice of the Moabites, and other nations. . . .

The Obsequies of a Chief
"On the day of decease, they put the body, with its insignia, into a large 
earthen vessel, or painted jar) which they bury in one of the angles of the 
quarter, laying over it a covering of potter's clay, and throwing in earth 
until the grave is on a level with the surface of the ground. When the 
obsequies are over, they forbear to pay a visit to it, and lose every 
recollection of the name of the warrior. The Roamaynas disenterre their 
dead, as soon as they think that the fleshy parts have been consumed, and 
having washed the bones form the skeleton, which they place in a coffin of 
potter's clay, adorned with various symbols of death, like the hieroglyphics 
on the wrappers of the Egyptian mummies. In this state the skeleton is 
carried home, to the end that the survivors may bear the deceased in 
respectful memory, and not in imitation of those extraordinary voluptuaries 
of antiquity, who introduced into their most splendid festivals a spectacle 
of this nature, which, by reminding them of their dissolution, might 
stimulate them to taste, before it should overtake them, all the impure 
pleasures the human passions could afford them. A space of time of about a 
year being elapsed, the bones are once more inhumed, and the individual to 
whom they belonged forgotten for ever." [Skinner, State of Peru, pp. 271 et 
seq.]

Peruvian Myths
Peru is not so rich in myths as Mexico, but the following legends well 
illustrate the mythological ideas of the Inca race:

The Vision of Yupanqui
The Inca Yupanqui before he succeeded to the sovereignty is said to have 
gone to visit his father, Viracocha Inca. On his way he arrived at a 
fountain called Susur-pugaio. There he saw a piece of crystal fall into the 
fountain, and in this crystal he saw the figure of an Indian, with three 
bright rays as of the sun coming from the back of his head. He wore a hauiu, 
or royal fringe, across the forehead like the Inca. Serpents wound round his 
arms and over his shoulders. He had ear-pieces in his ears like the Incas, 
and was also dressed like them. There was the head of a lion between his 
legs, and another lion was about his shoulders. Inca Yupanqui took fright at 
this strange figure, and was running away when a voice called to him by name 
telling him not to be afraid, because it was his father, the sun, whom he 
beheld, and that he would conquer many nations, but he must remember his 
father-in his sacrifices and raise revenues for him, and pay him great 
reverence. Then the figure vanished, but the crystal remained, and the Inca 
afterwards saw all he wished in it. When he became king he had a statue of 
the sun made, resembling the figure as closely as possible, and ordered all 
the tribes he had conquered to build splendid temples and worship the new 
deity instead of the creator.

The Bird Bride
The Canaris Indians are named from the province of Canaribamba, in Quito, 
and they have several myths regarding their origin. One recounts that at the 
deluge two brothers fled to a very high mountain called Huacaquan, and as 
the waters rose the hill ascended simultaneously, so that they escaped 
drowning. When the flood was over they had to find food in the valleys, and 
they built a tiny house and lived on herbs and roots. They were surprised 
one day when they went home to find food already prepared for them and 
chicha to drink. This continued for ten days. Then the elder brother decided 
to hide himself and discover who brought the food. Very soon two birds, one 
Aqua, the other Torito (otherwise quacamayo birds), appeared dressed as 
Canaris, and wearing their hair fastened in the same way. The larger bird 
removed the Ilicella, or mantle the Indians wear, and the man saw that they 
had beautiful faces and discovered that the bird-like beings were in reality 
women. When he came out the bird-women were very angry and flew away. When 
the younger brother came home and found no food he was annoyed, and 
determined to hide until the bird-women returned. After ten days the 
quacamayos appeared again on their old mission, and while they were busy the 
watcher contrived to close the door, and so prevented the younger bird from 
escaping. She lived with the brothers for a long time, and became the mother 
of six sons and daughters, from whom all the Canaris proceed. Hence the 
tribe look upon the quacamayo birds with reverence) and use their feathers 
at their festivals.

Thonapa
Some myths tell of a divine personage called Thonapa, who appears to have 
been a hero-god or civilising agent like Quetzalcoatl. He seems to have 
devoted his life to preaching to the people in the various villages, 
beginning in the provinces of Colla-suya. When he came to Yamquisupa he was 
treated so badly that he would not remain there. He slept in the open air, 
clad only in a long shirt and a mantle, and carried a book. He cursed the 
village. It was soon immersed in water, and is now a lake. There was an idol 
in the form of a woman to which the people offered sacrifice at the top of a 
high hill, Cachapucara. This idol Thonapa detested, so he burnt it, and also 
destroyed the hill. On another occasion Thonapa cursed a large assembly of 
people who were holding a great banquet to celebrate a wedding, because they 
refused to listen to his preaching. They were all changed into stones, which 
are visible to this day. Wandering through Peru, Thonapa came to the 
mountain of Caravaya, and after raising a very large cross he put it on his 
shoulders and took it to the hill Carapucu, where he preached so fervently 
that he shed tears. A chief's daughter got some of the water on her head, 
and the Indians, imagining that he was washing his head (a ritual offence), 
took him prisoner near the Lake of Carapucu. Very early the next morning a 
beautiful youth appeared to Thonapa, and told him not to fear, for he was 
sent from the divine guardian who watched over him. He released Thonapa, who 
escaped, though he was well guarded. He went down into the lake, his mantle 
keeping him above the water as a boat would have done. After Thonapa had 
escaped from the barbarians he remained on the rock of Titicaca, afterwards 
going to the town of Tiya-manacu, where again he cursed the people and 
turned them into stones. They were too bent upon amusement to listen to his 
preaching. He then followed the river Chacamarca till it reached the sea, 
and, like Quetzalcoatl, disappeared. This is good evidence that he was a 
solar deity, or man of the sun, who, his civilising labours completed, 
betook himself to the house of his father.

A Myth of Manco Ccapac Inca
When Manco Ccapac Inca was born a staff which had been given to his father 
turned into gold. He had seven brothers and sisters, and at his father's 
death he assembled all his people in order to see how much he could venture 
in making fresh conquests. He and his brothers supplied themselves with rich 
clothing, new arms, and the golden staff called tapac-yauri (royal sceptre). 
He had also two cups of gold from which Thonapa had drunk, called tapacusi. 
They proceeded to the highest point in the country, a mountain where the sun 
rose, and Manco Ccapac saw several rainbows. which he interpreted as a sign 
of good fortune, Delighted with the favouring symbols, he sang the song of 
Chamayhuarisca (The Song of Joy). Manco Ccapac: wondered why a brother who 
had accompanied him did not return, and sent one of his sisters in search of 
him, but she also did not come back, so he went himself, and found both 
nearly dead beside a huaca. They said they could not move, as the huaca, a 
stone, retarded them. In a great rage Manco struck this stone with his 
tapac-yauri. It spoke, and said that had it not been for his wonderful 
golden staff he would have had no power over it. It added that his brother 
and sister had sinned, and therefore must remain with it (the huaca) in the 
lower regions, but that Manco was to be "greatly honoured." The sad fate of 
his brother and sister troubled Manco exceedingly, but on going back to the 
place where he first saw the rainbows he got comfort from them and strength 
to bear his grief.

Coniraya Viracocha
Coniraya Viracocha was a tricky nature spirit who declared he was the 
creator, but who frequently appeared attired as a poor ragged Indian. He was 
an adept at deceiving people. A beautiful woman, Cavillaca, who was greatly 
admired, was one day weaving a mantle at the foot of a lucma tree. Coniraya, 
changing himself into a beautiful bird, climbed the tree, took some of his 
generative seed, made it into a ripe lucma, and dropped it near the 
beautiful virgin, who saw and ate the fruit. Some time afterwards a son was 
born to Cavillaca. When the child was older she wished that the huacas and 
gods should meet and declare who was the father of the boy. All dressed as 
finely as possible, hoping to be chosen as her husband. Coniraya was there, 
dressed like a beggar, and Cavillaca never even looked at him. The maiden 
addressed the assembly, but as no one immediately answered her speech she 
let the child go, saving he would be sure to crawl to his father. The infant 
went straight up to Coniraya, sitting in his rags, and laughed up to him. 
Cavillaca, extremely angry at the idea ot being associated with such a poor, 
dirty creature, fled to the seashore. Coniraya then put on magnificent 
attire and followed her to show her how handsome he was, but still thinking 
of him in his ragged condition she would not look back. She went into the 
sea at Pachacamac and was changed into a rock. Coniraya, still following 
her, met a condor, and asked if it had seen a woman. On the condor replying 
that it had seen her quite near, Coniraya. blessed it, and said whoever 
killed it would be killed himself. He then met a fox, who said he would 
never meet Cavillaca, so Coniraya told him he would always retain his 
disagreeable odour, and on account of it he would never be able to go abroad 
except at night, and that he would be hated by every one. Next came a lion, 
who told Coniraya he was very near Cavillaca, so the lover said he should 
have the power of punishing wrongdoers, and that whoever killed him would 
wear the skin without cutting off the head, and by preserving the teeth and 
eyes would make him appear still alive; his skin would be worn at festivals, 
and thus he would be honoured after death. Then another fox who gave bad 
news was cursed, and a falcon who said Cavillaca was near was told he would 
be highly esteemed, and that whoever killed him would also wear his skin at 
festivals. The parrots, giving bad news, were to cry so loud that they would 
be heard far away, and their cries would betray them to enemies. Thus 
Coniraya blessed the animals which gave him news he liked, and cursed those 
which gave the opposite. When at last he came to the sea he found Cavillaca 
and the child turned into stone, and there he encountered two beautiful 
young daughters of Pachacamac, who guarded a great serpent. He made love to 
the elder sister, but the younger one flew away in the form of a wild 
pigeon. At that time there were no fishes in the sea, but a certain goddess 
had reared a few in a small pond, and Coniraya emptied these into the ocean 
and thus peopled it. The angry deity tried to outwit Coniraya and kill him, 
but he was too wise and escaped. He returned to Huarochiri, and played 
tricks as before on the villagers.

Coniraya slightly approximates to the Jurupari of the Uapès Indians of 
Brazil, especially as regards his impish qualities. [See Spence, article 
"Brazil" in Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics vol. ii.]

The Llama's Warning
An old Peruvian myth relates how the world was nearly left without an 
inhabitant. A man took his llama to a fine place for feeding, but the beast 
moaned and would not eat, and on its master questioning it, it said there 
was little wonder it was sad, because in five days the sea would rise and 
engulf the earth. The man, alarmed, asked if there was no way of escape, and 
the llama advised him to go to the top of a high mountain, Villa-Coto, 
taking food for five days. When they reached the summit of the hill all 
kinds of birds and animals were already there. When the sea rose the water 
came so near that it washed the tail of a fox, and that is why foxes' tails 
are black! After five days the water fell, leaving only this one man alive, 
and from him the Peruvians believed the present human race to be descended.

The Myth of Huathlacuri
After the deluge the Indians chose the bravest and richest man as leader. 
This period they called Purunpacha (the time without a king). On a high 
mountain-top appeared five large eggs, from one of which Paricaca, father of 
Huathiacuri, later emerged. Huathiacuri, who was so poor that he had not 
means to cook his food properly, learned much wisdom from his father, and 
the following story shows how this assisted him. A certain man had built a 
most curious house, the roof being made of yellow and red birds' feathers. 
He was very rich, possessing many llamas, and was greatly esteemed on 
account of his wealth. So proud did he become that he aspired to be the 
creator himself; but when he became very ill and could not cure himself his 
divinity seemed doubtful. Just at this time Huathiacuri was travelling 
about, and one day he saw two foxes meet and listened to their conversation. 
From this he heard about the rich man and learned the cause of his illness, 
and forthwith he determined to go on to find him. On arriving at the curious 
house he met a lovely young girl, one of the rich man's daughters. She told 
him about her father's illness, and Huathiacuri, charmed with her, said he 
would cure her father if she would only give him her love. He looked so 
ragged and dirty that she refused, but she took him to her father and 
informed him that Huathiacuri said he could cure him. Her father consented 
to give him an opportunity to do so. Huathiacuri began his cure by telling 
the sick man that his wife had been unfaithful, and that there were two 
serpents hovering above his house to devour it, and a toad with two heads 
under his grinding-stone. His wife at first indignantly denied the 
accusation, but on Huathiacuri reminding her of some details, and the 
serpents and toad being discovered, she confessed her guilt. The reptiles 
were killed, the man recovered, and the daughter was married to Huathiacuri.

Huathiacuri's poverty and raggedness displeased the girl's brother-in-law, 
who suggested to the bridegroom a contest in dancing and drinking. 
Huathiacuri went to seek his father's advice, and the old man told him to 
accept the challenge and return to him. Paricaca then sent him to a 
mountain, where he was changed into a dead llama. Next morning a fox and its 
vixen carrying a jar of chicha came, the fox having a flute of many pipes. 
When they saw the dead llama they laid down their things and went toward it 
to have a feast, but Huathiacuri then resumed his human form and gave a loud 
cry that frightened away the foxes, whereupon he took possession of the jar 
and flute. By the aid of these, which were magically endowed, he beat his 
brother-in-law in dancing and drinking.

Then the brother-in-law proposed a contest to prove who was the handsomer 
when dressed in festal attire. By the aid of Paricaca Huathiacuri found a 
red lion-skin, which gave him the appearance of having a rainbow round his 
head, and he again won.

The next trial was to see who could build a house the quickest and best. The 
brother-in-law got all his men to help, and had his house nearly finished 
before the other had his foundation laid. But here again Paricaca's wisdom 
proved of service, for Huathiacuri got animals and birds of all kinds to 
help him during the night, and by morning the building was finished except 
the roof. His brother-in-law got many llamas to come with straw for his 
roof, but Huathiacuri ordered an animal to stand where its loud screams 
frightened the llamas away, and the straw was lost. Once more Huathiacuri 
won the day. At last Paricaca advised Huathiacuri to end this conflict, and 
he asked his brother-in-law to see who could dance best in a blue shirt with 
white cotton round the loins. The rich man as usual appeared first, but when 
Huathiacuri came in he made a very loud noise and frightened him, and he 
began to run away. As he ran Huathiacuri turned him into a deer. His wife, 
who had followed him, was turned into a stone, with her head on the ground 
and her feet in the air, because she had given her husband such bad advice.

The four remaining eggs on the mountain-top then opened, and four falcons 
issued, which turned into four great warriors. These warriors performed many 
miracles, one of which consisted in raising a storm which swept away the 
rich Indian's house in a flood to the sea.

Paricaca
Having assisted in the performance of several miracles, Paricaca set out 
determined to do great deeds. He went to find Caruyuchu Huayallo, to whom 
children were sacrificed. He came one day to a village where a festival was 
being celebrated, and as he was in very poor clothes no one took any notice 
of him or offered him anything, till a young girl, taking pity on him, 
brought him chicha to drink. In gratitude Paricaca told her to seek a place 
of safety for herself, as the village would be destroyed after five days, 
but she was to tell no one of this. Annoyed at the inhospitality of the 
people, Paricaca then went to a hill-top and sent down a fearful storm and 
flood, and the whole village was destroyed. Then he came to another village, 
now San Lorenzo. He saw a very beautiful girl, Choque Suso, crying bitterly. 
Asking her why she wept, she said the maize crop was dying for want of 
water. Paricaca at once fell in love with this girl, and after first damming 
up the little water there was, and thus leaving none for the crop, he told 
her he would give her plenty of water if she would only return his love. She 
said he must get water not only for her own crop but for all the other farms 
before she could consent. He noticed a small rill, from which, by opening a 
dam, he thought he might get a sufficient supply of water for the farms. He 
then got the assistance of the birds in the hills, and animals such as 
snakes, lizards, and so on, in removing any obstacles in the way, and they 
widened the channel so that the water irrigated all the land. The fox with 
his usual cunning managed to obtain the post of engineer, and carried the 
canal to near the site of the church of San Lorenzo. Paricaca, having 
accomplished what he had promised, begged Choque Suso to keep her word, 
which she willingly did, but she proposed living at the summit of some rocks 
called Yanacaca. There the lovers stayed very happily, at the head of the 
channel called Cocochallo, the making of which had united them; and as 
Choque Suso wished to remain there always, Paricaca. eventually turned her 
into a stone.

In all likelihood this myth was intended to account for the invention of 
irrigation among the early Peruvians, and from being a local legend probably 
spread over the length and breadth of the country.

Conclusion
The advance in civilisation attained by the peoples of America must be 
regarded as among the most striking phenomena in the history of mankind, 
especially if it be viewed as an example of what can be achieved by isolated 
races occupying a peculiar environment. It cannot be too strongly emphasised 
that the cultures and mythologies of old Mexico and Peru were evolved 
without foreign assistance or intervention, that, in fact, they were 
distinctively and solely the fruit of American aboriginal thought evolved 
upon American soil. An absorbing chapter in the story of human advancement 
is provided by these peoples, whose architecture, arts, graphic and plastic, 
laws and religions prove them to have been the equals of most of the Asiatic 
nations of antiquity, and the superiors of the primitive races of Europe, 
who entered into the heritage of civilisation through the gateway of the 
East. The aborigines of ancient America had evolved for themselves a system 
of writing which at the period of their discovery was approaching the 
alphabetic type, a mathematical system unique and by no means despicable, 
and an architectural science in some respects superior to any of which the 
Old World could boast. Their legal codes were reasonable and founded upon 
justice; and if their religions were tainted with cruelty, it was a cruelty 
which they regarded as inevitable, and as the doom placed upon them by 
sanguinary and insatiable deities and not by any human agency.

In comparing the myths of the American races with the deathless stories of 
Olympus or the scarcely less classic tales of India, frequent resemblances 
and analogies cannot fail to present themselves, and these are of value as 
illustrating the circumstance that in every quarter of the globe the mind of 
man has shaped for itself a system of faith based upon similar principles. 
But in the perusal of the myths and beliefs of Mexico and Peru we are also 
struck with the strangeness and remoteness alike of their subject-matter and 
the type of thought which they present. The result of centuries of isolation 
is evident in a profound contrast of "atmosphere." It seems almost as if we 
stood for a space upon the dim shores of another planet, spectators of the 
doings of a race of whose modes of thought and feeling we were entirely 
ignorant.

For generations these stories have been hidden, along with the memory of the 
gods and folk of whom they tell, beneath a thick dust of neglect, displaced 
here and there only by the efforts of antiquarians working singly and 
unaided. Nowadays many well-equipped students are striving to add to our 
knowledge of the civilisations of Mexico and Peru. To the mythical stories 
of these peoples, alas! we cannot add. The greater part of them perished in 
the flames of the Spanish autos-de-fé. But for those which have survived we 
must be grateful, as affording so many casements through which we may catch 
the glitter and gleam of civilisations more remote and bizarre than those of 
the Orient, shapes dim yet gigantic, misty yet many-coloured, the ghosts of 
peoples and beliefs not the least splendid and solemn in the roll of dead 
nations and vanished faiths.
