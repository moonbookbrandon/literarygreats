EUGENIE GRANDET



I

There are houses in certain provincial towns whose aspect inspires
melancholy, akin to that called forth by sombre cloisters, dreary
moorlands, or the desolation of ruins. Within these houses there is,
perhaps, the silence of the cloister, the barrenness of moors, the
skeleton of ruins; life and movement are so stagnant there that a
stranger might think them uninhabited, were it not that he encounters
suddenly the pale, cold glance of a motionless person, whose half-
monastic face peers beyond the window-casing at the sound of an
unaccustomed step.

Such elements of sadness formed the physiognomy, as it were, of a
dwelling-house in Saumur which stands at the end of the steep street
leading to the chateau in the upper part of the town. This street--now
little frequented, hot in summer, cold in winter, dark in certain
sections--is remarkable for the resonance of its little pebbly
pavement, always clean and dry, for the narrowness of its tortuous
road-way, for the peaceful stillness of its houses, which belong to
the Old town and are over-topped by the ramparts. Houses three
centuries old are still solid, though built of wood, and their divers
aspects add to the originality which commends this portion of Saumur
to the attention of artists and antiquaries.

It is difficult to pass these houses without admiring the enormous
oaken beams, their ends carved into fantastic figures, which crown
with a black bas-relief the lower floor of most of them. In one place
these transverse timbers are covered with slate and mark a bluish line
along the frail wall of a dwelling covered by a roof /en colombage/
which bends beneath the weight of years, and whose rotting shingles
are twisted by the alternate action of sun and rain. In another place
blackened, worn-out window-sills, with delicate sculptures now
scarcely discernible, seem too weak to bear the brown clay pots from
which springs the heart's-ease or the rose-bush of some poor working-
woman. Farther on are doors studded with enormous nails, where the
genius of our forefathers has traced domestic hieroglyphics, of which
the meaning is now lost forever. Here a Protestant attested his
belief; there a Leaguer cursed Henry IV.; elsewhere some bourgeois has
carved the insignia of his /noblesse de cloches/, symbols of his long-
forgotten magisterial glory. The whole history of France is there.

Next to a tottering house with roughly plastered walls, where an
artisan enshrines his tools, rises the mansion of a country gentleman,
on the stone arch of which above the door vestiges of armorial
bearings may still be seen, battered by the many revolutions that have
shaken France since 1789. In this hilly street the ground-floors of
the merchants are neither shops nor warehouses; lovers of the Middle
Ages will here find the /ouvrouere/ of our forefathers in all its
naive simplicity. These low rooms, which have no shop-frontage, no
show-windows, in fact no glass at all, are deep and dark and without
interior or exterior decoration. Their doors open in two parts, each
roughly iron-bound; the upper half is fastened back within the room,
the lower half, fitted with a spring-bell, swings continually to and
fro. Air and light reach the damp den within, either through the upper
half of the door, or through an open space between the ceiling and a
low front wall, breast-high, which is closed by solid shutters that
are taken down every morning, put up every evening, and held in place
by heavy iron bars.

This wall serves as a counter for the merchandise. No delusive display
is there; only samples of the business, whatever it may chance to be,
--such, for instance, as three or four tubs full of codfish and salt,
a few bundles of sail-cloth, cordage, copper wire hanging from the
joists above, iron hoops for casks ranged along the wall, or a few
pieces of cloth upon the shelves. Enter. A neat girl, glowing with
youth, wearing a white kerchief, her arms red and bare, drops her
knitting and calls her father or her mother, one of whom comes forward
and sells you what you want, phlegmatically, civilly, or arrogantly,
according to his or her individual character, whether it be a matter
of two sous' or twenty thousand francs' worth of merchandise. You may
see a cooper, for instance, sitting in his doorway and twirling his
thumbs as he talks with a neighbor. To all appearance he owns nothing
more than a few miserable boat-ribs and two or three bundles of laths;
but below in the port his teeming wood-yard supplies all the cooperage
trade of Anjou. He knows to a plank how many casks are needed if the
vintage is good. A hot season makes him rich, a rainy season ruins
him; in a single morning puncheons worth eleven francs have been known
to drop to six. In this country, as in Touraine, atmospheric
vicissitudes control commercial life. Wine-growers, proprietors, wood-
merchants, coopers, inn-keepers, mariners, all keep watch of the sun.
They tremble when they go to bed lest they should hear in the morning
of a frost in the night; they dread rain, wind, drought, and want
water, heat, and clouds to suit their fancy. A perpetual duel goes on
between the heavens and their terrestrial interests. The barometer
smooths, saddens, or makes merry their countenances, turn and turn
about. From end to end of this street, formerly the Grand'Rue de
Saumur, the words: "Here's golden weather," are passed from door to
door; or each man calls to his neighbor: "It rains louis," knowing
well what a sunbeam or the opportune rainfall is bringing him.

On Saturdays after midday, in the fine season, not one sou's worth of
merchandise can be bought from these worthy traders. Each has his
vineyard, his enclosure of fields, and all spend two days in the
country. This being foreseen, and purchases, sales, and profits
provided for, the merchants have ten or twelve hours to spend in
parties of pleasure, in making observations, in criticisms, and in
continual spying. A housewife cannot buy a partridge without the
neighbors asking the husband if it were cooked to a turn. A young girl
never puts her head near a window that she is not seen by idling
groups in the street. Consciences are held in the light; and the
houses, dark, silent, impenetrable as they seem, hide no mysteries.
Life is almost wholly in the open air; every household sits at its own
threshold, breakfasts, dines, and quarrels there. No one can pass
along the street without being examined; in fact formerly, when a
stranger entered a provincial town he was bantered and made game of
from door to door. From this came many good stories, and the nickname
/copieux/, which was applied to the inhabitants of Angers, who
excelled in such urban sarcasms.

The ancient mansions of the old town of Saumur are at the top of this
hilly street, and were formerly occupied by the nobility of the
neighborhood. The melancholy dwelling where the events of the
following history took place is one of these mansions,--venerable
relics of a century in which men and things bore the characteristics
of simplicity which French manners and customs are losing day by day.
Follow the windings of the picturesque thoroughfare, whose
irregularities awaken recollections that plunge the mind mechanically
into reverie, and you will see a somewhat dark recess, in the centre
of which is hidden the door of the house of Monsieur Grandet. It is
impossible to understand the force of this provincial expression--the
house of Monsieur Grandet--without giving the biography of Monsieur
Grandet himself.

Monsieur Grandet enjoyed a reputation in Saumur whose causes and
effects can never be fully understood by those who have not, at one
time or another, lived in the provinces. In 1789 Monsieur Grandet--
still called by certain persons le Pere Grandet, though the number of
such old persons has perceptibly diminished--was a master-cooper, able
to read, write, and cipher. At the period when the French Republic
offered for sale the church property in the arrondissement of Saumur,
the cooper, then forty years of age, had just married the daughter of
a rich wood-merchant. Supplied with the ready money of his own fortune
and his wife's /dot/, in all about two thousand louis-d'or, Grandet
went to the newly established "district," where, with the help of two
hundred double louis given by his father-in-law to the surly
republican who presided over the sales of the national domain, he
obtained for a song, legally if not legitimately, one of the finest
vineyards in the arrondissement, an old abbey, and several farms. The
inhabitants of Saumur were so little revolutionary that they thought
Pere Grandet a bold man, a republican, and a patriot with a mind open
to all the new ideas; though in point of fact it was open only to
vineyards. He was appointed a member of the administration of Saumur,
and his pacific influence made itself felt politically and
commercially. Politically, he protected the ci-devant nobles, and
prevented, to the extent of his power, the sale of the lands and
property of the /emigres/; commercially, he furnished the Republican
armies with two or three thousand puncheons of white wine, and took
his pay in splendid fields belonging to a community of women whose
lands had been reserved for the last lot.

Under the Consulate Grandet became mayor, governed wisely, and
harvested still better pickings. Under the Empire he was called
Monsieur Grandet. Napoleon, however, did not like republicans, and
superseded Monsieur Grandet (who was supposed to have worn the
Phrygian cap) by a man of his own surroundings, a future baron of the
Empire. Monsieur Grandet quitted office without regret. He had
constructed in the interests of the town certain fine roads which led
to his own property; his house and lands, very advantageously
assessed, paid moderate taxes; and since the registration of his
various estates, the vineyards, thanks to his constant care, had
become the "head of the country,"--a local term used to denote those
that produced the finest quality of wine. He might have asked for the
cross of the Legion of honor.

This event occurred in 1806. Monsieur Grandet was then fifty-seven
years of age, his wife thirty-six, and an only daughter, the fruit of
their legitimate love, was ten years old. Monsieur Grandet, whom
Providence no doubt desired to compensate for the loss of his
municipal honors, inherited three fortunes in the course of this year,
--that of Madame de la Gaudiniere, born de la Bertelliere, the mother
of Madame Grandet; that of old Monsieur de la Bertelliere, her
grandfather; and, lastly, that of Madame Gentillet, her grandmother on
the mother's side: three inheritances, whose amount was not known to
any one. The avarice of the deceased persons was so keen that for a
long time they had hoarded their money for the pleasure of secretly
looking at it. Old Monsieur de la Bertelliere called an investment an
extravagance, and thought he got better interest from the sight of his
gold than from the profits of usury. The inhabitants of Saumur
consequently estimated his savings according to "the revenues of the
sun's wealth," as they said.

Monsieur Grandet thus obtained that modern title of nobility which our
mania for equality can never rub out. He became the most imposing
personage in the arrondissement. He worked a hundred acres of
vineyard, which in fruitful years yielded seven or eight hundred
hogsheads of wine. He owned thirteen farms, an old abbey, whose
windows and arches he had walled up for the sake of economy,--a
measure which preserved them,--also a hundred and twenty-seven acres
of meadow-land, where three thousand poplars, planted in 1793, grew
and flourished; and finally, the house in which he lived. Such was his
visible estate; as to his other property, only two persons could give
even a vague guess at its value: one was Monsieur Cruchot, a notary
employed in the usurious investments of Monsieur Grandet; the other
was Monsieur des Grassins, the richest banker in Saumur, in whose
profits Grandet had a certain covenanted and secret share.

Although old Cruchot and Monsieur des Grassins were both gifted with
the deep discretion which wealth and trust beget in the provinces,
they publicly testified so much respect to Monsieur Grandet that
observers estimated the amount of his property by the obsequious
attention which they bestowed upon him. In all Saumur there was no one
not persuaded that Monsieur Grandet had a private treasure, some
hiding-place full of louis, where he nightly took ineffable delight in
gazing upon great masses of gold. Avaricious people gathered proof of
this when they looked at the eyes of the good man, to which the yellow
metal seemed to have conveyed its tints. The glance of a man
accustomed to draw enormous interest from his capital acquires, like
that of the libertine, the gambler, or the sycophant, certain
indefinable habits,--furtive, eager, mysterious movements, which never
escape the notice of his co-religionists. This secret language is in a
certain way the freemasonry of the passions. Monsieur Grandet inspired
the respectful esteem due to one who owed no man anything, who,
skilful cooper and experienced wine-grower that he was, guessed with
the precision of an astronomer whether he ought to manufacture a
thousand puncheons for his vintage, or only five hundred, who never
failed in any speculation, and always had casks for sale when casks
were worth more than the commodity that filled them, who could store
his whole vintage in his cellars and bide his time to put the
puncheons on the market at two hundred francs, when the little
proprietors had been forced to sell theirs for five louis. His famous
vintage of 1811, judiciously stored and slowly disposed of, brought
him in more than two hundred and forty thousand francs.

Financially speaking, Monsieur Grandet was something between a tiger
and a boa-constrictor. He could crouch and lie low, watch his prey a
long while, spring upon it, open his jaws, swallow a mass of louis,
and then rest tranquilly like a snake in process of digestion,
impassible, methodical, and cold. No one saw him pass without a
feeling of admiration mingled with respect and fear; had not every man
in Saumur felt the rending of those polished steel claws? For this
one, Maitre Cruchot had procured the money required for the purchase
of a domain, but at eleven per cent. For that one, Monsieur des
Grassins discounted bills of exchange, but at a frightful deduction of
interest. Few days ever passed that Monsieur Grandet's name was not
mentioned either in the markets or in social conversations at the
evening gatherings. To some the fortune of the old wine-grower was an
object of patriotic pride. More than one merchant, more than one
innkeeper, said to strangers with a certain complacency: "Monsieur, we
have two or three millionaire establishments; but as for Monsieur
Grandet, he does not himself know how much he is worth."

In 1816 the best reckoners in Saumur estimated the landed property of
the worthy man at nearly four millions; but as, on an average, he had
made yearly, from 1793 to 1817, a hundred thousand francs out of that
property, it was fair to presume that he possessed in actual money a
sum nearly equal to the value of his estate. So that when, after a
game of boston or an evening discussion on the matter of vines, the
talk fell upon Monsieur Grandet, knowing people said: "Le Pere
Grandet? le Pere Grandet must have at least five or six millions."

"You are cleverer than I am; I have never been able to find out the
amount," answered Monsieur Cruchot or Monsieur des Grassins, when
either chanced to overhear the remark.

If some Parisian mentioned Rothschild or Monsieur Lafitte, the people
of Saumur asked if he were as rich as Monsieur Grandet. When the
Parisian, with a smile, tossed them a disdainful affirmative, they
looked at each other and shook their heads with an incredulous air. So
large a fortune covered with a golden mantle all the actions of this
man. If in early days some peculiarities of his life gave occasion for
laughter or ridicule, laughter and ridicule had long since died away.
His least important actions had the authority of results repeatedly
shown. His speech, his clothing, his gestures, the blinking of his
eyes, were law to the country-side, where every one, after studying
him as a naturalist studies the result of instinct in the lower
animals, had come to understand the deep mute wisdom of his slightest
actions.

"It will be a hard winter," said one; "Pere Grandet has put on his fur
gloves."

"Pere Grandet is buying quantities of staves; there will be plenty of
wine this year."

Monsieur Grandet never bought either bread or meat. His farmers
supplied him weekly with a sufficiency of capons, chickens, eggs,
butter, and his tithe of wheat. He owned a mill; and the tenant was
bound, over and above his rent, to take a certain quantity of grain
and return him the flour and bran. La Grande Nanon, his only servant,
though she was no longer young, baked the bread of the household
herself every Saturday. Monsieur Grandet arranged with kitchen-
gardeners who were his tenants to supply him with vegetables. As to
fruits, he gathered such quantities that he sold the greater part in
the market. His fire-wood was cut from his own hedgerows or taken from
the half-rotten old sheds which he built at the corners of his fields,
and whose planks the farmers carted into town for him, all cut up, and
obligingly stacked in his wood-house, receiving in return his thanks.
His only known expenditures were for the consecrated bread, the
clothing of his wife and daughter, the hire of their chairs in church,
the wages of la Grand Nanon, the tinning of the saucepans, lights,
taxes, repairs on his buildings, and the costs of his various
industries. He had six hundred acres of woodland, lately purchased,
which he induced a neighbor's keeper to watch, under the promise of an
indemnity. After the acquisition of this property he ate game for the
first time.

Monsieur Grandet's manners were very simple. He spoke little. He
usually expressed his meaning by short sententious phrases uttered in
a soft voice. After the Revolution, the epoch at which he first came
into notice, the good man stuttered in a wearisome way as soon as he
was required to speak at length or to maintain an argument. This
stammering, the incoherence of his language, the flux of words in
which he drowned his thought, his apparent lack of logic, attributed
to defects of education, were in reality assumed, and will be
sufficiently explained by certain events in the following history.
Four sentences, precise as algebraic formulas, sufficed him usually to
grasp and solve all difficulties of life and commerce: "I don't know;
I cannot; I will not; I will see about it." He never said yes, or no,
and never committed himself to writing. If people talked to him he
listened coldly, holding his chin in his right hand and resting his
right elbow in the back of his left hand, forming in his own mind
opinions on all matters, from which he never receded. He reflected
long before making any business agreement. When his opponent, after
careful conversation, avowed the secret of his own purposes, confident
that he had secured his listener's assent, Grandet answered: "I can
decide nothing without consulting my wife." His wife, whom he had
reduced to a state of helpless slavery, was a useful screen to him in
business. He went nowhere among friends; he neither gave nor accepted
dinners; he made no stir or noise, seeming to economize in everything,
even movement. He never disturbed or disarranged the things of other
people, out of respect for the rights of property. Nevertheless, in
spite of his soft voice, in spite of his circumspect bearing, the
language and habits of a coarse nature came to the surface, especially
in his own home, where he controlled himself less than elsewhere.

Physically, Grandet was a man five feet high, thick-set, square-built,
with calves twelve inches in circumference, knotted knee-joints, and
broad shoulders; his face was round, tanned, and pitted by the small-
pox; his chin was straight, his lips had no curves, his teeth were
white; his eyes had that calm, devouring expression which people
attribute to the basilisk; his forehead, full of transverse wrinkles,
was not without certain significant protuberances; his yellow-grayish
hair was said to be silver and gold by certain young people who did
not realize the impropriety of making a jest about Monsieur Grandet.
His nose, thick at the end, bore a veined wen, which the common people
said, not without reason, was full of malice. The whole countenance
showed a dangerous cunning, an integrity without warmth, the egotism
of a man long used to concentrate every feeling upon the enjoyments of
avarice and upon the only human being who was anything whatever to
him,--his daughter and sole heiress, Eugenie. Attitude, manners,
bearing, everything about him, in short, testified to that belief in
himself which the habit of succeeding in all enterprises never fails
to give to a man.

Thus, though his manners were unctuous and soft outwardly, Monsieur
Grandet's nature was of iron. His dress never varied; and those who
saw him to-day saw him such as he had been since 1791. His stout shoes
were tied with leathern thongs; he wore, in all weathers, thick
woollen stockings, short breeches of coarse maroon cloth with silver
buckles, a velvet waistcoat, in alternate stripes of yellow and puce,
buttoned squarely, a large maroon coat with wide flaps, a black
cravat, and a quaker's hat. His gloves, thick as those of a gendarme,
lasted him twenty months; to preserve them, he always laid them
methodically on the brim of his hat in one particular spot. Saumur
knew nothing further about this personage.

Only six individuals had a right of entrance to Monsieur Grandet's
house. The most important of the first three was a nephew of Monsieur
Cruchot. Since his appointment as president of the Civil courts of
Saumur this young man had added the name of Bonfons to that of
Cruchot. He now signed himself C. de Bonfons. Any litigant so ill-
advised as to call him Monsieur Cruchot would soon be made to feel his
folly in court. The magistrate protected those who called him Monsieur
le president, but he favored with gracious smiles those who addressed
him as Monsieur de Bonfons. Monsieur le president was thirty-three
years old, and possessed the estate of Bonfons (Boni Fontis), worth
seven thousand francs a year; he expected to inherit the property of
his uncle the notary and that of another uncle, the Abbe Cruchot, a
dignitary of the chapter of Saint-Martin de Tours, both of whom were
thought to be very rich. These three Cruchots, backed by a goodly
number of cousins, and allied to twenty families in the town, formed a
party, like the Medici in Florence; like the Medici, the Cruchots had
their Pazzi.

Madame des Grassins, mother of a son twenty-three years of age, came
assiduously to play cards with Madame Grandet, hoping to marry her
dear Adolphe to Mademoiselle Eugenie. Monsieur des Grassins, the
banker, vigorously promoted the schemes of his wife by means of secret
services constantly rendered to the old miser, and always arrived in
time upon the field of battle. The three des Grassins likewise had
their adherents, their cousins, their faithful allies. On the Cruchot
side the abbe, the Talleyrand of the family, well backed-up by his
brother the notary, sharply contested every inch of ground with his
female adversary, and tried to obtain the rich heiress for his nephew
the president.

This secret warfare between the Cruchots and des Grassins, the prize
thereof being the hand in marriage of Eugenie Grandet, kept the
various social circles of Saumur in violent agitation. Would
Mademoiselle Grandet marry Monsieur le president or Monsieur Adolphe
des Grassins? To this problem some replied that Monsieur Grandet would
never give his daughter to the one or to the other. The old cooper,
eaten up with ambition, was looking, they said, for a peer of France,
to whom an income of three hundred thousand francs would make all the
past, present, and future casks of the Grandets acceptable. Others
replied that Monsieur and Madame des Grassins were nobles, and
exceedingly rich; that Adolphe was a personable young fellow; and that
unless the old man had a nephew of the pope at his beck and call, such
a suitable alliance ought to satisfy a man who came from nothing,--a
man whom Saumur remembered with an adze in his hand, and who had,
moreover, worn the /bonnet rouge/. Certain wise heads called attention
to the fact that Monsieur Cruchot de Bonfons had the right of entry to
the house at all times, whereas his rival was received only on
Sundays. Others, however, maintained that Madame des Grassins was more
intimate with the women of the house of Grandet than the Cruchots
were, and could put into their minds certain ideas which would lead,
sooner or later, to success. To this the former retorted that the Abbe
Cruchot was the most insinuating man in the world: pit a woman against
a monk, and the struggle was even. "It is diamond cut diamond," said a
Saumur wit.

The oldest inhabitants, wiser than their fellows, declared that the
Grandets knew better than to let the property go out of the family,
and that Mademoiselle Eugenie Grandet of Saumur would be married to
the son of Monsieur Grandet of Paris, a wealthy wholesale wine-
merchant. To this the Cruchotines and the Grassinists replied: "In the
first place, the two brothers have seen each other only twice in
thirty years; and next, Monsieur Grandet of Paris has ambitious
designs for his son. He is mayor of an arrondissement, a deputy,
colonel of the National Guard, judge in the commercial courts; he
disowns the Grandets of Saumur, and means to ally himself with some
ducal family,--ducal under favor of Napoleon." In short, was there
anything not said of an heiress who was talked of through a
circumference of fifty miles, and even in the public conveyances from
Angers to Blois, inclusively!

At the beginning of 1811, the Cruchotines won a signal advantage over
the Grassinists. The estate of Froidfond, remarkable for its park, its
mansion, its farms, streams, ponds, forests, and worth about three
millions, was put up for sale by the young Marquis de Froidfond, who
was obliged to liquidate his possessions. Maitre Cruchot, the
president, and the abbe, aided by their adherents, were able to
prevent the sale of the estate in little lots. The notary concluded a
bargain with the young man for the whole property, payable in gold,
persuading him that suits without number would have to be brought
against the purchasers of small lots before he could get the money for
them; it was better, therefore, to sell the whole to Monsieur Grandet,
who was solvent and able to pay for the estate in ready money. The
fine marquisate of Froidfond was accordingly conveyed down the gullet
of Monsieur Grandet, who, to the great astonishment of Saumur, paid
for it, under proper discount, with the usual formalities.

This affair echoed from Nantes to Orleans. Monsieur Grandet took
advantage of a cart returning by way of Froidfond to go and see his
chateau. Having cast a master's eye over the whole property, he
returned to Saumur, satisfied that he had invested his money at five
per cent, and seized by the stupendous thought of extending and
increasing the marquisate of Froidfond by concentrating all his
property there. Then, to fill up his coffers, now nearly empty, he
resolved to thin out his woods and his forests, and to sell off the
poplars in the meadows.



II

It is now easy to understand the full meaning of the term, "the house
of Monsieur Grandet,"--that cold, silent, pallid dwelling, standing
above the town and sheltered by the ruins of the ramparts. The two
pillars and the arch, which made the porte-cochere on which the door
opened, were built, like the house itself, of tufa,--a white stone
peculiar to the shores of the Loire, and so soft that it lasts hardly
more than two centuries. Numberless irregular holes, capriciously
bored or eaten out by the inclemency of the weather, gave an
appearance of the vermiculated stonework of French architecture to the
arch and the side walls of this entrance, which bore some resemblance
to the gateway of a jail. Above the arch was a long bas-relief, in
hard stone, representing the four seasons, the faces already crumbling
away and blackened. This bas-relief was surmounted by a projecting
plinth, upon which a variety of chance growths had sprung up,--yellow
pellitory, bindweed, convolvuli, nettles, plantain, and even a little
cherry-tree, already grown to some height.

The door of the archway was made of solid oak, brown, shrunken, and
split in many places; though frail in appearance, it was firmly held
in place by a system of iron bolts arranged in symmetrical patterns. A
small square grating, with close bars red with rust, filled up the
middle panel and made, as it were, a motive for the knocker, fastened
to it by a ring, which struck upon the grinning head of a huge nail.
This knocker, of the oblong shape and kind which our ancestors called
/jaquemart/, looked like a huge note of exclamation; an antiquary who
examined it attentively might have found indications of the figure,
essentially burlesque, which it once represented, and which long usage
had now effaced. Through this little grating--intended in olden times
for the recognition of friends in times of civil war--inquisitive
persons could perceive, at the farther end of the dark and slimy
vault, a few broken steps which led to a garden, picturesquely shut in
by walls that were thick and damp, and through which oozed a moisture
that nourished tufts of sickly herbage. These walls were the ruins of
the ramparts, under which ranged the gardens of several neighboring
houses.

The most important room on the ground-floor of the house was a large
hall, entered directly from beneath the vault of the porte-cochere.
Few people know the importance of a hall in the little towns of Anjou,
Touraine, and Berry. The hall is at one and the same time antechamber,
salon, office, boudoir, and dining-room; it is the theatre of domestic
life, the common living-room. There the barber of the neighborhood
came, twice a year, to cut Monsieur Grandet's hair; there the farmers,
the cure, the under-prefect, and the miller's boy came on business.
This room, with two windows looking on the street, was entirely of
wood. Gray panels with ancient mouldings covered the walls from top to
bottom; the ceiling showed all its beams, which were likewise painted
gray, while the space between them had been washed over in white, now
yellow with age. An old brass clock, inlaid with arabesques, adorned
the mantel of the ill-cut white stone chimney-piece, above which was a
greenish mirror, whose edges, bevelled to show the thickness of the
glass, reflected a thread of light the whole length of a gothic frame
in damascened steel-work. The two copper-gilt candelabra which
decorated the corners of the chimney-piece served a double purpose: by
taking off the side-branches, each of which held a socket, the main
stem--which was fastened to a pedestal of bluish marble tipped with
copper--made a candlestick for one candle, which was sufficient for
ordinary occasions. The chairs, antique in shape, were covered with
tapestry representing the fables of La Fontaine; it was necessary,
however, to know that writer well to guess at the subjects, for the
faded colors and the figures, blurred by much darning, were difficult
to distinguish.

At the four corners of the hall were closets, or rather buffets,
surmounted by dirty shelves. An old card-table in marquetry, of which
the upper part was a chess-board, stood in the space between the two
windows. Above this table was an oval barometer with a black border
enlivened with gilt bands, on which the flies had so licentiously
disported themselves that the gilding had become problematical. On the
panel opposite to the chimney-piece were two portraits in pastel,
supposed to represent the grandfather of Madame Grandet, old Monsieur
de la Bertelliere, as a lieutenant in the French guard, and the
deceased Madame Gentillet in the guise of a shepherdess. The windows
were draped with curtains of red /gros de Tours/ held back by silken
cords with ecclesiastical tassels. This luxurious decoration, little
in keeping with the habits of Monsieur Grandet, had been, together
with the steel pier-glass, the tapestries, and the buffets, which were
of rose-wood, included in the purchase of the house.

By the window nearest to the door stood a straw chair, whose legs were
raised on castors to lift its occupant, Madame Grandet, to a height
from which she could see the passers-by. A work-table of stained
cherry-wood filled up the embrasure, and the little armchair of
Eugenie Grandet stood beside it. In this spot the lives had flowed
peacefully onward for fifteen years, in a round of constant work from
the month of April to the month of November. On the first day of the
latter month they took their winter station by the chimney. Not until
that day did Grandet permit a fire to be lighted; and on the thirty-
first of March it was extinguished, without regard either to the
chills of the early spring or to those of a wintry autumn. A foot-
warmer, filled with embers from the kitchen fire, which la Grande
Nanon contrived to save for them, enabled Madame and Mademoiselle
Grandet to bear the chilly mornings and evenings of April and October.
Mother and daughter took charge of the family linen, and spent their
days so conscientiously upon a labor properly that of working-women,
that if Eugenie wished to embroider a collar for her mother she was
forced to take the time from sleep, and deceive her father to obtain
the necessary light. For a long time the miser had given out the
tallow candle to his daughter and la Grande Nanon just as he gave out
every morning the bread and other necessaries for the daily
consumption.

La Grande Nanon was perhaps the only human being capable of accepting
willingly the despotism of her master. The whole town envied Monsieur
and Madame Grandet the possession of her. La Grande Nanon, so called
on account of her height, which was five feet eight inches, had lived
with Monsieur Grandet for thirty-five years. Though she received only
sixty francs a year in wages, she was supposed to be one of the
richest serving-women in Saumur. Those sixty francs, accumulating
through thirty-five years, had recently enabled her to invest four
thousand francs in an annuity with Maitre Cruchot. This result of her
long and persistent economy seemed gigantic. Every servant in the
town, seeing that the poor sexagenarian was sure of bread for her old
age, was jealous of her, and never thought of the hard slavery through
which it had been won.

At twenty-two years of age the poor girl had been unable to find a
situation, so repulsive was her face to almost every one. Yet the
feeling was certainly unjust: the face would have been much admired on
the shoulders of a grenadier of the guard; but all things, so they
say, should be in keeping. Forced to leave a farm where she kept the
cows, because the dwelling-house was burned down, she came to Saumur
to find a place, full of the robust courage that shrinks from no
labor. Le Pere Grandet was at that time thinking of marriage and about
to set up his household. He espied the girl, rejected as she was from
door to door. A good judge of corporeal strength in his trade as a
cooper, he guessed the work that might be got out of a female creature
shaped like a Hercules, as firm on her feet as an oak sixty years old
on its roots, strong in the hips, square in the back, with the hands
of a cartman and an honesty as sound as her unblemished virtue.
Neither the warts which adorned her martial visage, nor the red-brick
tints of her skin, nor the sinewy arms, nor the ragged garments of la
Grande Nanon, dismayed the cooper, who was at that time still of an
age when the heart shudders. He fed, shod, and clothed the poor girl,
gave her wages, and put her to work without treating her too roughly.
Seeing herself thus welcomed, la Grande Nanon wept secretly tears of
joy, and attached herself in all sincerity to her master, who from
that day ruled her and worked her with feudal authority. Nanon did
everything. She cooked, she made the lye, she washed the linen in the
Loire and brought it home on her shoulders; she got up early, she went
to bed late; she prepared the food of the vine-dressers during the
harvest, kept watch upon the market-people, protected the property of
her master like a faithful dog, and even, full of blind confidence,
obeyed without a murmur his most absurd exactions.

In the famous year of 1811, when the grapes were gathered with
unheard-of difficulty, Grandet resolved to give Nanon his old watch,--
the first present he had made her during twenty years of service.
Though he turned over to her his old shoes (which fitted her), it is
impossible to consider that quarterly benefit as a gift, for the shoes
were always thoroughly worn-out. Necessity had made the poor girl so
niggardly that Grandet had grown to love her as we love a dog, and
Nanon had let him fasten a spiked collar round her throat, whose
spikes no longer pricked her. If Grandet cut the bread with rather too
much parsimony, she made no complaint; she gaily shared the hygienic
benefits derived from the severe regime of the household, in which no
one was ever ill. Nanon was, in fact, one of the family; she laughed
when Grandet laughed, felt gloomy or chilly, warmed herself, and
toiled as he did. What pleasant compensations there were in such
equality! Never did the master have occasion to find fault with the
servant for pilfering the grapes, nor for the plums and nectarines
eaten under the trees. "Come, fall-to, Nanon!" he would say in years
when the branches bent under the fruit and the farmers were obliged to
give it to the pigs.

To the poor peasant who in her youth had earned nothing but harsh
treatment, to the pauper girl picked up by charity, Grandet's
ambiguous laugh was like a sunbeam. Moreover, Nanon's simple heart and
narrow head could hold only one feeling and one idea. For thirty-five
years she had never ceased to see herself standing before the wood-
yard of Monsieur Grandet, ragged and barefooted, and to hear him say:
"What do you want, young one?" Her gratitude was ever new. Sometimes
Grandet, reflecting that the poor creature had never heard a
flattering word, that she was ignorant of all the tender sentiments
inspired by women, that she might some day appear before the throne of
God even more chaste than the Virgin Mary herself,--Grandet, struck
with pity, would say as he looked at her, "Poor Nanon!" The
exclamation was always followed by an undefinable look cast upon him
in return by the old servant. The words, uttered from time to time,
formed a chain of friendship that nothing ever parted, and to which
each exclamation added a link. Such compassion arising in the heart of
the miser, and accepted gratefully by the old spinster, had something
inconceivably horrible about it. This cruel pity, recalling, as it
did, a thousand pleasures to the heart of the old cooper, was for
Nanon the sum total of happiness. Who does not likewise say, "Poor
Nanon!" God will recognize his angels by the inflexions of their
voices and by their secret sighs.

There were very many households in Saumur where the servants were
better treated, but where the masters received far less satisfaction
in return. Thus it was often said: "What have the Grandets ever done
to make their Grande Nanon so attached to them? She would go through
fire and water for their sake!" Her kitchen, whose barred windows
looked into the court, was always clean, neat, cold,--a true miser's
kitchen, where nothing went to waste. When Nanon had washed her
dishes, locked up the remains of the dinner, and put out her fire, she
left the kitchen, which was separated by a passage from the living-
room, and went to spin hemp beside her masters. One tallow candle
sufficed the family for the evening. The servant slept at the end of
the passage in a species of closet lighted only by a fan-light. Her
robust health enabled her to live in this hole with impunity; there
she could hear the slightest noise through the deep silence which
reigned night and day in that dreary house. Like a watch-dog, she
slept with one ear open, and took her rest with a mind alert.

A description of the other parts of the dwelling will be found
connected with the events of this history, though the foregoing sketch
of the hall, where the whole luxury of the household appears, may
enable the reader to surmise the nakedness of the upper floors.

In 1819, at the beginning of an evening in the middle of November, la
Grande Nanon lighted the fire for the first time. The autumn had been
very fine. This particular day was a fete-day well known to the
Cruchotines and the Grassinists. The six antagonists, armed at all
points, were making ready to meet at the Grandets and surpass each
other in testimonials of friendship. That morning all Saumur had seen
Madame and Mademoiselle Grandet, accompanied by Nanon, on their way to
hear Mass at the parish church, and every one remembered that the day
was the anniversary of Mademoiselle Eugenie's birth. Calculating the
hour at which the family dinner would be over, Maitre Cruchot, the
Abbe Cruchot, and Monsieur C. de Bonfons hastened to arrive before the
des Grassins, and be the first to pay their compliments to
Mademoiselle Eugenie. All three brought enormous bouquets, gathered in
their little green-houses. The stalks of the flowers which the
president intended to present were ingeniously wound round with a
white satin ribbon adorned with gold fringe. In the morning Monsieur
Grandet, following his usual custom on the days that commemorated the
birth and the fete of Eugenie, went to her bedside and solemnly
presented her with his paternal gift,--which for the last thirteen
years had consisted regularly of a curious gold-piece. Madame Grandet
gave her daughter a winter dress or a summer dress, as the case might
be. These two dresses and the gold-pieces, of which she received two
others on New Year's day and on her father's fete-day, gave Eugenie a
little revenue of a hundred crowns or thereabouts, which Grandet loved
to see her amass. Was it not putting his money from one strong-box to
another, and, as it were, training the parsimony of his heiress? from
whom he sometimes demanded an account of her treasure (formerly
increased by the gifts of the Bertellieres), saying: "It is to be your
marriage dozen."

The "marriage dozen" is an old custom sacredly preserved and still in
force in many parts of central France. In Berry and in Anjou, when a
young girl marries, her family, or that of the husband, must give her
a purse, in which they place, according to their means, twelve pieces,
or twelve dozen pieces, or twelve hundred pieces of gold. The poorest
shepherd-girl never marries without her dozen, be it only a dozen
coppers. They still tell in Issoudun of a certain "dozen" presented to
a rich heiress, which contained a hundred and forty-four /portugaises
d'or/. Pope Clement VII., uncle of Catherine de' Medici, gave her when
he married her to Henri II. a dozen antique gold medals of priceless
value.

During dinner the father, delighted to see his Eugenie looking well in
a new gown, exclaimed: "As it is Eugenie's birthday let us have a
fire; it will be a good omen."

"Mademoiselle will be married this year, that's certain," said la
Grande Nanon, carrying away the remains of the goose,--the pheasant of
tradesmen.

"I don't see any one suitable for her in Saumur," said Madame Grandet,
glancing at her husband with a timid look which, considering her
years, revealed the conjugal slavery under which the poor woman
languished.

Grandet looked at his daughter and exclaimed gaily,--

"She is twenty-three years old to-day, the child; we must soon begin
to think of it."

Eugenie and her mother silently exchanged a glance of intelligence.

Madame Grandet was a dry, thin woman, as yellow as a quince, awkward,
slow, one of those women who are born to be down-trodden. She had big
bones, a big nose, a big forehead, big eyes, and presented at first
sight a vague resemblance to those mealy fruits that have neither
savor nor succulence. Her teeth were black and few in number, her
mouth was wrinkled, her chin long and pointed. She was an excellent
woman, a true la Bertelliere. L'abbe Cruchot found occasional
opportunity to tell her that she had not done ill; and she believed
him. Angelic sweetness, the resignation of an insect tortured by
children, a rare piety, a good heart, an unalterable equanimity of
soul, made her universally pitied and respected. Her husband never
gave her more than six francs at a time for her personal expenses.
Ridiculous as it may seem, this woman, who by her own fortune and her
various inheritances brought Pere Grandet more than three hundred
thousand francs, had always felt so profoundly humiliated by her
dependence and the slavery in which she lived, against which the
gentleness of her spirit prevented her from revolting, that she had
never asked for one penny or made a single remark on the deeds which
Maitre Cruchot brought for her signature. This foolish secret pride,
this nobility of soul perpetually misunderstood and wounded by
Grandet, ruled the whole conduct of the wife.

Madame Grandet was attired habitually in a gown of greenish levantine
silk, endeavoring to make it last nearly a year; with it she wore a
large kerchief of white cotton cloth, a bonnet made of plaited straws
sewn together, and almost always a black-silk apron. As she seldom
left the house she wore out very few shoes. She never asked anything
for herself. Grandet, seized with occasional remorse when he
remembered how long a time had elapsed since he gave her the last six
francs, always stipulated for the "wife's pin-money" when he sold his
yearly vintage. The four or five louis presented by the Belgian or the
Dutchman who purchased the wine were the chief visible signs of Madame
Grandet's annual revenues. But after she had received the five louis,
her husband would often say to her, as though their purse were held in
common: "Can you lend me a few sous?" and the poor woman, glad to be
able to do something for a man whom her confessor held up to her as
her lord and master, returned him in the course of the winter several
crowns out of the "pin-money." When Grandet drew from his pocket the
five-franc piece which he allowed monthly for the minor expenses,--
thread, needles, and toilet,--of his daughter, he never failed to say
as he buttoned his breeches' pocket: "And you, mother, do you want
anything?"

"My friend," Madame Grandet would answer, moved by a sense of maternal
dignity, "we will see about that later."

Wasted dignity! Grandet thought himself very generous to his wife.
Philosophers who meet the like of Nanon, of Madame Grandet, of
Eugenie, have surely a right to say that irony is at the bottom of the
ways of Providence.

After the dinner at which for the first time allusion had been made to
Eugenie's marriage, Nanon went to fetch a bottle of black-currant
ratafia from Monsieur Grandet's bed-chamber, and nearly fell as she
came down the stairs.

"You great stupid!" said her master; "are you going to tumble about
like other people, hey?"

"Monsieur, it was that step on your staircase which has given way."

"She is right," said Madame Grandet; "it ought to have been mended
long ago. Yesterday Eugenie nearly twisted her ankle."

"Here," said Grandet to Nanon, seeing that she looked quite pale, "as
it is Eugenie's birthday, and you came near falling, take a little
glass of ratafia to set you right."

"Faith! I've earned it," said Nanon; "most people would have broken
the bottle; but I'd sooner have broken my elbow holding it up high."

"Poor Nanon!" said Grandet, filling a glass.

"Did you hurt yourself?" asked Eugenie, looking kindly at her.

"No, I didn't fall; I threw myself back on my haunches."

"Well! as it is Eugenie's birthday," said Grandet, "I'll have the step
mended. You people don't know how to set your foot in the corner where
the wood is still firm."

Grandet took the candle, leaving his wife, daughter, and servant
without any other light than that from the hearth, where the flames
were lively, and went into the bakehouse to fetch planks, nails, and
tools.

"Can I help you?" cried Nanon, hearing him hammer on the stairs.

"No, no! I'm an old hand at it," answered the former cooper.

At the moment when Grandet was mending his worm-eaten staircase and
whistling with all his might, in remembrance of the days of his youth,
the three Cruchots knocked at the door.

"Is it you, Monsieur Cruchot?" asked Nanon, peeping through the little
grating.

"Yes," answered the president.

Nanon opened the door, and the light from the hearth, reflected on the
ceiling, enabled the three Cruchots to find their way into the room.

"Ha! you've come a-greeting," said Nanon, smelling the flowers.

"Excuse me, messieurs," cried Grandet, recognizing their voices; "I'll
be with you in a moment. I'm not proud; I am patching up a step on my
staircase."

"Go on, go on, Monsieur Grandet; a man's house is his castle," said
the president sententiously.

Madame and Mademoiselle Grandet rose. The president, profiting by the
darkness, said to Eugenie:

"Will you permit me, mademoiselle, to wish you, on this the day of
your birth, a series of happy years and the continuance of the health
which you now enjoy?"

He offered her a huge bouquet of choice flowers which were rare in
Saumur; then, taking the heiress by the elbows, he kissed her on each
side of her neck with a complacency that made her blush. The
president, who looked like a rusty iron nail, felt that his courtship
was progressing.

"Don't stand on ceremony," said Grandet, entering. "How well you do
things on fete-days, Monsieur le president!"

"When it concerns mademoiselle," said the abbe, armed with his own
bouquet, "every day is a fete-day for my nephew."

The abbe kissed Eugenie's hand. As for Maitre Cruchot, he boldly
kissed her on both cheeks, remarking: "How we sprout up, to be sure!
Every year is twelve months."

As he replaced the candlestick beside the clock, Grandet, who never
forgot his own jokes, and repeated them to satiety when he thought
them funny, said,--

"As this is Eugenie's birthday let us illuminate."

He carefully took off the branches of the candelabra, put a socket on
each pedestal, took from Nanon a new tallow candle with paper twisted
round the end of it, put it into the hollow, made it firm, lit it, and
then sat down beside his wife, looking alternately at his friends, his
daughter, and the two candles. The Abbe Cruchot, a plump, puffy little
man, with a red wig plastered down and a face like an old female
gambler, said as he stretched out his feet, well shod in stout shoes
with silver buckles: "The des Grassins have not come?"

"Not yet," said Grandet.

"But are they coming?" asked the old notary, twisting his face, which
had as many holes as a collander, into a queer grimace.

"I think so," answered Madame Grandet.

"Are your vintages all finished?" said Monsieur de Bonfons to Grandet.

"Yes, all of them," said the old man, rising to walk up and down the
room, his chest swelling with pride as he said the words, "all of
them." Through the door of the passage which led to the kitchen he saw
la Grande Nanon sitting beside her fire with a candle and preparing to
spin there, so as not to intrude among the guests.

"Nanon," he said, going into the passage, "put out that fire and that
candle, and come and sit with us. Pardieu! the hall is big enough for
all."

"But monsieur, you are to have the great people."

"Are not you as good as they? They are descended from Adam, and so are
you."

Grandet came back to the president and said,--

"Have you sold your vintage?"

"No, not I; I shall keep it. If the wine is good this year, it will be
better two years hence. The proprietors, you know, have made an
agreement to keep up the price; and this year the Belgians won't get
the better of us. Suppose they are sent off empty-handed for once,
faith! they'll come back."

"Yes, but let us mind what we are about," said Grandet in a tone which
made the president tremble.

"Is he driving some bargain?" thought Cruchot.

At this moment the knocker announced the des Grassins family, and
their arrival interrupted a conversation which had begun between
Madame Grandet and the abbe.

Madame des Grassins was one of those lively, plump little women, with
pink-and-white skins, who, thanks to the claustral calm of the
provinces and the habits of a virtuous life, keep their youth until
they are past forty. She was like the last rose of autumn,--pleasant
to the eye, though the petals have a certain frostiness, and their
perfume is slight. She dressed well, got her fashions from Paris, set
the tone to Saumur, and gave parties. Her husband, formerly a
quartermaster in the Imperial guard, who had been desperately wounded
at Austerlitz, and had since retired, still retained, in spite of his
respect for Grandet, the seeming frankness of an old soldier.

"Good evening, Grandet," he said, holding out his hand and affecting a
sort of superiority, with which he always crushed the Cruchots.
"Mademoiselle," he added, turning to Eugenie, after bowing to Madame
Grandet, "you are always beautiful and good, and truly I do not know
what to wish you." So saying, he offered her a little box which his
servant had brought and which contained a Cape heather,--a flower
lately imported into Europe and very rare.

Madame des Grassins kissed Eugenie very affectionately, pressed her
hand, and said: "Adolphe wishes to make you my little offering."

A tall, blond young man, pale and slight, with tolerable manners and
seemingly rather shy, although he had just spent eight or ten thousand
francs over his allowance in Paris, where he had been sent to study
law, now came forward and kissed Eugenie on both cheeks, offering her
a workbox with utensils in silver-gilt,--mere show-case trumpery, in
spite of the monogram E.G. in gothic letters rather well engraved,
which belonged properly to something in better taste. As she opened
it, Eugenie experienced one of those unexpected and perfect delights
which make a young girl blush and quiver and tremble with pleasure.
She turned her eyes to her father as if to ask permission to accept
it, and Monsieur Grandet replied: "Take it, my daughter," in a tone
which would have made an actor illustrious.

The three Cruchots felt crushed as they saw the joyous, animated look
cast upon Adolphe des Grassins by the heiress, to whom such riches
were unheard-of. Monsieur des Grassins offered Grandet a pinch of
snuff, took one himself, shook off the grains as they fell on the
ribbon of the Legion of honor which was attached to the button-hole of
his blue surtout; then he looked at the Cruchots with an air that
seemed to say, "Parry that thrust if you can!" Madame des Grassins
cast her eyes on the blue vases which held the Cruchot bouquets,
looking at the enemy's gifts with the pretended interest of a
satirical woman. At this delicate juncture the Abbe Cruchot left the
company seated in a circle round the fire and joined Grandet at the
lower end of the hall. As the two men reached the embrasure of the
farthest window the priest said in the miser's ear: "Those people
throw money out of the windows."

"What does that matter if it gets into my cellar?" retorted the old
wine-grower.

"If you want to give gilt scissors to your daughter, you have the
means," said the abbe.

"I give her something better than scissors," answered Grandet.

"My nephew is a blockhead," thought the abbe as he looked at the
president, whose rumpled hair added to the ill grace of his brown
countenance. "Couldn't he have found some little trifle which cost
money?"

"We will join you at cards, Madame Grandet," said Madame des Grassins.

"We might have two tables, as we are all here."

"As it is Eugenie's birthday you had better play loto all together,"
said Pere Grandet: "the two young ones can join"; and the old cooper,
who never played any game, motioned to his daughter and Adolphe.
"Come, Nanon, set the tables."

"We will help you, Mademoiselle Nanon," said Madame des Grassins
gaily, quite joyous at the joy she had given Eugenie.

"I have never in my life been so pleased," the heiress said to her; "I
have never seen anything so pretty."

"Adolphe brought it from Paris, and he chose it," Madame des Grassins
whispered in her ear.

"Go on! go on! damned intriguing thing!" thought the president. "If
you ever have a suit in court, you or your husband, it shall go hard
with you."

The notary, sitting in his corner, looked calmly at the abbe, saying
to himself: "The des Grassins may do what they like; my property and
my brother's and that of my nephew amount in all to eleven hundred
thousand francs. The des Grassins, at the most, have not half that;
besides, they have a daughter. They may give what presents they like;
heiress and presents too will be ours one of these days."

At half-past eight in the evening the two card-tables were set out.
Madame des Grassins succeeded in putting her son beside Eugenie. The
actors in this scene, so full of interest, commonplace as it seems,
were provided with bits of pasteboard striped in many colors and
numbered, and with counters of blue glass, and they appeared to be
listening to the jokes of the notary, who never drew a number without
making a remark, while in fact they were all thinking of Monsieur
Grandet's millions. The old cooper, with inward self-conceit, was
contemplating the pink feathers and the fresh toilet of Madame des
Grassins, the martial head of the banker, the faces of Adolphe, the
president, the abbe, and the notary, saying to himself:--

"They are all after my money. Hey! neither the one nor the other shall
have my daughter; but they are useful--useful as harpoons to fish
with."

This family gaiety in the old gray room dimly lighted by two tallow
candles; this laughter, accompanied by the whirr of Nanon's spinning-
wheel, sincere only upon the lips of Eugenie or her mother; this
triviality mingled with important interests; this young girl, who,
like certain birds made victims of the price put upon them, was now
lured and trapped by proofs of friendship of which she was the dupe,--
all these things contributed to make the scene a melancholy comedy. Is
it not, moreover, a drama of all times and all places, though here
brought down to its simplest expression? The figure of Grandet,
playing his own game with the false friendship of the two families and
getting enormous profits from it, dominates the scene and throws light
upon it. The modern god,--the only god in whom faith is preserved,--
money, is here, in all its power, manifested in a single countenance.
The tender sentiments of life hold here but a secondary place; only
the three pure, simple hearts of Nanon, of Eugenie, and of her mother
were inspired by them. And how much of ignorance there was in the
simplicity of these poor women! Eugenie and her mother knew nothing of
Grandet's wealth; they could only estimate the things of life by the
glimmer of their pale ideas, and they neither valued nor despised
money, because they were accustomed to do without it. Their feelings,
bruised, though they did not know it, but ever-living, were the secret
spring of their existence, and made them curious exceptions in the
midst of these other people whose lives were purely material.
Frightful condition of the human race! there is no one of its joys
that does not come from some species of ignorance.

At the moment when Madame Grandet had won a loto of sixteen sous,--the
largest ever pooled in that house,--and while la Grande Nanon was
laughing with delight as she watched madame pocketing her riches, the
knocker resounded on the house-door with such a noise that the women
all jumped in their chairs.

"There is no man in Saumur who would knock like that," said the
notary.

"How can they bang in that way!" exclaimed Nanon; "do they want to
break in the door?"

"Who the devil is it?" cried Grandet.



III

Nanon took one of the candles and went to open the door, followed by
her master.

"Grandet! Grandet!" cried his wife, moved by a sudden impulse of fear,
and running to the door of the room.

All the players looked at each other.

"Suppose we all go?" said Monsieur des Grassins; "that knock strikes
me as evil-intentioned."

Hardly was Monsieur des Grassins allowed to see the figure of a young
man, accompanied by a porter from the coach-office carrying two large
trunks and dragging a carpet-bag after him, than Monsieur Grandet
turned roughly on his wife and said,--

"Madame Grandet, go back to your loto; leave me to speak with
monsieur."

Then he pulled the door quickly to, and the excited players returned
to their seats, but did not continue the game.

"Is it any one belonging to Saumur, Monsieur des Grassins?" asked his
wife.

"No, it is a traveller."

"He must have come from Paris."

"Just so," said the notary, pulling out his watch, which was two
inches thick and looked like a Dutch man-of-war; "it's nine o'clock;
the diligence of the Grand Bureau is never late."

"Is the gentleman young?" inquired the Abbe Cruchot.

"Yes," answered Monsieur des Grassins, "and he has brought luggage
which must weigh nearly three tons."

"Nanon does not come back," said Eugenie.

"It must be one of your relations," remarked the president.

"Let us go on with our game," said Madame Grandet gently. "I know from
Monsieur Grandet's tone of voice that he is annoyed; perhaps he would
not like to find us talking of his affairs."

"Mademoiselle," said Adolphe to his neighbor, "it is no doubt your
cousin Grandet,--a very good-looking young man; I met him at the ball
of Monsieur de Nucingen." Adolphe did not go on, for his mother trod
on his toes; and then, asking him aloud for two sous to put on her
stake, she whispered: "Will you hold your tongue, you great goose!"

At this moment Grandet returned, without la Grande Nanon, whose steps,
together with those of the porter, echoed up the staircase; and he was
followed by the traveller who had excited such curiosity and so filled
the lively imaginations of those present that his arrival at this
dwelling, and his sudden fall into the midst of this assembly, can
only be likened to that of a snail into a beehive, or the introduction
of a peacock into some village poultry-yard.

"Sit down near the fire," said Grandet.

Before seating himself, the young stranger saluted the assembled
company very gracefully. The men rose to answer by a courteous
inclination, and the women made a ceremonious bow.

"You are cold, no doubt, monsieur," said Madame Grandet; "you have,
perhaps, travelled from--"

"Just like all women!" said the old wine-grower, looking up from a
letter he was reading. "Do let monsieur rest himself!"

"But, father, perhaps monsieur would like to take something," said
Eugenie.

"He has got a tongue," said the old man sternly.

The stranger was the only person surprised by this scene; all the
others were well-used to the despotic ways of the master. However,
after the two questions and the two replies had been exchanged, the
newcomer rose, turned his back towards the fire, lifted one foot so as
to warm the sole of its boot, and said to Eugenie,--

"Thank you, my cousin, but I dined at Tours. And," he added, looking
at Grandet, "I need nothing; I am not even tired."

"Monsieur has come from the capital?" asked Madame des Grassins.

Monsieur Charles,--such was the name of the son of Monsieur Grandet of
Paris,--hearing himself addressed, took a little eye-glass, suspended
by a chain from his neck, applied it to his right eye to examine what
was on the table, and also the persons sitting round it. He ogled
Madame des Grassins with much impertinence, and said to her, after he
had observed all he wished,--

"Yes, madame. You are playing at loto, aunt," he added. "Do not let me
interrupt you, I beg; go on with your game: it is too amusing to
leave."

"I was certain it was the cousin," thought Madame des Grassins,
casting repeated glances at him.

"Forty-seven!" cried the old abbe. "Mark it down, Madame des Grassins.
Isn't that your number?"

Monsieur des Grassins put a counter on his wife's card, who sat
watching first the cousin from Paris and then Eugenie, without
thinking of her loto, a prey to mournful presentiments. From time to
time the young the heiress glanced furtively at her cousin, and the
banker's wife easily detected a /crescendo/ of surprise and curiosity
in her mind.

Monsieur Charles Grandet, a handsome young man of twenty-two,
presented at this moment a singular contrast to the worthy
provincials, who, considerably disgusted by his aristocratic manners,
were all studying him with sarcastic intent. This needs an
explanation. At twenty-two, young people are still so near childhood
that they often conduct themselves childishly. In all probability, out
of every hundred of them fully ninety-nine would have behaved
precisely as Monsieur Charles Grandet was now behaving.

Some days earlier than this his father had told him to go and spend
several months with his uncle at Saumur. Perhaps Monsieur Grandet was
thinking of Eugenie. Charles, sent for the first time in his life into
the provinces, took a fancy to make his appearance with the
superiority of a man of fashion, to reduce the whole arrondissement to
despair by his luxury, and to make his visit an epoch, importing into
those country regions all the refinements of Parisian life. In short,
to explain it in one word, he mean to pass more time at Saumur in
brushing his nails than he ever thought of doing in Paris, and to
assume the extra nicety and elegance of dress which a young man of
fashion often lays aside for a certain negligence which in itself is
not devoid of grace. Charles therefore brought with him a complete
hunting-costume, the finest gun, the best hunting-knife in the
prettiest sheath to be found in all Paris. He brought his whole
collection of waistcoats. They were of all kinds,--gray, black, white,
scarabaeus-colored: some were shot with gold, some spangled, some
/chined/; some were double-breasted and crossed like a shawl, others
were straight in the collar; some had turned-over collars, some
buttoned up to the top with gilt buttons. He brought every variety of
collar and cravat in fashion at that epoch. He brought two of
Buisson's coats and all his finest linen He brought his pretty gold
toilet-set,--a present from his mother. He brought all his dandy
knick-knacks, not forgetting a ravishing little desk presented to him
by the most amiable of women,--amiable for him, at least,--a fine lady
whom he called Annette and who at this moment was travelling,
matrimonially and wearily, in Scotland, a victim to certain suspicions
which required a passing sacrifice of happiness; in the desk was much
pretty note-paper on which to write to her once a fortnight.

In short, it was as complete a cargo of Parisian frivolities as it was
possible for him to get together,--a collection of all the implements
of husbandry with which the youth of leisure tills his life, from the
little whip which helps to begin a duel, to the handsomely chased
pistols which end it. His father having told him to travel alone and
modestly, he had taken the coupe of the diligence all to himself,
rather pleased at not having to damage a delightful travelling-
carriage ordered for a journey on which he was to meet his Annette,
the great lady who, etc.,--whom he intended to rejoin at Baden in the
following June. Charles expected to meet scores of people at his
uncle's house, to hunt in his uncle's forests,--to live, in short, the
usual chateau life; he did not know that his uncle was in Saumur, and
had only inquired about him incidentally when asking the way to
Froidfond. Hearing that he was in town, he supposed that he should
find him in a suitable mansion.

In order that he might make a becoming first appearance before his
uncle either at Saumur or at Froidfond, he had put on his most elegant
travelling attire, simple yet exquisite,--"adorable," to use the word
which in those days summed up the special perfections of a man or a
thing. At Tours a hairdresser had re-curled his beautiful chestnut
locks; there he changed his linen and put on a black satin cravat,
which, combined with a round shirt-collar, framed his fair and smiling
countenance agreeably. A travelling great-coat, only half buttoned up,
nipped in his waist and disclosed a cashmere waistcoat crossed in
front, beneath which was another waistcoat of white material. His
watch, negligently slipped into a pocket, was fastened by a short gold
chain to a buttonhole. His gray trousers, buttoned up at the sides,
were set off at the seams with patterns of black silk embroidery. He
gracefully twirled a cane, whose chased gold knob did not mar the
freshness of his gray gloves. And to complete all, his cap was in
excellent taste. None but a Parisian, and a Parisian of the upper
spheres, could thus array himself without appearing ridiculous; none
other could give the harmony of self-conceit to all these fopperies,
which were carried off, however, with a dashing air,--the air of a
young man who has fine pistols, a sure aim, and Annette.

Now if you wish to understand the mutual amazement of the provincial
party and the young Parisian; if you would clearly see the brilliance
which the traveller's elegance cast among the gray shadows of the room
and upon the faces of this family group,--endeavor to picture to your
minds the Cruchots. All three took snuff, and had long ceased to
repress the habit of snivelling or to remove the brown blotches which
strewed the frills of their dingy shirts and the yellowing creases of
their crumpled collars. Their flabby cravats were twisted into ropes
as soon as they wound them about their throats. The enormous quantity
of linen which allowed these people to have their clothing washed only
once in six months, and to keep it during that time in the depths of
their closets, also enabled time to lay its grimy and decaying stains
upon it. There was perfect unison of ill-grace and senility about
them; their faces, as faded as their threadbare coats, as creased as
their trousers, were worn-out, shrivelled-up, and puckered. As for the
others, the general negligence of their dress, which was incomplete
and wanting in freshness,--like the toilet of all country places,
where insensibly people cease to dress for others and come to think
seriously of the price of a pair of gloves,--was in keeping with the
negligence of the Cruchots. A horror of fashion was the only point on
which the Grassinists and the Cruchotines agreed.

When the Parisian took up his eye-glass to examine the strange
accessories of this dwelling,--the joists of the ceiling, the color of
the woodwork, and the specks which the flies had left there in
sufficient number to punctuate the "Moniteur" and the "Encyclopaedia
of Sciences,"--the loto-players lifted their noses and looked at him
with as much curiosity as they might have felt about a giraffe.
Monsieur des Grassins and his son, to whom the appearance of a man of
fashion was not wholly unknown, were nevertheless as much astonished
as their neighbors, whether it was that they fell under the
indefinable influence of the general feeling, or that they really
shared it as with satirical glances they seemed to say to their
compatriots,--

"That is what you see in Paris!"

They were able to examine Charles at their leisure without fearing to
displease the master of the house. Grandet was absorbed in the long
letter which he held in his hand; and to read it he had taken the only
candle upon the card-table, paying no heed to his guests or their
pleasure. Eugenie, to whom such a type of perfection, whether of dress
or of person, was absolutely unknown, thought she beheld in her cousin
a being descended from seraphic spheres. She inhaled with delight the
fragrance wafted from the graceful curls of that brilliant head. She
would have liked to touch the soft kid of the delicate gloves. She
envied Charles his small hands, his complexion, the freshness and
refinement of his features. In short,--if it is possible to sum up the
effect this elegant being produced upon an ignorant young girl
perpetually employed in darning stockings or in mending her father's
clothes, and whose life flowed on beneath these unclean rafters,
seeing none but occasional passers along the silent street,--this
vision of her cousin roused in her soul an emotion of delicate desire
like that inspired in a young man by the fanciful pictures of women
drawn by Westall for the English "Keepsakes," and that engraved by the
Findens with so clever a tool that we fear, as we breathe upon the
paper, that the celestial apparitions may be wafted away. Charles drew
from his pocket a handkerchief embroidered by the great lady now
travelling in Scotland. As Eugenie saw this pretty piece of work, done
in the vacant hours which were lost to love, she looked at her cousin
to see if it were possible that he meant to make use of it. The
manners of the young man, his gestures, the way in which he took up
his eye-glass, his affected superciliousness, his contemptuous glance
at the coffer which had just given so much pleasure to the rich
heiress, and which he evidently regarded as without value, or even as
ridiculous,--all these things, which shocked the Cruchots and the des
Grassins, pleased Eugenie so deeply that before she slept she dreamed
long dreams of her phoenix cousin.

The loto-numbers were drawn very slowly, and presently the game came
suddenly to an end. La Grand Nanon entered and said aloud: "Madame, I
want the sheets for monsieur's bed."

Madame Grandet followed her out. Madame des Grassins said in a low
voice: "Let us keep our sous and stop playing." Each took his or her
two sous from the chipped saucer in which they had been put; then the
party moved in a body toward the fire.

"Have you finished your game?" said Grandet, without looking up from
his letter.

"Yes, yes!" replied Madame des Grassins, taking a seat near Charles.

Eugenie, prompted by a thought often born in the heart of a young girl
when sentiment enters it for the first time, left the room to go and
help her mother and Nanon. Had an able confessor then questioned her
she would, no doubt, have avowed to him that she thought neither of
her mother nor of Nanon, but was pricked by a poignant desire to look
after her cousin's room and concern herself with her cousin; to supply
what might be needed, to remedy any forgetfulness, to see that all was
done to make it, as far as possible, suitable and elegant; and, in
fact, she arrived in time to prove to her mother and Nanon that
everything still remained to be done. She put into Nanon's head the
notion of passing a warming-pan between the sheets. She herself
covered the old table with a cloth and requested Nanon to change it
every morning; she convinced her mother that it was necessary to light
a good fire, and persuaded Nanon to bring up a great pile of wood into
the corridor without saying anything to her father. She ran to get,
from one of the corner-shelves of the hall, a tray of old lacquer
which was part of the inheritance of the late Monsieur de la
Bertelliere, catching up at the same time a six-sided crystal goblet,
a little tarnished gilt spoon, an antique flask engraved with cupids,
all of which she put triumphantly on the corner of her cousin's
chimney-piece. More ideas surged through her head in one quarter of an
hour than she had ever had since she came into the world.

"Mamma," she said, "my cousin will never bear the smell of a tallow
candle; suppose we buy a wax one?" And she darted, swift as a bird, to
get the five-franc piece which she had just received for her monthly
expenses. "Here, Nanon," she cried, "quick!"

"What will your father say?" This terrible remonstrance was uttered by
Madame Grandet as she beheld her daughter armed with an old Sevres
sugar-basin which Grandet had brought home from the chateau of
Froidfond. "And where will you get the sugar? Are you crazy?"

"Mamma, Nanon can buy some sugar as well as the candle."

"But your father?"

"Surely his nephew ought not to go without a glass of /eau sucree/?
Besides, he will not notice it."

"Your father sees everything," said Madame Grandet, shaking her head.

Nanon hesitated; she knew her master.

"Come, Nanon, go,--because it is my birthday."

Nanon gave a loud laugh as she heard the first little jest her young
mistress had ever made, and then obeyed her.

While Eugenie and her mother were trying to embellish the bedroom
assigned by Monsieur Grandet for his nephew, Charles himself was the
object of Madame des Grassins' attentions; to all appearances she was
setting her cap at him.

"You are very courageous, monsieur," she said to the young dandy, "to
leave the pleasures of the capital at this season and take up your
abode in Saumur. But if we do not frighten you away, you will find
there are some amusements even here."

She threw him the ogling glance of the provinces, where women put so
much prudence and reserve into their eyes that they impart to them the
prudish concupiscence peculiar to certain ecclesiastics to whom all
pleasure is either a theft or an error. Charles was so completely out
of his element in this abode, and so far from the vast chateau and the
sumptuous life with which his fancy had endowed his uncle, that as he
looked at Madame des Grassins he perceived a dim likeness to Parisian
faces. He gracefully responded to the species of invitation addressed
to him, and began very naturally a conversation, in which Madame des
Grassins gradually lowered her voice so as to bring it into harmony
with the nature of the confidences she was making. With her, as with
Charles, there was the need of conference; so after a few moments
spent in coquettish phrases and a little serious jesting, the clever
provincial said, thinking herself unheard by the others, who were
discussing the sale of wines which at that season filled the heads of
every one in Saumur,--

"Monsieur if you will do us the honor to come and see us, you will
give as much pleasure to my husband as to myself. Our salon is the
only one in Saumur where you will find the higher business circles
mingling with the nobility. We belong to both societies, who meet at
our house simply because they find it amusing. My husband--I say it
with pride--is as much valued by the one class as by the other. We
will try to relieve the monotony of your visit here. If you stay all
the time with Monsieur Grandet, good heavens! what will become of you?
Your uncle is a sordid miser who thinks of nothing but his vines; your
aunt is a pious soul who can't put two ideas together; and your cousin
is a little fool, without education, perfectly common, no fortune, who
will spend her life in darning towels."

"She is really very nice, this woman," thought Charles Grandet as he
duly responded to Madame des Grassins' coquetries.

"It seems to me, wife, that you are taking possession of monsieur,"
said the stout banker, laughing.

On this remark the notary and the president said a few words that were
more or less significant; but the abbe, looking at them slyly, brought
their thoughts to a focus by taking a pinch of snuff and saying as he
handed round his snuff-box: "Who can do the honors of Saumur for
monsieur so well as madame?"

"Ah! what do you mean by that, monsieur l'abbe?" demanded Monsieur des
Grassins.

"I mean it in the best possible sense for you, for madame, for the
town of Saumur, and for monsieur," said the wily old man, turning to
Charles.

The Abbe Cruchot had guessed the conversation between Charles and
Madame des Grassins without seeming to pay attention to it.

"Monsieur," said Adolphe to Charles with an air which he tried to make
free and easy, "I don't know whether you remember me, but I had the
honor of dancing as your /vis-a-vis/ at a ball given by the Baron de
Nucingen, and--"

"Perfectly; I remember perfectly, monsieur," answered Charles, pleased
to find himself the object of general attention.

"Monsieur is your son?" he said to Madame des Grassins.

The abbe looked at her maliciously.

"Yes, monsieur," she answered.

"Then you were very young when you were in Paris?" said Charles,
addressing Adolphe.

"You must know, monsieur," said the abbe, "that we send them to
Babylon as soon as they are weaned."

Madame des Grassins examined the abbe with a glance of extreme
penetration.

"It is only in the provinces," he continued, "that you will find women
of thirty and more years as fresh as madame, here, with a son about to
take his degree. I almost fancy myself back in the days when the young
men stood on chairs in the ball-room to see you dance, madame," said
the abbe, turning to his female adversary. "To me, your triumphs are
but of yesterday--"

"The old rogue!" thought Madame Grassins; "can he have guessed my
intentions?"

"It seems that I shall have a good deal of success in Saumur," thought
Charles as he unbuttoned his great-coat, put a hand into his
waistcoat, and cast a glance into the far distance, to imitate the
attitude which Chantrey has given to Lord Byron.

The inattention of Pere Grandet, or, to speak more truly, the
preoccupation of mind into which the reading of the letter had plunged
him, did not escape the vigilance of the notary and the president, who
tried to guess the contents of the letter by the almost imperceptible
motions of the miser's face, which was then under the full light of
the candle. He maintained the habitual calm of his features with
evident difficulty; we may, in fact, picture to ourselves the
countenance such a man endeavored to preserve as he read the fatal
letter which here follows:--

  My Brother,--It is almost twenty-three years since we have seen
  each other. My marriage was the occasion of our last interview,
  after which we parted, and both of us were happy. Assuredly I
  could not then foresee that you would one day be the prop of the
  family whose prosperity you then predicted.

  When you hold this letter within your hands I shall be no longer
  living. In the position I now hold I cannot survive the disgrace
  of bankruptcy. I have waited on the edge of the gulf until the
  last moment, hoping to save myself. The end has come, I must sink
  into it. The double bankruptcies of my broker and of Roguin, my
  notary, have carried off my last resources and left me nothing. I
  have the bitterness of owing nearly four millions, with assets not
  more than twenty-five per cent in value to pay them. The wines in
  my warehouses suffer from the fall in prices caused by the 
  abundance and quality of your vintage. In three days Paris will
  cry out: "Monsieur Grandet was a knave!" and I, an honest man,
  shall be lying in my winding-sheet of infamy. I deprive my son of
  a good name, which I have stained, and the fortune of his mother,
  which I have lost. He knows nothing of all this,--my unfortunate
  child whom I idolize! We parted tenderly. He was ignorant,
  happily, that the last beatings of my heart were spent in that
  farewell. Will he not some day curse me? My brother, my brother!
  the curses of our children are horrible; they can appeal against
  ours, but theirs are irrevocable. Grandet, you are my elder
  brother, you owe me your protection; act for me so that Charles
  may cast no bitter words upon my grave! My brother, if I were
  writing with my blood, with my tears, no greater anguish could I
  put into this letter,--nor as great, for then I should weep, I
  should bleed, I should die, I should suffer no more, but now I
  suffer and look at death with dry eyes.

  From henceforth you are my son's father; he has no relations, as
  you well know, on his mother's side. Why did I not consider social
  prejudices? Why did I yield to love? Why did I marry the natural
  daughter of a great lord? Charles has no family. Oh, my unhappy
  son! my son! Listen, Grandet! I implore nothing for myself,--
  besides, your property may not be large enough to carry a mortgage
  of three millions,--but for my son! Brother, my suppliant hands
  are clasped as I think of you; behold them! Grandet, I confide my
  son to you in dying, and I look at the means of death with less
  pain as I think that you will be to him a father. He loved me
  well, my Charles; I was good to him, I never thwarted him; he will
  not curse me. Ah, you see! he is gentle, he is like his mother, he
  will cause you no grief. Poor boy! accustomed to all the
  enjoyments of luxury, he knows nothing of the privations to which
  you and I were condemned by the poverty of our youth. And I leave
  him ruined! alone! Yes, all my friends will avoid him, and it is I
  who have brought this humiliation upon him! Would that I had the
  force to send him with one thrust into the heavens to his mother's
  side! Madness! I come back to my disaster--to his. I send him to
  you that you may tell him in some fitting way of my death, of his
  future fate. Be a father to him, but a good father. Do not tear
  him all at once from his idle life, it would kill him. I beg him
  on my knees to renounce all rights that, as his mother's heir, he
  may have on my estate. But the prayer is superfluous; he is
  honorable, and he will feel that he must not appear among my
  creditors. Bring him to see this at the right time; reveal to him
  the hard conditions of the life I have made for him: and if he
  still has tender thoughts of me, tell him in my name that all is
  not lost for him. Yes, work, labor, which saved us both, may give
  him back the fortune of which I have deprived him; and if he
  listens to his father's voice as it reaches him from the grave, he
  will go the Indies. My brother, Charles is an upright and
  courageous young man; give him the wherewithal to make his
  venture; he will die sooner than not repay you the funds which you
  may lend him. Grandet! if you will not do this, you will lay up
  for yourself remorse. Ah, should my child find neither tenderness
  nor succor in you, I would call down the vengeance of God upon
  your cruelty!

  If I had been able to save something from the wreck, I might have
  had the right to leave him at least a portion of his mother's
  property; but my last monthly payments have absorbed everything. I
  did not wish to die uncertain of my child's fate; I hoped to feel
  a sacred promise in a clasp of your hand which might have warmed
  my heart: but time fails me. While Charles is journeying to you I
  shall be preparing my assignment. I shall endeavor to show by the
  order and good faith of my accounts that my disaster comes neither
  from a faulty life nor from dishonesty. It is for my son's sake
  that I strive to do this.

  Farewell, my brother! May the blessing of God be yours for the
  generous guardianship I lay upon you, and which, I doubt not, you
  will accept. A voice will henceforth and forever pray for you in
  that world where we must all go, and where I am now as you read
  these lines.

Victor-Ange-Guillaume Grandet.


"So you are talking?" said Pere Grandet as he carefully folded the
letter in its original creases and put it into his waistcoat-pocket.
He looked at his nephew with a humble, timid air, beneath which he hid
his feelings and his calculations. "Have you warmed yourself?" he said
to him.

"Thoroughly, my dear uncle."

"Well, where are the women?" said his uncle, already forgetting that
his nephew was to sleep at the house. At this moment Eugenie and
Madame Grandet returned.

"Is the room all ready?" said Grandet, recovering his composure.

"Yes, father."

"Well then, my nephew, if you are tired, Nanon shall show you your
room. It isn't a dandy's room; but you will excuse a poor wine-grower
who never has a penny to spare. Taxes swallow up everything."

"We do not wish to intrude, Grandet," said the banker; "you may want
to talk to your nephew, and therefore we will bid you good-night."

At these words the assembly rose, and each made a parting bow in
keeping with his or her own character. The old notary went to the door
to fetch his lantern and came back to light it, offering to accompany
the des Grassins on their way. Madame des Grassins had not foreseen
the incident which brought the evening prematurely to an end, her
servant therefore had not arrived.

"Will you do me the honor to take my arm, madame?" said the abbe.

"Thank you, monsieur l'abbe, but I have my son," she answered dryly.

"Ladies cannot compromise themselves with me," said the abbe.

"Take Monsieur Cruchot's arm," said her husband.

The abbe walked off with the pretty lady so quickly that they were
soon some distance in advance of the caravan.

"That is a good-looking young man, madame," he said, pressing her arm.
"Good-by to the grapes, the vintage is done. It is all over with us.
We may as well say adieu to Mademoiselle Grandet. Eugenie will belong
to the dandy. Unless this cousin is enamoured of some Parisian woman,
your son Adolphe will find another rival in--"

"Not at all, monsieur l'abbe. This young man cannot fail to see that
Eugenie is a little fool,--a girl without the least freshness. Did you
notice her to-night? She was as yellow as a quince."

"Perhaps you made the cousin notice it?"

"I did not take the trouble--"

"Place yourself always beside Eugenie, madame, and you need never take
the trouble to say anything to the young man against his cousin; he
will make his own comparisons, which--"

"Well, he has promised to dine with me the day after to-morrow."

"Ah! if you only /would/, madame--" said the abbe.

"What is it that you wish me to do, monsieur l'abbe? Do you mean to
offer me bad advice? I have not reached the age of thirty-nine,
without a stain upon my reputation, thank God! to compromise myself
now, even for the empire of the Great Mogul. You and I are of an age
when we both know the meaning of words. For an ecclesiastic, you
certainly have ideas that are very incongruous. Fie! it is worthy of
Faublas!"

"You have read Faublas?"

"No, monsieur l'abbe; I meant to say the /Liaisons dangereuses/."

"Ah! that book is infinitely more moral," said the abbe, laughing.
"But you make me out as wicked as a young man of the present day; I
only meant--"

"Do you dare to tell me you were not thinking of putting wicked things
into my head? Isn't it perfectly clear? If this young man--who I admit
is very good-looking--were to make love to me, he would not think of
his cousin. In Paris, I know, good mothers do devote themselves in
this way to the happiness and welfare of their children; but we live
in the provinces, monsieur l'abbe."

"Yes, madame."

"And," she continued, "I do not want, and Adolphe himself would not
want, a hundred millions brought at such a price."

"Madame, I said nothing about a hundred millions; that temptation
might be too great for either of us to withstand. Only, I do think
that an honest woman may permit herself, in all honor, certain
harmless little coquetries, which are, in fact, part of her social
duty and which--"

"Do you think so?"

"Are we not bound, madame, to make ourselves agreeable to each other?
--Permit me to blow my nose.--I assure you, madame," he resumed, "that
the young gentleman ogled you through his glass in a more flattering
manner than he put on when he looked at me; but I forgive him for
doing homage to beauty in preference to old age--"

"It is quite apparent," said the president in his loud voice, "that
Monsieur Grandet of Paris has sent his son to Saumur with extremely
matrimonial intentions."

"But in that case the cousin wouldn't have fallen among us like a
cannon-ball," answered the notary.

"That doesn't prove anything," said Monsieur des Grassins; "the old
miser is always making mysteries."

"Des Grassins, my friend, I have invited the young man to dinner. You
must go and ask Monsieur and Madame de Larsonniere and the du Hautoys,
with the beautiful demoiselle du Hautoy, of course. I hope she will be
properly dressed; that jealous mother of hers does make such a fright
of her! Gentlemen, I trust that you will all do us the honor to come,"
she added, stopping the procession to address the two Cruchots.

"Here you are at home, madame," said the notary.

After bowing to the three des Grassins, the three Cruchots returned
home, applying their provincial genius for analysis to studying, under
all its aspects, the great event of the evening, which undoubtedly
changed the respective positions of Grassinists and Cruchotines. The
admirable common-sense which guided all the actions of these great
machinators made each side feel the necessity of a momentary alliance
against a common enemy. Must they not mutually hinder Eugenie from
loving her cousin, and the cousin from thinking of Eugenie? Could the
Parisian resist the influence of treacherous insinuations, soft-spoken
calumnies, slanders full of faint praise and artless denials, which
should be made to circle incessantly about him and deceive him?



IV

When the four relations were left alone, Monsieur Grandet said to his
nephew,--

"We must go to bed. It is too late to talk about the matters which
have brought you here; to-morrow we will take a suitable moment. We
breakfast at eight o'clock; at midday we eat a little fruit or a bit
of bread, and drink a glass of white wine; and we dine, like the
Parisians, at five o'clock. That's the order of the day. If you like
to go and see the town and the environs you are free to do so. You
will excuse me if my occupations do not permit me to accompany you.
You may perhaps hear people say that I am rich,--Monsieur Grandet
this, Monsieur Grandet that. I let them talk; their gossip does not
hurt my credit. But I have not a penny; I work in my old age like an
apprentice whose worldly goods are a bad plane and two good arms.
Perhaps you'll soon know yourself what a franc costs when you have got
to sweat for it. Nanon, where are the candles?"

"I trust, my nephew, that you will find all you want," said Madame
Grandet; "but if you should need anything else, you can call Nanon."

"My dear aunt, I shall need nothing; I have, I believe, brought
everything with me. Permit me to bid you good-night, and my young
cousin also."

Charles took a lighted wax candle from Nanon's hand,--an Anjou candle,
very yellow in color, and so shopworn that it looked like tallow and
deceived Monsieur Grandet, who, incapable of suspecting its presence
under his roof, did not perceive this magnificence.

"I will show you the way," he said.

Instead of leaving the hall by the door which opened under the
archway, Grandet ceremoniously went through the passage which divided
the hall from the kitchen. A swing-door, furnished with a large oval
pane of glass, shut this passage from the staircase, so as to fend off
the cold air which rushed through it. But the north wind whistled none
the less keenly in winter, and, in spite of the sand-bags at the
bottom of the doors of the living-room, the temperature within could
scarcely be kept at a proper height. Nanon went to bolt the outer
door; then she closed the hall and let loose a wolf-dog, whose bark
was so strangled that he seemed to have laryngitis. This animal, noted
for his ferocity, recognized no one but Nanon; the two untutored
children of the fields understood each other.

When Charles saw the yellow, smoke-stained walls of the well of the
staircase, where each worm-eaten step shook under the heavy foot-fall
of his uncle, his expectations began to sober more and more. He
fancied himself in a hen-roost. His aunt and cousin, to whom he turned
an inquiring look, were so used to the staircase that they did not
guess the cause of his amazement, and took the glance for an
expression of friendliness, which they answered by a smile that made
him desperate.

"Why the devil did my father send me to such a place?" he said to
himself.

When they reached the first landing he saw three doors painted in
Etruscan red and without casings,--doors sunk in the dusty walls and
provided with iron bars, which in fact were bolts, each ending with
the pattern of a flame, as did both ends of the long sheath of the
lock. The first door at the top of the staircase, which opened into a
room directly above the kitchen, was evidently walled up. In fact, the
only entrance to that room was through Grandet's bedchamber; the room
itself was his office. The single window which lighted it, on the side
of the court, was protected by a lattice of strong iron bars. No one,
not even Madame Grandet, had permission to enter it. The old man chose
to be alone, like an alchemist in his laboratory. There, no doubt,
some hiding-place had been ingeniously constructed; there the title-
deeds of property were stored; there hung the scales on which to weigh
the louis; there were devised, by night and secretly, the estimates,
the profits, the receipts, so that business men, finding Grandet
prepared at all points, imagined that he got his cue from fairies or
demons; there, no doubt, while Nanon's loud snoring shook the rafters,
while the wolf-dog watched and yawned in the courtyard, while Madame
and Mademoiselle Grandet were quietly sleeping, came the old cooper to
cuddle, to con over, to caress and clutch and clasp his gold. The
walls were thick, the screens sure. He alone had the key of this
laboratory, where--so people declared--he studied the maps on which
his fruit-trees were marked, and calculated his profits to a vine, and
almost to a twig.

The door of Eugenie's chamber was opposite to the walled-up entrance
to this room. At the other end of the landing were the appartements of
the married pair, which occupied the whole front of the house. Madame
Grandet had a room next to that of Eugenie, which was entered through
a glass door. The master's chamber was separated from that of his wife
by a partition, and from the mysterious strong-room by a thick wall.
Pere Grandet lodged his nephew on the second floor, in the high
mansarde attic which was above his own bedroom, so that he might hear
him if the young man took it into his head to go and come. When
Eugenie and her mother reached the middle of the landing they kissed
each other for good-night; then with a few words of adieu to Charles,
cold upon the lips, but certainly very warm in the heart of the young
girl, they withdrew into their own chambers.

"Here you are in your room, my nephew," said Pere Grandet as he opened
the door. "If you need to go out, call Nanon; without her, beware! the
dog would eat you up without a word. Sleep well. Good-night. Ha! why,
they have made you a fire!" he cried.

At this moment Nanon appeared with the warming pan.

"Here's something more!" said Monsieur Grandet. "Do you take my nephew
for a lying-in woman? Carry off your brazier, Nanon!"

"But, monsieur, the sheets are damp, and this gentleman is as delicate
as a woman."

"Well, go on, as you've taken it into your head," said Grandet,
pushing her by the shoulders; "but don't set things on fire." So
saying, the miser went down-stairs, grumbling indistinct sentences.

Charles stood aghast in the midst of his trunks. After casting his
eyes on the attic-walls covered with that yellow paper sprinkled with
bouquets so well known in dance-houses, on the fireplace of ribbed
stone whose very look was chilling, on the chairs of yellow wood with
varnished cane seats that seemed to have more than the usual four
angles, on the open night-table capacious enough to hold a small
sergeant-at-arms, on the meagre bit of rag-carpet beside the bed, on
the tester whose cloth valance shook as if, devoured by moths, it was
about to fall, he turned gravely to la Grande Nanon and said,--

"Look here! my dear woman, just tell me, am I in the house of Monsieur
Grandet, formerly mayor of Saumur, and brother to Monsieur Grandet of
Paris?"

"Yes, monsieur; and a very good, a very kind, a very perfect
gentleman. Shall I help you to unpack your trunks?"

"Faith! yes, if you will, my old trooper. Didn't you serve in the
marines of the Imperial Guard?"

"Ho, ho, ho!" laughed Nanon. "What's that,--the marines of the guard?
Is it salt? Does it go in the water?"

"Here, get me my dressing-gown out of that valise; there's the key."

Nanon was wonder-struck by the sight of a dressing-gown made of green
silk, brocaded with gold flowers of an antique design.

"Are you going to put that on to go to bed with?" she asked.

"Yes."

"Holy Virgin! what a beautiful altar-cloth it would make for the
parish church! My dear darling monsieur, give it to the church, and
you'll save your soul; if you don't, you'll lose it. Oh, how nice you
look in it! I must call mademoiselle to see you."

"Come, Nanon, if Nanon you are, hold your tongue; let me go to bed.
I'll arrange my things to-morrow. If my dressing-gown pleases you so
much, you shall save your soul. I'm too good a Christian not to give
it to you when I go away, and you can do what you like with it."

Nanon stood rooted to the ground, gazing at Charles and unable to put
faith into his words.

"Good night, Nanon."

"What in the world have I come here for?" thought Charles as he went
to sleep. "My father is not a fool; my journey must have some object.
Pshaw! put off serious thought till the morrow, as some Greek idiot
said."

"Blessed Virgin! how charming he is, my cousin!" Eugenie was saying,
interrupting her prayers, which that night at least were never
finished.

Madame Grandet had no thoughts at all as she went to bed. She heard
the miser walking up and down his room through the door of
communication which was in the middle of the partition. Like all timid
women, she had studied the character of her lord. Just as the petrel
foresees the storm, she knew by imperceptible signs when an inward
tempest shook her husband; and at such times, to use an expression of
her own, she "feigned dead."

Grandet gazed at the door lined with sheet-iron which he lately put to
his sanctum, and said to himself,--

"What a crazy idea of my brother to bequeath his son to me! A fine
legacy! I have not fifty francs to give him. What are fifty francs to
a dandy who looked at my barometer as if he meant to make firewood of
it!"

In thinking over the consequences of that legacy of anguish Grandet
was perhaps more agitated than his brother had been at the moment of
writing it.

"I shall have that golden robe," thought Nanon, who went to sleep
tricked out in her altar-cloth, dreaming for the first time in her
life of flowers, embroidery, and damask, just as Eugenie was dreaming
of love.

*****

In the pure and monotonous life of young girls there comes a delicious
hour when the sun sheds its rays into their soul, when the flowers
express their thoughts, when the throbbings of the heart send upward
to the brain their fertilizing warmth and melt all thoughts into a
vague desire,--day of innocent melancholy and of dulcet joys! When
babes begin to see, they smile; when a young girl first perceives the
sentiment of nature, she smiles as she smiled when an infant. If light
is the first love of life, is not love a light to the heart? The
moment to see within the veil of earthly things had come for Eugenie.

An early riser, like all provincial girls, she was up betimes and said
her prayers, and then began the business of dressing,--a business
which henceforth was to have a meaning. First she brushed and smoothed
her chestnut hair and twisted its heavy masses to the top of her head
with the utmost care, preventing the loose tresses from straying, and
giving to her head a symmetry which heightened the timid candor of her
face; for the simplicity of these accessories accorded well with the
innocent sincerity of its lines. As she washed her hands again and
again in the cold water which hardened and reddened the skin, she
looked at her handsome round arms and asked herself what her cousin
did to make his hands so softly white, his nails so delicately curved.
She put on new stockings and her prettiest shoes. She laced her corset
straight, without skipping a single eyelet. And then, wishing for the
first time in her life to appear to advantage, she felt the joy of
having a new gown, well made, which rendered her attractive.

As she finished her toilet the clock of the parish church struck the
hour; to her astonishment, it was only seven. The desire of having
plenty of time for dressing carefully had led her to get up too early.
Ignorant of the art of retouching every curl and studying every
effect, Eugenie simply crossed her arms, sat down by the window, and
looked at the court-yard, the narrow garden, and the high terraced
walls that over-topped it: a dismal, hedged-in prospect, yet not
wholly devoid of those mysterious beauties which belong to solitary or
uncultivated nature. Near the kitchen was a well surrounded by a curb,
with a pulley fastened to a bent iron rod clasped by a vine whose
leaves were withered, reddened, and shrivelled by the season. From
thence the tortuous shoots straggled to the wall, clutched it, and ran
the whole length of the house, ending near the wood-pile, where the
logs were ranged with as much precision as the books in a library. The
pavement of the court-yard showed the black stains produced in time by
lichens, herbage, and the absence of all movement or friction. The
thick walls wore a coating of green moss streaked with waving brown
lines, and the eight stone steps at the bottom of the court-yard which
led up to the gate of the garden were disjointed and hidden beneath
tall plants, like the tomb of a knight buried by his widow in the days
of the Crusades. Above a foundation of moss-grown, crumbling stones
was a trellis of rotten wood, half fallen from decay; over them
clambered and intertwined at will a mass of clustering creepers. On
each side of the latticed gate stretched the crooked arms of two
stunted apple-trees. Three parallel walks, gravelled and separated
from each other by square beds, where the earth was held in by box-
borders, made the garden, which terminated, beneath a terrace of the
old walls, in a group of lindens. At the farther end were raspberry-
bushes; at the other, near the house, an immense walnut-tree drooped
its branches almost into the window of the miser's sanctum.

A clear day and the beautiful autumnal sun common to the banks of the
Loire was beginning to melt the hoar-frost which the night had laid on
these picturesque objects, on the walls, and on the plants which
swathed the court-yard. Eugenie found a novel charm in the aspect of
things lately so insignificant to her. A thousand confused thoughts
came to birth in her mind and grew there, as the sunbeams grew without
along the wall. She felt that impulse of delight, vague, inexplicable,
which wraps the moral being as a cloud wraps the physical body. Her
thoughts were all in keeping with the details of this strange
landscape, and the harmonies of her heart blended with the harmonies
of nature. When the sun reached an angle of the wall where the "Venus-
hair" of southern climes drooped its thick leaves, lit with the
changing colors of a pigeon's breast, celestial rays of hope illumined
the future to her eyes, and thenceforth she loved to gaze upon that
piece of wall, on its pale flowers, its blue harebells, its wilting
herbage, with which she mingled memories as tender as those of
childhood. The noise made by each leaf as it fell from its twig in the
void of that echoing court gave answer to the secret questionings of
the young girl, who could have stayed there the livelong day without
perceiving the flight of time. Then came tumultuous heavings of the
soul. She rose often, went to her glass, and looked at herself, as an
author in good faith looks at his work to criticise it and blame it in
his own mind.

"I am not beautiful enough for him!" Such was Eugenie's thought,--a
humble thought, fertile in suffering. The poor girl did not do herself
justice; but modesty, or rather fear, is among the first of love's
virtues. Eugenie belonged to the type of children with sturdy
constitutions, such as we see among the lesser bourgeoisie, whose
beauties always seem a little vulgar; and yet, though she resembled
the Venus of Milo, the lines of her figure were ennobled by the softer
Christian sentiment which purifies womanhood and gives it a
distinction unknown to the sculptors of antiquity. She had an enormous
head, with the masculine yet delicate forehead of the Jupiter of
Phidias, and gray eyes, to which her chaste life, penetrating fully
into them, carried a flood of light. The features of her round face,
formerly fresh and rosy, were at one time swollen by the small-pox,
which destroyed the velvet texture of the skin, though it kindly left
no other traces, and her cheek was still so soft and delicate that her
mother's kiss made a momentary red mark upon it. Her nose was somewhat
too thick, but it harmonized well with the vermilion mouth, whose
lips, creased in many lines, were full of love and kindness. The
throat was exquisitely round. The bust, well curved and carefully
covered, attracted the eye and inspired reverie. It lacked, no doubt,
the grace which a fitting dress can bestow; but to a connoisseur the
non-flexibility of her figure had its own charm. Eugenie, tall and
strongly made, had none of the prettiness which pleases the masses;
but she was beautiful with a beauty which the spirit recognizes, and
none but artists truly love. A painter seeking here below for a type
of Mary's celestial purity, searching womankind for those proud modest
eyes which Raphael divined, for those virgin lines, often due to
chances of conception, which the modesty of Christian life alone can
bestow or keep unchanged,--such a painter, in love with his ideal,
would have found in the face of Eugenie the innate nobleness that is
ignorant of itself; he would have seen beneath the calmness of that
brow a world of love; he would have felt, in the shape of the eyes, in
the fall of the eyelids, the presence of the nameless something that
we call divine. Her features, the contour of her head, which no
expression of pleasure had ever altered or wearied, were like the
lines of the horizon softly traced in the far distance across the
tranquil lakes. That calm and rosy countenance, margined with light
like a lovely full-blown flower, rested the mind, held the eye, and
imparted the charm of the conscience that was there reflected. Eugenie
was standing on the shore of life where young illusions flower, where
daisies are gathered with delights ere long to be unknown; and thus
she said, looking at her image in the glass, unconscious as yet of
love: "I am too ugly; he will not notice me."

Then she opened the door of her chamber which led to the staircase,
and stretched out her neck to listen for the household noises. "He is
not up," she thought, hearing Nanon's morning cough as the good soul
went and came, sweeping out the halls, lighting her fire, chaining the
dog, and speaking to the beasts in the stable. Eugenie at once went
down and ran to Nanon, who was milking the cow.

"Nanon, my good Nanon, make a little cream for my cousin's breakfast."

"Why, mademoiselle, you should have thought of that yesterday," said
Nanon, bursting into a loud peal of laughter. "I can't make cream.
Your cousin is a darling, a darling! oh, that he is! You should have
seen him in his dressing-gown, all silk and gold! I saw him, I did! He
wears linen as fine as the surplice of monsieur le cure."

"Nanon, please make us a /galette/."

"And who'll give me wood for the oven, and flour and butter for the
cakes?" said Nanon, who in her function of prime-minister to Grandet
assumed at times enormous importance in the eyes of Eugenie and her
mother. "Mustn't rob the master to feast the cousin. You ask him for
butter and flour and wood: he's your father, perhaps he'll give you
some. See! there he is now, coming to give out the provisions."

Eugenie escaped into the garden, quite frightened as she heard the
staircase shaking under her father's step. Already she felt the
effects of that virgin modesty and that special consciousness of
happiness which lead us to fancy, not perhaps without reason, that our
thoughts are graven on our foreheads and are open to the eyes of all.
Perceiving for the first time the cold nakedness of her father's
house, the poor girl felt a sort of rage that she could not put it in
harmony with her cousin's elegance. She felt the need of doing
something for him,--what, she did not know. Ingenuous and truthful,
she followed her angelic nature without mistrusting her impressions or
her feelings. The mere sight of her cousin had wakened within her the
natural yearnings of a woman,--yearnings that were the more likely to
develop ardently because, having reached her twenty-third year, she
was in the plenitude of her intelligence and her desires. For the
first time in her life her heart was full of terror at the sight of
her father; in him she saw the master of the fate, and she fancied
herself guilty of wrong-doing in hiding from his knowledge certain
thoughts. She walked with hasty steps, surprised to breathe a purer
air, to feel the sun's rays quickening her pulses, to absorb from
their heat a moral warmth and a new life. As she turned over in her
mind some stratagem by which to get the cake, a quarrel--an event as
rare as the sight of swallows in winter--broke out between la Grande
Nanon and Grandet. Armed with his keys, the master had come to dole
out provisions for the day's consumption.

"Is there any bread left from yesterday?" he said to Nanon.

"Not a crumb, monsieur."

Grandet took a large round loaf, well floured and moulded in one of
the flat baskets which they use for baking in Anjou, and was about to
cut it, when Nanon said to him,--

"We are five, to-day, monsieur."

"That's true," said Grandet, "but your loaves weigh six pounds;
there'll be some left. Besides, these young fellows from Paris don't
eat bread, you'll see."

"Then they must eat /frippe/?" said Nanon.

/Frippe/ is a word of the local lexicon of Anjou, and means any
accompaniment of bread, from butter which is spread upon it, the
commonest kind of /frippe/, to peach preserve, the most distinguished
of all the /frippes/; those who in their childhood have licked the
/frippe/ and left the bread, will comprehend the meaning of Nanon's
speech.

"No," answered Grandet, "they eat neither bread nor /frippe/; they are
something like marriageable girls."

After ordering the meals for the day with his usual parsimony, the
goodman, having locked the closets containing the supplies, was about
to go towards the fruit-garden, when Nanon stopped him to say,--

"Monsieur, give me a little flour and some butter, and I'll make a
/galette/ for the young ones."

"Are you going to pillage the house on account of my nephew?"

"I wasn't thinking any more of your nephew than I was of your dog,--
not more than you think yourself; for, look here, you've only forked
out six bits of sugar. I want eight."

"What's all this, Nanon? I have never seen you like this before. What
have you got in your head? Are you the mistress here? You sha'n't have
more than six pieces of sugar."

"Well, then, how is your nephew to sweeten his coffee?"

"With two pieces; I'll go without myself."

"Go without sugar at your age! I'd rather buy you some out of my own
pocket."

"Mind your own business."

In spite of the recent fall in prices, sugar was still in Grandet's
eyes the most valuable of all the colonial products; to him it was
always six francs a pound. The necessity of economizing it, acquired
under the Empire, had grown to be the most inveterate of his habits.
All women, even the greatest ninnies, know how to dodge and dodge to
get their ends; Nanon abandoned the sugar for the sake of getting the
/galette/.

"Mademoiselle!" she called through the window, "do you want some
/galette/?"

"No, no," answered Eugenie.

"Come, Nanon," said Grandet, hearing his daughter's voice. "See here."
He opened the cupboard where the flour was kept, gave her a cupful,
and added a few ounces of butter to the piece he had already cut off.

"I shall want wood for the oven," said the implacable Nanon.

"Well, take what you want," he answered sadly; "but in that case you
must make us a fruit-tart, and you'll cook the whole dinner in the
oven. In that way you won't need two fires."

"Goodness!" cried Nanon, "you needn't tell me that."

Grandet cast a look that was well-nigh paternal upon his faithful
deputy.

"Mademoiselle," she cried, when his back was turned, "we shall have
the /galette/."

Pere Grandet returned from the garden with the fruit and arranged a
plateful on the kitchen-table.

"Just see, monsieur," said Nanon, "what pretty boots your nephew has.
What leather! why it smells good! What does he clean it with, I
wonder? Am I to put your egg-polish on it?"

"Nanon, I think eggs would injure that kind of leather. Tell him you
don't know how to black morocco; yes, that's morocco. He will get you
something himself in Saumur to polish those boots with. I have heard
that they put sugar into the blacking to make it shine."

"They look good to eat," said the cook, putting the boots to her nose.
"Bless me! if they don't smell like madame's eau-de-cologne. Ah! how
funny!"

"Funny!" said her master. "Do you call it funny to put more money into
boots than the man who stands in them is worth?"

"Monsieur," she said, when Grandet returned the second time, after
locking the fruit-garden, "won't you have the /pot-au-feu/ put on once
or twice a week on account of your nephew?"

"Yes."

"Am I to go to the butcher's?"

"Certainly not. We will make the broth of fowls; the farmers will
bring them. I shall tell Cornoiller to shoot some crows; they make the
best soup in the world."

"Isn't it true, monsieur, that crows eat the dead?"

"You are a fool, Nanon. They eat what they can get, like the rest of
the world. Don't we all live on the dead? What are legacies?"

Monsieur Grandet, having no further orders to give, drew out his
watch, and seeing that he had half an hour to dispose of before
breakfast, he took his hat, went and kissed his daughter, and said to
her:

"Do you want to come for a walk in the fields, down by the Loire? I
have something to do there."

Eugenie fetched her straw bonnet, lined with pink taffeta; then the
father and daughter went down the winding street to the shore.

"Where are you going at this early hour?" said Cruchot, the notary,
meeting them.

"To see something," answered Grandet, not duped by the matutinal
appearance of his friend.

When Pere Grandet went to "see something," the notary knew by
experience there was something to be got by going with him; so he
went.

"Come, Cruchot," said Grandet, "you are one of my friends. I'll show
you what folly it is to plant poplar-trees on good ground."

"Do you call the sixty thousand francs that you pocketed for those
that were in your fields down by the Loire, folly?" said Maitre
Cruchot, opening his eyes with amazement. "What luck you have had! To
cut down your trees at the very time they ran short of white-wood at
Nantes, and to sell them at thirty francs!"

Eugenie listened, without knowing that she approached the most solemn
moment of her whole life, and that the notary was about to bring down
upon her head a paternal and supreme sentence. Grandet had now reached
the magnificent fields which he owned on the banks of the Loire, where
thirty workmen were employed in clearing away, filling up, and
levelling the spots formerly occupied by the poplars.

"Maitre Cruchot, see how much ground this tree once took up! Jean," he
cried to a laborer, "m-m-measure with your r-r-rule, b-both ways."

"Four times eight feet," said the man.

"Thirty-two feet lost," said Grandet to Cruchot. "I had three hundred
poplars in this one line, isn't that so? Well, then, three h-h-hundred
times thir-thirty-two lost m-m-me five hundred in h-h-hay; add twice
as much for the side rows,--fifteen hundred; the middle rows as much
more. So we may c-c-call it a th-thousand b-b-bales of h-h-hay--"

"Very good," said Cruchot, to help out his friend; "a thousand bales
are worth about six hundred francs."

"Say t-t-twelve hundred, be-c-cause there's three or four hundred
francs on the second crop. Well, then, c-c-calculate that t-twelve
thousand francs a year for f-f-forty years with interest c-c-comes
to--"

"Say sixty thousand francs," said the notary.

"I am willing; c-c-comes t-t-to sixty th-th-thousand. Very good,"
continued Grandet, without stuttering: "two thousand poplars forty
years old will only yield me fifty thousand francs. There's a loss. I
have found that myself," said Grandet, getting on his high horse.
"Jean, fill up all the holes except those at the bank of the river;
there you are to plant the poplars I have bought. Plant 'em there, and
they'll get nourishment from the government," he said, turning to
Cruchot, and giving a slight motion to the wen on his nose, which
expressed more than the most ironical of smiles.

"True enough; poplars should only be planted on poor soil," said
Cruchot, amazed at Grandet's calculations.

"Y-y-yes, monsieur," answered the old man satirically.

Eugenie, who was gazing at the sublime scenery of the Loire, and
paying no attention to her father's reckonings, presently turned an
ear to the remarks of Cruchot when she heard him say,--

"So you have brought a son-in-law from Paris. All Saumur is talking
about your nephew. I shall soon have the marriage-contract to draw up,
hey! Pere Grandet?"

"You g-g-got up very early to t-t-tell me that," said Grandet,
accompanying the remark with a motion of his wen. "Well, old
c-c-comrade, I'll be frank, and t-t-tell you what you want t-t-to
know. I would rather, do you see, f-f-fling my daughter into the Loire
than g-g-give her to her c-c-cousin. You may t-t-tell that everywhere,
--no, never mind; let the world t-t-talk."

This answer dazzled and blinded the young girl with sudden light. The
distant hopes upspringing in her heart bloomed suddenly, became real,
tangible, like a cluster of flowers, and she saw them cut down and
wilting on the earth. Since the previous evening she had attached
herself to Charles by those links of happiness which bind soul to
soul; from henceforth suffering was to rivet them. Is it not the noble
destiny of women to be more moved by the dark solemnities of grief
than by the splendors of fortune? How was it that fatherly feeling had
died out of her father's heart? Of what crime had Charles been guilty?
Mysterious questions! Already her dawning love, a mystery so profound,
was wrapping itself in mystery. She walked back trembling in all her
limbs; and when she reached the gloomy street, lately so joyous to
her, she felt its sadness, she breathed the melancholy which time and
events had printed there. None of love's lessons lacked. A few steps
from their own door she went on before her father and waited at the
threshold. But Grandet, who saw a newspaper in the notary's hand,
stopped short and asked,--

"How are the Funds?"

"You never listen to my advice, Grandet," answered Cruchot. "Buy soon;
you will still make twenty per cent in two years, besides getting an
excellent rate of interest,--five thousand a year for eighty thousand
francs fifty centimes."

"We'll see about that," answered Grandet, rubbing his chin.

"Good God!" exclaimed the notary.

"Well, what?" cried Grandet; and at the same moment Cruchot put the
newspaper under his eyes and said:

"Read that!"

  "Monsieur Grandet, one of the most respected merchants in Paris,
  blew his brains out yesterday, after making his usual appearance
  at the Bourse. He had sent his resignation to the president of the
  Chamber of Deputies, and had also resigned his functions as a
  judge of the commercial courts. The failures of Monsieur Roguin
  and Monsieur Souchet, his broker and his notary, had ruined him.
  The esteem felt for Monsieur Grandet and the credit he enjoyed
  were nevertheless such that he might have obtained the necessary
  assistance from other business houses. It is much to be regretted
  that so honorable a man should have yielded to momentary despair,"
  etc.

"I knew it," said the old wine-grower to the notary.

The words sent a chill of horror through Maitre Cruchot, who,
notwithstanding his impassibility as a notary, felt the cold running
down his spine as he thought that Grandet of Paris had possibly
implored in vain the millions of Grandet of Saumur.

"And his son, so joyous yesterday--"

"He knows nothing as yet," answered Grandet, with the same composure.

"Adieu! Monsieur Grandet," said Cruchot, who now understood the state
of the case, and went off to reassure Monsieur de Bonfons.

On entering, Grandet found breakfast ready. Madame Grandet, round
whose neck Eugenie had flung her arms, kissing her with the quick
effusion of feeling often caused by secret grief, was already seated
in her chair on castors, knitting sleeves for the coming winter.

"You can begin to eat," said Nanon, coming downstairs four steps at a
time; "the young one is sleeping like a cherub. Isn't he a darling
with his eyes shut? I went in and I called him: no answer."

"Let him sleep," said Grandet; "he'll wake soon enough to hear ill-
tidings."

"What is it?" asked Eugenie, putting into her coffee the two little
bits of sugar weighing less than half an ounce which the old miser
amused himself by cutting up in his leisure hours. Madame Grandet, who
did not dare to put the question, gazed at her husband.

"His father has blown his brains out."

"My uncle?" said Eugenie.

"Poor young man!" exclaimed Madame Grandet.

"Poor indeed!" said Grandet; "he isn't worth a sou!"

"Eh! poor boy, and he's sleeping like the king of the world!" said
Nanon in a gentle voice.

Eugenie stopped eating. Her heart was wrung, as the young heart is
wrung when pity for the suffering of one she loves overflows, for the
first time, the whole being of a woman. The poor girl wept.

"What are you crying about? You didn't know your uncle," said her
father, giving her one of those hungry tigerish looks he doubtless
threw upon his piles of gold.

"But, monsieur," said Nanon, "who wouldn't feel pity for the poor
young man, sleeping there like a wooden shoe, without knowing what's
coming?"

"I didn't speak to you, Nanon. Hold your tongue!"

Eugenie learned at that moment that the woman who loves must be able
to hide her feelings. She did not answer.

"You will say nothing to him about it, Ma'ame Grandet, till I return,"
said the old man. "I have to go and straighten the line of my hedge
along the high-road. I shall be back at noon, in time for the second
breakfast, and then I will talk with my nephew about his affairs. As
for you, Mademoiselle Eugenie, if it is for that dandy you are crying,
that's enough, child. He's going off like a shot to the Indies. You
will never see him again."

The father took his gloves from the brim of his hat, put them on with
his usual composure, pushed them in place by shoving the fingers of
both hands together, and went out.

"Mamma, I am suffocating!" cried Eugenie when she was alone with her
mother; "I have never suffered like this."

Madame Grandet, seeing that she turned pale, opened the window and let
her breathe fresh air.

"I feel better!" said Eugenie after a moment.

This nervous excitement in a nature hitherto, to all appearance, calm
and cold, reacted on Madame Grandet; she looked at her daughter with
the sympathetic intuition with which mothers are gifted for the
objects of their tenderness, and guessed all. In truth the life of the
Hungarian sisters, bound together by a freak of nature, could scarcely
have been more intimate than that of Eugenie and her mother,--always
together in the embrasure of that window, and sleeping together in the
same atmosphere.

"My poor child!" said Madame Grandet, taking Eugenie's head and laying
it upon her bosom.

At these words the young girl raised her head, questioned her mother
by a look, and seemed to search out her inmost thought.

"Why send him to the Indies?" she said. "If he is unhappy, ought he
not to stay with us? Is he not our nearest relation?"

"Yes, my child, it seems natural; but your father has his reasons: we
must respect them."

The mother and daughter sat down in silence, the former upon her
raised seat, the latter in her little armchair, and both took up their
work. Swelling with gratitude for the full heart-understanding her
mother had given her, Eugenie kissed the dear hand, saying,--

"How good you are, my kind mamma!"

The words sent a glow of light into the motherly face, worn and
blighted as it was by many sorrows.

"You like him?" asked Eugenie.

Madame Grandet only smiled in reply. Then, after a moment's silence,
she said in a low voice: "Do you love him already? That is wrong."

"Wrong?" said Eugenie. "Why is it wrong? You are pleased with him,
Nanon is pleased with him; why should he not please me? Come, mamma,
let us set the table for his breakfast."

She threw down her work, and her mother did the same, saying, "Foolish
child!" But she sanctioned the child's folly by sharing it. Eugenie
called Nanon.

"What do you want now, mademoiselle?"

"Nanon, can we have cream by midday?"

"Ah! midday, to be sure you can," answered the old servant.

"Well, let him have his coffee very strong; I heard Monsieur des
Grassins say that they make the coffee very strong in Paris. Put in a
great deal."

"Where am I to get it?"

"Buy some."

"Suppose monsieur meets me?"

"He has gone to his fields."

"I'll run, then. But Monsieur Fessard asked me yesterday if the Magi
had come to stay with us when I bought the wax candle. All the town
will know our goings-on."

"If your father finds it out," said Madame Grandet, "he is capable of
beating us."

"Well, let him beat us; we will take his blows on our knees."

Madame Grandet for all answer raised her eyes to heaven. Nanon put on
her hood and went off. Eugenie got out some clean table-linen, and
went to fetch a few bunches of grapes which she had amused herself by
hanging on a string across the attic; she walked softly along the
corridor, so as not to waken her cousin, and she could not help
listening at the door to his quiet breathing.

"Sorrow is watching while he sleeps," she thought.

She took the freshest vine-leaves and arranged her dish of grapes as
coquettishly as a practised house-keeper might have done, and placed
it triumphantly on the table. She laid hands on the pears counted out
by her father, and piled them in a pyramid mixed with leaves. She went
and came, and skipped and ran. She would have liked to lay under
contribution everything in her father's house; but the keys were in
his pocket. Nanon came back with two fresh eggs. At sight of them
Eugenie almost hugged her round the neck.

"The farmer from Lande had them in his basket. I asked him for them,
and he gave them to me, the darling, for nothing, as an attention!"



V

After two hours' thought and care, during which Eugenie jumped up
twenty times from her work to see if the coffee were boiling, or to go
and listen to the noise her cousin made in dressing, she succeeded in
preparing a simple little breakfast, very inexpensive, but which,
nevertheless, departed alarmingly from the inveterate customs of the
house. The midday breakfast was always taken standing. Each took a
slice of bread, a little fruit or some butter, and a glass of wine. As
Eugenie looked at the table drawn up near the fire with an arm-chair
placed before her cousin's plate, at the two dishes of fruit, the egg-
cup, the bottle of white wine, the bread, and the sugar heaped up in a
saucer, she trembled in all her limbs at the mere thought of the look
her father would give her if he should come in at that moment. She
glanced often at the clock to see if her cousin could breakfast before
the master's return.

"Don't be troubled, Eugenie; if your father comes in, I will take it
all upon myself," said Madame Grandet.

Eugenie could not repress a tear.

"Oh, my good mother!" she cried, "I have never loved you enough."

Charles, who had been tramping about his room for some time, singing
to himself, now came down. Happily, it was only eleven o'clock. The
true Parisian! he had put as much dandyism into his dress as if he
were in the chateau of the noble lady then travelling in Scotland. He
came into the room with the smiling, courteous manner so becoming to
youth, which made Eugenie's heart beat with mournful joy. He had taken
the destruction of his castles in Anjou as a joke, and came up to his
aunt gaily.

"Have you slept well, dear aunt? and you, too, my cousin?"

"Very well, monsieur; did you?" said Madame Grandet.

"I? perfectly."

"You must be hungry, cousin," said Eugenie; "will you take your seat?"

"I never breakfast before midday; I never get up till then. However, I
fared so badly on the journey that I am glad to eat something at once.
Besides--" here he pulled out the prettiest watch Breguet ever made.
"Dear me! I am early, it is only eleven o'clock!"

"Early?" said Madame Grandet.

"Yes; but I wanted to put my things in order. Well, I shall be glad to
have anything to eat,--anything, it doesn't matter what, a chicken, a
partridge."

"Holy Virgin!" exclaimed Nanon, overhearing the words.

"A partridge!" whispered Eugenie to herself; she would gladly have
given the whole of her little hoard for a partridge.

"Come and sit down," said his aunt.

The young dandy let himself drop into an easy-chair, just as a pretty
woman falls gracefully upon a sofa. Eugenie and her mother took
ordinary chairs and sat beside him, near the fire.

"Do you always live here?" said Charles, thinking the room uglier by
daylight than it had seemed the night before.

"Always," answered Eugenie, looking at him, "except during the
vintage. Then we go and help Nanon, and live at the Abbaye des
Noyers."

"Don't you ever take walks?"

"Sometimes on Sunday after vespers, when the weather is fine," said
Madame Grandet, "we walk on the bridge, or we go and watch the
haymakers."

"Have you a theatre?"

"Go to the theatre!" exclaimed Madame Grandet, "see a play! Why,
monsieur, don't you know it is a mortal sin?"

"See here, monsieur," said Nanon, bringing in the eggs, "here are your
chickens,--in the shell."

"Oh! fresh eggs," said Charles, who, like all people accustomed to
luxury, had already forgotten about his partridge, "that is delicious:
now, if you will give me the butter, my good girl."

"Butter! then you can't have the /galette/."

"Nanon, bring the butter," cried Eugenie.

The young girl watched her cousin as he cut his sippets, with as much
pleasure as a grisette takes in a melodrama where innocence and virtue
triumph. Charles, brought up by a charming mother, improved, and
trained by a woman of fashion, had the elegant, dainty, foppish
movements of a coxcomb. The compassionate sympathy and tenderness of a
young girl possess a power that is actually magnetic; so that Charles,
finding himself the object of the attentions of his aunt and cousin,
could not escape the influence of feelings which flowed towards him,
as it were, and inundated him. He gave Eugenie a bright, caressing
look full of kindness,--a look which seemed itself a smile. He
perceived, as his eyes lingered upon her, the exquisite harmony of
features in the pure face, the grace of her innocent attitude, the
magic clearness of the eyes, where young love sparkled and desire
shone unconsciously.

"Ah! my dear cousin, if you were in full dress at the Opera, I assure
you my aunt's words would come true,--you would make the men commit
the mortal sin of envy, and the women the sin of jealousy."

The compliment went to Eugenie's heart and set it beating, though she
did not understand its meaning.

"Oh! cousin," she said, "you are laughing at a poor little country
girl."

"If you knew me, my cousin, you would know that I abhor ridicule; it
withers the heart and jars upon all my feelings." Here he swallowed
his buttered sippet very gracefully. "No, I really have not enough
mind to make fun of others; and doubtless it is a great defect. In
Paris, when they want to disparage a man, they say: 'He has a good
heart.' The phrase means: 'The poor fellow is as stupid as a
rhinoceros.' But as I am rich, and known to hit the bull's-eye at
thirty paces with any kind of pistol, and even in the open fields,
ridicule respects me."

"My dear nephew, that bespeaks a good heart."

"You have a very pretty ring," said Eugenie; "is there any harm in
asking to see it?"

Charles held out his hand after loosening the ring, and Eugenie
blushed as she touched the pink nails of her cousin with the tips of
her fingers.

"See, mamma, what beautiful workmanship."

"My! there's a lot of gold!" said Nanon, bringing in the coffee.

"What is that?" exclaimed Charles, laughing, as he pointed to an
oblong pot of brown earthenware, glazed on the inside, and edged with
a fringe of ashes, from the bottom of which the coffee-grounds were
bubbling up and falling in the boiling liquid.

"It is boiled coffee," said Nanon.

"Ah! my dear aunt, I shall at least leave one beneficent trace of my
visit here. You are indeed behind the age! I must teach you to make
good coffee in a Chaptal coffee-pot."

He tried to explain the process of a Chaptal coffee-pot.

"Gracious! if there are so many things as all that to do," said Nanon,
"we may as well give up our lives to it. I shall never make coffee
that way; I know that! Pray, who is to get the fodder for the cow
while I make the coffee?"

"I will make it," said Eugenie.

"Child!" said Madame Grandet, looking at her daughter.

The word recalled to their minds the sorrow that was about to fall
upon the unfortunate young man; the three women were silent, and
looked at him with an air of commiseration that caught his attention.

"Is anything the matter, my cousin?" he said.

"Hush!" said Madame Grandet to Eugenie, who was about to answer; "you
know, my daughter, that your father charged us not to speak to
monsieur--"

"Say Charles," said young Grandet.

"Ah! you are called Charles? What a beautiful name!" cried Eugenie.

Presentiments of evil are almost always justified. At this moment
Nanon, Madame Grandet, and Eugenie, who had all three been thinking
with a shudder of the old man's return, heard the knock whose echoes
they knew but too well.

"There's papa!" said Eugenie.

She removed the saucer filled with sugar, leaving a few pieces on the
table-cloth; Nanon carried off the egg-cup; Madame Grandet sat up like
a frightened hare. It was evidently a panic, which amazed Charles, who
was wholly unable to understand it.

"Why! what is the matter?" he asked.

"My father has come," answered Eugenie.

"Well, what of that?"

Monsieur Grandet entered the room, threw his keen eye upon the table,
upon Charles, and saw the whole thing.

"Ha! ha! so you have been making a feast for your nephew; very good,
very good, very good indeed!" he said, without stuttering. "When the
cat's away, the mice will play."

"Feast!" thought Charles, incapable of suspecting or imagining the
rules and customs of the household.

"Give me my glass, Nanon," said the master

Eugenie brought the glass. Grandet drew a horn-handled knife with a
big blade from his breeches' pocket, cut a slice of bread, took a
small bit of butter, spread it carefully on the bread, and ate it
standing. At this moment Charlie was sweetening his coffee. Pere
Grandet saw the bits of sugar, looked at his wife, who turned pale,
and made three steps forward; he leaned down to the poor woman's ear
and said,--

"Where did you get all that sugar?"

"Nanon fetched it from Fessard's; there was none."

It is impossible to picture the profound interest the three women took
in this mute scene. Nanon had left her kitchen and stood looking into
the room to see what would happen. Charles, having tasted his coffee,
found it bitter and glanced about for the sugar, which Grandet had
already put away.

"What do you want?" said his uncle.

"The sugar."

"Put in more milk," answered the master of the house; "your coffee
will taste sweeter."

Eugenie took the saucer which Grandet had put away and placed it on
the table, looking calmly at her father as she did so. Most assuredly,
the Parisian woman who held a silken ladder with her feeble arms to
facilitate the flight of her lover, showed no greater courage than
Eugenie displayed when she replaced the sugar upon the table. The
lover rewarded his mistress when she proudly showed him her beautiful
bruised arm, and bathed every swollen vein with tears and kisses till
it was cured with happiness. Charles, on the other hand, never so much
as knew the secret of the cruel agitation that shook and bruised the
heart of his cousin, crushed as it was by the look of the old miser.

"You are not eating your breakfast, wife."

The poor helot came forward with a piteous look, cut herself a piece
of bread, and took a pear. Eugenie boldly offered her father some
grapes, saying,--

"Taste my preserves, papa. My cousin, you will eat some, will you not?
I went to get these pretty grapes expressly for you."

"If no one stops them, they will pillage Saumur for you, nephew. When
you have finished, we will go into the garden; I have something to
tell you which can't be sweetened."

Eugenie and her mother cast a look on Charles whose meaning the young
man could not mistake.

"What is it you mean, uncle? Since the death of my poor mother"--at
these words his voice softened--"no other sorrow can touch me."

"My nephew, who knows by what afflictions God is pleased to try us?"
said his aunt.

"Ta, ta, ta, ta," said Grandet, "there's your nonsense beginning. I am
sorry to see those white hands of yours, nephew"; and he showed the
shoulder-of-mutton fists which Nature had put at the end of his own
arms. "There's a pair of hands made to pick up silver pieces. You've
been brought up to put your feet in the kid out of which we make the
purses we keep our money in. A bad look-out! Very bad!"

"What do you mean, uncle? I'll be hanged if I understand a single word
of what you are saying."

"Come!" said Grandet.

The miser closed the blade of his knife with a snap, drank the last of
his wine, and opened the door.

"My cousin, take courage!"

The tone of the young girl struck terror to Charles's heart, and he
followed his terrible uncle, a prey to disquieting thoughts. Eugenie,
her mother, and Nanon went into the kitchen, moved by irresistible
curiosity to watch the two actors in the scene which was about to take
place in the garden, where at first the uncle walked silently ahead of
the nephew. Grandet was not at all troubled at having to tell Charles
of the death of his father; but he did feel a sort of compassion in
knowing him to be without a penny, and he sought for some phrase or
formula by which to soften the communication of that cruel truth. "You
have lost your father," seemed to him a mere nothing to say; fathers
die before their children. But "you are absolutely without means,"--
all the misfortunes of life were summed up in those words! Grandet
walked round the garden three times, the gravel crunching under his
heavy step.

In the crucial moments of life our minds fasten upon the locality
where joys or sorrows overwhelm us. Charles noticed with minute
attention the box-borders of the little garden, the yellow leaves as
they fluttered down, the dilapidated walls, the gnarled fruit-trees,--
picturesque details which were destined to remain forever in his
memory, blending eternally, by the mnemonics that belong exclusively
to the passions, with the recollections of this solemn hour.

"It is very fine weather, very warm," said Grandet, drawing a long
breath.

"Yes, uncle; but why--"

"Well, my lad," answered his uncle, "I have some bad news to give you.
Your father is ill--"

"Then why am I here?" said Charles. "Nanon," he cried, "order post-
horses! I can get a carriage somewhere?" he added, turning to his
uncle, who stood motionless.

"Horses and carriages are useless," answered Grandet, looking at
Charles, who remained silent, his eyes growing fixed. "Yes, my poor
boy, you guess the truth,--he is dead. But that's nothing; there is
something worse: he blew out his brains."

"My father!"

"Yes, but that's not the worst; the newspapers are all talking about
it. Here, read that."

Grandet, who had borrowed the fatal article from Cruchot, thrust the
paper under his nephew's eyes. The poor young man, still a child,
still at an age when feelings wear no mask, burst into tears.

"That's good!" thought Grandet; "his eyes frightened me. He'll be all
right if he weeps,--That is not the worst, my poor nephew," he said
aloud, not noticing whether Charles heard him, "that is nothing; you
will get over it: but--"

"Never, never! My father! Oh, my father!"

"He has ruined you, you haven't a penny."

"What does that matter? My father! Where is my father?"

His sobs resounded horribly against those dreary walls and
reverberated in the echoes. The three women, filled with pity, wept
also; for tears are often as contagious as laughter. Charles, without
listening further to his uncle, ran through the court and up the
staircase to his chamber, where he threw himself across the bed and
hid his face in the sheets, to weep in peace for his lost parents.

"The first burst must have its way," said Grandet, entering the
living-room, where Eugenie and her mother had hastily resumed their
seats and were sewing with trembling hands, after wiping their eyes.
"But that young man is good for nothing; his head is more taken up
with the dead than with his money."

Eugenie shuddered as she heard her father's comment on the most sacred
of all griefs. From that moment she began to judge him. Charles's
sobs, though muffled, still sounded through the sepulchral house; and
his deep groans, which seemed to come from the earth beneath, only
ceased towards evening, after growing gradually feebler.

"Poor young man!" said Madame Grandet.

Fatal exclamation! Pere Grandet looked at his wife, at Eugenie, and at
the sugar-bowl. He recollected the extraordinary breakfast prepared
for the unfortunate youth, and he took a position in the middle of the
room.

"Listen to me," he said, with his usual composure. "I hope that you
will not continue this extravagance, Madame Grandet. I don't give you
MY money to stuff that young fellow with sugar."

"My mother had nothing to do with it," said Eugenie; "it was I who--"

"Is it because you are of age," said Grandet, interrupting his
daughter, "that you choose to contradict me? Remember, Eugenie--"

"Father, the son of your brother ought to receive from us--"

"Ta, ta, ta, ta!" exclaimed the cooper on four chromatic tones; "the
son of my brother this, my nephew that! Charles is nothing at all to
us; he hasn't a farthing, his father has failed; and when this dandy
has cried his fill, off he goes from here. I won't have him
revolutionize my household."

"What is 'failing,' father?" asked Eugenie.

"To fail," answered her father, "is to commit the most dishonorable
action that can disgrace a man."

"It must be a great sin," said Madame Grandet, "and our brother may be
damned."

"There, there, don't begin with your litanies!" said Grandet,
shrugging his shoulders. "To fail, Eugenie," he resumed, "is to commit
a theft which the law, unfortunately, takes under its protection.
People have given their property to Guillaume Grandet trusting to his
reputation for honor and integrity; he has made away with it all, and
left them nothing but their eyes to weep with. A highway robber is
better than a bankrupt: the one attacks you and you can defend
yourself, he risks his own life; but the other--in short, Charles is
dishonored."

The words rang in the poor girl's heart and weighed it down with their
heavy meaning. Upright and delicate as a flower born in the depths of
a forest, she knew nothing of the world's maxims, of its deceitful
arguments and specious sophisms; she therefore believed the atrocious
explanation which her father gave her designedly, concealing the
distinction which exists between an involuntary failure and an
intentional one.

"Father, could you not have prevented such a misfortune?"

"My brother did not consult me. Besides, he owes four millions."

"What is a 'million,' father?" she asked, with the simplicity of a
child which thinks it can find out at once all that it wants to know.

"A million?" said Grandet, "why, it is a million pieces of twenty sous
each, and it takes five twenty sous pieces to make five francs."

"Dear me!" cried Eugenie, "how could my uncle possibly have had four
millions? Is there any one else in France who ever had so many
millions?" Pere Grandet stroked his chin, smiled, and his wen seemed
to dilate. "But what will become of my cousin Charles?"

"He is going off to the West Indies by his father's request, and he
will try to make his fortune there."

"Has he got the money to go with?"

"I shall pay for his journey as far as--yes, as far as Nantes."

Eugenie sprang into his arms.

"Oh, father, how good you are!"

She kissed him with a warmth that almost made Grandet ashamed of
himself, for his conscience galled him a little.

"Will it take much time to amass a million?" she asked.

"Look here!" said the old miser, "you know what a napoleon is? Well,
it takes fifty thousand napoleons to make a million."

"Mamma, we must say a great many /neuvaines/ for him."

"I was thinking so," said Madame Grandet.

"That's the way, always spending my money!" cried the father. "Do you
think there are francs on every bush?"

At this moment a muffled cry, more distressing than all the others,
echoed through the garrets and struck a chill to the hearts of Eugenie
and her mother.

"Nanon, go upstairs and see that he does not kill himself," said
Grandet. "Now, then," he added, looking at his wife and daughter, who
had turned pale at his words, "no nonsense, you two! I must leave you;
I have got to see about the Dutchmen who are going away to-day. And
then I must find Cruchot, and talk with him about all this."

He departed. As soon as he had shut the door Eugenie and her mother
breathed more freely. Until this morning the young girl had never felt
constrained in the presence of her father; but for the last few hours
every moment wrought a change in her feelings and ideas.

"Mamma, how many louis are there in a cask of wine?"

"Your father sells his from a hundred to a hundred and fifty francs,
sometimes two hundred,--at least, so I've heard say."

"Then papa must be rich?"

"Perhaps he is. But Monsieur Cruchot told me he bought Froidfond two
years ago; that may have pinched him."

Eugenie, not being able to understand the question of her father's
fortune, stopped short in her calculations.

"He didn't even see me, the darling!" said Nanon, coming back from her
errand. "He's stretched out like a calf on his bed and crying like the
Madeleine, and that's a blessing! What's the matter with the poor dear
young man!"

"Let us go and console him, mamma; if any one knocks, we can come
down."

Madame Grandet was helpless against the sweet persuasive tones of her
daughter's voice. Eugenie was sublime: she had become a woman. The
two, with beating hearts, went up to Charles's room. The door was
open. The young man heard and saw nothing; plunged in grief, he only
uttered inarticulate cries.

"How he loves his father!" said Eugenie in a low voice.

In the utterance of those words it was impossible to mistake the hopes
of a heart that, unknown to itself, had suddenly become passionate.
Madame Grandet cast a mother's look upon her daughter, and then
whispered in her ear,--

"Take care, you will love him!"

"Love him!" answered Eugenie. "Ah! if you did but know what my father
said to Monsieur Cruchot."

Charles turned over, and saw his aunt and cousin.

"I have lost my father, my poor father! If he had told me his secret
troubles we might have worked together to repair them. My God! my poor
father! I was so sure I should see him again that I think I kissed him
quite coldly--"

Sobs cut short the words.

"We will pray for him," said Madame Grandet. "Resign yourself to the
will of God."

"Cousin," said Eugenie, "take courage! Your loss is irreparable;
therefore think only of saving your honor."

With the delicate instinct of a woman who intuitively puts her mind
into all things, even at the moment when she offers consolation,
Eugenie sought to cheat her cousin's grief by turning his thoughts
inward upon himself.

"My honor?" exclaimed the young man, tossing aside his hair with an
impatient gesture as he sat up on his bed and crossed his arms. "Ah!
that is true. My uncle said my father had failed." He uttered a heart-
rending cry, and hid his face in his hands. "Leave me, leave me,
cousin! My God! my God! forgive my father, for he must have suffered
sorely!"

There was something terribly attractive in the sight of this young
sorrow, sincere without reasoning or afterthought. It was a virgin
grief which the simple hearts of Eugenie and her mother were fitted to
comprehend, and they obeyed the sign Charles made them to leave him to
himself. They went downstairs in silence and took their accustomed
places by the window and sewed for nearly an hour without exchanging a
word. Eugenie had seen in the furtive glance that she cast about the
young man's room--that girlish glance which sees all in the twinkling
of an eye--the pretty trifles of his dressing-case, his scissors, his
razors embossed with gold. This gleam of luxury across her cousin's
grief only made him the more interesting to her, possibly by way of
contrast. Never before had so serious an event, so dramatic a sight,
touched the imaginations of these two passive beings, hitherto sunk in
the stillness and calm of solitude.

"Mamma," said Eugenie, "we must wear mourning for my uncle."

"Your father will decide that," answered Madame Grandet.

They relapsed into silence. Eugenie drew her stitches with a uniform
motion which revealed to an observer the teeming thoughts of her
meditation. The first desire of the girl's heart was to share her
cousin's mourning.



VI

About four o'clock an abrupt knock at the door struck sharply on the
heart of Madame Grandet.

"What can have happened to your father?" she said to her daughter.

Grandet entered joyously. After taking off his gloves, he rubbed his
hands hard enough to take off their skin as well, if his epidermis had
not been tanned and cured like Russia leather,--saving, of course, the
perfume of larch-trees and incense. Presently his secret escaped him.

"Wife," he said, without stuttering, "I've trapped them all! Our wine
is sold! The Dutch and the Belgians have gone. I walked about the
market-place in front of their inn, pretending to be doing nothing.
That Belgian fellow--you know who I mean--came up to me. The owners of
all the good vineyards have kept back their vintages, intending to
wait; well, I didn't hinder them. The Belgian was in despair; I saw
that. In a minute the bargain was made. He takes my vintage at two
hundred francs the puncheon, half down. He paid me in gold; the notes
are drawn. Here are six louis for you. In three months wines will have
fallen."

These words, uttered in a quiet tone of voice, were nevertheless so
bitterly sarcastic that the inhabitants of Saumur, grouped at this
moment in the market-place and overwhelmed by the news of the sale
Grandet had just effected, would have shuddered had they heard them.
Their panic would have brought the price of wines down fifty per cent
at once.

"Did you have a thousand puncheons this year, father?"

"Yes, little one."

That term applied to his daughter was the superlative expression of
the old miser's joy.

"Then that makes two hundred thousand pieces of twenty sous each?"

"Yes, Mademoiselle Grandet."

"Then, father, you can easily help Charles."

The amazement, the anger, the stupefaction of Belshazzar when he saw
the /Mene-Tekel-Upharsin/ before his eyes is not to be compared with
the cold rage of Grandet, who, having forgotten his nephew, now found
him enshrined in the heart and calculations of his daughter.

"What's this? Ever since that dandy put foot in MY house everything
goes wrong! You behave as if you had the right to buy sugar-plums and
make feasts and weddings. I won't have that sort of thing. I hope I
know my duty at my time of life! I certainly sha'n't take lessons from
my daughter, or from anybody else. I shall do for my nephew what it is
proper to do, and you have no need to poke your nose into it. As for
you, Eugenie," he added, facing her, "don't speak of this again, or
I'll send you to the Abbaye des Noyers with Nanon, see if I don't; and
no later than to-morrow either, if you disobey me! Where is that
fellow, has he come down yet?"

"No, my friend," answered Madame Grandet.

"What is he doing then?"

"He is weeping for his father," said Eugenie.

Grandet looked at his daughter without finding a word to say; after
all, he was a father. He made a couple of turns up and down the room,
and then went hurriedly to his secret den to think over an investment
he was meditating in the public Funds. The thinning out of his two
thousand acres of forest land had yielded him six hundred thousand
francs: putting this sum to that derived from the sale of his poplars
and to his other gains for the last year and for the current year, he
had amassed a total of nine hundred thousand francs, without counting
the two hundred thousand he had got by the sale just concluded. The
twenty per cent which Cruchot assured him would gain in a short time
from the Funds, then quoted at seventy, tempted him. He figured out
his calculation on the margin of the newspaper which gave the account
of his brother's death, all the while hearing the moans of his nephew,
but without listening to them. Nanon came and knocked on the wall to
summon him to dinner. On the last step of the staircase he was saying
to himself as he came down,--

"I'll do it; I shall get eight per cent interest. In two years I shall
have fifteen hundred thousand francs, which I will then draw out in
good gold,--Well, where's my nephew?"

"He says he doesn't want anything to eat," answered Nanon; "that's not
good for him."

"So much saved," retorted her master.

"That's so," she said.

"Bah! he won't cry long. Hunger drives the wolves out of the woods."

The dinner was eaten in silence.

"My good friend," said Madame Grandet, when the cloth was removed, "we
must put on mourning."

"Upon my word, Madame Grandet! what will you invent next to spend
money on? Mourning is in the heart, and not in the clothes."

"But mourning for a brother is indispensable; and the Church commands
us to--"

"Buy your mourning out of your six louis. Give me a hat-band; that's
enough for me."

Eugenie raised her eyes to heaven without uttering a word. Her
generous instincts, slumbering and long repressed but now suddenly and
for the first time awakened, were galled at every turn. The evening
passed to all appearance like a thousand other evenings of their
monotonous life, yet it was certainly the most horrible. Eugenie sewed
without raising her head, and did not use the workbox which Charles
had despised the night before. Madame Grandet knitted her sleeves.
Grandet twirled his thumbs for four hours, absorbed in calculations
whose results were on the morrow to astonish Saumur. No one came to
visit the family that day. The whole town was ringing with the news of
the business trick just played by Grandet, the failure of his brother,
and the arrival of his nephew. Obeying the desire to gossip over their
mutual interests, all the upper and middle-class wine-growers in
Saumur met at Monsieur des Grassins, where terrible imprecations were
being fulminated against the ex-mayor. Nanon was spinning, and the
whirr of her wheel was the only sound heard beneath the gray rafters
of that silent hall.

"We don't waste our tongues," she said, showing her teeth, as large
and white as peeled almonds.

"Nothing should be wasted," answered Grandet, rousing himself from his
reverie. He saw a perspective of eight millions in three years, and he
was sailing along that sheet of gold. "Let us go to bed. I will bid my
nephew good-night for the rest of you, and see if he will take
anything."

Madame Grandet remained on the landing of the first storey to hear the
conversation that was about to take place between the goodman and his
nephew. Eugenie, bolder than her mother, went up two stairs.

"Well, nephew, you are in trouble. Yes, weep, that's natural. A father
is a father; but we must bear our troubles patiently. I am a good
uncle to you, remember that. Come, take courage! Will you have a
little glass of wine?" (Wine costs nothing in Saumur, and they offer
it as tea is offered in China.) "Why!" added Grandet, "you have got no
light! That's bad, very bad; you ought to see what you are about," and
he walked to the chimney-piece. "What's this?" he cried. "A wax
candle! How the devil did they filch a wax candle? The spendthrifts
would tear down the ceilings of my house to boil the fellow's eggs."

Hearing these words, mother and daughter slipped back into their rooms
and burrowed in their beds, with the celerity of frightened mice
getting back to their holes.

"Madame Grandet, have you found a mine?" said the man, coming into the
chamber of his wife.

"My friend, wait; I am saying my prayers," said the poor mother in a
trembling voice.

"The devil take your good God!" growled Grandet in reply.

Misers have no belief in a future life; the present is their all in
all. This thought casts a terrible light upon our present epoch, in
which, far more than at any former period, money sways the laws and
politics and morals.  Institutions, books, men, and dogmas, all
conspire to undermine belief in a future life,--a belief upon which
the social edifice has rested for eighteen hundred years. The grave,
as a means of transition, is little feared in our day. The future,
which once opened to us beyond the requiems, has now been imported
into the present. To obtain /per fas et nefas/ a terrestrial paradise
of luxury and earthly enjoyment, to harden the heart and macerate the
body for the sake of fleeting possessions, as the martyrs once
suffered all things to reach eternal joys, this is now the universal
thought--a thought written everywhere, even in the very laws which ask
of the legislator, "What do you pay?" instead of asking him, "What do
you think?" When this doctrine has passed down from the bourgeoisie to
the populace, where will this country be?

"Madame Grandet, have you done?" asked the old man.

"My friend, I am praying for you."

"Very good! Good-night; to-morrow morning we will have a talk."

The poor woman went to sleep like a schoolboy who, not having learned
his lessons, knows he will see his master's angry face on the morrow.
At the moment when, filled with fear, she was drawing the sheet above
her head that she might stifle hearing, Eugenie, in her night-gown and
with naked feet, ran to her side and kissed her brow.

"Oh! my good mother," she said, "to-morrow I will tell him it was I."

"No; he would send you to Noyers. Leave me to manage it; he cannot eat
me."

"Do you hear, mamma?"

"What?"

"/He/ is weeping still."

"Go to bed, my daughter; you will take cold in your feet: the floor is
damp."

*****

Thus passed the solemn day which was destined to weight upon the whole
life of the rich and poor heiress, whose sleep was never again to be
so calm, nor yet so pure, as it had been up to this moment. It often
happens that certain actions of human life seem, literally speaking,
improbable, though actual. Is not this because we constantly omit to
turn the stream of psychological light upon our impulsive
determinations, and fail to explain the subtile reasons, mysteriously
conceived in our minds, which impelled them? Perhaps Eugenie's deep
passion should be analyzed in its most delicate fibres; for it became,
scoffers might say, a malady which influenced her whole existence.
Many people prefer to deny results rather than estimate the force of
ties and links and bonds, which secretly join one fact to another in
the moral order. Here, therefore, Eugenie's past life will offer to
observers of human nature an explanation of her naive want of
reflection and the suddenness of the emotions which overflowed her
soul. The more tranquil her life had been, the more vivid was her
womanly pity, the more simple-minded were the sentiments now developed
in her soul.

Made restless by the events of the day, she woke at intervals to
listen to her cousin, thinking she heard the sighs which still echoed
in her heart. Sometimes she saw him dying of his trouble, sometimes
she dreamed that he fainted from hunger. Towards morning she was
certain that she heard a startling cry. She dressed at once and ran,
in the dawning light, with a swift foot to her cousin's chamber, the
door of which he had left open. The candle had burned down to the
socket. Charles, overcome by nature, was sleeping, dressed and sitting
in an armchair beside the bed, on which his head rested; he dreamed as
men dream on an empty stomach. Eugenie might weep at her ease; she
might admire the young and handsome face blotted with grief, the eyes
swollen with weeping, that seemed, sleeping as they were, to well
forth tears. Charles felt sympathetically the young girl's presence;
he opened his eyes and saw her pitying him.

"Pardon me, my cousin," he said, evidently not knowing the hour nor
the place in which he found himself.

"There are hearts who hear you, cousin, and /we/ thought you might
need something. You should go to bed; you tire yourself by sitting
thus."

"That is true."

"Well, then, adieu!"

She escaped, ashamed and happy at having gone there. Innocence alone
can dare to be so bold. Once enlightened, virtue makes her
calculations as well as vice. Eugenie, who had not trembled beside her
cousin, could scarcely stand upon her legs when she regained her
chamber. Her ignorant life had suddenly come to an end; she reasoned,
she rebuked herself with many reproaches.

"What will he think of me? He will think that I love him!"

That was what she most wished him to think. An honest love has its own
prescience, and knows that love begets love. What an event for this
poor solitary girl thus to have entered the chamber of a young man!
Are there not thoughts and actions in the life of love which to
certain souls bear the full meaning of the holiest espousals? An hour
later she went to her mother and dressed her as usual. Then they both
came down and sat in their places before the window waiting for
Grandet, with that cruel anxiety which, according to the individual
character, freezes the heart or warms it, shrivels or dilates it, when
a scene is feared, a punishment expected,--a feeling so natural that
even domestic animals possess it, and whine at the slightest pain of
punishment, though they make no outcry when they inadvertently hurt
themselves. The goodman came down; but he spoke to his wife with an
absent manner, kissed Eugenie, and sat down to table without appearing
to remember his threats of the night before.

"What has become of my nephew? The lad gives no trouble."

"Monsieur, he is asleep," answered Nanon.

"So much the better; he won't want a wax candle," said Grandet in a
jeering tone.

This unusual clemency, this bitter gaiety, struck Madame Grandet with
amazement, and she looked at her husband attentively. The goodman--
here it may be well to explain that in Touraine, Anjou, Pitou, and
Bretagne the word "goodman," already used to designate Grandet, is
bestowed as often upon harsh and cruel men as upon those of kindly
temperament, when either have reached a certain age; the title means
nothing on the score of individual gentleness--the goodman took his
hat and gloves, saying as he went out,--

"I am going to loiter about the market-place and find Cruchot."

"Eugenie, your father certainly has something on his mind."

Grandet, who was a poor sleeper, employed half his nights in the
preliminary calculations which gave such astonishing accuracy to his
views and observations and schemes, and secured to them the unfailing
success at sight of which his townsmen stood amazed. All human power
is a compound of time and patience. Powerful beings will and wait. The
life of a miser is the constant exercise of human power put to the
service of self. It rests on two sentiments only,--self-love and self-
interest; but self-interest being to a certain extent compact and
intelligent self-love, the visible sign of real superiority, it
follows that self-love and self-interest are two parts of the same
whole,--egotism. From this arises, perhaps, the excessive curiosity
shown in the habits of a miser's life whenever they are put before the
world. Every nature holds by a thread to those beings who challenge
all human sentiments by concentrating all in one passion. Where is the
man without desire? and what social desire can be satisfied without
money?

Grandet unquestionably "had something on his mind," to use his wife's
expression. There was in him, as in all misers, a persistent craving
to play a commercial game with other men and win their money legally.
To impose upon other people was to him a sign of power, a perpetual
proof that he had won the right to despise those feeble beings who
suffer themselves to be preyed upon in this world. Oh! who has ever
truly understood the lamb lying peacefully at the feet of God?--
touching emblem of all terrestrial victims, myth of their future,
suffering and weakness glorified! This lamb it is which the miser
fattens, puts in his fold, slaughters, cooks, eats, and then despises.
The pasture of misers is compounded of money and disdain. During the
night Grandet's ideas had taken another course, which was the reason
of his sudden clemency. He had hatched a plot by which to trick the
Parisians, to decoy and dupe and snare them, to drive them into a
trap, and make them go and come and sweat and hope and turn pale,--a
plot by which to amuse himself, the old provincial cooper, sitting
there beneath his gloomy rafters, or passing up and down the rotten
staircase of his house in Saumur. His nephew filled his mind. He
wished to save the honor of his dead brother without the cost of a
penny to the son or to himself. His own funds he was about to invest
for three years; he had therefore nothing further to do than to manage
his property in Saumur. He needed some nutriment for his malicious
activity, and he found it suddenly in his brother's failure. Feeling
nothing to squeeze between his own paws, he resolved to crush the
Parisians in behalf of Charles, and to play the part of a good brother
on the cheapest terms. The honor of the family counted for so little
in this scheme that his good intentions might be likened to the
interest a gambler takes in seeing a game well played in which he has
no stake. The Cruchots were a necessary part of his plan; but he would
not seek them,--he resolved to make them come to him, and to lead up
that very evening to a comedy whose plot he had just conceived, which
should make him on the morrow an object of admiration to the whole
town without its costing him a single penny.

In her father's absence Eugenie had the happiness of busying herself
openly with her much-loved cousin, of spending upon him fearlessly the
treasures of her pity,--woman's sublime superiority, the sole she
desires to have recognized, the sole she pardons man for letting her
assume. Three or four times the young girl went to listen to her
cousin's breathing, to know if he were sleeping or awake; then, when
he had risen, she turned her thoughts to the cream, the eggs, the
fruits, the plates, the glasses,--all that was a part of his breakfast
became the object of some special care. At length she ran lightly up
the old staircase to listen to the noise her cousin made. Was he
dressing? Did he still weep? She reached the door.

"My cousin!"

"Yes, cousin."

"Will you breakfast downstairs, or in your room?"

"Where you like."

"How do you feel?"

"Dear cousin, I am ashamed of being hungry."

This conversation, held through the closed door, was like an episode
in a poem to Eugenie.

"Well, then, we will bring your breakfast to your own room, so as not
to annoy my father."

She ran to the kitchen with the swiftness and lightness of a bird.

"Nanon, go and do his room!"

That staircase, so often traversed, which echoed to the slightest
noise, now lost its decaying aspect in the eyes of Eugenie. It grew
luminous; it had a voice and spoke to her; it was young like herself,
--young like the love it was now serving. Her mother, her kind,
indulgent mother, lent herself to the caprices of the child's love,
and after the room was put in order, both went to sit with the unhappy
youth and keep him company. Does not Christian charity make
consolation a duty? The two women drew a goodly number of little
sophistries from their religion wherewith to justify their conduct.
Charles was made the object of the tenderest and most loving care. His
saddened heart felt the sweetness of the gentle friendship, the
exquisite sympathy which these two souls, crushed under perpetual
restraint, knew so well how to display when, for an instant, they were
left unfettered in the regions of suffering, their natural sphere.

Claiming the right of relationship, Eugenie began to fold the linen
and put in order the toilet articles which Charles had brought; thus
she could marvel at her ease over each luxurious bauble and the
various knick-knacks of silver or chased gold, which she held long in
her hand under a pretext of examining them. Charles could not see
without emotion the generous interest his aunt and cousin felt in him;
he knew society in Paris well enough to feel assured that, placed as
he now was, he would find all hearts indifferent or cold. Eugenie thus
appeared to him in the splendor of a special beauty, and from
thenceforth he admired the innocence of life and manners which the
previous evening he had been inclined to ridicule. So when Eugenie
took from Nanon the bowl of coffee and cream, and began to pour it out
for her cousin with the simplicity of real feeling, giving him a
kindly glance, the eyes of the Parisian filled with tears; he took her
hand and kissed it.

"What troubles you?" she said.

"Oh! these are tears of gratitude," he answered.

Eugenie turned abruptly to the chimney-piece to take the candlesticks.

"Here, Nanon, carry them away!" she said.

When she looked again towards her cousin she was still blushing, but
her looks could at least deceive, and did not betray the excess of joy
which innundated her heart; yet the eyes of both expressed the same
sentiment as their souls flowed together in one thought,--the future
was theirs. This soft emotion was all the more precious to Charles in
the midst of his heavy grief because it was wholly unexpected. The
sound of the knocker recalled the women to their usual station.
Happily they were able to run downstairs with sufficient rapidity to
be seated at their work when Grandet entered; had he met them under
the archway it would have been enough to rouse his suspicions. After
breakfast, which the goodman took standing, the keeper from Froidfond,
to whom the promised indemnity had never yet been paid, made his
appearance, bearing a hare and some partridges shot in the park, with
eels and two pike sent as tribute by the millers.

"Ha, ha! poor Cornoiller; here he comes, like fish in Lent. Is all
that fit to eat?"

"Yes, my dear, generous master; it has been killed two days."

"Come, Nanon, bestir yourself," said Grandet; "take these things,
they'll do for dinner. I have invited the two Cruchots."

Nanon opened her eyes, stupid with amazement, and looked at everybody
in the room.

"Well!" she said, "and how am I to get the lard and the spices?"

"Wife," said Grandet, "give Nanon six francs, and remind me to get
some of the good wine out of the cellar."

"Well, then, Monsieur Grandet," said the keeper, who had come prepared
with an harangue for the purpose of settling the question of the
indemnity, "Monsieur Grandet--"

"Ta, ta, ta, ta!" said Grandet; "I know what you want to say. You are
a good fellow; we will see about it to-morrow, I'm too busy to-day.
Wife, give him five francs," he added to Madame Grandet as he
decamped.

The poor woman was only too happy to buy peace at the cost of eleven
francs. She knew that Grandet would let her alone for a fortnight
after he had thus taken back, franc by franc, the money he had given
her.

"Here, Cornoiller," she said, slipping ten francs into the man's hand,
"some day we will reward your services."

Cornoiller could say nothing, so he went away.

"Madame," said Nanon, who had put on her black coif and taken her
basket, "I want only three francs. You keep the rest; it'll go fast
enough somehow."

"Have a good dinner, Nanon; my cousin will come down," said Eugenie.

"Something very extraordinary is going on, I am certain of it," said
Madame Grandet. "This is only the third time since our marriage that
your father has given a dinner."

*****

About four o'clock, just as Eugenie and her mother had finished
setting the table for six persons, and after the master of the house
had brought up a few bottles of the exquisite wine which provincials
cherish with true affection, Charles came down into the hall. The
young fellow was pale; his gestures, the expression of his face, his
glance, and the tones of his voice, all had a sadness which was full
of grace. He was not pretending grief, he truly suffered; and the veil
of pain cast over his features gave him an interesting air dear to the
heart of women. Eugenie loved him the more for it. Perhaps she felt
that sorrow drew him nearer to her. Charles was no longer the rich and
distinguished young man placed in a sphere far above her, but a
relation plunged into frightful misery. Misery begets equality. Women
have this in common with the angels,--suffering humanity belongs to
them. Charles and Eugenie understood each other and spoke only with
their eyes; for the poor fallen dandy, orphaned and impoverished, sat
apart in a corner of the room, and was proudly calm and silent. Yet,
from time to time, the gentle and caressing glance of the young girl
shone upon him and constrained him away from his sad thoughts, drawing
him with her into the fields of hope and of futurity, where she loved
to hold him at her side.



VII

At this moment the town of Saumur was more excited about the dinner
given by Grandet to the Cruchots than it had been the night before at
the sale of his vintage, though that constituted a crime of high-
treason against the whole wine-growing community. If the politic old
miser had given his dinner from the same idea that cost the dog of
Alcibiades his tail, he might perhaps have been called a great man;
but the fact is, considering himself superior to a community which he
could trick on all occasions, he paid very little heed to what Saumur
might say.

The des Grassins soon learned the facts of the failure and the violent
death of Guillaume Grandet, and they determined to go to their
client's house that very evening to commiserate his misfortune and
show him some marks of friendship, with a view of ascertaining the
motives which had led him to invite the Cruchots to dinner. At
precisely five o'clock Monsieur C. de Bonfons and his uncle the notary
arrived in their Sunday clothes. The party sat down to table and began
to dine with good appetites. Grandet was grave, Charles silent,
Eugenie dumb, and Madame Grandet did not say more than usual; so that
the dinner was, very properly, a repast of condolence. When they rose
from table Charles said to his aunt and uncle,--

"Will you permit me to retire? I am obliged to undertake a long and
painful correspondence."

"Certainly, nephew."

As soon as the goodman was certain that Charles could hear nothing and
was probably deep in his letter-writing, he said, with a dissimulating
glance at his wife,--

"Madame Grandet, what we have to talk about will be Latin to you; it
is half-past seven; you can go and attend to your household accounts.
Good-night, my daughter."

He kissed Eugenie, and the two women departed. A scene now took place
in which Pere Grandet brought to bear, more than at any other moment
of his life, the shrewd dexterity he had acquired in his intercourse
with men, and which had won him from those whose flesh he sometimes
bit too sharply the nickname of "the old dog." If the mayor of Saumur
had carried his ambition higher still, if fortunate circumstances,
drawing him towards the higher social spheres, had sent him into
congresses where the affairs of nations were discussed, and had he
there employed the genius with which his personal interests had
endowed him, he would undoubtedly have proved nobly useful to his
native land. Yet it is perhaps equally certain that outside of Saumur
the goodman would have cut a very sorry figure. Possibly there are
minds like certain animals which cease to breed when transplanted from
the climates in which they are born.

"M-m-mon-sieur le p-p-president, you said t-t-that b-b-bankruptcy--"

The stutter which for years the old miser had assumed when it suited
him, and which, together with the deafness of which he sometimes
complained in rainy weather, was thought in Saumur to be a natural
defect, became at this crisis so wearisome to the two Cruchots that
while they listened they unconsciously made faces and moved their
lips, as if pronouncing the words over which he was hesitating and
stuttering at will. Here it may be well to give the history of this
impediment of the speech and hearing of Monsieur Grandet. No one in
Anjou heard better, or could pronounce more crisply the French
language (with an Angevin accent) than the wily old cooper. Some years
earlier, in spite of his shrewdness, he had been taken in by an
Israelite, who in the course of the discussion held his hand behind
his ear to catch sounds, and mangled his meaning so thoroughly in
trying to utter his words that Grandet fell a victim to his humanity
and was compelled to prompt the wily Jew with the words and ideas he
seemed to seek, to complete himself the arguments of the said Jew, to
say what that cursed Jew ought to have said for himself; in short, to
be the Jew instead of being Grandet. When the cooper came out of this
curious encounter he had concluded the only bargain of which in the
course of a long commercial life he ever had occasion to complain. But
if he lost at the time pecuniarily, he gained morally a valuable
lesson; later, he gathered its fruits. Indeed, the goodman ended by
blessing that Jew for having taught him the art of irritating his
commercial antagonist and leading him to forget his own thoughts in
his impatience to suggest those over which his tormentor was
stuttering. No affair had ever needed the assistance of deafness,
impediments of speech, and all the incomprehensible circumlocutions
with which Grandet enveloped his ideas, as much as the affair now in
hand. In the first place, he did not mean to shoulder the
responsibility of his own scheme; in the next, he was determined to
remain master of the conversation and to leave his real intentions in
doubt.

"M-m-monsieur de B-B-Bonfons,"--for the second time in three years
Grandet called the Cruchot nephew Monsieur de Bonfons; the president
felt he might consider himself the artful old fellow's son-in-law,--
"you-ou said th-th-that b-b-bankruptcy c-c-could, in some c-c-cases,
b-b-be p-p-prevented b-b-by--"

"By the courts of commerce themselves. It is done constantly," said
Monsieur C. de Bonfons, bestriding Grandet's meaning, or thinking he
guessed it, and kindly wishing to help him out with it. "Listen."

"Y-yes," said Grandet humbly, with the mischievous expression of a boy
who is inwardly laughing at his teacher while he pays him the greatest
attention.

"When a man so respected and important as, for example, your late
brother--"

"M-my b-b-brother, yes."

"--is threatened with insolvency--"

"They c-c-call it in-ins-s-solvency?"

"Yes; when his failure is imminent, the court of commerce, to which he
is amenable (please follow me attentively), has the power, by a
decree, to appoint a receiver. Liquidation, you understand, is not the
same as failure. When a man fails, he is dishonored; but when he
merely liquidates, he remains an honest man."

"T-t-that's very d-d-different, if it d-d-doesn't c-c-cost m-m-more,"
said Grandet.

"But a liquidation can be managed without having recourse to the
courts at all. For," said the president, sniffing a pinch of snuff,
"don't you know how failures are declared?"

"N-n-no, I n-n-never t-t-thought," answered Grandet.

"In the first place," resumed the magistrate, "by filing the schedule
in the record office of the court, which the merchant may do himself,
or his representative for him with a power of attorney duly certified.
In the second place, the failure may be declared under compulsion from
the creditors. Now if the merchant does not file his schedule, and if
no creditor appears before the courts to obtain a decree of insolvency
against the merchant, what happens?"

"W-w-what h-h-happens?"

"Why, the family of the deceased, his representatives, his heirs, or
the merchant himself, if he is not dead, or his friends if he is only
hiding, liquidate his business. Perhaps you would like to liquidate
your brother's affairs?"

"Ah! Grandet," said the notary, "that would be the right thing to do.
There is honor down here in the provinces. If you save your name--for
it is your name--you will be a man--"

"A noble man!" cried the president, interrupting his uncle.

"Certainly," answered the old man, "my b-b-brother's name was
G-G-Grandet, like m-m-mine. Th-that's c-c-certain; I d-d-don't
d-d-deny it. And th-th-this l-l-liquidation might be, in m-m-many
ways, v-v-very advan-t-t-tageous t-t-to the interests of m-m-my
n-n-nephew, whom I l-l-love. But I must consider. I don't k-k-know the
t-t-tricks of P-P-Paris. I b-b-belong to Sau-m-mur, d-d-don't you see?
M-m-my vines, my d-d-drains--in short, I've my own b-b-business. I
never g-g-give n-n-notes. What are n-n-notes? I t-t-take a good
m-m-many, but I have never s-s-signed one. I d-d-don't understand such
things. I have h-h-heard say that n-n-notes c-c-can be b-b-bought up."

"Of course," said the president. "Notes can be bought in the market,
less so much per cent. Don't you understand?"

Grandet made an ear-trumpet of his hand, and the president repeated
his words.

"Well, then," replied the man, "there's s-s-something to be g-g-got
out of it? I k-know n-nothing at my age about such th-th-things. I
l-l-live here and l-l-look after the v-v-vines. The vines g-g-grow,
and it's the w-w-wine that p-p-pays. L-l-look after the v-v-vintage,
t-t-that's my r-r-rule. My c-c-chief interests are at Froidfond. I
c-c-can't l-l-leave my h-h-house to m-m-muddle myself with a
d-d-devilish b-b-business I kn-know n-n-nothing about. You say I ought
to l-l-liquidate my b-b-brother's af-f-fairs, to p-p-prevent the
f-f-failure. I c-c-can't be in two p-p-places at once, unless I were a
little b-b-bird, and--"

"I understand," cried the notary. "Well, my old friend, you have
friends, old friends, capable of devoting themselves to your
interests."

"All right!" thought Grandet, "make haste and come to the point!"

"Suppose one of them went to Paris and saw your brother Guillaume's
chief creditor and said to him--"

"One m-m-moment," interrupted the goodman, "said wh-wh-what? Something
l-l-like this. Monsieur Gr-Grandet of Saumur this, Monsieur Grandet of
Saumur that. He l-loves his b-b-brother, he loves his n-nephew.
Grandet is a g-g-good uncle; he m-m-means well. He has sold his
v-v-vintage. D-d-don't declare a f-f-failure; c-c-call a meeting;
l-l-liquidate; and then Gr-Gr-Grandet will see what he c-c-can do.
B-b-better liquidate than l-let the l-l-law st-st-stick its n-n-nose
in. Hein? isn't it so?"

"Exactly so," said the president.

"B-because, don't you see, Monsieur de B-Bonfons, a man must l-l-look
b-b-before he l-leaps. If you c-c-can't, you c-c-can't. M-m-must know
all about the m-m-matter, all the resources and the debts, if you
d-d-don't want to be r-r-ruined. Hein? isn't it so?"

"Certainly," said the president. "I'm of opinion that in a few months
the debts might be bought up for a certain sum, and then paid in full
by an agreement. Ha! ha! you can coax a dog a long way if you show him
a bit of lard. If there has been no declaration of failure, and you
hold a lien on the debts, you come out of the business as white as the
driven snow."

"Sn-n-now," said Grandet, putting his hand to his ear, "wh-wh-what
about s-now?"

"But," cried the president, "do pray attend to what I am saying."

"I am at-t-tending."

"A note is merchandise,--an article of barter which rises and falls in
prices. That is a deduction from Jeremy Bentham's theory about usury.
That writer has proved that the prejudice which condemned usurers to
reprobation was mere folly."

"Whew!" ejaculated the goodman.

"Allowing that money, according to Bentham, is an article of
merchandise, and that whatever represents money is equally
merchandise," resumed the president; "allowing also that it is
notorious that the commercial note, bearing this or that signature, is
liable to the fluctuation of all commercial values, rises or falls in
the market, is dear at one moment, and is worth nothing at another,
the courts decide--ah! how stupid I am, I beg your pardon--I am
inclined to think you could buy up your brother's debts for twenty-
five per cent."

"D-d-did you c-c-call him Je-Je-Jeremy B-Ben?"

"Bentham, an Englishman.'

"That's a Jeremy who might save us a lot of lamentations in business,"
said the notary, laughing.

"Those Englishmen s-sometimes t-t-talk sense," said Grandet. "So,
ac-c-cording to Ben-Bentham, if my b-b-brother's n-notes are worth
n-n-nothing; if Je-Je--I'm c-c-correct, am I not? That seems c-c-clear
to my m-m-mind--the c-c-creditors would be--No, would not be; I
understand."

"Let me explain it all," said the president. "Legally, if you acquire
a title to all the debts of the Maison Grandet, your brother or his
heirs will owe nothing to any one. Very good."

"Very g-good," repeated Grandet.

"In equity, if your brother's notes are negotiated--negotiated, do you
clearly understand the term?--negotiated in the market at a reduction
of so much per cent in value, and if one of your friends happening to
be present should buy them in, the creditors having sold them of their
own free-will without constraint, the estate of the late Grandet is
honorably released."

"That's t-true; b-b-business is b-business," said the cooper.
"B-b-but, st-still, you know, it is d-d-difficult. I h-have n-no
m-m-money and n-no t-t-time."

"Yes, but you need not undertake it. I am quite ready to go to Paris
(you may pay my expenses, they will only be a trifle). I will see the
creditors and talk with them and get an extension of time, and
everything can be arranged if you will add something to the assets so
as to buy up all title to the debts."

"We-we'll see about th-that. I c-c-can't and I w-w-won't bind myself
without--He who c-c-can't, can't; don't you see?"

"That's very true."

"I'm all p-p-put ab-b-bout by what you've t-t-told me. This is the
f-first t-t-time in my life I have b-been obliged to th-th-think--"

"Yes, you are not a lawyer."

"I'm only a p-p-poor wine-g-grower, and know n-nothing about wh-what
you have just t-told me; I m-m-must th-think about it."

"Very good," said the president, preparing to resume his argument.

"Nephew!" said the notary, interrupting him in a warning tone.

"Well, what, uncle?" answered the president.

"Let Monsieur Grandet explain his own intentions. The matter in
question is of the first importance. Our good friend ought to define
his meaning clearly, and--"

A loud knock, which announced the arrival of the des Grassins family,
succeeded by their entrance and salutations, hindered Cruchot from
concluding his sentence. The notary was glad of the interruption, for
Grandet was beginning to look suspiciously at him, and the wen gave
signs of a brewing storm. In the first place, the notary did not think
it becoming in a president of the Civil courts to go to Paris and
manipulate creditors and lend himself to an underhand job which
clashed with the laws of strict integrity; moreover, never having
known old Grandet to express the slightest desire to pay anything, no
matter what, he instinctively feared to see his nephew taking part in
the affair. He therefore profited by the entrance of the des Grassins
to take the nephew by the arm and lead him into the embrasure of the
window,--

"You have said enough, nephew; you've shown enough devotion. Your
desire to win the girl blinds you. The devil! you mustn't go at it
tooth and nail. Let me sail the ship now; you can haul on the braces.
Do you think it right to compromise your dignity as a magistrate in
such a--"

He stopped, for he heard Monsieur des Grassins saying to the old
cooper as they shook hands,--

"Grandet, we have heard of the frightful misfortunes which have just
befallen your family,--the failure of the house of Guillaume Grandet
and the death of your brother. We have come to express our grief at
these sad events."

"There is but one sad event," said the notary, interrupting the
banker,--"the death of Monsieur Grandet, junior; and he would never
have killed himself had he thought in time of applying to his brother
for help. Our old friend, who is honorable to his finger-nails,
intends to liquidate the debts of the Maison Grandet of Paris. To save
him the worry of legal proceedings, my nephew, the president, has just
offered to go to Paris and negotiate with the creditors for a
satisfactory settlement."

These words, corroborated by Grandet's attitude as he stood silently
nursing his chin, astonished the three des Grassins, who had been
leisurely discussing the old man's avarice as they came along, very
nearly accusing him of fratricide.

"Ah! I was sure of it," cried the banker, looking at his wife. "What
did I tell you just now, Madame des Grassins? Grandet is honorable to
the backbone, and would never allow his name to remain under the
slightest cloud! Money without honor is a disease. There is honor in
the provinces! Right, very right, Grandet. I'm an old soldier, and I
can't disguise my thoughts; I speak roughly. Thunder! it is sublime!"

"Th-then s-s-sublime th-things c-c-cost d-dear," answered the goodman,
as the banker warmly wrung his hand.

"But this, my dear Grandet,--if the president will excuse me,--is a
purely commercial matter, and needs a consummate business man. Your
agent must be some one fully acquainted with the markets,--with
disbursements, rebates, interest calculations, and so forth. I am
going to Paris on business of my own, and I can take charge of--"

"We'll see about t-t-trying to m-m-manage it b-b-between us, under the
p-p-peculiar c-c-circumstances, b-b-but without b-b-binding m-m-myself
to anything th-that I c-c-could not do," said Grandet, stuttering;
"because, you see, monsieur le president naturally expects me to pay
the expenses of his journey."

The goodman did not stammer over the last words.

"Eh!" cried Madame des Grassins, "why it is a pleasure to go to Paris.
I would willingly pay to go myself."

She made a sign to her husband, as if to encourage him in cutting the
enemy out of the commission, /coute que coute/; then she glanced
ironically at the two Cruchots, who looked chap-fallen. Grandet seized
the banker by a button and drew him into a corner of the room.

"I have a great deal more confidence in you than in the president," he
said; "besides, I've other fish to fry," he added, wriggling his wen.
"I want to buy a few thousand francs in the Funds while they are at
eighty. They fall, I'm told, at the end of each month. You know all
about these things, don't you?"

"Bless me! then, am I to invest enough to give you a few thousand
francs a year?"

"That's not much to begin with. Hush! I don't want any one to know I
am going to play that game. You can make the investment by the end of
the month. Say nothing to the Cruchots; that'll annoy them. If you are
really going to Paris, we will see if there is anything to be done for
my poor nephew."

"Well, it's all settled. I'll start to-morrow by the mail-post," said
des Grassins aloud, "and I will come and take your last directions at
--what hour will suit you?"

"Five o'clock, just before dinner," said Grandet, rubbing his hands.

The two parties stayed on for a short time. Des Grassins said, after a
pause, striking Grandet on the shoulder,--

"It is a good thing to have a relation like him."

"Yes, yes; without making a show," said Grandet, "I am a g-good
relation. I loved my brother, and I will prove it, unless it
c-c-costs--"

"We must leave you, Grandet," said the banker, interrupting him
fortunately before he got to the end of his sentence. "If I hurry my
departure, I must attend to some matters at once."

"Very good, very good! I myself--in c-consequence of what I t-told you
--I must retire to my own room and 'd-d-deliberate,' as President
Cruchot says."

"Plague take him! I am no longer Monsieur de Bonfons," thought the
magistrate ruefully, his face assuming the expression of a judge bored
by an argument.

The heads of the two factions walked off together. Neither gave any
further thought to the treachery Grandet had been guilty of in the
morning against the whole wine-growing community; each tried to fathom
what the other was thinking about the real intentions of the wily old
man in this new affair, but in vain.

"Will you go with us to Madame Dorsonval's?" said des Grassins to the
notary.

"We will go there later," answered the president. "I have promised to
say good-evening to Mademoiselle de Gribeaucourt, and we will go there
first, if my uncle is willing."

"Farewell for the present!" said Madame des Grassins.

When the Cruchots were a few steps off, Adolphe remarked to his
father,--

"Are not they fuming, hein?"

"Hold your tongue, my son!" said his mother; "they might hear you.
Besides, what you say is not in good taste,--law-school language."

"Well, uncle," cried the president when he saw the des Grassins
disappearing, "I began by being de Bonfons, and I have ended as
nothing but Cruchot."

"I saw that that annoyed you; but the wind has set fair for the des
Grassins. What a fool you are, with all your cleverness! Let them sail
off on Grandet's 'We'll see about it,' and keep yourself quiet, young
man. Eugenie will none the less be your wife."

In a few moments the news of Grandet's magnanimous resolve was
disseminated in three houses at the same moment, and the whole town
began to talk of his fraternal devotion. Every one forgave Grandet for
the sale made in defiance of the good faith pledged to the community;
they admired his sense of honor, and began to laud a generosity of
which they had never thought him capable. It is part of the French
nature to grow enthusiastic, or angry, or fervent about some meteor of
the moment. Can it be that collective beings, nationalities, peoples,
are devoid of memory?

When Pere Grandet had shut the door he called Nanon.

"Don't let the dog loose, and don't go to bed; we have work to do
together. At eleven o'clock Cornoiller will be at the door with the
chariot from Froidfond. Listen for him and prevent his knocking; tell
him to come in softly. Police regulations don't allow nocturnal
racket. Besides, the whole neighborhood need not know that I am
starting on a journey."

So saying, Grandet returned to his private room, where Nanon heard him
moving about, rummaging, and walking to and fro, though with much
precaution, for he evidently did not wish to wake his wife and
daughter, and above all not to rouse the attention of his nephew, whom
he had begun to anathematize when he saw a thread of light under his
door. About the middle of the night Eugenie, intent on her cousin,
fancied she heard a cry like that of a dying person. It must be
Charles, she thought; he was so pale, so full of despair when she had
seen him last,--could he have killed himself? She wrapped herself
quickly in a loose garment,--a sort of pelisse with a hood,--and was
about to leave the room when a bright light coming through the chinks
of her door made her think of fire. But she recovered herself as she
heard Nanon's heavy steps and gruff voice mingling with the snorting
of several horses.

"Can my father be carrying off my cousin?" she said to herself,
opening her door with great precaution lest it should creak, and yet
enough to let her see into the corridor.

Suddenly her eye encountered that of her father; and his glance, vague
and unnoticing as it was, terrified her. The goodman and Nanon were
yoked together by a stout stick, each end of which rested on their
shoulders; a stout rope was passed over it, on which was slung a small
barrel or keg like those Pere Grandet still made in his bakehouse as
an amusement for his leisure hours.

"Holy Virgin, how heavy it is!" said the voice of Nanon.

"What a pity that it is only copper sous!" answered Grandet. "Take
care you don't knock over the candlestick."

The scene was lighted by a single candle placed between two rails of
the staircase.

"Cornoiller," said Grandet to his keeper /in partibus/, "have you
brought your pistols?"

"No, monsieur. Mercy! what's there to fear for your copper sous?"

"Oh! nothing," said Pere Grandet.

"Besides, we shall go fast," added the man; "your farmers have picked
out their best horses."

"Very good. You did not tell them where I was going?"

"I didn't know where."

"Very good. Is the carriage strong?"

"Strong? hear to that, now! Why, it can carry three thousand weight.
How much does that old keg weigh?"

"Goodness!" exclaimed Nanon. "I ought to know! There's pretty nigh
eighteen hundred--"

"Will you hold your tongue, Nanon! You are to tell my wife I have gone
into the country. I shall be back to dinner. Drive fast, Cornoiller; I
must get to Angers before nine o'clock."

The carriage drove off. Nanon bolted the great door, let loose the
dog, and went off to bed with a bruised shoulder, no one in the
neighborhood suspecting either the departure of Grandet or the object
of his journey. The precautions of the old miser and his reticence
were never relaxed. No one had ever seen a penny in that house, filled
as it was with gold. Hearing in the morning, through the gossip of the
port, that exchange on gold had doubled in price in consequence of
certain military preparations undertaken at Nantes, and that
speculators had arrived at Angers to buy coin, the old wine-grower, by
the simple process of borrowing horses from his farmers, seized the
chance of selling his gold and of bringing back in the form of
treasury notes the sum he intended to put into the Funds, having
swelled it considerably by the exchange.



VIII

"My father has gone," thought Eugenie, who heard all that took place
from the head of the stairs. Silence was restored in the house, and
the distant rumbling of the carriage, ceasing by degrees, no longer
echoed through the sleeping town. At this moment Eugenie heard in her
heart, before the sound caught her ears, a cry which pierced the
partitions and came from her cousin's chamber. A line of light, thin
as the blade of a sabre, shone through a chink in the door and fell
horizontally on the balusters of the rotten staircase.

"He suffers!" she said, springing up the stairs. A second moan brought
her to the landing near his room. The door was ajar, she pushed it
open. Charles was sleeping; his head hung over the side of the old
armchair, and his hand, from which the pen had fallen, nearly touched
the floor. The oppressed breathing caused by the strained posture
suddenly frightened Eugenie, who entered the room hastily.

"He must be very tired," she said to herself, glancing at a dozen
letters lying sealed upon the table. She read their addresses: "To
Messrs. Farry, Breilmann, & Co., carriage-makers"; "To Monsieur
Buisson, tailor," etc.

"He has been settling all his affairs, so as to leave France at once,"
she thought. Her eyes fell upon two open letters. The words, "My dear
Annette," at the head of one of them, blinded her for a moment. Her
heart beat fast, her feet were nailed to the floor.

"His dear Annette! He loves! he is loved! No hope! What does he say to
her?"

These thoughts rushed through her head and heart. She saw the words
everywhere, even on the bricks of the floor, in letters of fire.

"Resign him already? No, no! I will not read the letter. I ought to go
away--What if I do read it?"

She looked at Charles, then she gently took his head and placed it
against the back of the chair; he let her do so, like a child which,
though asleep, knows its mother's touch and receives, without awaking,
her kisses and watchful care. Like a mother Eugenie raised the
drooping hand, and like a mother she gently kissed the chestnut hair--
"Dear Annette!" a demon shrieked the words in her ear.

"I am doing wrong; but I must read it, that letter," she said. She
turned away her head, for her noble sense of honor reproached her. For
the first time in her life good and evil struggled together in her
heart. Up to that moment she had never had to blush for any action.
Passion and curiosity triumphed. As she read each sentence her heart
swelled more and more, and the keen glow which filled her being as she
did so, only made the joys of first love still more precious.

  My dear Annette,--Nothing could ever have separated us but the
  great misfortune which has now overwhelmed me, and which no human
  foresight could have prevented. My father has killed himself; his
  fortune and mine are irretrievably lost. I am orphaned at an age
  when, through the nature of my education, I am still a child; and
  yet I must lift myself as a man out of the abyss into which I am
  plunged. I have just spent half the night in facing my position.
  If I wish to leave France an honest man,--and there is no doubt of
  that,--I have not a hundred francs of my own with which to try my
  fate in the Indies or in America. Yes, my poor Anna, I must seek
  my fortune in those deadly climates. Under those skies, they tell
  me, I am sure to make it. As for remaining in Paris, I cannot do
  so. Neither my nature nor my face are made to bear the affronts,
  the neglect, the disdain shown to a ruined man, the son of a
  bankrupt! Good God! think of owing two millions! I should be
  killed in a duel the first week; therefore I shall not return
  there. Your love--the most tender and devoted love which ever
  ennobled the heart of man--cannot draw me back. Alas! my beloved,
  I have no money with which to go to you, to give and receive a
  last kiss from which I might derive some strength for my forlorn
  enterprise.

"Poor Charles! I did well to read the letter. I have gold; I will give
it to him," thought Eugenie.

She wiped her eyes, and went on reading.

  I have never thought of the miseries of poverty. If I have the
  hundred louis required for the mere costs of the journey, I have
  not a sou for an outfit. But no, I have not the hundred louis, not
  even one louis. I don't know that anything will be left after I
  have paid my debts in Paris. If I have nothing, I shall go quietly
  to Nantes and ship as a common sailor; and I will begin in the new
  world like other men who have started young without a sou and
  brought back the wealth of the Indies. During this long day I have
  faced my future coolly. It seems more horrible for me than for
  another, because I have been so petted by a mother who adored me,
  so indulged by the kindest of fathers, so blessed by meeting, on
  my entrance into life, with the love of an Anna! The flowers of
  life are all I have ever known. Such happiness could not last.
  Nevertheless, my dear Annette, I feel more courage than a careless
  young man is supposed to feel,--above all a young man used to the
  caressing ways of the dearest woman in all Paris, cradled in
  family joys, on whom all things smiled in his home, whose wishes
  were a law to his father--oh, my father! Annette, he is dead!

  Well, I have thought over my position, and yours as well. I have
  grown old in twenty-four hours. Dear Anna, if in order to keep me
  with you in Paris you were to sacrifice your luxury, your dress,
  your opera-box, we should even then not have enough for the
  expenses of my extravagant ways of living. Besides, I would never
  accept such sacrifices. No, we must part now and forever--

"He gives her up! Blessed Virgin! What happiness!"

Eugenie quivered with joy. Charles made a movement, and a chill of
terror ran through her. Fortunately, he did not wake, and she resumed
her reading.

  When shall I return? I do not know. The climate of the West Indies
  ages a European, so they say; especially a European who works
  hard. Let us think what may happen ten years hence. In ten years
  your daughter will be eighteen; she will be your companion, your
  spy. To you society will be cruel, and your daughter perhaps more
  cruel still. We have seen cases of the harsh social judgment and
  ingratitude of daughters; let us take warning by them. Keep in the
  depths of your soul, as I shall in mine, the memory of four years
  of happiness, and be faithful, if you can, to the memory of your
  poor friend. I cannot exact such faithfulness, because, do you
  see, dear Annette, I must conform to the exigencies of my new
  life; I must take a commonplace view of them and do the best I
  can. Therefore I must think of marriage, which becomes one of the
  necessities of my future existence; and I will admit to you that I
  have found, here in Saumur, in my uncle's house, a cousin whose
  face, manners, mind, and heart would please you, and who, besides,
  seems to me--

"He must have been very weary to have ceased writing to her," thought
Eugenie, as she gazed at the letter which stopped abruptly in the
middle of the last sentence.

Already she defended him. How was it possible that an innocent girl
should perceive the cold-heartedness evinced by this letter? To young
girls religiously brought up, whose minds are ignorant and pure, all
is love from the moment they set their feet within the enchanted
regions of that passion. They walk there bathed in a celestial light
shed from their own souls, which reflects its rays upon their lover;
they color all with the flame of their own emotion and attribute to
him their highest thoughts. A woman's errors come almost always from
her belief in good or her confidence in truth. In Eugenie's simple
heart the words, "My dear Annette, my loved one," echoed like the
sweetest language of love; they caressed her soul as, in childhood,
the divine notes of the /Venite adoremus/, repeated by the organ,
caressed her ear. Moreover, the tears which still lingered on the
young man's lashes gave signs of that nobility of heart by which young
girls are rightly won. How could she know that Charles, though he
loved his father and mourned him truly, was moved far more by paternal
goodness than by the goodness of his own heart? Monsieur and Madame
Guillaume Grandet, by gratifying every fancy of their son, and
lavishing upon him the pleasures of a large fortune, had kept him from
making the horrible calculations of which so many sons in Paris become
more or less guilty when, face to face with the enjoyments of the
world, they form desires and conceive schemes which they see with
bitterness must be put off or laid aside during the lifetime of their
parents. The liberality of the father in this instance had shed into
the heart of the son a real love, in which there was no afterthought
of self-interest.

Nevertheless, Charles was a true child of Paris, taught by the customs
of society and by Annette herself to calculate everything; already an
old man under the mask of youth. He had gone through the frightful
education of social life, of that world where in one evening more
crimes are committed in thought and speech than justice ever punishes
at the assizes; where jests and clever sayings assassinate the noblest
ideas; where no one is counted strong unless his mind sees clear: and
to see clear in that world is to believe in nothing, neither in
feelings, nor in men, nor even in events,--for events are falsified.
There, to "see clear" we must weigh a friend's purse daily, learn how
to keep ourselves adroitly on the top of the wave, cautiously admire
nothing, neither works of art nor glorious actions, and remember that
self-interest is the mainspring of all things here below. After
committing many follies, the great lady--the beautiful Annette--
compelled Charles to think seriously; with her perfumed hand among his
curls, she talked to him of his future position; as she rearranged his
locks, she taught him lessons of worldly prudence; she made him
effeminate and materialized him,--a double corruption, but a delicate
and elegant corruption, in the best taste.

"You are very foolish, Charles," she would say to him. "I shall have a
great deal of trouble in teaching you to understand the world. You
behaved extremely ill to Monsieur des Lupeaulx. I know very well he is
not an honorable man; but wait till he is no longer in power, then you
may despise him as much as you like. Do you know what Madame Campan
used to tell us?--'My dears, as long as a man is a minister, adore
him; when he falls, help to drag him in the gutter. Powerful, he is a
sort of god; fallen, he is lower than Marat in the sewer, because he
is living, and Marat is dead. Life is a series of combinations, and
you must study them and understand them if you want to keep yourselves
always in good position.'"

Charles was too much a man of the world, his parents had made him too
happy, he had received too much adulation in society, to be possessed
of noble sentiments. The grain of gold dropped by his mother into his
heart was beaten thin in the smithy of Parisian society; he had spread
it superficially, and it was worn away by the friction of life.
Charles was only twenty-one years old. At that age the freshness of
youth seems inseparable from candor and sincerity of soul. The voice,
the glance, the face itself, seem in harmony with the feelings; and
thus it happens that the sternest judge, the most sceptical lawyer,
the least complying of usurers, always hesitate to admit decrepitude
of heart or the corruption of worldly calculation while the eyes are
still bathed in purity and no wrinkles seam the brow. Charles, so far,
had had no occasion to apply the maxims of Parisian morality; up to
this time he was still endowed with the beauty of inexperience. And
yet, unknown to himself, he had been inoculated with selfishness. The
germs of Parisian political economy, latent in his heart, would
assuredly burst forth, sooner or later, whenever the careless
spectator became an actor in the drama of real life.

Nearly all young girls succumb to the tender promises such an outward
appearance seems to offer: even if Eugenie had been as prudent and
observing as provincial girls are often found to be, she was not
likely to distrust her cousin when his manners, words, and actions
were still in unison with the aspirations of a youthful heart. A mere
chance--a fatal chance--threw in her way the last effusions of real
feeling which stirred the young man's soul; she heard as it were the
last breathings of his conscience. She laid down the letter--to her so
full of love--and began smilingly to watch her sleeping cousin; the
fresh illusions of life were still, for her at least, upon his face;
she vowed to herself to love him always. Then she cast her eyes on the
other letter, without attaching much importance to this second
indiscretion; and though she read it, it was only to obtain new proofs
of the noble qualities which, like all women, she attributed to the
man her heart had chosen.

  My dear Alphonse,--When you receive this letter I shall be without
  friends; but let me assure you that while I doubt the friendship
  of the world, I have never doubted yours. I beg you therefore to
  settle all my affairs, and I trust to you to get as much as you
  can out of my possessions. By this time you know my situation. I
  have nothing left, and I intend to go at once to the Indies. I
  have just written to all the people to whom I think I owe money,
  and you will find enclosed a list of their names, as correct as I
  can make it from memory. My books, my furniture, my pictures, my
  horses, etc., ought, I think, to pay my debts. I do not wish to
  keep anything, except, perhaps, a few baubles which might serve as
  the beginning of an outfit for my enterprise. My dear Alphonse, I
  will send you a proper power of attorney under which you can make
  these sales. Send me all my weapons. Keep Briton for yourself;
  nobody would pay the value of that noble beast, and I would rather
  give him to you--like a mourning-ring bequeathed by a dying man to
  his executor. Farry, Breilmann, & Co. built me a very comfortable
  travelling-carriage, which they have not yet delivered; persuade
  them to keep it and not ask for any payment on it. If they refuse,
  do what you can in the matter, and avoid everything that might
  seem dishonorable in me under my present circumstances. I owe the
  British Islander six louis, which I lost at cards; don't fail to
  pay him--

"Dear cousin!" whispered Eugenie, throwing down the letter and running
softly back to her room, carrying one of the lighted candles. A thrill
of pleasure passed over her as she opened the drawer of an old oak
cabinet, a fine specimen of the period called the Renaissance, on
which could still be seen, partly effaced, the famous royal
salamander. She took from the drawer a large purse of red velvet with
gold tassels, edged with a tarnished fringe of gold wire,--a relic
inherited from her grandmother. She weighed it proudly in her hand,
and began with delight to count over the forgotten items of her little
hoard. First she took out twenty /portugaises/, still new, struck in
the reign of John V., 1725, worth by exchange, as her father told her,
five /lisbonnines/, or a hundred and sixty-eight francs, sixty-four
centimes each; their conventional value, however, was a hundred and
eighty francs apiece, on account of the rarity and beauty of the
coins, which shone like little suns. Item, five /genovines/, or five
hundred-franc pieces of Genoa; another very rare coin worth eighty-
seven francs on exchange, but a hundred francs to collectors. These
had formerly belonged to old Monsieur de la Bertelliere. Item, three
gold /quadruples/, Spanish, of Philip V., struck in 1729, given to her
one by one by Madame Gentillet, who never failed to say, using the
same words, when she made the gift, "This dear little canary, this
little yellow-boy, is worth ninety-eight francs! Keep it, my pretty
one, it will be the flower of your treasure." Item (that which her
father valued most of all, the gold of these coins being twenty-three
carats and a fraction), a hundred Dutch ducats, made in the year 1756,
and worth thirteen francs apiece. Item, a great curiosity, a species
of medal precious to the soul of misers,--three rupees with the sign
of the Scales, and five rupees with the sign of the Virgin, all in
pure gold of twenty-four carats; the magnificent money of the Great
Mogul, each of which was worth by mere weight thirty-seven francs,
forty centimes, but at least fifty francs to those connoisseurs who
love to handle gold. Item, the napoleon of forty francs received the
day before, which she had forgotten to put away in the velvet purse.
This treasure was all in virgin coins, true works of art, which
Grandet from time to time inquired after and asked to see, pointing
out to his daughter their intrinsic merits,--such as the beauty of the
milled edge, the clearness of the flat surface, the richness of the
lettering, whose angles were not yet rubbed off.

Eugenie gave no thought to these rarities, nor to her father's mania
for them, nor to the danger she incurred in depriving herself of a
treasure so dear to him; no, she thought only of her cousin, and soon
made out, after a few mistakes of calculation, that she possessed
about five thousand eight hundred francs in actual value, which might
be sold for their additional value to collectors for nearly six
thousand. She looked at her wealth and clapped her hands like a happy
child forced to spend its overflowing joy in artless movements of the
body. Father and daughter had each counted up their fortune this
night,--he, to sell his gold; Eugenie to fling hers into the ocean of
affection. She put the pieces back into the old purse, took it in her
hand, and ran upstairs without hesitation. The secret misery of her
cousin made her forget the hour and conventional propriety; she was
strong in her conscience, in her devotion, in her happiness.

As she stood upon the threshold of the door, holding the candle in one
hand and the purse in the other, Charles woke, caught sight of her,
and remained speechless with surprise. Eugenie came forward, put the
candle on the table, and said in a quivering voice:

"My cousin, I must beg pardon for a wrong I have done you; but God
will pardon me--if you--will help me to wipe it out."

"What is it?" asked Charles, rubbing his eyes.

"I have read those letters."

Charles colored.

"How did it happen?" she continued; "how came I here? Truly, I do not
know. I am tempted not to regret too much that I have read them; they
have made me know your heart, your soul, and--"

"And what?" asked Charles.

"Your plans, your need of a sum--"

"My dear cousin--"

"Hush, hush! my cousin, not so loud; we must not wake others. See,"
she said, opening her purse, "here are the savings of a poor girl who
wants nothing. Charles, accept them! This morning I was ignorant of
the value of money; you have taught it to me. It is but a means, after
all. A cousin is almost a brother; you can surely borrow the purse of
your sister."

Eugenie, as much a woman as a young girl, never dreamed of refusal;
but her cousin remained silent.

"Oh! you will not refuse?" cried Eugenie, the beatings of whose heart
could be heard in the deep silence.

Her cousin's hesitation mortified her; but the sore need of his
position came clearer still to her mind, and she knelt down.

"I will never rise till you have taken that gold!" she said. "My
cousin, I implore you, answer me! let me know if you respect me, if
you are generous, if--"

As he heard this cry of noble distress the young man's tears fell upon
his cousin's hands, which he had caught in his own to keep her from
kneeling. As the warm tears touched her, Eugenie sprang to the purse
and poured its contents upon the table.

"Ah! yes, yes, you consent?" she said, weeping with joy. "Fear
nothing, my cousin, you will be rich. This gold will bring you
happiness; some day you shall bring it back to me,--are we not
partners? I will obey all conditions. But you should not attach such
value to the gift."

Charles was at last able to express his feelings.

"Yes, Eugenie; my soul would be small indeed if I did not accept. And
yet,--gift for gift, confidence for confidence."

"What do you mean?" she said, frightened.

"Listen, dear cousin; I have here--" He interrupted himself to point
out a square box covered with an outer case of leather which was on
the drawers. "There," he continued, "is something as precious to me as
life itself. This box was a present from my mother. All day I have
been thinking that if she could rise from her grave, she would herself
sell the gold which her love for me lavished on this dressing-case;
but were I to do so, the act would seem to me a sacrilege." Eugenie
pressed his hand as she heard these last words. "No," he added, after
a slight pause, during which a liquid glance of tenderness passed
between them, "no, I will neither sell it nor risk its safety on my
journey. Dear Eugenie, you shall be its guardian. Never did friend
commit anything more sacred to another. Let me show it to you."

He went to the box, took it from its outer coverings, opened it, and
showed his delighted cousin a dressing-case where the rich workmanship
gave to the gold ornaments a value far above their weight.

"What you admire there is nothing," he said, pushing a secret spring
which opened a hidden drawer. "Here is something which to me is worth
the whole world." He drew out two portraits, masterpieces of Madame
Mirbel, richly set with pearls.

"Oh, how beautiful! Is it the lady to whom you wrote that--"

"No," he said, smiling; "this is my mother, and here is my father,
your aunt and uncle. Eugenie, I beg you on my knees, keep my treasure
safely. If I die and your little fortune is lost, this gold and these
pearls will repay you. To you alone could I leave these portraits; you
are worthy to keep them. But destroy them at last, so that they may
pass into no other hands." Eugenie was silent. "Ah, yes, say yes! You
consent?" he added with winning grace.

Hearing the very words she had just used to her cousin now addressed
to herself, she turned upon him a look of love, her first look of
loving womanhood,--a glance in which there is nearly as much of
coquetry as of inmost depth. He took her hand and kissed it.

"Angel of purity! between us two money is nothing, never can be
anything. Feeling, sentiment, must be all henceforth."

"You are like your mother,--was her voice as soft as yours?"

"Oh! much softer--"

"Yes, for you," she said, dropping her eyelids. "Come, Charles, go to
bed; I wish it; you must be tired. Good-night." She gently disengaged
her hand from those of her cousin, who followed her to her room,
lighting the way. When they were both upon the threshold,--

"Ah!" he said, "why am I ruined?"

"What matter?--my father is rich; I think so," she answered.

"Poor child!" said Charles, making a step into her room and leaning
his back against the wall, "if that were so, he would never have let
my father die; he would not let you live in this poor way; he would
live otherwise himself."

"But he owns Froidfond."

"What is Froidfond worth?"

"I don't know; but he has Noyers."

"Nothing but a poor farm!"

"He has vineyards and fields."

"Mere nothing," said Charles disdainfully. "If your father had only
twenty-four thousand francs a year do you suppose you would live in
this cold, barren room?" he added, making a step in advance. "Ah!
there you will keep my treasures," he said, glancing at the old
cabinet, as if to hide his thoughts.

"Go and sleep," she said, hindering his entrance into the disordered
room.

Charles stepped back, and they bid each other good-night with a mutual
smile.

Both fell asleep in the same dream; and from that moment the youth
began to wear roses with his mourning. The next day, before breakfast,
Madame Grandet found her daughter in the garden in company with
Charles. The young man was still sad, as became a poor fellow who,
plunged in misfortune, measures the depths of the abyss into which he
has fallen, and sees the terrible burden of his whole future life.

"My father will not be home till dinner-time," said Eugenie,
perceiving the anxious look on her mother's face.

It was easy to trace in the face and manners of the young girl and in
the singular sweetness of her voice a unison of thought between her
and her cousin. Their souls had espoused each other, perhaps before
they even felt the force of the feelings which bound them together.
Charles spent the morning in the hall, and his sadness was respected.
Each of the three women had occupations of her own. Grandet had left
all his affairs unattended to, and a number of persons came on
business,--the plumber, the mason, the slater, the carpenter, the
diggers, the dressers, the farmers; some to drive a bargain about
repairs, others to pay their rent or to be paid themselves for
services. Madame Grandet and Eugenie were obliged to go and come and
listen to the interminable talk of all these workmen and country folk.
Nanon put away in her kitchen the produce which they brought as
tribute. She always waited for her master's orders before she knew
what portion was to be used in the house and what was to be sold in
the market. It was the goodman's custom, like that of a great many
country gentlemen, to drink his bad wine and eat his spoiled fruit.

Towards five in the afternoon Grandet returned from Angers, having
made fourteen thousand francs by the exchange on his gold, bringing
home in his wallet good treasury-notes which bore interest until the
day he should invest them in the Funds. He had left Cornoiller at
Angers to look after the horses, which were well-nigh foundered, with
orders to bring them home slowly after they were rested.

"I have got back from Angers, wife," he said; "I am hungry."

Nanon called out to him from the kitchen: "Haven't you eaten anything
since yesterday?"

"Nothing," answered the old man.

Nanon brought in the soup. Des Grassins came to take his client's
orders just as the family sat down to dinner. Grandet had not even
observed his nephew.

"Go on eating, Grandet," said the banker; "we can talk. Do you know
what gold is worth in Angers? They have come from Nantes after it? I
shall send some of ours."

"Don't send any," said Grandet; "they have got enough. We are such old
friends, I ought to save you from such a loss of time."

"But gold is worth thirteen francs fifty centimes."

"Say /was/ worth--"

"Where the devil have they got any?"

"I went to Angers last night," answered Grandet in a low voice.

The banker shook with surprise. Then a whispered conversation began
between the two, during which Grandet and des Grassins frequently
looked at Charles. Presently des Grassins gave a start of
astonishment; probably Grandet was then instructing him to invest the
sum which was to give him a hundred thousand francs a year in the
Funds.

"Monsieur Grandet," said the banker to Charles, "I am starting for
Paris; if you have any commissions--"

"None, monsieur, I thank you," answered Charles.

"Thank him better than that, nephew. Monsieur is going to settle the
affairs of the house of Guillaume Grandet."

"Is there any hope?" said Charles eagerly.

"What!" exclaimed his uncle, with well-acted pride, "are you not my
nephew? Your honor is ours. Is not your name Grandet?"

Charles rose, seized Pere Grandet, kissed him, turned pale, and left
the room. Eugenie looked at her father with admiration.

"Well, good-by, des Grassins; it is all in your hands. Decoy those
people as best you can; lead 'em by the nose."

The two diplomatists shook hands. The old cooper accompanied the
banker to the front door. Then, after closing it, he came back and
plunged into his armchair, saying to Nanon,--

"Get me some black-currant ratafia."

Too excited, however, to remain long in one place, he got up, looked
at the portrait of Monsieur de la Bertelliere, and began to sing,
doing what Nanon called his dancing steps,--

  "Dans les gardes francaises
  J'avais un bon papa."

Nanon, Madame Grandet, and Eugenie looked at each other in silence.
The hilarity of the master always frightened them when it reached its
climax. The evening was soon over. Pere Grandet chose to go to bed
early, and when he went to bed, everybody else was expected to go too;
like as when Augustus drank, Poland was drunk. On this occasion Nanon,
Charles, and Eugenie were not less tired than the master. As for
Madame Grandet, she slept, ate, drank, and walked according to the
will of her husband. However, during the two hours consecrated to
digestion, the cooper, more facetious than he had ever been in his
life, uttered a number of his own particular apothegms,--a single one
of which will give the measure of his mind. When he had drunk his
ratafia, he looked at his glass and said,--

"You have no sooner put your lips to a glass than it is empty! Such is
life. You can't have and hold. Gold won't circulate and stay in your
purse. If it were not for that, life would be too fine."

He was jovial and benevolent. When Nanon came with her spinning-wheel,
"You must be tired," he said; "put away your hemp."

"Ah, bah! then I shall get sleepy," she answered.

"Poor Nanon! Will you have some ratafia?"

"I won't refuse a good offer; madame makes it a deal better than the
apothecaries. What they sell is all drugs."

"They put too much sugar," said the master; "you can't taste anything
else."



IX

The following day the family, meeting at eight o'clock for the early
breakfast, made a picture of genuine domestic intimacy. Grief had
drawn Madame Grandet, Eugenie, and Charles /en rapport/; even Nanon
sympathized, without knowing why. The four now made one family. As to
the old man, his satisfied avarice and the certainty of soon getting
rid of the dandy without having to pay more than his journey to
Nantes, made him nearly indifferent to his presence in the house. He
left the two children, as he called Charles and Eugenie, free to
conduct themselves as they pleased, under the eye of Madame Grandet,
in whom he had implicit confidence as to all that concerned public and
religious morality. He busied himself in straightening the boundaries
of his fields and ditches along the high-road, in his poplar-
plantations beside the Loire, in the winter work of his vineyards, and
at Froidfond. All these things occupied his whole time.

For Eugenie the springtime of love had come. Since the scene at night
when she gave her little treasure to her cousin, her heart had
followed the treasure. Confederates in the same secret, they looked at
each other with a mutual intelligence which sank to the depth of their
consciousness, giving a closer communion, a more intimate relation to
their feelings, and putting them, so to speak, beyond the pale of
ordinary life. Did not their near relationship warrant the gentleness
in their tones, the tenderness in their glances? Eugenie took delight
in lulling her cousin's pain with the pretty childish joys of a new-
born love. Are there no sweet similitudes between the birth of love
and the birth of life? Do we not rock the babe with gentle songs and
softest glances? Do we not tell it marvellous tales of the golden
future? Hope herself, does she not spread her radiant wings above its
head? Does it not shed, with infant fickleness, its tears of sorrow
and its tears of joy? Does it not fret for trifles, cry for the pretty
pebbles with which to build its shifting palaces, for the flowers
forgotten as soon as plucked? Is it not eager to grasp the coming
time, to spring forward into life? Love is our second transformation.
Childhood and love were one and the same thing to Eugenie and to
Charles; it was a first passion, with all its child-like play,--the
more caressing to their hearts because they now were wrapped in
sadness. Struggling at birth against the gloom of mourning, their love
was only the more in harmony with the provincial plainness of that
gray and ruined house. As they exchanged a few words beside the well
in the silent court, or lingered in the garden for the sunset hour,
sitting on a mossy seat saying to each other the infinite nothings of
love, or mused in the silent calm which reigned between the house and
the ramparts like that beneath the arches of a church, Charles
comprehended the sanctity of love; for his great lady, his dear
Annette, had taught him only its stormy troubles. At this moment he
left the worldly passion, coquettish, vain, and showy as it was, and
turned to the true, pure love. He loved even the house, whose customs
no longer seemed to him ridiculous. He got up early in the mornings
that he might talk with Eugenie for a moment before her father came to
dole out the provisions; when the steps of the old man sounded on the
staircase he escaped into the garden. The small criminality of this
morning /tete-a-tete/ which Nanon pretended not to see, gave to their
innocent love the lively charm of a forbidden joy.

After breakfast, when Grandet had gone to his fields and his other
occupations, Charles remained with the mother and daughter, finding an
unknown pleasure in holding their skeins, in watching them at work, in
listening to their quiet prattle. The simplicity of this half-monastic
life, which revealed to him the beauty of these souls, unknown and
unknowing of the world, touched him keenly. He had believed such
morals impossible in France, and admitted their existence nowhere but
in Germany; even so, they seemed to him fabulous, only real in the
novels of Auguste Lafontaine. Soon Eugenie became to him the Margaret
of Goethe--before her fall. Day by day his words, his looks enraptured
the poor girl, who yielded herself up with delicious non-resistance to
the current of love; she caught her happiness as a swimmer seizes the
overhanging branch of a willow to draw himself from the river and lie
at rest upon its shore. Did no dread of a coming absence sadden the
happy hours of those fleeting days? Daily some little circumstance
reminded them of the parting that was at hand.

Three days after the departure of des Grassins, Grandet took his
nephew to the Civil courts, with the solemnity which country people
attach to all legal acts, that he might sign a deed surrendering his
rights in his father's estate. Terrible renunciation! species of
domestic apostasy! Charles also went before Maitre Cruchot to make two
powers of attorney,--one for des Grassins, the other for the friend
whom he had charged with the sale of his belongings. After that he
attended to all the formalities necessary to obtain a passport for
foreign countries; and finally, when he received his simple mourning
clothes from Paris, he sent for the tailor of Saumur and sold to him
his useless wardrobe. This last act pleased Grandet exceedingly.

"Ah! now you look like a man prepared to embark and make your
fortune," he said, when Charles appeared in a surtout of plain black
cloth. "Good! very good!"

"I hope you will believe, monsieur," answered his nephew, "that I
shall always try to conform to my situation."

"What's that?" said his uncle, his eyes lighting up at a handful of
gold which Charles was carrying.

"Monsieur, I have collected all my buttons and rings and other
superfluities which may have some value; but not knowing any one in
Saumur, I wanted to ask you to--"

"To buy them?" said Grandet, interrupting him.

"No, uncle; only to tell me of an honest man who--"

"Give me those things, I will go upstairs and estimate their value; I
will come back and tell you what it is to a fraction. Jeweller's
gold," examining a long chain, "eighteen or nineteen carats."

The goodman held out his huge hand and received the mass of gold,
which he carried away.

"Cousin," said Grandet, "may I offer you these two buttons? They can
fasten ribbons round your wrists; that sort of bracelet is much the
fashion just now."

"I accept without hesitation," she answered, giving him an
understanding look.

"Aunt, here is my mother's thimble; I have always kept it carefully in
my dressing-case," said Charles, presenting a pretty gold thimble to
Madame Grandet, who for many years had longed for one.

"I cannot thank you; no words are possible, my nephew," said the poor
mother, whose eyes filled with tears. "Night and morning in my prayers
I shall add one for you, the most earnest of all--for those who
travel. If I die, Eugenie will keep this treasure for you."

"They are worth nine hundred and eighty-nine francs, seventy-five
centimes," said Grandet, opening the door. "To save you the pain of
selling them, I will advance the money--in /livres/."

The word /livres/ on the littoral of the Loire signifies that crown
prices of six /livres/ are to be accepted as six francs without
deduction.

"I dared not propose it to you," answered Charles; "but it was most
repugnant to me to sell my jewels to some second-hand dealer in your
own town. People should wash their dirty linen at home, as Napoleon
said. I thank you for your kindness."

Grandet scratched his ear, and there was a moment's silence.

"My dear uncle," resumed Charles, looking at him with an uneasy air,
as if he feared to wound his feelings, "my aunt and cousin have been
kind enough to accept a trifling remembrance of me. Will you allow me
to give you these sleeve-buttons, which are useless to me now? They
will remind you of a poor fellow who, far away, will always think of
those who are henceforth all his family."

"My lad, my lad, you mustn't rob yourself this way! Let me see, wife,
what have you got?" he added, turning eagerly to her. "Ah! a gold
thimble. And you, little girl? What! diamond buttons? Yes, I'll accept
your present, nephew," he answered, shaking Charles by the hand. "But
--you must let me--pay--your--yes, your passage to the Indies. Yes, I
wish to pay your passage because--d'ye see, my boy?--in valuing your
jewels I estimated only the weight of the gold; very likely the
workmanship is worth something. So let us settle it that I am to give
you fifteen hundred francs--in /livres/; Cruchot will lend them to me.
I haven't got a copper farthing here,--unless Perrotet, who is
behindhand with his rent, should pay up. By the bye, I'll go and see
him."

He took his hat, put on his gloves, and went out.

"Then you are really going?" said Eugenie to her cousin, with a sad
look, mingled with admiration.

"I must," he said, bowing his head.

For some days past, Charles's whole bearing, manners, and speech had
become those of a man who, in spite of his profound affliction, feels
the weight of immense obligations and has the strength to gather
courage from misfortune. He no longer repined, he became a man.
Eugenie never augured better of her cousin's character than when she
saw him come down in the plain black clothes which suited well with
his pale face and sombre countenance. On that day the two women put on
their own mourning, and all three assisted at a Requiem celebrated in
the parish church for the soul of the late Guillaume Grandet.

At the second breakfast Charles received letters from Paris and began
to read them.

"Well, cousin, are you satisfied with the management of your affairs?"
said Eugenie in a low voice.

"Never ask such questions, my daughter," said Grandet. "What the
devil! do I tell you my affairs? Why do you poke your nose into your
cousin's? Let the lad alone!"

"Oh! I haven't any secrets," said Charles.

"Ta, ta, ta, ta, nephew; you'll soon find out that you must hold your
tongue in business."

When the two lovers were alone in the garden, Charles said to Eugenie,
drawing her down on the old bench beneath the walnut-tree,--

"I did right to trust Alphonse; he has done famously. He has managed
my affairs with prudence and good faith. I now owe nothing in Paris.
All my things have been sold; and he tells me that he has taken the
advice of an old sea-captain and spent three thousand francs on a
commercial outfit of European curiosities which will be sure to be in
demand in the Indies. He has sent my trunks to Nantes, where a ship is
loading for San Domingo. In five days, Eugenie, we must bid each other
farewell--perhaps forever, at least for years. My outfit and ten
thousand francs, which two of my friends send me, are a very small
beginning. I cannot look to return for many years. My dear cousin, do
not weight your life in the scales with mine; I may perish; some good
marriage may be offered to you--"

"Do you love me?" she said.

"Oh, yes! indeed, yes!" he answered, with a depth of tone that
revealed an equal depth of feeling.

"I shall wait, Charles--Good heavens! there is my father at his
window," she said, repulsing her cousin, who leaned forward to kiss
her.

She ran quickly under the archway. Charles followed her. When she saw
him, she retreated to the foot of the staircase and opened the swing-
door; then, scarcely knowing where she was going, Eugenie reached the
corner near Nanon's den, in the darkest end of the passage. There
Charles caught her hand and drew her to his heart. Passing his arm
about her waist, he made her lean gently upon him. Eugenie no longer
resisted; she received and gave the purest, the sweetest, and yet,
withal, the most unreserved of kisses.

"Dear Eugenie, a cousin is better than a brother, for he can marry
you," said Charles.

"So be it!" cried Nanon, opening the door of her lair.

The two lovers, alarmed, fled into the hall, where Eugenie took up her
work and Charles began to read the litanies of the Virgin in Madame
Grandet's prayer-book.

"Mercy!" cried Nanon, "now they're saying their prayers."

As soon as Charles announced his immediate departure, Grandet
bestirred himself to testify much interest in his nephew. He became
very liberal of all that cost him nothing; took pains to find a
packer; declared the man asked too much for his cases; insisted on
making them himself out of old planks; got up early in the morning to
fit and plane and nail together the strips, out of which he made, to
his own satisfaction, some strong cases, in which he packed all
Charles's effects; he also took upon himself to send them by boat down
the Loire, to insure them, and get them to Nantes in proper time.

After the kiss taken in the passage, the hours fled for Eugenie with
frightful rapidity. Sometimes she thought of following her cousin.
Those who have known that most endearing of all passions,--the one
whose duration is each day shortened by time, by age, by mortal
illness, by human chances and fatalities,--they will understand the
poor girl's tortures. She wept as she walked in the garden, now so
narrow to her, as indeed the court, the house, the town all seemed.
She launched in thought upon the wide expanse of the ocean he was
about to traverse. At last the eve of his departure came. That
morning, in the absence of Grandet and of Nanon, the precious case
which contained the two portraits was solemnly installed in the only
drawer of the old cabinet which could be locked, where the now empty
velvet purse was lying. This deposit was not made without a goodly
number of tears and kisses. When Eugenie placed the key within her
bosom she had no courage to forbid the kiss with which Charles sealed
the act.

"It shall never leave that place, my friend," she said.

"Then my heart will be always there."

"Ah! Charles, it is not right," she said, as though she blamed him.

"Are we not married?" he said. "I have thy promise,--then take mine."

"Thine; I am thine forever!" they each said, repeating the words twice
over.

No promise made upon this earth was ever purer. The innocent sincerity
of Eugenie had sanctified for a moment the young man's love.

On the morrow the breakfast was sad. Nanon herself, in spite of the
gold-embroidered robe and the Jeannette cross bestowed by Charles, had
tears in her eyes.

"The poor dear monsieur who is going on the seas--oh, may God guide
him!"

At half-past ten the whole family started to escort Charles to the
diligence for Nantes. Nanon let loose the dog, locked the door, and
insisted on carrying the young man's carpet-bag. All the tradesmen in
the tortuous old street were on the sill of their shop-doors to watch
the procession, which was joined in the market-place by Maitre
Cruchot.

"Eugenie, be sure you don't cry," said her mother.

"Nephew," said Grandet, in the doorway of the inn from which the coach
started, kissing Charles on both cheeks, "depart poor, return rich;
you will find the honor of your father safe. I answer for that myself,
I--Grandet; for it will only depend on you to--"

"Ah! my uncle, you soften the bitterness of my departure. Is it not
the best gift that you could make me?"

Not understanding his uncle's words which he had thus interrupted,
Charles shed tears of gratitude upon the tanned cheeks of the old
miser, while Eugenie pressed the hand of her cousin and that of her
father with all her strength. The notary smiled, admiring the sly
speech of the old man, which he alone had understood. The family stood
about the coach until it started; then as it disappeared upon the
bridge, and its rumble grew fainter in the distance, Grandet said:

"Good-by to you!"

Happily no one but Maitre Cruchot heard the exclamation. Eugenie and
her mother had gone to a corner of the quay from which they could
still see the diligence and wave their white handkerchiefs, to which
Charles made answer by displaying his.

"Ah! mother, would that I had the power of God for a single moment,"
said Eugenie, when she could no longer see her lover's handkerchief.

*****

Not to interrupt the current of events which are about to take place
in the bosom of the Grandet family, it is necessary to cast a
forestalling eye upon the various operations which the goodman carried
on in Paris by means of Monsieur des Grassins. A month after the
latter's departure from Saumur, Grandet, became possessed of a
certificate of a hundred thousand francs a year from his investment in
the Funds, bought at eighty francs net. The particulars revealed at
his death by the inventory of his property threw no light upon the
means which his suspicious nature took to remit the price of the
investment and receive the certificate thereof. Maitre Cruchot was of
opinion that Nanon, unknown to herself, was the trusty instrument by
which the money was transported; for about this time she was absent
five days, under a pretext of putting things to rights at Froidfond,--
as if the goodman were capable of leaving anything lying about or out
of order!

In all that concerned the business of the house of Guillaume Grandet
the old cooper's intentions were fulfilled to the letter. The Bank of
France, as everybody knows, affords exact information about all the
large fortunes in Paris and the provinces. The names of des Grassins
and Felix Grandet of Saumur were well known there, and they enjoyed
the esteem bestowed on financial celebrities whose wealth comes from
immense and unencumbered territorial possessions. The arrival of the
Saumur banker for the purpose, it was said, of honorably liquidating
the affairs of Grandet of Paris, was enough to avert the shame of
protested notes from the memory of the defunct merchant. The seals on
the property were taken off in presence of the creditors, and the
notary employed by Grandet went to work at once on the inventory of
the assets. Soon after this, des Grassins called a meeting of the
creditors, who unanimously elected him, conjointly with Francois
Keller, the head of a rich banking-house and one of those principally
interested in the affair, as liquidators, with full power to protect
both the honor of the family and the interests of the claimants. The
credit of Grandet of Saumur, the hopes he diffused by means of des
Grassins in the minds of all concerned, facilitated the transactions.
Not a single creditor proved recalcitrant; no one thought of passing
his claim to his profit-and-loss account; each and all said
confidently, "Grandet of Saumur will pay."

Six months went by. The Parisians had redeemed the notes in
circulation as they fell due, and held them under lock and key in
their desks. First result aimed at by the old cooper! Nine months
after this preliminary meeting, the two liquidators distributed forty-
seven per cent to each creditor on his claim. This amount was obtained
by the sale of the securities, property, and possessions of all kinds
belonging to the late Guillaume Grandet, and was paid over with
scrupulous fidelity. Unimpeachable integrity was shown in the
transaction. The creditors gratefully acknowledged the remarkable and
incontestable honor displayed by the Grandets. When these praises had
circulated for a certain length of time, the creditors asked for the
rest of their money. It became necessary to write a collective letter
to Grandet of Saumur.

"Here it comes!" said the old man as he threw the letter into the
fire. "Patience, my good friends!"

In answer to the proposals contained in the letter, Grandet of Saumur
demanded that all vouchers for claims against the estate of his
brother should be deposited with a notary, together with aquittances
for the forty-seven per cent already paid; he made this demand under
pretence of sifting the accounts and finding out the exact condition
of the estate. It roused at once a variety of difficulties. Generally
speaking, the creditor is a species of maniac, ready to agree to
anything one day, on the next breathing fire and slaughter; later on,
he grows amicable and easy-going. To-day his wife is good-humored, his
last baby has cut its first tooth, all is well at home, and he is
determined not to lose a sou; on the morrow it rains, he can't go out,
he is gloomy, he says yes to any proposal that is made to him, so long
as it will put an end to the affair; on the third day he declares he
must have guarantees; by the end of the month he wants his debtor's
head, and becomes at heart an executioner. The creditor is a good deal
like the sparrow on whose tail confiding children are invited to put
salt,--with this difference, that he applies the image to his claim,
the proceeds of which he is never able to lay hold of. Grandet had
studied the atmospheric variations of creditors, and the creditors of
his brother justified all his calculations. Some were angry, and
flatly refused to give in their vouchers.

"Very good; so much the better," said Grandet, rubbing his hands over
the letter in which des Grassins announced the fact.

Others agreed to the demand, but only on condition that their rights
should be fully guaranteed; they renounced none, and even reserved the
power of ultimately compelling a failure. On this began a long
correspondence, which ended in Grandet of Saumur agreeing to all
conditions. By means of this concession the placable creditors were
able to bring the dissatisfied creditors to reason. The deposit was
then made, but not without sundry complaints.

"Your goodman," they said to des Grassins, "is tricking us."

Twenty-three months after the death of Guillaume Grandet many of the
creditors, carried away by more pressing business in the markets of
Paris, had forgotten their Grandet claims, or only thought of them to
say:

"I begin to believe that forty-seven per cent is all I shall ever get
out of that affair."

The old cooper had calculated on the power of time, which, as he used
to say, is a pretty good devil after all. By the end of the third year
des Grassins wrote to Grandet that he had brought the creditors to
agree to give up their claims for ten per cent on the two million four
hundred thousand francs still due by the house of Grandet. Grandet
answered that the notary and the broker whose shameful failures had
caused the death of his brother were still living, that they might now
have recovered their credit, and that they ought to be sued, so as to
get something out of them towards lessening the total of the deficit.

By the end of the fourth year the liabilities were definitely
estimated at a sum of twelve hundred thousand francs. Many
negotiations, lasting over six months, took place between the
creditors and the liquidators, and between the liquidators and
Grandet. To make a long story short, Grandet of Saumur, anxious by
this time to get out of the affair, told the liquidators, about the
ninth month of the fourth year, that his nephew had made a fortune in
the Indies and was disposed to pay his father's debts in full; he
therefore could not take upon himself to make any settlement without
previously consulting him; he had written to him, and was expecting an
answer. The creditors were held in check until the middle of the fifth
year by the words, "payment in full," which the wily old miser threw
out from time to time as he laughed in his beard, saying with a smile
and an oath, "Those Parisians!"

But the creditors were reserved for a fate unexampled in the annals of
commerce. When the events of this history bring them once more into
notice, they will be found still in the position Grandet had resolved
to force them into from the first.

As soon as the Funds reached a hundred and fifteen, Pere Grandet sold
out his interests and withdrew two million four hundred thousand
francs in gold, to which he added, in his coffers, the six hundred
thousand francs compound interest which he had derived from the
capital. Des Grassins now lived in Paris. In the first place he had
been made a deputy; then he became infatuated (father of a family as
he was, though horribly bored by the provincial life of Saumur) with a
pretty actress at the Theatre de Madame, known as Florine, and he
presently relapsed into the old habits of his army life. It is useless
to speak of his conduct; Saumur considered it profoundly immoral. His
wife was fortunate in the fact of her property being settled upon
herself, and in having sufficient ability to keep up the banking-house
in Saumur, which was managed in her name and repaired the breach in
her fortune caused by the extravagance of her husband. The Cruchotines
made so much talk about the false position of the quasi-widow that she
married her daughter very badly, and was forced to give up all hope of
an alliance between Eugenie Grandet and her son. Adolphe joined his
father in Paris and became, it was said, a worthless fellow. The
Cruchots triumphed.

"Your husband hasn't common sense," said Grandet as he lent Madame des
Grassins some money on a note securely endorsed. "I am very sorry for
you, for you are a good little woman."

"Ah, monsieur," said the poor lady, "who could have believed that when
he left Saumur to go to Paris on your business he was going to his
ruin?"

"Heaven is my witness, madame, that up to the last moment I did all I
could to prevent him from going. Monsieur le president was most
anxious to take his place; but he was determined to go, and now we all
see why."

In this way Grandet made it quite plain that he was under no
obligation to des Grassins.

In all situations women have more cause for suffering than men, and
they suffer more. Man has strength and the power of exercising it; he
acts, moves, thinks, occupies himself; he looks ahead, and sees
consolation in the future. It was thus with Charles. But the woman
stays at home; she is always face to face with the grief from which
nothing distracts her; she goes down to the depths of the abyss which
yawns before her, measures it, and often fills it with her tears and
prayers. Thus did Eugenie. She initiated herself into her destiny. To
feel, to love, to suffer, to devote herself,--is not this the sum of
woman's life? Eugenie was to be in all things a woman, except in the
one thing that consoles for all. Her happiness, picked up like nails
scattered on a wall--to use the fine simile of Bossuet--would never so
much as fill even the hollow of her hand. Sorrows are never long in
coming; for her they came soon. The day after Charles's departure the
house of Monsieur Grandet resumed its ordinary aspect in the eyes of
all, except in those of Eugenie, to whom it grew suddenly empty. She
wished, if it could be done unknown to her father, that Charles's room
might be kept as he had left it. Madame Grandet and Nanon were willing
accomplices in this /statu quo/.

"Who knows but he may come back sooner than we think for?" she said.

"Ah, don't I wish I could see him back!" answered Nanon. "I took to
him! He was such a dear, sweet young man,--pretty too, with his curly
hair." Eugenie looked at Nanon. "Holy Virgin! don't look at me that
way, mademoiselle; your eyes are like those of a lost soul."

From that day the beauty of Mademoiselle Grandet took a new character.
The solemn thoughts of love which slowly filled her soul, and the
dignity of the woman beloved, gave to her features an illumination
such as painters render by a halo. Before the coming of her cousin,
Eugenie might be compared to the Virgin before the conception; after
he had gone, she was like the Virgin Mother,--she had given birth to
love. These two Marys so different, so well represented by Spanish
art, embody one of those shining symbols with which Christianity
abounds.

Returning from Mass on the morning after Charles's departure,--having
made a vow to hear it daily,--Eugenie bought a map of the world, which
she nailed up beside her looking-glass, that she might follow her
cousin on his westward way, that she might put herself, were it ever
so little, day by day into the ship that bore him, and see him and ask
him a thousand questions,--"Art thou well? Dost thou suffer? Dost thou
think of me when the star, whose beauty and usefulness thou hast
taught me to know, shines upon thee?" In the mornings she sat pensive
beneath the walnut-tree, on the worm-eaten bench covered with gray
lichens, where they had said to each other so many precious things, so
many trifles, where they had built the pretty castles of their future
home. She thought of the future now as she looked upward to the bit of
sky which was all the high walls suffered her to see; then she turned
her eyes to the angle where the sun crept on, and to the roof above
the room in which he had slept. Hers was the solitary love, the
persistent love, which glides into every thought and becomes the
substance, or, as our fathers might have said, the tissue of life.
When the would-be friends of Pere Grandet came in the evening for
their game at cards, she was gay and dissimulating; but all the
morning she talked of Charles with her mother and Nanon. Nanon had
brought herself to see that she could pity the sufferings of her young
mistress without failing in her duty to the old master, and she would
say to Eugenie,--

"If I had a man for myself I'd--I'd follow him to hell, yes, I'd
exterminate myself for him; but I've none. I shall die and never know
what life is. Would you believe, mamz'elle, that old Cornoiller (a
good fellow all the same) is always round my petticoats for the sake
of my money,--just for all the world like the rats who come smelling
after the master's cheese and paying court to you? I see it all; I've
got a shrewd eye, though I am as big as a steeple. Well, mamz'elle, it
pleases me, but it isn't love."

Two months went by. This domestic life, once so monotonous, was now
quickened with the intense interest of a secret that bound these women
intimately together. For them Charles lived and moved beneath the grim
gray rafters of the hall. Night and morning Eugenie opened the
dressing-case and gazed at the portrait of her aunt. One Sunday
morning her mother surprised her as she stood absorbed in finding her
cousin's features in his mother's face. Madame Grandet was then for
the first time admitted into the terrible secret of the exchange made
by Charles against her daughter's treasure.

"You gave him all!" cried the poor mother, terrified. "What will you
say to your father on New Year's Day when he asks to see your gold?"

Eugenie's eyes grew fixed, and the two women lived through mortal
terror for more than half the morning. They were so troubled in mind
that they missed high Mass, and only went to the military service. In
three days the year 1819 would come to an end. In three days a
terrible drama would begin, a bourgeois tragedy, without poison, or
dagger, or the spilling of blood; but--as regards the actors in it--
more cruel than all the fabled horrors in the family of the Atrides.

"What will become of us?" said Madame Grandet to her daughter, letting
her knitting fall upon her knees.

The poor mother had gone through such anxiety for the past two months
that the woollen sleeves which she needed for the coming winter were
not yet finished. This domestic fact, insignificant as it seems, bore
sad results. For want of those sleeves, a chill seized her in the
midst of a sweat caused by a terrible explosion of anger on the part
of her husband.

"I have been thinking, my poor child, that if you had confided your
secret to me we should have had time to write to Monsieur des Grassins
in Paris. He might have sent us gold pieces like yours; though Grandet
knows them all, perhaps--"

"Where could we have got the money?"

"I would have pledged my own property. Besides, Monsieur des Grassins
would have--"

"It is too late," said Eugenie in a broken, hollow voice. "To-morrow
morning we must go and wish him a happy New Year in his chamber."

"But, my daughter, why should I not consult the Cruchots?"

"No, no; it would be delivering me up to them, and putting ourselves
in their power. Besides, I have chosen my course. I have done right, I
repent of nothing. God will protect me. His will be done! Ah! mother,
if you had read his letter, you, too, would have thought only of him."

The next morning, January 1, 1820, the horrible fear to which mother
and daughter were a prey suggested to their minds a natural excuse by
which to escape the solemn entrance into Grandet's chamber. The winter
of 1819-1820 was one of the coldest of that epoch. The snow encumbered
the roofs.

Madame Grandet called to her husband as soon as she heard him stirring
in his chamber, and said,--

"Grandet, will you let Nanon light a fire here for me? The cold is so
sharp that I am freezing under the bedclothes. At my age I need some
comforts. Besides," she added, after a slight pause, "Eugenie shall
come and dress here; the poor child might get an illness from dressing
in her cold room in such weather. Then we will go and wish you a happy
New Year beside the fire in the hall."

"Ta, ta, ta, ta, what a tongue! a pretty way to begin the new year,
Madame Grandet! You never talked so much before; but you haven't been
sopping your bread in wine, I know that."

There was a moment's silence.

"Well," resumed the goodman, who no doubt had some reason of his own
for agreeing to his wife's request, "I'll do what you ask, Madame
Grandet. You are a good woman, and I don't want any harm to happen to
you at your time of life,--though as a general thing the Bertellieres
are as sound as a roach. Hein! isn't that so?" he added after a pause.
"Well, I forgive them; we got their property in the end." And he
coughed.

"You are very gay this morning, monsieur," said the poor woman
gravely.

"I'm always gay,--

  "'Gai, gai, gai, le tonnelier,
  Raccommodez votre cuvier!'"

he answered, entering his wife's room fully dressed. "Yes, on my word,
it is cold enough to freeze you solid. We shall have a fine breakfast,
wife. Des Grassins has sent me a pate-de-foie-gras truffled! I am
going now to get it at the coach-office. There'll be a double napoleon
for Eugenie in the package," he whispered in Madame Grandet's ear. "I
have no gold left, wife. I had a few stray pieces--I don't mind
telling you that--but I had to let them go in business."

Then, by way of celebrating the new year, he kissed her on the
forehead.

"Eugenie," cried the mother, when Grandet was fairly gone, "I don't
know which side of the bed your father got out of, but he is good-
tempered this morning. Perhaps we shall come out safe after all?"

"What's happened to the master?" said Nanon, entering her mistress's
room to light the fire. "First place, he said, 'Good-morning; happy
New Year, you big fool! Go and light my wife's fire, she's cold'; and
then, didn't I feel silly when he held out his hand and gave me a six-
franc piece, which isn't worn one bit? Just look at it, madame! Oh,
the kind man! He is a good man, that's a fact. There are some people
who the older they get the harder they grow; but he,--why he's getting
soft and improving with time, like your ratafia! He is a good, good
man--"

The secret of Grandet's joy lay in the complete success of his
speculation. Monsieur des Grassins, after deducting the amount which
the old cooper owed him for the discount on a hundred and fifty
thousand francs in Dutch notes, and for the surplus which he had
advanced to make up the sum required for the investment in the Funds
which was to produce a hundred thousand francs a year, had now sent
him, by the diligence, thirty thousand francs in silver coin, the
remainder of his first half-year's interest, informing him at the same
time that the Funds had already gone up in value. They were then
quoted at eighty-nine; the shrewdest capitalists bought in, towards
the last of January, at ninety-three. Grandet had thus gained in two
months twelve per cent on his capital; he had simplified his accounts,
and would in future receive fifty thousand francs interest every six
months, without incurring any taxes or costs for repairs. He
understood at last what it was to invest money in the public
securities,--a system for which provincials have always shown a marked
repugnance,--and at the end of five years he found himself master of a
capital of six millions, which increased without much effort of his
own, and which, joined to the value and proceeds of his territorial
possessions, gave him a fortune that was absolutely colossal. The six
francs bestowed on Nanon were perhaps the reward of some great service
which the poor servant had rendered to her master unawares.

"Oh! oh! where's Pere Grandet going? He has been scurrying about since
sunrise as if to a fire," said the tradespeople to each other as they
opened their shops for the day.

When they saw him coming back from the wharf, followed by a porter
from the coach-office wheeling a barrow which was laden with sacks,
they all had their comments to make:--

"Water flows to the river; the old fellow was running after his gold,"
said one.

"He gets it from Paris and Froidfond and Holland," said another.

"He'll end by buying up Saumur," cried a third.

"He doesn't mind the cold, he's so wrapped up in his gains," said a
wife to her husband.

"Hey! hey! Monsieur Grandet, if that's too heavy for you," said a
cloth-dealer, his nearest neighbor, "I'll take it off your hands."

"Heavy?" said the cooper, "I should think so; it's all sous!"

"Silver sous," said the porter in a low voice.

"If you want me to take care of you, keep your tongue between your
teeth," said the goodman to the porter as they reached the door.

"The old fox! I thought he was deaf; seems he can hear fast enough in
frosty weather."

"Here's twenty sous for your New Year, and /mum/!" said Grandet. "Be
off with you! Nanon shall take back your barrow. Nanon, are the
linnets at church?"

"Yes, monsieur."

"Then lend a hand! go to work!" he cried, piling the sacks upon her.
In a few moments all were carried up to his inner room, where he shut
himself in with them. "When breakfast is ready, knock on the wall," he
said as he disappeared. "Take the barrow back to the coach-office."

The family did not breakfast that day until ten o'clock.

"Your father will not ask to see your gold downstairs," said Madame
Grandet as they got back from Mass. "You must pretend to be very
chilly. We may have time to replace the treasure before your fete-
day."

Grandet came down the staircase thinking of his splendid speculation
in government securities, and wondering how he could metamorphose his
Parisian silver into solid gold; he was making up his mind to invest
in this way everything he could lay hands on until the Funds should
reach a par value. Fatal reverie for Eugenie! As soon as he came in,
the two women wished him a happy New Year,--his daughter by putting
her arms round his neck and caressing him; Madame Grandet gravely and
with dignity.

"Ha! ha! my child," he said, kissing his daughter on both cheeks. "I
work for you, don't you see? I think of your happiness. Must have
money to be happy. Without money there's not a particle of happiness.
Here! there's a new napoleon for you. I sent to Paris for it. On my
word of honor, it's all the gold I have; you are the only one that has
got any gold. I want to see your gold, little one."

"Oh! it is too cold; let us have breakfast," answered Eugenie.

"Well, after breakfast, then; it will help the digestion. That fat
des Grassins sent me the pate. Eat as much as you like, my children,
it costs nothing. Des Grassins is getting along very well. I am
satisfied with him. The old fish is doing Charles a good service, and
gratis too. He is making a very good settlement of that poor deceased
Grandet's business. Hoo! hoo!" he muttered, with his mouth full, after
a pause, "how good it is! Eat some, wife; that will feed you for at
least two days."

"I am not hungry. I am very poorly; you know that."

"Ah, bah! you can stuff yourself as full as you please without danger,
you're a Bertelliere; they are all hearty. You are a bit yellow,
that's true; but I like yellow, myself."

The expectation of ignominious and public death is perhaps less
horrible to a condemned criminal than the anticipation of what was
coming after breakfast to Madame Grandet and Eugenie. The more
gleefully the old man talked and ate, the more their hearts shrank
within them. The daughter, however, had an inward prop at this crisis,
--she gathered strength through love.

"For him! for him!" she cried within her, "I would die a thousand
deaths."

At this thought, she shot a glance at her mother which flamed with
courage.

"Clear away," said Grandet to Nanon when, about eleven o'clock,
breakfast was over, "but leave the table. We can spread your little
treasure upon it," he said, looking at Eugenie. "Little? Faith! no; it
isn't little. You possess, in actual value, five thousand nine hundred
and fifty-nine francs and the forty I gave you just now. That makes
six thousand francs, less one. Well, now see here, little one! I'll
give you that one franc to make up the round number. Hey! what are you
listening for, Nanon? Mind your own business; go and do your work."

Nanon disappeared.

"Now listen, Eugenie; you must give me back your gold. You won't
refuse your father, my little girl, hein?"

The two women were dumb.

"I have no gold myself. I had some, but it is all gone. I'll give you
in return six thousand francs in /livres/, and you are to put them
just where I tell you. You mustn't think anything more about your
'dozen.' When I marry you (which will be soon) I shall get you a
husband who can give you the finest 'dozen' ever seen in the
provinces. Now attend to me, little girl. There's a fine chance for
you; you can put your six thousand francs into government funds, and
you will receive every six months nearly two hundred francs interest,
without taxes, or repairs, or frost, or hail, or floods, or anything
else to swallow up the money. Perhaps you don't like to part with your
gold, hey, my girl? Never mind, bring it to me all the same. I'll get
you some more like it,--like those Dutch coins and the /portugaises/,
the rupees of Mogul, and the /genovines/,--I'll give you some more on
your fete-days, and in three years you'll have got back half your
little treasure. What's that you say? Look up, now. Come, go and get
it, the precious metal. You ought to kiss me on the eyelids for
telling you the secrets and the mysteries of the life and death of
money. Yes, silver and gold live and swarm like men; they come, and
go, and sweat, and multiply--"

Eugenie rose; but after making a few steps towards the door she turned
abruptly, looked her father in the face, and said,--

"I have not got /my/ gold."

"You have not got your gold!" cried Grandet, starting up erect, like a
horse that hears a cannon fired beside him.

"No, I have not got it."

"You are mistaken, Eugenie."

"No."

"By the shears of my father!"

Whenever the old man swore that oath the rafters trembled.

"Holy Virgin! Madame is turning pale," cried Nanon.

"Grandet, your anger will kill me," said the poor mother.

"Ta, ta, ta, ta! nonsense; you never die in your family! Eugenie, what
have you done with your gold?" he cried, rushing upon her.

"Monsieur," said the daughter, falling at Madame Grandet's knees, "my
mother is ill. Look at her; do not kill her."

Grandet was frightened by the pallor which overspread his wife's face,
usually so yellow.

"Nanon, help me to bed," said the poor woman in a feeble voice; "I am
dying--"

Nanon gave her mistress an arm, Eugenie gave her another; but it was
only with infinite difficulty that they could get her upstairs, she
fell with exhaustion at every step. Grandet remained alone. However,
in a few moments he went up six or eight stairs and called out,--

"Eugenie, when your mother is in bed, come down."

"Yes, father."

She soon came, after reassuring her mother.

"My daughter," said Grandet, "you will now tell me what you have done
with your gold."

"My father, if you make me presents of which I am not the sole
mistress, take them back," she answered coldly, picking up the
napoleon from the chimney-piece and offering it to him.

Grandet seized the coin and slipped it into his breeches' pocket.

"I shall certainly never give you anything again. Not so much as
that!" he said, clicking his thumb-nail against a front tooth. "Do you
dare to despise your father? have you no confidence in him? Don't you
know what a father is? If he is nothing for you, he is nothing at all.
Where is your gold?"

"Father, I love and respect you, in spite of your anger; but I humbly
ask you to remember that I am twenty-three years old. You have told me
often that I have attained my majority, and I do not forget it. I have
used my money as I chose to use it, and you may be sure that it was
put to a good use--"

"What use?"

"That is an inviolable secret," she answered. "Have you no secrets?"

"I am the head of the family; I have my own affairs."

"And this is mine."

"It must be something bad if you can't tell it to your father,
Mademoiselle Grandet."

"It is good, and I cannot tell it to my father."

"At least you can tell me when you parted with your gold?"

Eugenie made a negative motion with her head.

"You had it on your birthday, hein?"

She grew as crafty through love as her father was through avarice, and
reiterated the negative sign.

"Was there ever such obstinacy! It's a theft," cried Grandet, his
voice going up in a crescendo which gradually echoed through the
house. "What! here, in my own home, under my very eyes, somebody has
taken your gold!--the only gold we have!--and I'm not to know who has
got it! Gold is a precious thing. Virtuous girls go wrong sometimes,
and give--I don't know what; they do it among the great people, and
even among the bourgeoisie. But give their gold!--for you have given
it to some one, hein?--"

Eugenie was silent and impassive.

"Was there ever such a daughter? Is it possible that I am your father?
If you have invested it anywhere, you must have a receipt--"

"Was I free--yes or no--to do what I would with my own? Was it not
mine?"

"You are a child."

"Of age."

Dumbfounded by his daughter's logic, Grandet turned pale and stamped
and swore. When at last he found words, he cried: "Serpent! Cursed
girl! Ah, deceitful creature! You know I love you, and you take
advantage of it. She'd cut her father's throat! Good God! you've given
our fortune to that ne'er-do-well,--that dandy with morocco boots! By
the shears of my father! I can't disinherit you, but I curse you,--you
and your cousin and your children! Nothing good will come of it! Do
you hear? If it was to Charles--but, no; it's impossible. What! has
that wretched fellow robbed me?--"

He looked at his daughter, who continued cold and silent.

"She won't stir; she won't flinch! She's more Grandet than I'm
Grandet! Ha! you have not given your gold for nothing? Come, speak the
truth!"

Eugenie looked at her father with a sarcastic expression that stung
him.

"Eugenie, you are here, in my house,--in your father's house. If you
wish to stay here, you must submit yourself to me. The priests tell
you to obey me." Eugenie bowed her head. "You affront me in all I hold
most dear. I will not see you again until you submit. Go to your
chamber. You will stay there till I give you permission to leave it.
Nanon will bring you bread and water. You hear me--go!"

Eugenie burst into tears and fled up to her mother. Grandet, after
marching two or three times round the garden in the snow without
heeding the cold, suddenly suspected that his daughter had gone to her
mother; only too happy to find her disobedient to his orders, he
climbed the stairs with the agility of a cat and appeared in Madame
Grandet's room just as she was stroking Eugenie's hair, while the
girl's face was hidden in her motherly bosom.

"Be comforted, my poor child," she was saying; "your father will get
over it."

"She has no father!" said the old man. "Can it be you and I, Madame
Grandet, who have given birth to such a disobedient child? A fine
education,--religious, too! Well! why are you not in your chamber?
Come, to prison, to prison, mademoiselle!"

"Would you deprive me of my daughter, monsieur?" said Madame Grandet,
turning towards him a face that was now red with fever.

"If you want to keep her, carry her off! Clear out--out of my house,
both of you! Thunder! where is the gold? what's become of the gold?"

Eugenie rose, looked proudly at her father, and withdrew to her room.
Grandet turned the key of the door.

"Nanon," he cried, "put out the fire in the hall."

Then he sat down in an armchair beside his wife's fire and said to
her,--

"Undoubtedly she has given the gold to that miserable seducer,
Charles, who only wanted our money."

"I knew nothing about it," she answered, turning to the other side of
the bed, that she might escape the savage glances of her husband. "I
suffer so much from your violence that I shall never leave this room,
if I trust my own presentiments, till I am carried out of it in my
coffin. You ought to have spared me this suffering, monsieur,--you, to
whom I have caused no pain; that is, I think so. Your daughter loves
you. I believe her to be as innocent as the babe unborn. Do not make
her wretched. Revoke your sentence. The cold is very severe; you may
give her some serious illness."

"I will not see her, neither will I speak to her. She shall stay in
her room, on bread and water, until she submits to her father. What
the devil! shouldn't a father know where the gold in his house has
gone to? She owned the only rupees in France, perhaps, and the Dutch
ducats and the /genovines/--"

"Monsieur, Eugenie is our only child; and even if she had thrown them
into the water--"

"Into the water!" cried her husband; "into the water! You are crazy,
Madame Grandet! What I have said is said; you know that well enough.
If you want peace in this household, make your daughter confess, pump
it out of her. Women understand how to do that better than we do.
Whatever she has done, I sha'n't eat her. Is she afraid of me? Even if
she has plastered Charles with gold from head to foot, he is on the
high seas, and nobody can get at him, hein!"

"But, monsieur--" Excited by the nervous crisis through which she had
passed, and by the fate of her daughter, which brought forth all her
tenderness and all her powers of mind, Madame Grandet suddenly
observed a frightful movement of her husband's wen, and, in the very
act of replying, she changed her speech without changing the tones of
her voice,--"But, monsieur, I have not more influence over her than
you have. She has said nothing to me; she takes after you."

"Tut, tut! Your tongue is hung in the middle this morning. Ta, ta, ta,
ta! You are setting me at defiance, I do believe. I daresay you are in
league with her."

He looked fixedly at his wife.

"Monsieur Grandet, if you wish to kill me, you have only to go on like
this. I tell you, monsieur,--and if it were to cost me my life, I
would say it,--you do wrong by your daughter; she is more in the right
than you are. That money belonged to her; she is incapable of making
any but a good use of it, and God alone has the right to know our good
deeds. Monsieur, I implore you, take Eugenie back into favor; forgive
her. If you will do this you will lessen the injury your anger has
done me; perhaps you will save my life. My daughter! oh, monsieur,
give me back my daughter!"

"I shall decamp," he said; "the house is not habitable. A mother and
daughter talking and arguing like that! Broooouh! Pouah! A fine New
Year's present you've made me, Eugenie," he called out. "Yes, yes, cry
away! What you've done will bring you remorse, do you hear? What's the
good of taking the sacrament six times every three months, if you give
away your father's gold secretly to an idle fellow who'll eat your
heart out when you've nothing else to give him? You'll find out some
day what your Charles is worth, with his morocco boots and
supercilious airs. He has got neither heart nor soul if he dared to
carry off a young girl's treasure without the consent of her parents."

When the street-door was shut, Eugenie came out of her room and went
to her mother.

"What courage you have had for your daughter's sake!" she said.

"Ah! my child, see where forbidden things may lead us. You forced me
to tell a lie."

"I will ask God to punish only me."

"Is it true," cried Nanon, rushing in alarmed, "that mademoiselle is
to be kept on bread and water for the rest of her life?"

"What does that signify, Nanon?" said Eugenie tranquilly.

"Goodness! do you suppose I'll eat /frippe/ when the daughter of the
house is eating dry bread? No, no!"

"Don't say a word about all this, Nanon," said Eugenie.

"I'll be as mute as a fish; but you'll see!"

*****

Grandet dined alone for the first time in twenty-four years.

"So you're a widower, monsieur," said Nanon; "it must be disagreeable
to be a widower with two women in the house."

"I did not speak to you. Hold your jaw, or I'll turn you off! What is
that I hear boiling in your saucepan on the stove?"

"It is grease I'm trying out."

"There will be some company to-night. Light the fire."

The Cruchots, Madame des Grassins, and her son arrived at the usual
hour of eight, and were surprised to see neither Madame Grandet nor
her daughter.

"My wife is not very well, and Eugenie is with her," said the old
wine-grower, whose face betrayed no emotion.

At the end of an hour spent in idle conversation, Madame des Grassins,
who had gone up to see Madame Grandet, came down, and every one
inquired,--

"How is Madame Grandet?"

"Not at all well," she answered; "her condition seems to me really
alarming. At her age you ought to take every precaution, Papa
Grandet."

"We'll see about it," said the old man in an absent way.

They all wished him good-night. When the Cruchots got into the street
Madame des Grassins said to them,--

"There is something going on at the Grandets. The mother is very ill
without her knowing it. The girl's eyes are red, as if she had been
crying all day. Can they be trying to marry her against her will?"

*****

When Grandet had gone to bed Nanon came softly to Eugenie's room in
her stockinged feet and showed her a pate baked in a saucepan.

"See, mademoiselle," said the good soul, "Cornoiller gave me a hare.
You eat so little that this pate will last you full a week; in such
frosty weather it won't spoil. You sha'n't live on dry bread, I'm
determined; it isn't wholesome."

"Poor Nanon!" said Eugenie, pressing her hand.

"I've made it downright good and dainty, and /he/ never found it out.
I bought the lard and the spices out of my six francs: I'm the
mistress of my own money"; and she disappeared rapidly, fancying she
heard Grandet.



XI

For several months the old wine-grower came constantly to his wife's
room at all hours of the day, without ever uttering his daughter's
name, or seeing her, or making the smallest allusion to her. Madame
Grandet did not leave her chamber, and daily grew worse. Nothing
softened the old man; he remained unmoved, harsh, and cold as a
granite rock. He continued to go and come about his business as usual;
but ceased to stutter, talked less, and was more obdurate in business
transactions than ever before. Often he made mistakes in adding up his
figures.

"Something is going on at the Grandets," said the Grassinists and the
Cruchotines.

"What has happened in the Grandet family?" became a fixed question
which everybody asked everybody else at the little evening-parties of
Saumur. Eugenie went to Mass escorted by Nanon. If Madame des Grassins
said a few words to her on coming out of church, she answered in an
evasive manner, without satisfying any curiosity. However, at the end
of two months, it became impossible to hide, either from the three
Cruchots or from Madame des Grassins, the fact that Eugenie was in
confinement. There came a moment when all pretexts failed to explain
her perpetual absence. Then, though it was impossible to discover by
whom the secret had been betrayed, all the town became aware that ever
since New Year's day Mademoiselle Grandet had been kept in her room
without fire, on bread and water, by her father's orders, and that
Nanon cooked little dainties and took them to her secretly at night.
It was even known that the young woman was not able to see or take
care of her mother, except at certain times when her father was out of
the house.

Grandet's conduct was severely condemned. The whole town outlawed him,
so to speak; they remembered his treachery, his hard-heartedness, and
they excommunicated him. When he passed along the streets, people
pointed him out and muttered at him. When his daughter came down the
winding street, accompanied by Nanon, on her way to Mass or Vespers,
the inhabitants ran to the windows and examined with intense curiosity
the bearing of the rich heiress and her countenance, which bore the
impress of angelic gentleness and melancholy. Her imprisonment and the
condemnation of her father were as nothing to her. Had she not a map
of the world, the little bench, the garden, the angle of the wall? Did
she not taste upon her lips the honey that love's kisses left there?
She was ignorant for a time that the town talked about her, just as
Grandet himself was ignorant of it. Pious and pure in heart before
God, her conscience and her love helped her to suffer patiently the
wrath and vengeance of her father.

One deep grief silenced all others. Her mother, that gentle, tender
creature, made beautiful by the light which shone from the inner to
the outer as she approached the tomb,--her mother was perishing from
day to day. Eugenie often reproached herself as the innocent cause of
the slow, cruel malady that was wasting her away. This remorse, though
her mother soothed it, bound her still closer to her love. Every
morning, as soon as her father left the house, she went to the bedside
of her mother, and there Nanon brought her breakfast. The poor girl,
sad, and suffering through the sufferings of her mother, would turn
her face to the old servant with a mute gesture, weeping, and yet not
daring to speak of her cousin. It was Madame Grandet who first found
courage to say,--

"Where is /he/? Why does /he/ not write?"

"Let us think about him, mother, but not speak of him. You are ill--
you, before all."

"All" meant "him."

"My child," said Madame Grandet, "I do not wish to live. God protects
me and enables me to look with joy to the end of my misery."

Every utterance of this woman was unfalteringly pious and Christian.
Sometimes, during the first months of the year, when her husband came
to breakfast with her and tramped up and down the room, she would say
to him a few religious words, always spoken with angelic sweetness,
yet with the firmness of a woman to whom approaching death lends a
courage she had lacked in life.

"Monsieur, I thank you for the interest you take in my health," she
would answer when he made some commonplace inquiry; "but if you really
desire to render my last moments less bitter and to ease my grief,
take back your daughter: be a Christian, a husband, and a father."

When he heard these words, Grandet would sit down by the bed with the
air of a man who sees the rain coming and quietly gets under the
shelter of a gateway till it is over. When these touching, tender, and
religious supplications had all been made, he would say,--

"You are rather pale to-day, my poor wife."

Absolute forgetfulness of his daughter seemed graven on his stony
brow, on his closed lips. He was unmoved by the tears which flowed
down the white cheeks of his unhappy wife as she listened to his
meaningless answers.

"May God pardon you," she said, "even as I pardon you! You will some
day stand in need of mercy."

Since Madame Grandet's illness he had not dared to make use of his
terrible "Ta, ta, ta, ta!" Yet, for all that, his despotic nature was
not disarmed by this angel of gentleness, whose ugliness day by day
decreased, driven out by the ineffable expression of moral qualities
which shone upon her face. She was all soul. The spirit of prayer
seemed to purify her and refine those homely features and make them
luminous. Who has not seen the phenomenon of a like transfiguration on
sacred faces where the habits of the soul have triumphed over the
plainest features, giving them that spiritual illumination whose light
comes from the purity and nobility of the inward thought? The
spectacle of this transformation wrought by the struggle which
consumed the last shreds of the human life of this woman, did somewhat
affect the old cooper, though feebly, for his nature was of iron; if
his language ceased to be contemptuous, an imperturbable silence,
which saved his dignity as master of the household, took its place and
ruled his conduct.

When the faithful Nanon appeared in the market, many quips and quirks
and complaints about the master whistled in her ears; but however
loudly public opinion condemned Monsieur Grandet, the old servant
defended him, for the honor of the family.

"Well!" she would say to his detractors, "don't we all get hard as we
grow old? Why shouldn't he get horny too? Stop telling lies.
Mademoiselle lives like a queen. She's alone, that's true; but she
likes it. Besides, my masters have good reasons."

At last, towards the end of spring, Madame Grandet, worn out by grief
even more than by illness, having failed, in spite of her prayers, to
reconcile the father and daughter, confided her secret troubles to the
Cruchots.

"Keep a girl of twenty-three on bread and water!" cried Monsieur de
Bonfons; "without any reason, too! Why, that constitutes wrongful
cruelty; she can contest, as much in as upon--"

"Come, nephew, spare us your legal jargon," said the notary. "Set your
mind at ease, madame; I will put a stop to such treatment to-morrow."

Eugenie, hearing herself mentioned, came out of her room.

"Gentlemen," she said, coming forward with a proud step, "I beg you
not to interfere in this matter. My father is master in his own house.
As long as I live under his roof I am bound to obey him. His conduct
is not subject to the approbation or the disapprobation of the world;
he is accountable to God only. I appeal to your friendship to keep
total silence in this affair. To blame my father is to attack our
family honor. I am much obliged to you for the interest you have shown
in me; you will do me an additional service if you will put a stop to
the offensive rumors which are current in the town, of which I am
accidentally informed."

"She is right," said Madame Grandet.

"Mademoiselle, the best way to stop such rumors is to procure your
liberty," answered the old notary respectfully, struck with the beauty
which seclusion, melancholy, and love had stamped upon her face.

"Well, my daughter, let Monsieur Cruchot manage the matter if he is so
sure of success. He understands your father, and how to manage him. If
you wish to see me happy for my few remaining days, you must, at any
cost, be reconciled to your father."

On the morrow Grandet, in pursuance of a custom he had begun since
Eugenie's imprisonment, took a certain number of turns up and down the
little garden; he had chosen the hour when Eugenie brushed and
arranged her hair. When the old man reached the walnut-tree he hid
behind its trunk and remained for a few moments watching his
daughter's movements, hesitating, perhaps, between the course to which
the obstinacy of his character impelled him and his natural desire to
embrace his child. Sometimes he sat down on the rotten old bench where
Charles and Eugenie had vowed eternal love; and then she, too, looked
at her father secretly in the mirror before which she stood. If he
rose and continued his walk, she sat down obligingly at the window and
looked at the angle of the wall where the pale flowers hung, where the
Venus-hair grew from the crevices with the bindweed and the sedum,--a
white or yellow stone-crop very abundant in the vineyards of Saumur
and at Tours. Maitre Cruchot came early, and found the old wine-grower
sitting in the fine June weather on the little bench, his back against
the division wall of the garden, engaged in watching his daughter.

"What may you want, Maitre Cruchot?" he said, perceiving the notary.

"I came to speak to you on business."

"Ah! ah! have you brought some gold in exchange for my silver?"

"No, no, I have not come about money; it is about your daughter
Eugenie. All the town is talking of her and you."

"What does the town meddle for? A man's house is his castle."

"Very true; and a man may kill himself if he likes, or, what is worse,
he may fling his money into the gutter."

"What do you mean?"

"Why, your wife is very ill, my friend. You ought to consult Monsieur
Bergerin; she is likely to die. If she does die without receiving
proper care, you will not be very easy in mind, I take it."

"Ta, ta, ta, ta! you know a deal about my wife! These doctors, if they
once get their foot in your house, will come five and six times a
day."

"Of course you will do as you think best. We are old friends; there is
no one in all Saumur who takes more interest than I in what concerns
you. Therefore, I was bound to tell you this. However, happen what
may, you have the right to do as you please; you can choose your own
course. Besides, that is not what brings me here. There is another
thing which may have serious results for you. After all, you can't
wish to kill your wife; her life is too important to you. Think of
your situation in connection with your daughter if Madame Grandet
dies. You must render an account to Eugenie, because you enjoy your
wife's estate only during her lifetime. At her death your daughter can
claim a division of property, and she may force you to sell Froidfond.
In short, she is her mother's heir, and you are not."

These words fell like a thunderbolt on the old man, who was not as
wise about law as he was about business. He had never thought of a
legal division of the estate.

"Therefore I advise you to treat her kindly," added Cruchot, in
conclusion.

"But do you know what she has done, Cruchot?"

"What?" asked the notary, curious to hear the truth and find out the
cause of the quarrel.

"She has given away her gold!"

"Well, wasn't it hers?" said the notary.

"They all tell me that!" exclaimed the old man, letting his arms fall
to his sides with a movement that was truly tragic.

"Are you going--for a mere nothing,"--resumed Cruchot, "to put
obstacles in the way of the concessions which you will be obliged to
ask from your daughter as soon as her mother dies?"

"Do you call six thousand francs a mere nothing?"

"Hey! my old friend, do you know what the inventory of your wife's
property will cost, if Eugenie demands the division?"

"How much?"

"Two, three, four thousand francs, perhaps! The property would have to
be put up at auction and sold, to get at its actual value. Instead of
that, if you are on good terms with--"

"By the shears of my father!" cried Grandet, turning pale as he
suddenly sat down, "we will see about it, Cruchot."

After a moment's silence, full of anguish perhaps, the old man looked
at the notary and said,--

"Life is very hard! It has many griefs! Cruchot," he continued
solemnly, "you would not deceive me? Swear to me upon your honor that
all you've told me is legally true. Show me the law; I must see the
law!"

"My poor friend," said the notary, "don't I know my own business?"

"Then it is true! I am robbed, betrayed, killed, destroyed by my own
daughter!"

"It is true that your daughter is her mother's heir."

"Why do we have children? Ah! my wife, I love her! Luckily she's sound
and healthy; she's a Bertelliere."

"She has not a month to live."

Grandet struck his forehead, went a few steps, came back, cast a
dreadful look on Cruchot, and said,--

"What can be done?"

"Eugenie can relinquish her claim to her mother's property. Should she
do this you would not disinherit her, I presume?--but if you want to
come to such a settlement, you must not treat her harshly. What I am
telling you, old man, is against my own interests. What do I live by,
if it isn't liquidations, inventories, conveyances, divisions of
property?--"

"We'll see, we'll see! Don't let's talk any more about it, Cruchot; it
wrings my vitals. Have you received any gold?"

"No; but I have a few old louis, a dozen or so, which you may have. My
good friend, make it up with Eugenie. Don't you know all Saumur is
pelting you with stones?"

"The scoundrels!"

"Come, the Funds are at ninety-nine. Do be satisfied for once in your
life."

"At ninety-nine! Are they, Cruchot?"

"Yes."

"Hey, hey! Ninety-nine!" repeated the old man, accompanying the notary
to the street-door. Then, too agitated by what he had just heard to
stay in the house, he went up to his wife's room and said,--

"Come, mother, you may have your daughter to spend the day with you.
I'm going to Froidfond. Enjoy yourselves, both of you. This is our
wedding-day, wife. See! here are sixty francs for your altar at the
Fete-Dieu; you've wanted one for a long time. Come, cheer up, enjoy
yourself, and get well! Hurrah for happiness!"

He threw ten silver pieces of six francs each upon the bed, and took
his wife's head between his hands and kissed her forehead.

"My good wife, you are getting well, are not you?"

"How can you think of receiving the God of mercy in your house when
you refuse to forgive your daughter?" she said with emotion.

"Ta, ta, ta, ta!" said Grandet in a coaxing voice. "We'll see about
that."

"Merciful heaven! Eugenie," cried the mother, flushing with joy, "come
and kiss your father; he forgives you!"

But the old man had disappeared. He was going as fast as his legs
could carry him towards his vineyards, trying to get his confused
ideas into order. Grandet had entered his seventy-sixth year. During
the last two years his avarice had increased upon him, as all the
persistent passions of men increase at a certain age. As if to
illustrate an observation which applies equally to misers, ambitious
men, and others whose lives are controlled by any dominant idea, his
affections had fastened upon one special symbol of his passion. The
sight of gold, the possession of gold, had become a monomania. His
despotic spirit had grown in proportion to his avarice, and to part
with the control of the smallest fraction of his property at the death
of his wife seemed to him a thing "against nature." To declare his
fortune to his daughter, to give an inventory of his property, landed
and personal, for the purposes of division--

"Why," he cried aloud in the midst of a field where he was pretending
to examine a vine, "it would be cutting my throat!"

He came at last to a decision, and returned to Saumur in time for
dinner, resolved to unbend to Eugenie, and pet and coax her, that he
might die regally, holding the reins of his millions in his own hands
so long as the breath was in his body. At the moment when the old man,
who chanced to have his pass-key in his pocket, opened the door and
climbed with a stealthy step up the stairway to go into his wife's
room, Eugenie had brought the beautiful dressing-case from the oak
cabinet and placed it on her mother's bed. Mother and daughter, in
Grandet's absence, allowed themselves the pleasure of looking for a
likeness to Charles in the portrait of his mother.

"It is exactly his forehead and his mouth," Eugenie was saying as the
old man opened the door. At the look which her husband cast upon the
gold, Madame Grandet cried out,--

"O God, have pity upon us!"

The old man sprang upon the box as a famished tiger might spring upon
a sleeping child.

"What's this?" he said, snatching the treasure and carrying it to the
window. "Gold, good gold!" he cried. "All gold,--it weighs two pounds!
Ha, ha! Charles gave you that for your money, did he? Hein! Why didn't
you tell me so? It was a good bargain, little one! Yes, you are my
daughter, I see that--" Eugenie trembled in every limb. "This came
from Charles, of course, didn't it?" continued the old man.

"Yes, father; it is not mine. It is a sacred trust."

"Ta, ta, ta, ta! He took your fortune, and now you can get it back."

"Father!"

Grandet took his knife to pry out some of the gold; to do this, he
placed the dressing-case on a chair. Eugenie sprang forward to recover
it; but her father, who had his eye on her and on the treasure too,
pushed her back so violently with a thrust of his arm that she fell
upon her mother's bed.

"Monsieur, monsieur!" cried the mother, lifting herself up.

Grandet had opened his knife, and was about to apply it to the gold.

"Father!" cried Eugenie, falling on her knees and dragging herself
close to him with clasped hands, "father, in the name of all the
saints and the Virgin! in the name of Christ who died upon the cross!
in the name of your eternal salvation, father! for my life's sake,
father!--do not touch that! It is neither yours nor mine. It is a
trust placed in my hands by an unhappy relation: I must give it back
to him uninjured!"

"If it is a trust, why were you looking at it? To look at it is as bad
as touching it."

"Father, don't destroy it, or you will disgrace me! Father, do you
hear?"

"Oh, have pity!" said the mother.

"Father!" cried Eugenie in so startling a voice that Nanon ran
upstairs terrified. Eugenie sprang upon a knife that was close at
hand.

"Well, what now?" said Grandet coldly, with a callous smile.

"Oh, you are killing me!" said the mother.

"Father, if your knife so much as cuts a fragment of that gold, I will
stab myself with this one! You have already driven my mother to her
death; you will now kill your child! Do as you choose! Wound for
wound!"

Grandet held his knife over the dressing-case and hesitated as he
looked at his daughter.

"Are you capable of doing it, Eugenie?" he said.

"Yes, yes!" said the mother.

"She'll do it if she says so!" cried Nanon. "Be reasonable, monsieur,
for once in your life."

The old man looked at the gold and then at his daughter alternately
for an instant. Madame Grandet fainted.

"There! don't you see, monsieur, that madame is dying?" cried Nanon.

"Come, come, my daughter, we won't quarrel for a box! Here, take it!"
he cried hastily, flinging the case upon the bed. "Nanon, go and fetch
Monsieur Bergerin! Come, mother," said he, kissing his wife's hand,
"it's all over! There! we've made up--haven't we, little one? No more
dry bread; you shall have all you want--Ah, she opens her eyes! Well,
mother, little mother, come! See, I'm kissing Eugenie! She loves her
cousin, and she may marry him if she wants to; she may keep his case.
But don't die, mother; live a long time yet, my poor wife! Come, try
to move! Listen! you shall have the finest altar that ever was made in
Saumur."

"Oh, how can you treat your wife and daughter so!" said Madame Grandet
in a feeble voice.

"I won't do so again, never again," cried her husband; "you shall see,
my poor wife!" He went to his inner room and returned with a handful
of louis, which he scattered on the bed. "Here, Eugenie! see, wife!
all these are for you," he said, fingering the coins. "Come, be happy,
wife! feel better, get well; you sha'n't want for anything, nor
Eugenie either. Here's a hundred /louis d'or/ for her. You won't give
these away, will you, Eugenie, hein?"

Madame Grandet and her daughter looked at each other in astonishment.

"Take back your money, father; we ask for nothing but your affection."

"Well, well, that's right!" he said, pocketing the coins; "let's be
good friends! We will all go down to dinner to-day, and we'll play
loto every evening for two sous. You shall both be happy. Hey, wife?"

"Alas! I wish I could, if it would give you pleasure," said the dying
woman; "but I cannot rise from my bed."

"Poor mother," said Grandet, "you don't know how I love you! and you
too, my daughter!" He took her in his arms and kissed her. "Oh, how
good it is to kiss a daughter when we have been angry with her! There,
mother, don't you see it's all over now? Go and put that away,
Eugenie," he added, pointing to the case. "Go, don't be afraid! I
shall never speak of it again, never!"

Monsieur Bergerin, the celebrated doctor of Saumur, presently arrived.
After an examination, he told Grandet positively that his wife was
very ill; but that perfect peace of mind, a generous diet, and great
care might prolong her life until the autumn.

"Will all that cost much?" said the old man. "Will she need
medicines?"

"Not much medicine, but a great deal of care," answered the doctor,
who could scarcely restrain a smile.

"Now, Monsieur Bergerin," said Grandet, "you are a man of honor, are
not you? I trust to you! Come and see my wife how and when you think
necessary. Save my good wife! I love her,--don't you see?--though I
never talk about it; I keep things to myself. I'm full of trouble.
Troubles began when my brother died; I have to spend enormous sums on
his affairs in Paris. Why, I'm paying through my nose; there's no end
to it. Adieu, monsieur! If you can save my wife, save her. I'll spare
no expense, not even if it costs me a hundred or two hundred francs."

In spite of Grandet's fervent wishes for the health of his wife, whose
death threatened more than death to him; in spite of the consideration
he now showed on all occasions for the least wish of his astonished
wife and daughter; in spite of the tender care which Eugenie lavished
upon her mother,--Madame Grandet rapidly approached her end. Every day
she grew weaker and wasted visibly, as women of her age when attacked
by serious illness are wont to do. She was fragile as the foliage in
autumn; the radiance of heaven shone through her as the sun strikes
athwart the withering leaves and gilds them. It was a death worthy of
her life,--a Christian death; and is not that sublime? In the month of
October, 1822, her virtues, her angelic patience, her love for her
daughter, seemed to find special expression; and then she passed away
without a murmur. Lamb without spot, she went to heaven, regretting
only the sweet companion of her cold and dreary life, for whom her
last glance seemed to prophesy a destiny of sorrows. She shrank from
leaving her ewe-lamb, white as herself, alone in the midst of a
selfish world that sought to strip her of her fleece and grasp her
treasures.

"My child," she said as she expired, "there is no happiness except in
heaven; you will know it some day."



XII

On the morrow of this death Eugenie felt a new motive for attachment
to the house in which she was born, where she had suffered so much,
where her mother had just died. She could not see the window and the
chair on its castors without weeping. She thought she had mistaken the
heart of her old father when she found herself the object of his
tenderest cares. He came in the morning and gave her his arm to take
her to breakfast; he looked at her for hours together with an eye that
was almost kind; he brooded over her as though she had been gold. The
old man was so unlike himself, he trembled so often before his
daughter, that Nanon and the Cruchotines, who witnessed his weakness,
attributed it to his great age, and feared that his faculties were
giving away. But the day on which the family put on their mourning,
and after dinner, to which meal Maitre Cruchot (the only person who
knew his secret) had been invited, the conduct of the old miser was
explained.

"My dear child," he said to Eugenie when the table had been cleared
and the doors carefully shut, "you are now your mother's heiress, and
we have a few little matters to settle between us. Isn't that so,
Cruchot?"

"Yes."

"Is it necessary to talk of them to-day, father?"

"Yes, yes, little one; I can't bear the uncertainty in which I'm
placed. I think you don't want to give me pain?"

"Oh! father--"

"Well, then! let us settle it all to-night."

"What is it you wish me to do?"

"My little girl, it is not for me to say. Tell her, Cruchot."

"Mademoiselle, your father does not wish to divide the property, nor
sell the estate, nor pay enormous taxes on the ready money which he
may possess. Therefore, to avoid all this, he must be released from
making the inventory of his whole fortune, part of which you inherit
from your mother, and which is now undivided between you and your
father--"

"Cruchot, are you quite sure of what you are saying before you tell it
to a mere child?"

"Let me tell it my own way, Grandet."

"Yes, yes, my friend. Neither you nor my daughter wish to rob me,--do
you, little one?"

"But, Monsieur Cruchot, what am I to do?" said Eugenie impatiently.

"Well," said the notary, "it is necessary to sign this deed, by which
you renounce your rights to your mother's estate and leave your father
the use and disposition, during his lifetime, of all the property
undivided between you, of which he guarantees you the capital."

"I do not understand a word of what you are saying," returned Eugenie;
"give me the deed, and show me where I am to sign it."

Pere Grandet looked alternately at the deed and at his daughter, at
his daughter and at the deed, undergoing as he did so such violent
emotion that he wiped the sweat from his brow.

"My little girl," he said, "if, instead of signing this deed, which
will cost a great deal to record, you would simply agree to renounce
your rights as heir to your poor dear, deceased mother's property, and
would trust to me for the future, I should like it better. In that
case I will pay you monthly the good round sum of a hundred francs.
See, now, you could pay for as many masses as you want for anybody--
Hein! a hundred francs a month--in /livres/?"

"I will do all you wish, father."

"Mademoiselle," said the notary, "it is my duty to point out to you
that you are despoiling yourself without guarantee--"

"Good heavens! what is all that to me?"

"Hold your tongue, Cruchot! It's settled, all settled," cried Grandet,
taking his daughter's hand and striking it with his own. "Eugenie, you
won't go back on your word?--you are an honest girl, hein?"

"Oh! father!--"

He kissed her effusively, and pressed her in his arms till he almost
choked her.

"Go, my good child, you restore your father's life; but you only
return to him that which he gave you: we are quits. This is how
business should be done. Life is a business. I bless you! you are a
virtuous girl, and you love your father. Do just what you like in
future. To-morrow, Cruchot," he added, looking at the horrified
notary, "you will see about preparing the deed of relinquishment, and
then enter it on the records of the court."

The next morning Eugenie signed the papers by which she herself
completed her spoliation. At the end of the first year, however, in
spite of his bargain, the old man had not given his daughter one sou
of the hundred francs he had so solemnly pledged to her. When Eugenie
pleasantly reminded him of this, he could not help coloring, and went
hastily to his secret hiding-place, from whence he brought down about
a third of the jewels he had taken from his nephew, and gave them to
her.

"There, little one," he said in a sarcastic tone, "do you want those
for your twelve hundred francs?"

"Oh! father, truly? will you really give them to me?"

"I'll give you as many more next year," he said, throwing them into
her apron. "So before long you'll get all his gewgaws," he added,
rubbing his hands, delighted to be able to speculate on his daughter's
feelings.

Nevertheless, the old man, though still robust, felt the importance of
initiating his daughter into the secrets of his thrift and its
management. For two consecutive years he made her order the household
meals in his presence and receive the rents, and he taught her slowly
and successively the names and remunerative capacity of his vineyards
and his farms. About the third year he had so thoroughly accustomed
her to his avaricious methods that they had turned into the settled
habits of her own life, and he was able to leave the household keys in
her charge without anxiety, and to install her as mistress of the
house.

Five years passed away without a single event to relieve the
monotonous existence of Eugenie and her father. The same actions were
performed daily with the automatic regularity of clockwork. The deep
sadness of Mademoiselle Grandet was known to every one; but if others
surmised the cause, she herself never uttered a word that justified
the suspicions which all Saumur entertained about the state of the
rich heiress's heart. Her only society was made up of the three
Cruchots and a few of their particular friends whom they had, little
by little, introduced into the Grandet household. They had taught her
to play whist, and they came every night for their game. During the
year 1827 her father, feeling the weight of his infirmities, was
obliged to initiate her still further into the secrets of his landed
property, and told her that in case of difficulty she was to have
recourse to Maitre Cruchot, whose integrity was well known to him.

Towards the end of this year the old man, then eighty-two, was seized
by paralysis, which made rapid progress. Dr. Bergerin gave him up.
Eugenie, feeling that she was about to be left alone in the world,
came, as it were, nearer to her father, and clasped more tightly this
last living link of affection. To her mind, as in that of all loving
women, love was the whole of life. Charles was not there, and she
devoted all her care and attention to the old father, whose faculties
had begun to weaken, though his avarice remained instinctively acute.
The death of this man offered no contrast to his life. In the morning
he made them roll him to a spot between the chimney of his chamber and
the door of the secret room, which was filled, no doubt, with gold. He
asked for an explanation of every noise he heard, even the slightest;
to the great astonishment of the notary, he even heard the watch-dog
yawning in the court-yard. He woke up from his apparent stupor at the
day and hour when the rents were due, or when accounts had to be
settled with his vine-dressers, and receipts given. At such times he
worked his chair forward on its castors until he faced the door of the
inner room. He made his daughter open it, and watched while she placed
the bags of money one upon another in his secret receptacles and
relocked the door. Then she returned silently to her seat, after
giving him the key, which he replaced in his waistcoat pocket and
fingered from time to time. His old friend the notary, feeling sure
that the rich heiress would inevitably marry his nephew the president,
if Charles Grandet did not return, redoubled all his attentions; he
came every day to take Grandet's orders, went on his errands to
Froidfond, to the farms and the fields and the vineyards, sold the
vintages, and turned everything into gold and silver, which found
their way in sacks to the secret hiding-place.

At length the last struggle came, in which the strong frame of the old
man slowly yielded to destruction. He was determined to sit at the
chimney-corner facing the door of the secret room. He drew off and
rolled up all the coverings which were laid over him, saying to Nanon,
"Put them away, lock them up, for fear they should be stolen."

So long as he could open his eyes, in which his whole being had now
taken refuge, he turned them to the door behind which lay his
treasures, saying to his daughter, "Are they there? are they there?"
in a tone of voice which revealed a sort of panic fear.

"Yes, my father," she would answer.

"Take care of the gold--put gold before me."

Eugenie would then spread coins on a table before him, and he would
sit for hours together with his eyes fixed upon them, like a child
who, at the moment it first begins to see, gazes in stupid
contemplation at the same object, and like the child, a distressful
smile would flicker upon his face.

"It warms me!" he would sometimes say, as an expression of beatitude
stole across his features.

When the cure of the parish came to administer the last sacraments,
the old man's eyes, sightless, apparently, for some hours, kindled at
the sight of the cross, the candlesticks, and the holy-water vessel of
silver; he gazed at them fixedly, and his wen moved for the last time.
When the priest put the crucifix of silver-gilt to his lips, that he
might kiss the Christ, he made a frightful gesture, as if to seize it;
and that last effort cost him his life. He called Eugenie, whom he did
not see, though she was kneeling beside him bathing with tears his
stiffening hand, which was already cold.

"My father, bless me!" she entreated.

"Take care of it all. You will render me an account yonder!" he said,
proving by these last words that Christianity must always be the
religion of misers.

*****

Eugenie Grandet was now alone in the world in that gray house, with
none but Nanon to whom she could turn with the certainty of being
heard and understood,--Nanon the sole being who loved her for herself
and with whom she could speak of her sorrows. La Grande Nanon was a
providence for Eugenie. She was not a servant, but a humble friend.
After her father's death Eugenie learned from Maitre Cruchot that she
possessed an income of three hundred thousand francs from landed and
personal property in the arrondissement of Saumur; also six millions
invested at three per cent in the Funds (bought at sixty, and now
worth seventy-six francs); also two millions in gold coin, and a
hundred thousand francs in silver crown-pieces, besides all the
interest which was still to be collected. The sum total of her
property reached seventeen millions.

"Where is my cousin?" was her one thought.

The day on which Maitre Cruchot handed in to his client a clear and
exact schedule of the whole inheritance, Eugenie remained alone with
Nanon, sitting beside the fireplace in the vacant hall, where all was
now a memory, from the chair on castors which her mother had sat in,
to the glass from which her cousin drank.

"Nanon, we are alone--"

"Yes, mademoiselle; and if I knew where he was, the darling, I'd go on
foot to find him."

"The ocean is between us," she said.

While the poor heiress wept in company of an old servant, in that cold
dark house, which was to her the universe, the whole province rang,
from Nantes to Orleans, with the seventeen millions of Mademoiselle
Grandet. Among her first acts she had settled an annuity of twelve
hundred francs on Nanon, who, already possessed of six hundred more,
became a rich and enviable match. In less than a month that good soul
passed from single to wedded life under the protection of Antoine
Cornoiller, who was appointed keeper of all Mademoiselle Grandet's
estates. Madame Cornoiller possessed one striking advantage over her
contemporaries. Although she was fifty-nine years of age, she did not
look more than forty. Her strong features had resisted the ravages of
time. Thanks to the healthy customs of her semi-conventual life, she
laughed at old age from the vantage-ground of a rosy skin and an iron
constitution. Perhaps she never looked as well in her life as she did
on her marriage-day. She had all the benefits of her ugliness, and was
big and fat and strong, with a look of happiness on her indestructible
features which made a good many people envy Cornoiller.

"Fast colors!" said the draper.

"Quite likely to have children," said the salt merchant. "She's
pickled in brine, saving your presence."

"She is rich, and that fellow Cornoiller has done a good thing for
himself," said a third man.

When she came forth from the old house on her way to the parish
church, Nanon, who was loved by all the neighborhood, received many
compliments as she walked down the tortuous street. Eugenie had given
her three dozen silver forks and spoons as a wedding present.
Cornoiller, amazed at such magnificence, spoke of his mistress with
tears in his eyes; he would willingly have been hacked in pieces in
her behalf. Madame Cornoiller, appointed housekeeper to Mademoiselle
Grandet, got as much happiness out of her new position as she did from
the possession of a husband. She took charge of the weekly accounts;
she locked up the provisions and gave them out daily, after the manner
of her defunct master; she ruled over two servants,--a cook, and a
maid whose business it was to mend the house-linen and make
mademoiselle's dresses. Cornoiller combined the functions of keeper
and bailiff. It is unnecessary to say that the women-servants selected
by Nanon were "perfect treasures." Mademoiselle Grandet thus had four
servants, whose devotion was unbounded. The farmers perceived no
change after Monsieur Grandet's death; the usages and customs he had
sternly established were scrupulously carried out by Monsieur and
Madame Cornoiller.

At thirty years of age Eugenie knew none of the joys of life. Her
pale, sad childhood had glided on beside a mother whose heart, always
misunderstood and wounded, had known only suffering. Leaving this life
joyfully, the mother pitied the daughter because she still must live;
and she left in her child's soul some fugitive remorse and many
lasting regrets. Eugenie's first and only love was a wellspring of
sadness within her. Meeting her lover for a few brief days, she had
given him her heart between two kisses furtively exchanged; then he
had left her, and a whole world lay between them. This love, cursed by
her father, had cost the life of her mother and brought her only
sorrow, mingled with a few frail hopes. Thus her upward spring towards
happiness had wasted her strength and given her nothing in exchange
for it. In the life of the soul, as in the physical life, there is an
inspiration and a respiration; the soul needs to absorb the sentiments
of another soul and assimilate them, that it may render them back
enriched. Were it not for this glorious human phenomenon, there would
be no life for the heart; air would be wanting; it would suffer, and
then perish. Eugenie had begun to suffer. For her, wealth was neither
a power nor a consolation; she could not live except through love,
through religion, through faith in the future. Love explained to her
the mysteries of eternity. Her heart and the Gospel taught her to know
two worlds; she bathed, night and day, in the depths of two infinite
thoughts, which for her may have had but one meaning. She drew back
within herself, loving, and believing herself beloved. For seven years
her passion had invaded everything. Her treasuries were not the
millions whose revenues were rolling up; they were Charles's dressing-
case, the portraits hanging above her bed, the jewels recovered from
her father and proudly spread upon a bed of wool in a drawer of the
oaken cabinet, the thimble of her aunt, used for a while by her
mother, which she wore religiously as she worked at a piece of
embroidery,--a Penelope's web, begun for the sole purpose of putting
upon her finger that gold so rich in memories.

It seemed unlikely that Mademoiselle Grandet would marry during the
period of her mourning. Her genuine piety was well known. Consequently
the Cruchots, whose policy was sagely guided by the old abbe,
contented themselves for the time being with surrounding the great
heiress and paying her the most affectionate attentions. Every evening
the hall was filled with a party of devoted Cruchotines, who sang the
praises of its mistress in every key. She had her doctor in ordinary,
her grand almoner, her chamberlain, her first lady of honor, her prime
minister; above all, her chancellor, a chancellor who would fain have
said much to her. If the heiress had wished for a train-bearer, one
would instantly have been found. She was a queen, obsequiously
flattered. Flattery never emanates from noble souls; it is the gift of
little minds, who thus still further belittle themselves to worm their
way into the vital being of the persons around whom they crawl.
Flattery means self-interest. So the people who, night after night,
assembled in Mademoiselle Grandet's house (they called her
Mademoiselle de Froidfond) outdid each other in expressions of
admiration. This concert of praise, never before bestowed upon
Eugenie, made her blush under its novelty; but insensibly her ear
became habituated to the sound, and however coarse the compliments
might be, she soon was so accustomed to hear her beauty lauded that if
any new-comer had seemed to think her plain, she would have felt the
reproach far more than she might have done eight years earlier. She
ended at last by loving the incense, which she secretly laid at the
feet of her idol. By degrees she grew accustomed to be treated as a
sovereign and to see her court pressing around her every evening.

Monsieur de Bonfons was the hero of the little circle, where his wit,
his person, his education, his amiability, were perpetually praised.
One or another would remark that in seven years he had largely
increased his fortune, that Bonfons brought in at least ten thousand
francs a year, and was surrounded, like the other possessions of the
Cruchots, by the vast domains of the heiress.

"Do you know, mademoiselle," said an habitual visitor, "that the
Cruchots have an income of forty thousand francs among them!"

"And then, their savings!" exclaimed an elderly female Cruchotine,
Mademoiselle de Gribeaucourt.

"A gentleman from Paris has lately offered Monsieur Cruchot two
hundred thousand francs for his practice," said another. "He will sell
it if he is appointed /juge de paix/."

"He wants to succeed Monsieur de Bonfons as president of the Civil
courts, and is taking measures," replied Madame d'Orsonval. "Monsieur
le president will certainly be made councillor."

"Yes, he is a very distinguished man," said another,--"don't you think
so, mademoiselle?"

Monsieur de Bonfons endeavored to put himself in keeping with the role
he sought to play. In spite of his forty years, in spite of his dusky
and crabbed features, withered like most judicial faces, he dressed in
youthful fashions, toyed with a bamboo cane, never took snuff in
Mademoiselle de Froidfond's house, and came in a white cravat and a
shirt whose pleated frill gave him a family resemblance to the race of
turkeys. He addressed the beautiful heiress familiarly, and spoke of
her as "Our dear Eugenie." In short, except for the number of
visitors, the change from loto to whist, and the disappearance of
Monsieur and Madame Grandet, the scene was about the same as the one
with which this history opened. The pack were still pursuing Eugenie
and her millions; but the hounds, more in number, lay better on the
scent, and beset the prey more unitedly. If Charles could have dropped
from the Indian Isles, he would have found the same people and the
same interests. Madame des Grassins, to whom Eugenie was full of
kindness and courtesy, still persisted in tormenting the Cruchots.
Eugenie, as in former days, was the central figure of the picture; and
Charles, as heretofore, would still have been the sovereign of all.
Yet there had been some progress. The flowers which the president
formerly presented to Eugenie on her birthdays and fete-days had now
become a daily institution. Every evening he brought the rich heiress
a huge and magnificent bouquet, which Madame Cornoiller placed
conspicuously in a vase, and secretly threw into a corner of the
court-yard when the visitors had departed.

Early in the spring, Madame des Grassins attempted to trouble the
peace of the Cruchotines by talking to Eugenie of the Marquis de
Froidfond, whose ancient and ruined family might be restored if the
heiress would give him back his estates through marriage. Madame des
Grassins rang the changes on the peerage and the title of marquise,
until, mistaking Eugenie's disdainful smile for acquiescence, she went
about proclaiming that the marriage with "Monsieur Cruchot" was not
nearly as certain as people thought.

"Though Monsieur de Froidfond is fifty," she said, "he does not look
older than Monsieur Cruchot. He is a widower, and he has children,
that's true. But then he is a marquis; he will be peer of France; and
in times like these where you will find a better match? I know it for
a fact that Pere Grandet, when he put all his money into Froidfond,
intended to graft himself upon that stock; he often told me so. He was
a deep one, that old man!"

"Ah! Nanon," said Eugenie, one night as she was going to bed, "how is
it that in seven years he has never once written to me?"



XIII

While these events were happening in Saumur, Charles was making his
fortune in the Indies. His commercial outfit had sold well. He began
by realizing a sum of six thousand dollars. Crossing the line had
brushed a good many cobwebs out of his brain; he perceived that the
best means of attaining fortune in tropical regions, as well as in
Europe, was to buy and sell men. He went to the coast of Africa and
bought Negroes, combining his traffic in human flesh with that of
other merchandise equally advantageous to his interests. He carried
into this business an activity which left him not a moment of leisure.
He was governed by the desire of reappearing in Paris with all the
prestige of a large fortune, and by the hope of regaining a position
even more brilliant than the one from which he had fallen.

By dint of jostling with men, travelling through many lands, and
studying a variety of conflicting customs, his ideas had been modified
and had become sceptical. He ceased to have fixed principles of right
and wrong, for he saw what was called a crime in one country lauded as
a virtue in another. In the perpetual struggle of selfish interests
his heart grew cold, then contracted, and then dried up. The blood of
the Grandets did not fail of its destiny; Charles became hard, and
eager for prey. He sold Chinamen, Negroes, birds' nests, children,
artists; he practised usury on a large scale; the habit of defrauding
custom-houses soon made him less scrupulous about the rights of his
fellow men. He went to the Island of St. Thomas and bought, for a mere
song, merchandise that had been captured by pirates, and took it to
ports where he could sell it at a good price. If the pure and noble
face of Eugenie went with him on his first voyage, like that image of
the Virgin which Spanish mariners fastened to their masts, if he
attributed his first success to the magic influence of the prayers and
intercessions of his gentle love, later on women of other kinds,--
blacks, mulattoes, whites, and Indian dancing-girls,--orgies and
adventures in many lands, completely effaced all recollection of his
cousin, of Saumur, of the house, the bench, the kiss snatched in the
dark passage. He remembered only the little garden shut in with
crumbling walls, for it was there he learned the fate that had
overtaken him; but he rejected all connection with his family. His
uncle was an old dog who had filched his jewels; Eugenie had no place
in his heart nor in his thoughts, though she did have a place in his
accounts as a creditor for the sum of six thousand francs.

Such conduct and such ideas explain Charles Grandet's silence. In the
Indies, at St. Thomas, on the coast of Africa, at Lisbon, and in the
United States the adventurer had taken the pseudonym of Shepherd, that
he might not compromise his own name. Charles Shepherd could safely be
indefatigable, bold, grasping, and greedy of gain, like a man who
resolves to snatch his fortune /quibus cumque viis/, and makes haste
to have done with villany, that he may spend the rest of his life as
an honest man.

With such methods, prosperity was rapid and brilliant; and in 1827
Charles Grandet returned to Bordeaux on the "Marie Caroline," a fine
brig belonging to a royalist house of business. He brought with him
nineteen hundred thousand francs worth of gold-dust, from which he
expected to derive seven or eight per cent more at the Paris mint. On
the brig he met a gentleman-in-ordinary to His Majesty Charles X.,
Monsieur d'Aubrion, a worthy old man who had committed the folly of
marrying a woman of fashion with a fortune derived from the West India
Islands. To meet the costs of Madame d'Aubrion's extravagance, he had
gone out to the Indies to sell the property, and was now returning
with his family to France.

Monsieur and Madame d'Aubrion, of the house of d'Aubrion de Buch, a
family of southern France, whose last /captal/, or chief, died before
1789, were now reduced to an income of about twenty thousand francs,
and they possessed an ugly daughter whom the mother was resolved to
marry without a /dot/,--the family fortune being scarcely sufficient
for the demands of her own life in Paris. This was an enterprise whose
success might have seemed problematical to most men of the world, in
spite of the cleverness with which such men credit a fashionable
woman; in fact, Madame d'Aubrion herself, when she looked at her
daughter, almost despaired of getting rid of her to any one, even to a
man craving connection with nobility. Mademoiselle d'Aubrion was a
long, spare, spindling demoiselle, like her namesake the insect; her
mouth was disdainful; over it hung a nose that was too long, thick at
the end, sallow in its normal condition, but very red after a meal,--a
sort of vegetable phenomenon which is particularly disagreeable when
it appears in the middle of a pale, dull, and uninteresting face. In
one sense she was all that a worldly mother, thirty-eight years of age
and still a beauty with claims to admiration, could have wished.
However, to counterbalance her personal defects, the marquise gave her
daughter a distinguished air, subjected her to hygienic treatment
which provisionally kept her nose at a reasonable flesh-tint, taught
her the art of dressing well, endowed her with charming manners,
showed her the trick of melancholy glances which interest a man and
make him believe that he has found a long-sought angel, taught her the
manoeuvre of the foot,--letting it peep beneath the petticoat, to show
its tiny size, at the moment when the nose became aggressively red; in
short, Madame d'Aubrion had cleverly made the very best of her
offspring. By means of full sleeves, deceptive pads, puffed dresses
amply trimmed, and high-pressure corsets, she had obtained such
curious feminine developments that she ought, for the instruction of
mothers, to have exhibited them in a museum.

Charles became very intimate with Madame d'Aubrion precisely because
she was desirous of becoming intimate with him. Persons who were on
board the brig declared that the handsome Madame d'Aubrion neglected
no means of capturing so rich a son-in-law. On landing at Bordeaux in
June, 1827, Monsieur, Madame, Mademoiselle d'Aubrion, and Charles
lodged at the same hotel and started together for Paris. The hotel
d'Aubrion was hampered with mortgages; Charles was destined to free
it. The mother told him how delighted she would be to give up the
ground-floor to a son-in-law. Not sharing Monsieur d'Aubrion's
prejudices on the score of nobility, she promised Charles Grandet to
obtain a royal ordinance from Charles X. which would authorize him,
Grandet, to take the name and arms of d'Aubrion and to succeed, by
purchasing the entailed estate for thirty-six thousand francs a year,
to the titles of Captal de Buch and Marquis d'Aubrion. By thus uniting
their fortunes, living on good terms, and profiting by sinecures, the
two families might occupy the hotel d'Aubrion with an income of over a
hundred thousand francs.

"And when a man has a hundred thousand francs a year, a name, a
family, and a position at court,--for I will get you appointed as
gentleman-of-the-bedchamber,--he can do what he likes," she said to
Charles. "You can then become anything you choose,--master of the
rolls in the council of State, prefect, secretary to an embassy, the
ambassador himself, if you like. Charles X. is fond of d'Aubrion; they
have known each other from childhood."

Intoxicated with ambition, Charles toyed with the hopes thus cleverly
presented to him in the guise of confidences poured from heart to
heart. Believing his father's affairs to have been settled by his
uncle, he imagined himself suddenly anchored in the Faubourg Saint-
Germain,--that social object of all desire, where, under shelter of
Mademoiselle Mathilde's purple nose, he was to reappear as the Comte
d'Aubrion, very much as the Dreux reappeared in Breze. Dazzled by the
prosperity of the Restoration, which was tottering when he left
France, fascinated by the splendor of aristocratic ideas, his
intoxication, which began on the brig, increased after he reached
Paris, and he finally determined to take the course and reach the high
position which the selfish hopes of his would-be mother-in-law pointed
out to him. His cousin counted for no more than a speck in this
brilliant perspective; but he went to see Annette. True woman of the
world, Annette advised her old friend to make the marriage, and
promised him her support in all his ambitious projects. In her heart
she was enchanted to fasten an ugly and uninteresting girl on Charles,
whose life in the West Indies had rendered him very attractive. His
complexion had bronzed, his manners had grown decided and bold, like
those of a man accustomed to make sharp decisions, to rule, and to
succeed. Charles breathed more at his ease in Paris, conscious that he
now had a part to play.

Des Grassins, hearing of his return, of his approaching marriage and
his large fortune, came to see him, and inquired about the three
hundred thousand francs still required to settle his father's debts.
He found Grandet in conference with a goldsmith, from whom he had
ordered jewels for Mademoiselle d'Aubrion's /corbeille/, and who was
then submitting the designs. Charles had brought back magnificent
diamonds, and the value of their setting, together with the plate and
jewelry of the new establishment, amounted to more than two hundred
thousand francs. He received des Grassins, whom he did not recognize,
with the impertinence of a young man of fashion conscious of having
killed four men in as many duels in the Indies. Monsieur des Grassins
had already called several times. Charles listened to him coldly, and
then replied, without fully understanding what had been said to him,--

"My father's affairs are not mine. I am much obliged, monsieur, for
the trouble you have been good enough to take,--by which, however, I
really cannot profit. I have not earned two millions by the sweat of
my brow to fling them at the head of my father's creditors."

"But suppose that your father's estate were within a few days to be
declared bankrupt?"

"Monsieur, in a few days I shall be called the Comte d'Aubrion; you
will understand, therefore, that what you threaten is of no
consequence to me. Besides, you know as well as I do that when a man
has an income of a hundred thousand francs his father has /never
failed/." So saying, he politely edged Monsieur des Grassins to the
door.

*****

At the beginning of August in the same year, Eugenie was sitting on
the little wooden bench where her cousin had sworn to love her
eternally, and where she usually breakfasted if the weather were fine.
The poor girl was happy, for the moment, in the fresh and joyous
summer air, letting her memory recall the great and the little events
of her love and the catastrophes which had followed it. The sun had
just reached the angle of the ruined wall, so full of chinks, which no
one, through a caprice of the mistress, was allowed to touch, though
Cornoiller often remarked to his wife that "it would fall and crush
somebody one of these days." At this moment the postman knocked, and
gave a letter to Madame Cornoiller, who ran into the garden, crying
out:

"Mademoiselle, a letter!" She gave it to her mistress, adding, "Is it
the one you expected?"

The words rang as loudly in the heart of Eugenie as they echoed in
sound from wall to wall of the court and garden.

"Paris--from him--he has returned!"

Eugenie turned pale and held the letter for a moment. She trembled so
violently that she could not break the seal. La Grande Nanon stood
before her, both hands on her hips, her joy puffing as it were like
smoke through the cracks of her brown face.

"Read it, mademoiselle!"

"Ah, Nanon, why did he return to Paris? He went from Saumur."

"Read it, and you'll find out."

Eugenie opened the letter with trembling fingers. A cheque on the
house of "Madame des Grassins and Coret, of Saumur," fluttered down.
Nanon picked it up.

  My dear Cousin,--

"No longer 'Eugenie,'" she thought, and her heart quailed.

  You--

"He once said 'thou.'" She folded her arms and dared not read another
word; great tears gathered in her eyes.

"Is he dead?" asked Nanon.

"If he were, he could not write," said Eugenie.

She then read the whole letter, which was as follows:

  My dear Cousin,--You will, I am sure, hear with pleasure of the
  success of my enterprise. You brought me luck; I have come back
  rich, and I have followed the advice of my uncle, whose death,
  together with that of my aunt, I have just learned from Monsieur
  des Grassins. The death of parents is in the course of nature, and
  we must succeed them. I trust you are by this time consoled.
  Nothing can resist time, as I am well aware. Yes, my dear cousin,
  the day of illusions is, unfortunately, gone for me. How could it
  be otherwise? Travelling through many lands, I have reflected upon
  life. I was a child when I went away,--I have come back a man.
  To-day, I think of many I did not dream of then. You are free, my
  dear cousin, and I am free still. Nothing apparently hinders the
  realization of our early hopes; but my nature is too loyal to hide
  from you the situation in which I find myself. I have not
  forgotten our relations; I have always remembered, throughout my
  long wanderings, the little wooden seat--

Eugenie rose as if she were sitting on live coals, and went away and
sat down on the stone steps of the court.

  --the little wooden seat where we vowed to love each other
  forever, the passage, the gray hall, my attic chamber, and the
  night when, by your delicate kindness, you made my future easier
  to me. Yes, these recollections sustained my courage; I said in my
  heart that you were thinking of me at the hour we had agreed upon.
  Have you always looked at the clouds at nine o'clock? Yes, I am
  sure of it. I cannot betray so true a friendship,--no, I must not
  deceive you. An alliance has been proposed to me which satisfies
  all my ideas of matrimony. Love in marriage is a delusion. My
  present experience warns me that in marrying we are bound to obey
  all social laws and meet the conventional demands of the world.
  Now, between you and me there are differences which might affect
  your future, my dear cousin, even more than they would mine. I
  will not here speak of your customs and inclinations, your
  education, nor yet of your habits, none of which are in keeping
  with Parisian life, or with the future which I have marked out for
  myself. My intention is to keep my household on a stately footing,
  to receive much company,--in short, to live in the world; and I
  think I remember that you love a quiet and tranquil life. I will
  be frank, and make you the judge of my situation; you have the
  right to understand it and to judge it.

  I possess at the present moment an income of eighty thousand
  francs. This fortune enables me to marry into the family of
  Aubrion, whose heiress, a young girl nineteen years of age, brings
  me a title, a place of gentleman-of-the-bed-chamber to His
  Majesty, and a very brilliant position. I will admit to you, my
  dear cousin, that I do not love Mademoiselle d'Aubrion; but in
  marrying her I secure to my children a social rank whose
  advantages will one day be incalculable: monarchical principles
  are daily coming more and more into favor. Thus in course of time
  my son, when he becomes Marquis d'Aubrion, having, as he then will
  have, an entailed estate with a rental of forty thousand francs a
  year, can obtain any position in the State which he may think
  proper to select. We owe ourselves to our children.

  You see, my cousin, with what good faith I lay the state of my
  heart, my hopes, and my fortune before you. Possibly, after seven
  years' separation, you have yourself forgotten our youthful loves;
  but I have never forgotten either your kindness or my own words. I
  remember all, even words that were lightly uttered,--words by
  which a man less conscientious than I, with a heart less youthful
  and less upright, would scarcely feel himself bound. In telling
  you that the marriage I propose to make is solely one of
  convenience, that I still remember our childish love, am I not
  putting myself entirely in your hands and making you the mistress
  of my fate? am I not telling you that if I must renounce my social
  ambitions, I shall willingly content myself with the pure and
  simple happiness of which you have shown me so sweet an image?

"Tan, ta, ta--tan, ta, ti," sang Charles Grandet to the air of /Non
piu andrai/, as he signed himself,--

Your devoted cousin,
Charles.


"Thunder! that's doing it handsomely!" he said, as he looked about him
for the cheque; having found it, he added the words:--

  P.S.--I enclose a cheque on the des Grassins bank for eight
  thousand francs to your order, payable in gold, which includes the
  capital and interest of the sum you were kind enough to lend me. I
  am expecting a case from Bordeaux which contains a few things
  which you must allow me to offer you as a mark of my unceasing
  gratitude. You can send my dressing-case by the diligence to the
  hotel d'Aubrion, rue Hillerin-Bertin.

"By the diligence!" said Eugenie. "A thing for which I would have laid
down my life!"

Terrible and utter disaster! The ship went down, leaving not a spar,
not a plank, on a vast ocean of hope! Some women when they see
themselves abandoned will try to tear their lover from the arms of a
rival, they will kill her, and rush to the ends of the earth,--to the
scaffold, to their tomb. That, no doubt, is fine; the motive of the
crime is a great passion, which awes even human justice. Other women
bow their heads and suffer in silence; they go their way dying,
resigned, weeping, forgiving, praying, and recollecting, till they
draw their last breath. This is love,--true love, the love of angels,
the proud love which lives upon its anguish and dies of it. Such was
Eugenie's love after she had read that dreadful letter. She raised her
eyes to heaven, thinking of the last words uttered by her dying
mother, who, with the prescience of death, had looked into the future
with clear and penetrating eyes: Eugenie, remembering that prophetic
death, that prophetic life, measured with one glance her own destiny.
Nothing was left for her; she could only unfold her wings, stretch
upward to the skies, and live in prayer until the day of her
deliverance.

"My mother was right," she said, weeping. "Suffer--and die!"



XIV

Eugenie came slowly back from the garden to the house, and avoided
passing, as was her custom, through the corridor. But the memory of
her cousin was in the gray old hall and on the chimney-piece, where
stood a certain saucer and the old Sevres sugar-bowl which she used
every morning at her breakfast.

This day was destined to be solemn throughout and full of events.
Nanon announced the cure of the parish church. He was related to the
Cruchots, and therefore in the interests of Monsieur de Bonfons. For
some time past the old abbe had urged him to speak to Mademoiselle
Grandet, from a purely religious point of view, about the duty of
marriage for a woman in her position. When she saw her pastor, Eugenie
supposed he had come for the thousand francs which she gave monthly to
the poor, and she told Nanon to go and fetch them; but the cure only
smiled.

"To-day, mademoiselle," he said, "I have come to speak to you about a
poor girl in whom the whole town of Saumur takes an interest, who,
through lack of charity to herself, neglects her Christian duties."

"Monsieur le cure, you have come to me at a moment when I cannot think
of my neighbor, I am filled with thoughts of myself. I am very
unhappy; my only refuge is in the Church; her bosom is large enough to
hold all human woe, her love so full that we may draw from its depths
and never drain it dry."

"Mademoiselle, in speaking of this young girl we shall speak of you.
Listen! If you wish to insure your salvation you have only two paths
to take,--either leave the world or obey its laws. Obey either your
earthly destiny or your heavenly destiny."

"Ah! your voice speaks to me when I need to hear a voice. Yes, God has
sent you to me; I will bid farewell to the world and live for God
alone, in silence and seclusion."

"My daughter, you must think long before you take so violent a step.
Marriage is life, the veil is death."

"Yes, death,--a quick death!" she said, with dreadful eagerness.

"Death? but you have great obligations to fulfil to society,
mademoiselle. Are you not the mother of the poor, to whom you give
clothes and wood in winter and work in summer? Your great fortune is a
loan which you must return, and you have sacredly accepted it as such.
To bury yourself in a convent would be selfishness; to remain an old
maid is to fail in duty. In the first place, can you manage your vast
property alone? May you not lose it? You will have law-suits, you will
find yourself surrounded by inextricable difficulties. Believe your
pastor: a husband is useful; you are bound to preserve what God has
bestowed upon you. I speak to you as a precious lamb of my flock. You
love God too truly not to find your salvation in the midst of his
world, of which you are noble ornament and to which you owe your
example."

At this moment Madame des Grassins was announced. She came incited by
vengeance and the sense of a great despair.

"Mademoiselle," she said--"Ah! here is monsieur le cure; I am silent.
I came to speak to you on business; but I see that you are conferring
with--"

"Madame," said the cure, "I leave the field to you."

"Oh! monsieur le cure," said Eugenie, "come back later; your support
is very necessary to me just now."

"Ah, yes, indeed, my poor child!" said Madame des Grassins.

"What do you mean?" asked Eugenie and the cure together.

"Don't I know about your cousin's return, and his marriage with
Mademoiselle d'Aubrion? A woman doesn't carry her wits in her pocket."

Eugenie blushed, and remained silent for a moment. From this day forth
she assumed the impassible countenance for which her father had been
so remarkable.

"Well, madame," she presently said, ironically, "no doubt I carry my
wits in my pocket, for I do not understand you. Speak, say what you
mean, before monsieur le cure; you know he is my director."

"Well, then, mademoiselle, here is what des Grassins writes me. Read
it."

Eugenie read the following letter:--

  My dear Wife,--Charles Grandet has returned from the Indies and
  has been in Paris about a month--

"A month!" thought Eugenie, her hand falling to her side. After a
pause she resumed the letter,--

  I had to dance attendance before I was allowed to see the future
  Vicomte d'Aubrion. Though all Paris is talking of his marriage and
  the banns are published--

"He wrote to me after that!" thought Eugenie. She did not conclude the
thought; she did not cry out, as a Parisian woman would have done,
"The villain!" but though she said it not, contempt was none the less
present in her mind.

  The marriage, however, will not come off. The Marquis d'Aubrion
  will never give his daughter to the son of a bankrupt. I went to
  tell Grandet of the steps his uncle and I took in his father's
  business, and the clever manoeuvres by which we had managed to
  keep the creditor's quiet until the present time. The insolent
  fellow had the face to say to me--to me, who for five years have
  devoted myself night and day to his interests and his honor!--that
  /his father's affairs were not his/! A solicitor would have had
  the right to demand fees amounting to thirty or forty thousand
  francs, one per cent on the total of the debts. But patience!
  there are twelve hundred thousand francs legitimately owing to the
  creditors, and I shall at once declare his father a bankrupt.

  I went into this business on the word of that old crocodile
  Grandet, and I have made promises in the name of his family. If
  Monsieur de vicomte d'Aubrion does not care for his honor, I care
  for mine. I shall explain my position to the creditors. Still, I
  have too much respect for Mademoiselle Eugenie (to whom under
  happier circumstances we once hoped to be allied) to act in this
  matter before you have spoken to her about it--

There Eugenie paused, and coldly returned the letter without finishing
it.

"I thank you," she said to Madame des Grassins.

"Ah! you have the voice and manner of your deceased father," Madame
des Grassins replied.

"Madame, you have eight thousand francs to pay us," said Nanon,
producing Charles's cheque.

"That's true; have the kindness to come with me now, Madame
Cornoiller."

"Monsieur le cure," said Eugenie with a noble composure, inspired by
the thought she was about to express, "would it be a sin to remain a
virgin after marriage?"

"That is a case of conscience whose solution is not within my
knowledge. If you wish to know what the celebrated Sanchez says of it
in his treatise 'De Matrimonio,' I shall be able to tell you
to-morrow."

The cure went away; Mademoiselle Grandet went up to her father's
secret room and spent the day there alone, without coming down to
dinner, in spite of Nanon's entreaties. She appeared in the evening at
the hour when the usual company began to arrive. Never was the old
hall so full as on this occasion. The news of Charles's return and his
foolish treachery had spread through the whole town. But however
watchful the curiosity of the visitors might be, it was left
unsatisfied. Eugenie, who expected scrutiny, allowed none of the cruel
emotions that wrung her soul to appear on the calm surface of her
face. She was able to show a smiling front in answer to all who tried
to testify their interest by mournful looks or melancholy speeches.
She hid her misery behind a veil of courtesy. Towards nine o'clock the
games ended and the players left the tables, paying their losses and
discussing points of the game as they joined the rest of the company.
At the moment when the whole party rose to take leave, an unexpected
and striking event occurred, which resounded through the length and
breadth of Saumur, from thence through the arrondissement, and even to
the four surrounding prefectures.

"Stay, monsieur le president," said Eugenie to Monsieur de Bonfons as
she saw him take his cane.

There was not a person in that numerous assembly who was unmoved by
these words. The president turned pale, and was forced to sit down.

"The president gets the millions," said Mademoiselle de Gribeaucourt.

"It is plain enough; the president marries Mademoiselle Grandet,"
cried Madame d'Orsonval.

"All the trumps in one hand," said the abbe.

"A love game," said the notary.

Each and all said his say, made his pun, and looked at the heiress
mounted on her millions as on a pedestal. The drama begun nine years
before had reached its conclusion. To tell the president, in face of
all Saumur, to "stay," was surely the same thing as proclaiming him
her husband. In provincial towns social conventionalities are so
rigidly enforced than an infraction like this constituted a solemn
promise.

"Monsieur le president," said Eugenie in a voice of some emotion when
they were left alone, "I know what pleases you in me. Swear to leave
me free during my whole life, to claim none of the rights which
marriage will give you over me, and my hand is yours. Oh!" she added,
seeing him about to kneel at her feet, "I have more to say. I must not
deceive you. In my heart I cherish one inextinguishable feeling.
Friendship is the only sentiment which I can give to a husband. I wish
neither to affront him nor to violate the laws of my own heart. But
you can possess my hand and my fortune only at the cost of doing me an
inestimable service."

"I am ready for all things," said the president.

"Here are fifteen hundred thousand francs," she said, drawing from her
bosom a certificate of a hundred shares in the Bank of France. "Go to
Paris,--not to-morrow, but instantly. Find Monsieur des Grassins,
learn the names of my uncle's creditors, call them together, pay them
in full all that was owing, with interest at five per cent from the
day the debt was incurred to the present time. Be careful to obtain a
full and legal receipt, in proper form, before a notary. You are a
magistrate, and I can trust this matter in your hands. You are a man
of honor; I will put faith in your word, and meet the dangers of life
under shelter of your name. Let us have mutual indulgence. We have
known each other so long that we are almost related; you would not
wish to render me unhappy."

The president fell at the feet of the rich heiress, his heart beating
and wrung with joy.

"I will be your slave!" he said.

"When you obtain the receipts, monsieur," she resumed, with a cold
glance, "you will take them with all the other papers to my cousin
Grandet, and you will give him this letter. On your return I will keep
my word."

The president understood perfectly that he owed the acquiescence of
Mademoiselle Grandet to some bitterness of love, and he made haste to
obey her orders, lest time should effect a reconciliation between the
pair.

When Monsieur de Bonfons left her, Eugenie fell back in her chair and
burst into tears. All was over.

The president took the mail-post, and reached Paris the next evening.
The morning after his arrival he went to see des Grassins, and
together they summoned the creditors to meet at the notary's office
where the vouchers had been deposited. Not a single creditor failed to
be present. Creditors though they were, justice must be done to them,
--they were all punctual. Monsieur de Bonfons, in the name of
Mademoiselle Grandet, paid them the amount of their claims with
interest. The payment of interest was a remarkable event in the
Parisian commerce of that day. When the receipts were all legally
registered, and des Grassins had received for his services the sum of
fifty thousand francs allowed to him by Eugenie, the president made
his way to the hotel d'Aubrion and found Charles just entering his own
apartment after a serious encounter with his prospective father-in-
law. The old marquis had told him plainly that he should not marry his
daughter until all the creditors of Guillaume Grandet had been paid in
full.

The president gave Charles the following letter:--

  My Cousin,--Monsieur le president de Bonfons has undertaken to
  place in your hands the aquittance for all claims upon my uncle,
  also a receipt by which I acknowledge having received from you the
  sum total of those claims. I have heard of a possible failure, and
  I think that the son of a bankrupt may not be able to marry
  Mademoiselle d'Aubrion. Yes, my cousin, you judged rightly of my
  mind and of my manners. I have, it is true, no part in the world;
  I understand neither its calculations nor its customs; and I could
  not give you the pleasures that you seek in it. Be happy,
  according to the social conventions to which you have sacrificed
  our love. To make your happiness complete I can only offer you
  your father's honor. Adieu! You will always have a faithful friend
  in your cousin

Eugenie.


The president smiled at the exclamation which the ambitious young man
could not repress as he received the documents.

"We shall announce our marriages at the same time," remarked Monsieur
de Bonfons.

"Ah! you marry Eugenie? Well, I am delighted; she is a good girl.
But," added Charles, struck with a luminous idea, "she must be rich?"

"She had," said the president, with a mischievous smile, "about
nineteen millions four days ago; but she has only seventeen millions
to-day."

Charles looked at him thunderstruck.

"Seventeen mil--"

"Seventeen millions; yes, monsieur. We shall muster, Mademoiselle
Grandet and I, an income of seven hundred and fifty thousand francs
when we marry."

"My dear cousin," said Charles, recovering a little of his assurance,
"we can push each other's fortunes."

"Agreed," said the president. "Here is also a little case which I am
charged to give into your own hands," he added, placing on the table
the leather box which contained the dressing-case.

"Well, my dear friend," said Madame d'Aubrion, entering the room
without noticing the president, "don't pay any attention to what poor
Monsieur d'Aubrion has just said to you; the Duchesse de Chaulieu has
turned his head. I repeat, nothing shall interfere with the
marriage--"

"Very good, madame. The three millions which my father owed were paid
yesterday."

"In money?" she asked.

"Yes, in full, capital and interest; and I am about to do honor to his
memory--"

"What folly!" exclaimed his mother-in-law. "Who is this?" she
whispered in Grandet's ear, perceiving the president.

"My man of business," he answered in a low voice.

The marquise bowed superciliously to Monsieur de Bonfons.

"We are pushing each other's fortunes already," said the president,
taking up his hat. "Good-by, cousin."

"He is laughing at me, the old cockatoo! I'd like to put six inches of
iron into him!" muttered Charles.

The president was out of hearing. Three days later Monsieur de
Bonfons, on his return to Saumur, announced his marriage with Eugenie.
Six months after the marriage he was appointed councillor in the Cour
royale at Angers. Before leaving Saumur Madame de Bonfons had the gold
of certain jewels, once so precious to her, melted up, and put,
together with the eight thousand francs paid back by her cousin, into
a golden pyx, which she gave to the parish church where she had so
long prayed for /him/. She now spent her time between Angers and
Saumur. Her husband, who had shown some public spirit on a certain
occasion, became a judge in the superior courts, and finally, after a
few years, president of them. He was anxiously awaiting a general
election, in the hope of being returned to the Chamber of deputies. He
hankered after a peerage; and then--

"The king will be his cousin, won't he?" said Nanon, la Grande Nanon,
Madame Cornoiller, bourgeoise of Saumur, as she listened to her
mistress, who was recounting the honors to which she was called.

Nevertheless, Monsieur de Bonfons (he had finally abolished his
patronymic of Cruchot) did not realize any of his ambitious ideas. He
died eight days after his election as deputy of Saumur. God, who sees
all and never strikes amiss, punished him, no doubt, for his sordid
calculations and the legal cleverness with which, /accurante Cruchot/,
he had drawn up his marriage contract, in which husband and wife gave
to each other, "in case they should have no children, their entire
property of every kind, landed or otherwise, without exception or
reservation, dispensing even with the formality of an inventory;
provided that said omission of said inventory shall not injure their
heirs and assigns, it being understood that this deed of gift is,
etc., etc." This clause of the contract will explain the profound
respect which monsieur le president always testified for the wishes,
and above all, for the solitude of Madame de Bonfons. Women cited him
as the most considerate and delicate of men, pitied him, and even went
so far as to find fault with the passion and grief of Eugenie, blaming
her, as women know so well how to blame, with cruel but discreet
insinuation.

"Madame de Bonfons must be very ill to leave her husband entirely
alone. Poor woman! Is she likely to get well? What is it? Something
gastric? A cancer?"--"She has grown perfectly yellow. She ought to
consult some celebrated doctor in Paris."--"How can she be happy
without a child? They say she loves her husband; then why not give him
an heir?--in his position, too!"--"Do you know, it is really dreadful!
If it is the result of mere caprice, it is unpardonable. Poor
president!"

Endowed with the delicate perception which a solitary soul acquires
through constant meditation, through the exquisite clear-sightedness
with which a mind aloof from life fastens on all that falls within its
sphere, Eugenie, taught by suffering and by her later education to
divine thought, knew well that the president desired her death that he
might step into possession of their immense fortune, augmented by the
property of his uncle the notary and his uncle the abbe, whom it had
lately pleased God to call to himself. The poor solitary pitied the
president. Providence avenged her for the calculations and the
indifference of a husband who respected the hopeless passion on which
she spent her life because it was his surest safeguard. To give life
to a child would give death to his hopes,--the hopes of selfishness,
the joys of ambition, which the president cherished as he looked into
the future.

God thus flung piles of gold upon this prisoner to whom gold was a
matter of indifference, who longed for heaven, who lived, pious and
good, in holy thoughts, succoring the unfortunate in secret, and never
wearying of such deeds. Madame de Bonfons became a widow at thirty-
six. She is still beautiful, but with the beauty of a woman who is
nearly forty years of age. Her face is white and placid and calm; her
voice gentle and self-possessed; her manners are simple. She has the
noblest qualities of sorrow, the saintliness of one who has never
soiled her soul by contact with the world; but she has also the rigid
bearing of an old maid and the petty habits inseparable from the
narrow round of provincial life. In spite of her vast wealth, she
lives as the poor Eugenie Grandet once lived. The fire is never
lighted on her hearth until the day when her father allowed it to be
lighted in the hall, and it is put out in conformity with the rules
which governed her youthful years. She dresses as her mother dressed.
The house in Saumur, without sun, without warmth, always in shadow,
melancholy, is an image of her life. She carefully accumulates her
income, and might seem parsimonious did she not disarm criticism by a
noble employment of her wealth. Pious and charitable institutions, a
hospital for old age, Christian schools for children, a public library
richly endowed, bear testimony against the charge of avarice which
some persons lay at her door. The churches of Saumur owe much of their
embellishment to her. Madame de Bonfons (sometimes ironically spoken
of as mademoiselle) inspires for the most part reverential respect:
and yet that noble heart, beating only with tenderest emotions, has
been, from first to last, subjected to the calculations of human
selfishness; money has cast its frigid influence upon that hallowed
life and taught distrust of feelings to a woman who is all feeling.

"I have none but you to love me," she says to Nanon.

The hand of this woman stanches the secret wounds in many families.
She goes on her way to heaven attended by a train of benefactions. The
grandeur of her soul redeems the narrowness of her education and the
petty habits of her early life.

Such is the history of Eugenie Grandet, who is in the world but not of
it; who, created to be supremely a wife and mother, has neither
husband nor children nor family. Lately there has been some question
of her marrying again. The Saumur people talk of her and of the
Marquis de Froidfond, whose family are beginning to beset the rich
widow just as, in former days, the Cruchots laid siege to the rich
heiress. Nanon and Cornoiller are, it is said, in the interests of the
marquis. Nothing could be more false. Neither la Grande Nanon nor
Cornoiller has sufficient mind to understand the corruptions of the
world.
