            CONSTITUTION OF THE EMPIRE OF JAPAN, 1889

Imperial Oath Sworn in the Sanctuary in the Imperial Palace
(Tsuge-bumi)

     We, the Successor to the prosperous Throne of Our
Predecessors, do humbly and solemnly swear to the Imperial
Founder of Our House and to Our other Imperial Ancestors that, in
pursuance of a great policy co-extensive with the Heavens and
with the Earth, We shall maintain and secure from decline the
ancient form of government. 

     In consideration of the progressive tendency of the course
of human affairs and in parallel with the advance of
civilization, We deem it expedient, in order to give clearness
and distinctness to the instructions bequeathed by the Imperial
Founder of Our House and by Our other Imperial Ancestors, to
establish fundamental laws formulated into express provisions of
law, so that, on the one hand, Our Imperial posterity may possess
an express guide for the course they are to follow, and that, on
the other, Our subjects shall thereby be enabled to enjoy a wider
range of action in giving Us their support, and that the
observance of Our laws shall continue to the remotest ages of
time. We will thereby to give greater firmness to the stability
of Our country and to promote the welfare of all the people
within the boundaries of Our dominions; and We now establish the
Imperial House Law and the Constitution. These Laws come to only
an exposition of grand precepts for the conduct of the
government, bequeathed by the Imperial Founder of Our House and
by Our other Imperial Ancestors. That we have been so fortunate
in Our reign, in keeping with the tendency of the times, as to
accomplish this work, We owe to the glorious Spirits of the
Imperial Founder of Our House and of Our other Imperial
Ancestors.

     We now reverently make Our prayer to Them and to Our
Illustrious Father, and implore the help of Their Sacred Spirits,
and make to Them solemn oath never at this time nor in the future
to fail to be an example to our subjects in the observance of the
Laws hereby established.

     May the heavenly Spirits witness this Our solemn Oath.


    Imperial Rescript on the Promulgation of the Constitution

     Whereas We make it the joy and glory of Our heart to behold
the prosperity of Our country, and the welfare of Our subjects,
We do hereby, in virtue of the Supreme power We inherit from Our
Imperial Ancestors, promulgate the present immutable fundamental
law, for the sake of Our present subjects and their descendants.

     The Imperial Founder of Our House and Our other Imperial
ancestors, by the help and support of the forefathers of Our
subjects, laid the foundation of Our Empire upon a basis, which
is to last forever. That this brilliant achievement embellishes
the annals of Our country, is due to the glorious virtues of Our
Sacred Imperial ancestors, and to the loyalty and bravery of Our
subjects, their love of their country and their public spirit.
Considering that Our subjects are the descendants of the loyal
and good subjects of Our Imperial Ancestors, We doubt not but
that Our subjects will be guided by Our views, and will
sympathize with all Our endeavors, and that, harmoniously
cooperating together, they will share with Us Our hope of making
manifest the glory of Our country, both at home and abroad, and
of securing forever the stability of the work bequeathed to Us by
Our Imperial Ancestors.
