   {Prince of darkness}, the Devil; Satan. ``In the power of the
      Prince of darkness.'' --Locke.

   Syn: {Darkness}, {Dimness}, {Obscurity}, {Gloom}.

   Usage: Darkness arises from a total, and dimness from a
          partial, want of light. A thing is obscure when so
          overclouded or covered as not to be easily perceived.
          As tha shade or obscurity increases, it deepens into
          gloom. What is dark is hidden from view; what is
          obscure is difficult to perceive or penetrate; the eye
          becomes dim with age; an impending storm fills the
          atmosphere with gloom. When taken figuratively, these
          words have a like use; as, the darkness of ignorance;
          dimness of discernment; obscurity of reasoning; gloom
          of superstition.

   Pertaining to Darwin; as, the Darwinian theory, a theory of

   things from certain original forms or elements.

   Note: This theory was put forth by Darwin in 1859 in a work
         entitled ``The Origin of species by Means of Natural
         Selection.'' The author argues that, in the struggle
         for existence, those plants and creatures best fitted
         to the requirements of the situation in which they are
         placed are the ones that will live; in other words,
         that Nature selects those which are to survive. This is
         the theory of natural selection or the survival of the
         fittest. He also argues that natural selection is
         capable of modifying and producing organisms fit for
         their circumstances. See {Development theory}, under
         {Development}.

         the entire disappearance of the vital actions of the
         ultimate structural constituents of the body. When

            And urged him, so that his soul was vexed unto
            death.                                --Judg. xvi.
                                                  16.

   Syn: {Death}, {Decease}, {Demise}, {Departure}, {Release}.

   Usage: Death applies to the termination of every form of
          existence, both animal and vegetable; the other words
          only to the human race. Decease is the term used in
          law for the removal of a human being out of life in
          the ordinary course of nature. Demise was formerly
          confined to decease of princes, but is now sometimes
          used of distinguished men in general; as, the demise
          of Mr. Pitt. Departure and release are peculiarly
          terms of Christian affection and hope. A violent death
          is not usually called a decease. Departure implies a
          friendly taking leave of life. Release implies a
          deliverance from a life of suffering or sorrow.

   Syn: {Debility}, {Infirmity}, {Imbecility}.

   Usage: An infirmity belongs, for the most part, to particular
          members, and is often temporary, as of the eyes, etc.
          Debility is more general, and while it lasts impairs
          the ordinary functions of nature. Imbecility attaches
          to the whole frame, and renders it more or less
          powerless. Debility may be constitutional or may be
          the result or superinduced causes; Imbecility is
          always constitutional; infirmity is accidental, and
          results from sickness or a decay of the frame. These
          words, in their figurative uses, have the same
          distinctions; we speak of infirmity of will, debility
          of body, and an Imbecility which affects the whole
          man; but Imbecility is often used with specific
          reference to feebleness of mind.

   Syn: {Deceive}, {Delude}, {Mislead}.

   Usage: Deceive is a general word applicable to any kind of
          misrepresentation affecting faith or life. To delude,
          primarily, is to make sport of, by deceiving, and is
          accomplished by playing upon one's imagination or
          credulity, as by exciting false hopes, causing him to
          undertake or expect what is impracticable, and making
          his failure ridiculous. It implies some infirmity of
          judgment in the victim, and intention to deceive in
          the deluder. But it is often used reflexively,
          indicating that a person's own weakness has made him
          the sport of others or of fortune; as, he deluded
          himself with a belief that luck would always favor
          him. To mislead is to lead, guide, or direct in a
          wrong way, either willfully or ignorantly.

Deceiver \De*ceiv"er\, n.
   One who deceives; one who leads into error; a cheat; an
   impostor.

         The deceived and the deceiver are his.   --Job xii. 16.

   Syn: {Deceiver}, {Impostor}.

   Usage: A deceiver operates by stealth and in private upon
          individuals; an impostor practices his arts on the
          community at large. The one succeeds by artful
          falsehoods, the other by bold assumption. The
          faithless friend and the fickle lover are deceivers;
          the false prophet and the pretended prince are
          impostors.

   Syn: {Deception}, {Deceit}, {Fraud}, {Imposition}.

   Usage: Deception usually refers to the act, and deceit to the
          habit of the mind; hence we speak of a person as
          skilled in deception and addicted to deceit. The
          practice of deceit springs altogether from design, and
          that of the worst kind; but a deception does not
          always imply aim and intention. It may be undesigned
          or accidental. An imposition is an act of deception
          practiced upon some one to his annoyance or injury; a
          fraud implies the use of stratagem, with a view to
          some unlawful gain or advantage.

                                                  --1 Kings xx.

   Syn: {Decided}, {Decisive}.

   Usage: We call a thing decisive when it has the power or
          quality of deciding; as, a decisive battle; we speak
          of it as decided when it is so fully settled as to
          leave no room for doubt; as, a decided preference, a
          decided aversion. Hence, a decided victory is one
          about which there is no question; a decisive victory
          is one which ends the contest. Decisive is applied
          only to things; as, a decisive sentence, a decisive
          decree, a decisive judgment. Decided is applied
          equally to persons and things. Thus we speak of a man
          as decided in his whole of conduct; and as having a
          decided disgust, or a decided reluctance, to certain
          measures. ``A politic caution, a guarded
          circumspection, were among the ruling principles of
          our forefathers in their most decided conduct.''
          --Burke. ``The sentences of superior judges are final,

   4. The quality of being decided; prompt and fixed
      determination; unwavering firmness; as, to manifest great
      decision.

   Syn: {Decision}, {Determination}, {Resolution}.

   Usage: Each of these words has two meanings, one implying the
          act of deciding, determining, or resolving; and the
          other a habit of mind as to doing. It is in the last
          sense that the words are here compared. Decision is a
          cutting short. It implies that several courses of
          action have been presented to the mind, and that the
          choice is now finally made. It supposes, therefore, a
          union of promptitude and energy. Determination is the
          natural consequence of decision. It is the settling of
          a thing with a fixed purpose to adhere. Resolution is
          the necessary result in a mind which is characterized
          by firmness. It is a spirit which scatters (resolves)
          all doubt, and is ready to face danger or suffering in
          carrying out one's determinations. Martin Luther was
          equally distinguished for his prompt decision, his
          steadfast determination, and his inflexible
          resolution.

   Usage: Deference marks an inclination to yield one's opinion,
          and to acquiesce in the sentiments of another in
          preference to one's own. Respect marks the estimation

          with a high degree of respect and esteem. Age, rank,
          dignity, and personal merit call for deference;

          is due to God, to the authors of our being, and to the

   Usage: A definition is designed to settle a thing in its
          compass and extent; an explanation is intended to

          therefore more extended and minute; a description

          interest or impress by graphic effect. It is not
          therefore true, though often said, that description is
          only an extended definition. ``Logicians distinguish
          definitions into essential and accidental. An
          essential definition states what are regarded as the
          constituent parts of the essence of that which is to
          be defined; and an accidental definition lays down
          what are regarded as circumstances belonging to it,

   Syn: To {Deliver}, {Give Forth}, {Discharge}, {Liberate},
        {Pronounce}, {Utter}.

   Usage: Deliver denotes, literally, to set free. Hence the
          term is extensively applied to cases where a thing is
          made to pass from a confined state to one of greater
          freedom or openness. Hence it may, in certain
          connections, be used as synonymous with any or all of
          the above-mentioned words, as will be seen from the
          following examples: One who delivers a package gives
          it forth; one who delivers a cargo discharges it; one
          who delivers a captive liberates him; one who delivers
          a message or a discourse utters or pronounces it; when
          soldiers deliver their fire, they set it free or give
          it forth.

            And fondly mourned the dear delusion gone. --Prior.

   Syn: {Delusion}, {Illusion}.

   Usage: These words both imply some deception practiced upon
          the mind. Delusion is deception from want of
          knowledge; illusion is deception from morbid
          imagination. An illusion is a false show, a mere cheat
          on the fancy or senses. It is, in other words, some
          idea or image presented to the bodily or mental vision
          which does not exist in reality. A delusion is a false
          judgment, usually affecting the real concerns of life.
          Or, in other words, it is an erroneous view of
          something which exists indeed, but has by no means the
          qualities or attributes ascribed to it. Thus we speak
          of the illusions of fancy, the illusions of hope,
          illusive prospects, illusive appearances, etc. In like
          manner, we speak of the delusions of stockjobbing, the
          delusions of honorable men, delusive appearances in
          trade, of being deluded by a seeming excellence. ``A
          fanatic, either religious or political, is the subject
          of strong delusions; while the term illusion is
          applied solely to the visions of an uncontrolled
          imagination, the chimerical ideas of one blinded by
          hope, passion, or credulity, or lastly, to spectral
          and other ocular deceptions, to which the word
          delusion is never applied.'' --Whately.

   The state of being depraved or corrupted; a vitiated state of
   moral character; general badness of character; wickedness of
   mind or heart; absence of religious feeling and principle.

   {Total depravity}. See {Original sin}, and {Calvinism}.

   Syn: Corruption; vitiation; wickedness; vice; contamination;
        degeneracy.

   Usage: {Depravity}, {Depravation}, {Corruption}. Depravilty
          is a vitiated state of mind or feeling; as, the
          depravity of the human heart; depravity of public
          morals. Depravation points to the act or process of
          making depraved, and hence to the end thus reached;
          as, a gradual depravation of principle; a depravation
          of manners, of the heart, etc. Corruption is the only
          one of these words which applies to physical
          substances, and in reference to these denotes the
          process by which their component parts are dissolved.
          Hence, when figuratively used, it denotes an utter
          vitiation of principle or feeling. Depravity applies
          only to the mind and heart: we can speak of a depraved
          taste, or a corrupt taste; in the first we introduce
          the notion that there has been the influence of bad
          training to pervert; in the second, that there is a
          want of true principle to pervert; in the second, that
          there is a want of true principles to decide. The
          other two words have a wider use: we can speak of the

          alike to a single sentence or a connected composition.
          Errors in grammar, false construction, a confused
          disposition of words, or an improper application of
          them, constitute bad diction; but the niceties, the
          elegancies, the peculiarities, and the beauties of
          composition, which mark the genius and talent of the
          writer, are what is comprehended under the name of
          style.'' --Crabb.

         withhold your pay, because the judge's award will be
         against you; if I lose it, I may withhold it, because I
         shall not yet have gained a cause.'' ``On the
         contrary,'' says the master, ``if you gain your cause,
         you must pay me, because you are to pay me when you
         gain a cause; if you lose it, you must pay me, because

   Syn: Attention; industry; assiduity; sedulousness;
        earnestness; constancy; heed; heedfulness; care;

        specific object or pursuit, which more or less directly
        has a strong hold on one's interests or feelings. A man
        may be diligent for a time, or in seeking some favorite

   Syn: Administration; guidance; management; superintendence;
        oversight; government; order; command; guide; clew.

   Usage: {Direction}, {Control}, {Command}, {Order}. These
          words, as here compared, have reference to the
          exercise of power over the actions of others. Control
          is negative, denoting power to restrain; command is
          positive, implying a right to enforce obedience;
          directions are commands containing instructions how to
          act. Order conveys more prominently the idea of
          authority than the word direction. A shipmaster has
          the command of his vessel; he gives orders or
          directions to the seamen as to the mode of sailing it;
          and exercises a due control over the passengers.

   Note: This use of the word is common in England, especially
         in colloquial speech, but it can hardly be regarded as
         a well-sanctioned or desirable use.

   {Directly proportional} (Math.), proportional in the order of
      the terms; increasing or decreasing together, and with a
      constant ratio; -- opposed to {inversely proportional}.

   Syn: Immediately; forthwith; straightway; instantly;
        instantaneously; soon; promptly; openly; expressly.

   Usage: -- {Directly}, {Immediately}, {Instantly},
          {Instantaneously}. Directly denotes, without any delay
          or diversion of attention; immediately implies,
          without any interposition of other occupation;
          instantly implies, without any intervention of time.
          Hence, ``I will do it directly,'' means, ``I will go
          straightway about it.'' ``I will do it immediately,''
          means, ``I will do it as the very next thing.'' ``I
          will do it instantly,'' allows not a particle of
          delay. Instantaneously, like instantly, marks an
          interval too small to be appreciable, but commonly
          relates to physical causes; as, the powder touched by
          fire instantaneously exploded.

Diruption \Di*rup"tion\, n. [L. diruptio, fr. dirumpere. See

   Disruption.

Dis- \Dis-\ (?; 258)
   .

   1. A prefix from the Latin, whence F. d['e]s, or sometimes
      d['e]-, dis-. The Latin dis-appears as di-before b, d, g,
      l, m, n, r, v, becomes dif-before f, and either dis-or di-
      before j. It is from the same root as bis twice, and duo,
      E. two. See {Two}, and cf. {Bi-}, {Di-}, {Dia-}.
      Dis-denotes separation, a parting from, as in distribute,
      disconnect; hence it often has the force of a privative
      and negative, as in disarm, disoblige, disagree. Also
      intensive, as in dissever.

   Note: Walker's rule of pronouncing this prefix is, that the s
         ought always to be pronounced like z, when the next
         syllable is accented and begins with ``a flat mute [b,
         d, v, g, z], a liquid [l, m, n, r], or a vowel; as,
         disable, disease, disorder, disuse, disband, disdain,
         disgrace, disvalue, disjoin, dislike, dislodge, dismay,
         dismember, dismiss, dismount, disnatured, disrank,
         disrelish, disrobe.'' Dr. Webster's example in
         disapproving of Walker's rule and pronouncing dis-as
         diz in only one (disease) of the above words, is
         followed by recent ortho["e]pists. See {Disable},
         {Disgrace}, and the other words, beginning with dis-,
         in this Dictionary.

   2. A prefix from Gr. di`s- twice. See {Di-}.

Dis \Dis\, n. [L.]
   The god Pluto. --Shak.

Disability \Dis`a*bil"i*ty\, n.; pl. {Disabilities}.
   1. State of being disabled; deprivation or want of ability;
      absence of competent physical, intellectual, or moral
      power, means, fitness, and the like.

            Grossest faults, or disabilities to perform what was
            covenanted.                           --Milton.

            Chatham refused to see him, pleading his disability.
                                                  --Bancroft.

   2. Want of legal qualification to do a thing; legal
      incapacity or incompetency.

            The disabilities of idiocy, infancy, and coverture.
                                                  --Abbott.

   Syn: Weakness; inability; incompetence; impotence;
        incapacity; incompetency; disqualification.

   Usage: -- {Disability}, {Inability}. Inability is an inherent
          want of power to perform the thing in question;
          disability arises from some deprivation or loss of the
          needed competency. One who becomes deranged is under a
          disability of holding his estate; and one who is made
          a judge, of deciding in his own case. A man may
          decline an office on account of his inability to
          discharge its duties; he may refuse to accept a trust
          or employment on account of some disability prevents
          him from entering into such engagements.

        now used by physicians only of the diseases of animals.
        Malady is not a medical term, and is less used than
        formerly in literature. Affection has special reference
        to the part, organ, or function disturbed; as, his
        disease is an affection of the lungs. A disease is
        usually deep-seated and permanent, or at least
        prolonged; a disorder is often slight, partial, and
        temporary; malady has less of a technical sense than the
        other terms, and refers more especially to the suffering
        endured. In a figurative sense we speak of a disease
        mind, of disordered faculties, and of mental maladies.

        {Dislike}, {Aversion}, {Reluctance}, {Repugnance},
        {Disgust}, {Antipathy}. Dislike is the more general
        term, applicable to both persons and things and arising
        either from feeling or judgment. It may mean little more
        than want of positive liking; but antipathy, repugnance,
        disgust, and aversion are more intense phases of
        dislike. Aversion denotes a fixed and habitual dislike;
        as, an aversion to or for business. Reluctance and
        repugnance denote a mental strife or hostility something
        proposed (repugnance being the stronger); as, a
        reluctance to make the necessary sacrifices, and a
        repugnance to the submission required. Disgust is
        repugnance either of taste or moral feeling; as, a
        disgust at gross exhibitions of selfishness. Antipathy
        is primarily an instinctive feeling of dislike of a
        thing, such as most persons feel for a snake. When used
        figuratively, it denotes a correspondent dislike for
        certain persons, modes of acting, etc. Men have an
        aversion to what breaks in upon their habits; a
        reluctance and repugnance to what crosses their will; a
        disgust at what offends their sensibilities; and are
        often governed by antipathies for which they can give no
        good reason.

   An abbreviation of {Ditto}.

Do \Do\ (d[=o]), n. (Mus.)
   A syllable attached to the first tone of the major diatonic
   scale for the purpose of solmization, or solfeggio. It is the
   first of the seven syllables used by the Italians as manes of
   musical tones, and replaced, for the sake of euphony, the
   syllable Ut, applied to the note C. In England and America
   the same syllables are used by mane as a scale pattern, while
   the tones in respect to absolute pitch are named from the
   first seven letters of the alphabet.

Do \Do\, v. t. or auxiliary. [imp. {Din}; p. p. {Done}; p. pr. &
   vb. n. {Doing}. This verb, when transitive, is formed in the
   indicative, present tense, thus: I do, thou doest (?) or dost
   ?, he does (?), doeth (?), or doth (?); when auxiliary, the
   second person is, thou dost. As an independent verb, dost is
   obsolete or rare, except in poetry. ``What dost thou in this
   world?'' --Milton. The form doeth is a verb unlimited, doth,
   formerly so used, now being the auxiliary form. The second
   pers, sing., imperfect tense, is didst (?), formerly didest
   (?).] [AS. d?n; akin to D. doen, OS. duan, OHG. tuon, G.
   thun, Lith. deti, OSlav. d?ti, OIr. d['e]nim I do, Gr. ? to
   put, Skr. dh[=a], and to E. suffix -dom, and prob. to L.
   facere to do, E. fact, and perh. to L. -dere in some
   compounfds, as addere to add, credere to trust. ??? Cf.

                                                  1.

   Note: We have lost the idiom shown by the citations (do used
         like the French faire or laisser), in which the verb in
         the infinitive apparently, but not really, has a
         passive signification, i. e., cause . . . to be made.

   3. To bring about; to produce, as an effect or result; to
      effect; to achieve.

            The neglecting it may do much danger. --Shak.

   4. To perform, as an action; to execute; to transact to carry
      out in action; as, to do a good or a bad act; do our duty;
      to do what I can.

                                                  xx. 9.

                                                  (Jason).

   9. To see or inspect; to explore; as, to do all the points of
      interest. [Colloq.]

   10. (Stock Exchange) To cash or to advance money for, as a
       bill or note.

   Note:
       (a) Do and did are much employed as auxiliaries, the verb
           to which they are joined being an infinitive. As an
           auxiliary the verb do has no participle. ``I do set
           my bow in the cloud.'' --Gen. ix. 13. [Now archaic or
           rare except for emphatic assertion.]

                 Rarely . . . did the wrongs of individuals to
                 the knowledge of the public.     -- Macaulay.
       (b) They are often used in emphatic construction. ``You
           don't say so, Mr. Jobson. -- but I do say so.'' --Sir
           W. Scott. ``I did love him, but scorn him now.''
           --Latham.
       (c) In negative and interrogative constructions, do and
           did are in common use. I do not wish to see them;
           what do you think? Did C[ae]sar cross the Tiber? He
           did not. ``Do you love me?'' --Shak.
       (d) Do, as an auxiliary, is supposed to have been first
           used before imperatives. It expresses entreaty or
           earnest request; as, do help me. In the imperative
           mood, but not in the indicative, it may be used with
           the verb to be; as, do be quiet. Do, did, and done
           often stand as a general substitute or representative
           verb, and thus save the repetition of the principal
           verb. ``To live and die is all we have to do.''
           --Denham. In the case of do and did as auxiliaries,
           the sense may be completed by the infinitive (without

   (Sirius) with the sun. Popularly, the sultry, close part of

   Note: The conjunction of the rising of the Dog Star with the
         rising of the sun was regarded by the ancients as one
         of the causes of the sultry heat of summer, and of the
         maladies which then prevailed. But as the conjunction
         does not occur at the same time in all latitudes, and
         is not constant in the same region for a long period,
         there has been much variation in calendars regarding

         states that in an ancient calendar in Bede (died 735)
         the beginning of dog days is placed on the 14th of
         July; that in a calendar prefixed to the Common Prayer,
         printed in the time of Queen Elizabeth, they were said
         to begin on the 6th of July and end on the 5th of
         September; that, from the Restoration (1660) to the
         beginning of New Style (1752), British almanacs placed
         the beginning on the 19th of July and the end on the
         28th of August; and that after 1752 the beginning was
         put on the 30th of July, the end on the 7th of
         September. Some English calendars now put the beginning
         on July 3d, and the ending on August 11th. A popular
         American almanac of the present time (1890) places the
         beginning on the 25th of July, and the end on the 5th
         of September.

                                                  Whewell.

   2. A formally stated and authoritatively settled doctrine; a

   3. A doctrinal notion asserted without regard to evidence or

   Syn: tenet; opinion; proposition; doctrine.

   Usage: -- {Dogma}, {Tenet}. A tenet is that which is
          maintained as true with great firmness; as, the tenets
          of our holy religion. A dogma is that which is laid
          down with authority as indubitably true, especially a
          religious doctrine; as, the dogmas of the church. A
          tenet rests on its own intrinsic merits or demerits; a
          dogma rests on authority regarded as competent to
          decide and determine. Dogma has in our language
          acquired, to some extent, a repulsive sense, from its
          carrying with it the idea of undue authority or
          assumption. This is more fully the case with its
          derivatives dogmatical and dogmatism.

   Syn: To {Draw}, {Drag}.

   Usage: Draw differs from drag in this, that drag implies a
          natural inaptitude for drawing, or positive
          resistance; it is applied to things pulled or hauled
          along the ground, or moved with toil or difficulty.
          Draw is applied to all bodies moved by force in
          advance, whatever may be the degree of force; it
          commonly implies that some kind of aptitude or
          provision exists for drawing. Draw is the more general
          or generic term, and drag the more specific. We say,
          the horses draw a coach or wagon, but they drag it
          through mire; yet draw is properly used in both cases.
