          objects; high and lofty have a moral acceptation; as,

   a cutting, cut tally, fr. tailler to cut, but influenced
   probably by taill['e], p. p. of tailler. See {Tailor}, and
   cf. {Tail} a limitation, {Taille}, {Tallage}.]
   1. Originally, a piece of wood on which notches or scores
      were cut, as the marks of number; later, one of two books,
      sheets of paper, etc., on which corresponding accounts
      were kept.

   Note: In purshasing and selling, it was once customary for
         traders to have two sticks, or one stick cleft into two
         parts, and to mark with a score or notch, on each, the
         number or quantity of goods delivered, -- the seller
         keeping one stick, and the purchaser the other. Before
         the use of writing, this, or something like it, was the
         only method of keeping accounts; and tallies were
         received as evidence in courts of justice. In the
         English exchequer were tallies of loans, one part being
         kept in the exchequer, the other being given to the
         creditor in lieu of an obligation for money lent to
         government.

   2. Hence, any account or score kept by notches or marks,
      whether on wood or paper, or in a book; especially, one
      kept in duplicate.

   3. One thing made to suit another; a match; a mate.

            They were framed the tallies for each other.
                                                  --Dryden.

   4. A notch, mark, or score made on or in a tally; as, to make
      or earn a tally in a game.

   5. A tally shop. See {Tally shop}, below.

   {Tally shop}, a shop at which goods or articles are sold to
      customers on account, the account being kept in
      corresponding books, one called the tally, kept by the
      buyer, the other the counter tally, kept by the seller,
      and the payments being made weekly or otherwise by
      agreement. The trade thus regulated is called tally trade.

   3. (Physiol.) The one of the five senses by which certain
      properties of bodies (called their taste, savor, flavor)
      are ascertained by contact with the organs of taste.

   Note: Taste depends mainly on the contact of soluble matter
         with the terminal organs (connected with branches of
         the glossopharyngeal and other nerves) in the
         papill[ae] on the surface of the tongue. The base of

   Usage: {Taste}, {Sensibility}, {Judgment}. Some consider
          taste as a mere sensibility, and others as a simple
          exercise of judgment; but a union of both is requisite
          to the existence of anything which deserves the name.
          An original sense of the beautiful is just as
          necessary to [ae]sthetic judgments, as a sense of
          right and wrong to the formation of any just
          conclusions or moral subjects. But this ``sense of the
          beautiful'' is not an arbitrary principle. It is under
          the guidance of reason; it grows in delicacy and
          correctness with the progress of the individual and of
          society at large; it has its laws, which are seated in
          the nature of man; and it is in the development of
          these laws that we find the true ``standard of
          taste.''

                What, then, is taste, but those internal powers,
                Active and strong, and feelingly alive To each
                fine impulse? a discerning sense Of decent and
                sublime, with quick disgust From things
                deformed, or disarranged, or gross In species?
                This, nor gems, nor stores of gold, Nor purple
                state, nor culture, can bestow, But God alone,
                when first his active hand Imprints the secret
                bias of the soul.                 --Akenside.

      Camellia, Chinensis}). The shrub is a native of China, but
      has been introduced to some extent into some other
      countries.

   Note: Teas are classed as green or black, according to their
         color or appearance, the kinds being distinguished also
         by various other characteristic differences, as of
         taste, odor, and the like. The color, flavor, and
         quality are dependent upon the treatment which the
         leaves receive after being gathered. The leaves for
         green tea are heated, or roasted slightly, in shallow
         pans over a wood fire, almost immediately after being
         gathered, after which they are rolled with the hands
         upon a table, to free them from a portion of their
         moisture, and to twist them, and are then quickly
         dried. Those intended for black tea are spread out in
         the air for some time after being gathered, and then
         tossed about with the hands until they become soft and
         flaccid, when they are roasted for a few minutes, and
         rolled, and having then been exposed to the air for a
         few hours in a soft and moist state, are finally dried
         slowly over a charcoal fire. The operation of roasting
         and rolling is sometimes repeated several times, until
         the leaves have become of the proper color. The
         principal sorts of green tea are Twankay, the poorest
         kind; Hyson skin, the refuse of Hyson; Hyson, Imperial,
         and Gunpowder, fine varieties; and Young Hyson, a
         choice kind made from young leaves gathered early in
         the spring. Those of black tea are Bohea, the poorest
         kind; Congou; Oolong; Souchong, one of the finest
         varieties; and Pekoe, a fine-flavored kind, made
         chiefly from young spring buds. See {Bohea}, {Congou},
         {Gunpowder tea}, under {Gunpowder}, {Hyson}, {Oolong},
         and {Souchong}. --K. Johnson. Tomlinson.

   Note: ``No knowledge of . . . [tea] appears to have reached
         Europe till after the establishment of intercourse
         between Portugal and China in 1517. The Portuguese,
         however, did little towards the introduction of the
         herb into Europe, and it was not till the Dutch
         established themselves at Bantam early in 17th century,
         that these adventurers learned from the Chinese the
         habit of tea drinking, and brought it to Europe.''

   Syn: To vex; harass: annoy; disturb; irritate; plague;
        torment; mortify; tantalize; chagrin.

   Usage: {Tease}, {Vex}. To tease is literally to pull or
          scratch, and implies a prolonged annoyance in respect
          to little things, which is often more irritating, and
          harder to bear, than severe pain. Vex meant originally
          to seize and bear away hither and thither, and hence,
          to disturb; as, to vex the ocean with storms. This
          sense of the term now rarely occurs; but vex is still
          a stronger word than tease, denoting the disturbance
          or anger created by minor provocations, losses,
          disappointments, etc. We are teased by the buzzing of
          a fly in our eyes; we are vexed by the carelessness or
          stupidity of our servants.

                sanguine, particularly where the agency of
                others is concerned, sorrow may degenerate into
                vexation and chagrin.             --Cogan.

   electrical action.

   Note: The instruments used are classed as indicator,
         type-printing, symbol-printing, or chemical-printing
         telegraphs, according as the intelligence is given by
         the movements of a pointer or indicator, as in Cooke &

         recording instrument is now little used, the receiving
         operator reading by ear the combinations of long and
         short intervals of sound produced by the armature of an
         electro-magnet as it is put in motion by the opening
         and breaking of the circuit, which motion, in
         registering instruments, traces upon a ribbon of paper
         the lines and dots used to represent the letters of the
         alphabet. See Illustration in Appendix.

      movements of that at the sending station.

   {Electric telegraph}, or {Electro-magnetic telegraph}, a
      telegraph in which an operator at one station causes words
      or signs to be made at another by means of a current of

Telephone \Tel"e*phone\, n. [Gr. ? far off + ? sound.] (Physics)
   An instrument for reproducing sounds, especially articulate
   speech, at a distance.

   Note: The ordinary telephone consists essentially of a device
         by which currents of electricity, produced by sounds
         through the agency of certain mechanical devices and
         exactly corresponding in duration and intensity to the
         vibrations of the air which attend them, are
         transmitted to a distant station, and there, acting on
         suitable mechanism, reproduce similar sounds by
         repeating the vibrations. The necessary variations in
         the electrical currents are usually produced by means
         of a microphone attached to a thin diaphragm upon which
         the voice acts, and are intensified by means of an
         induction coil. In the magnetic telephone, or
         magneto-telephone, the diaphragm is of soft iron placed
         close to the pole of a magnet upon which is wound a
         coil of fine wire, and its vibrations produce
         corresponding vibrable currents in the wire by
         induction. The mechanical, or string, telephone is a
         device in which the voice or sound causes vibrations in
         a thin diaphragm, which are directly transmitted along
         a wire or string connecting it to a similar diaphragm
         at the remote station, thus reproducing the sound. It
         does not employ electricity.

   t['e]lescope. See {Telegraph}, and {-scope}.]
   An optical instrument used in viewing distant objects, as the
   heavenly bodies.

   Note: A telescope assists the eye chiefly in two ways; first,
         by enlarging the visual angle under which a distant
         object is seen, and thus magnifying that object; and,
         secondly, by collecting, and conveying to the eye, a
         larger beam of light than would enter the naked organ,
         thus rendering objects distinct and visible which would
         otherwise be indistinct and or invisible. Its essential
         parts are the object glass, or concave mirror, which
         collects the beam of light, and forms an image of the
         object, and the eyeglass, which is a microscope, by
         which the image is magnified.

   {Aplanatic telescope}, a telescope having an aplanatic
      eyepiece.

   {Astronomical telescope}, a telescope which has a simple
      eyepiece so constructed or used as not to reverse the

      astronomical observations.

   {Cassegrainian telescope}, a reflecting telescope invented by
      Cassegrain, which differs from the Gregorian only in
      having the secondary speculum convex instead of concave,

      represents objects inverted; the Gregorian, in their
      natural position. The Melbourne telescope (see Illust.
      under {Reflecting telescope}, below) is a Cassegrainian
      telescope.

   Unreasonable contempt of danger; extreme venturesomeness;
   rashness; as, the temerity of a commander in war.

   Syn: Rashness; precipitancy; heedlessness; venturesomeness.

   Usage: {Temerity}, {Rashness}. These words are closely allied
          in sense, but have a slight difference in their use
          and application. Temerity is Latin, and rashness is
          Anglo-Saxon. As in many such cases, the Latin term is
          more select and dignified; the Anglo-Saxon more
          familiar and energetic. We show temerity in hasty
          decisions, and the conduct to which they lead. We show
          rashness in particular actions, as dictated by sudden
          impulse. It is an exhibition of temerity to approach
          the verge of a precipice; it is an act of rashness to
          jump into a river without being able to swim.
          Temerity, then, is an unreasonable contempt of danger;
          rashness is a rushing into danger from thoughtlessness
          or excited feeling.

                It is notorious temerity to pass sentence upon
                grounds uncapable of evidence.    --Barrow.

                Her rush hand in evil hour Forth reaching to the
                fruit, she plucked, she eat.      --Milton.

   2. (Eng. Law) The manner of holding lands and tenements of a
      superior.

   Note: Tenure is inseparable from the idea of property in
         land, according to the theory of the English law; and

         the law of real property in the United States, where
         the title to land is essentially allodial, and almost
         all lands are held in fee simple, not of a superior,
         but the whole right and title to the property being
         vested in the owner. Tenure, in general, then, is the
         particular manner of holding real estate, as by
         exclusive title or ownership, by fee simple, by fee
         tail, by courtesy, in dower, by copyhold, by lease, at
         will, etc.

   3. The consideration, condition, or service which the
      occupier of land gives to his lord or superior for the use
      of his land.

   4. Manner of holding, in general; as, in absolute

         January; Easter term, beginning on the 15th of April,

         Michaelmas term, beginning on the 2d and ending on the

         vacation. But this division has been practically
         abolished by the Judicature Acts of 1873, 1875, which
         provide for the more convenient arrangement of the
         terms and vacations. In the United States, the terms to

         by the statutes of Congress and of the several States.

   6. (Logic) The subject or the predicate of a proposition; one
      of the three component parts of a syllogism, each one of
      which is used twice.

            The subject and predicate of a proposition are,
            after Aristotle, together called its terms or
            extremes.                             --Sir W.
                                                  Hamilton.

   Note: The predicate of the conclusion is called the major
         term, because it is the most general, and the subject
         of the conclusion is called the minor term, because it
         is less general. These are called the extermes; and the
         third term, introduced as a common measure between
         them, is called the mean or middle term. Thus in the
         following syllogism, -- Every vegetable is combustible;
         Every tree is a vegetable; Therefore every tree is
         combustible, - combustible, the predicate of the
         conclusion, is the major term; tree is the minor term;
         vegetable is the middle term.

   7. A word or expression; specifically, one that has a
      precisely limited meaning in certain relations and uses,
      or is peculiar to a science, art, profession, or the like;

         narrowest at the base. Terms rudely carved were

   9. (Alg.) A member of a compound quantity; as, a or b in a +
      b; ab or cd in ab - cd.

         11; and two conventional terms -- Candlemas, Feb. 2,

   {Terms of a proportion} (Math.), the four members of which it
      is composed.

      submit; to force (one) to come to terms.

   {To make terms}, to come to terms; to make an agreement: to
      agree.

   Syn: Limit; bound; boundary; condition; stipulation; word;
        expression.

   Usage: {Term}, {Word}. These are more frequently interchanged
          than almost any other vocables that occur of the
          language. There is, however, a difference between them
          which is worthy of being kept in mind. Word is
          generic; it denotes an utterance which represents or
          expresses our thoughts and feelings. Term originally
          denoted one of the two essential members of a
          proposition in logic, and hence signifies a word of
          specific meaning, and applicable to a definite class
          of objects. Thus, we may speak of a scientific or a
          technical term, and of stating things in distinct
          terms. Thus we say, ``the term minister literally
          denotes servant;'' ``an exact definition of terms is
          essential to clearness of thought;'' ``no term of
          reproach can sufficiently express my indignation;''
          ``every art has its peculiar and distinctive terms,''
          etc. So also we say, ``purity of style depends on the
          choice of words, and precision of style on a clear
          understanding of the terms used.'' Term is chiefly
          applied to verbs, nouns, and adjectives, these being
          capable of standing as terms in a logical proposition;
          while prepositions and conjunctions, which can never
          be so employed, are rarely spoken of as terms, but
          simply as words.

                ``In eight terse lines has Ph[ae]drus told (So

                and closed with grace, Plan, moral, all, in that
                short space.'' It differs from concise in not
          implying, perhaps, quite as much condensation, but
          chiefly in the additional idea of ``grace or
          elegance.'' -- {Terse"ly}, adv. -- {Terse"ness}, n.

   Syn: Proof; evidence; attestation; witness; affirmation;

   Usage: {Testimony}, {Proof}, {Evidence}. Proof is the most
          familiar, and is used more frequently (though not
          exclusively) of facts and things which occur in the
          ordinary concerns of life. Evidence is a word of more
          dignity, and is more generally applied to that which
          is moral or intellectual; as, the evidences of
          Christianity, etc. Testimony is what is deposed to by
          a witness on oath or affirmation. When used
          figuratively or in a wider sense, the word testimony
          has still a reference to some living agent as its
          author, as when we speak of the testimony of
          conscience, or of doing a thing in testimony of our
          affection, etc. Testimony refers rather to the thing
          declared, evidence to its value or effect. ``To
          conform our language more to common use, we ought to
          divide arguments into demonstrations, proofs, and
          probabilities; ba proofs, meaning such arguments from
          experience as leave no room for doubt or opposition.''
          --Hume. ``The evidence of sense is the first and
          highest kind of evidence of which human nature is
          capable.'' --Bp. Wilkins. ``The proof of everything
          must be by the testimony of such as the parties
          produce.'' --Spenser.

   nom. & acc. sing. of the article (originally a demonstrative
   pronoun). The nom. masc. s[=e], and the nom. fem. se['o] are
   from a different root. AS. [eth][ae]t is akin to D. dat, G.
   das, OHG. daz, Sw. & Dan. det, Icel. [thorn]at (masc. s[=a],
   fem. s[=o]), Goth. [thorn]ata (masc. sa, fem. s[=o]), Gr. ?
   (masc. ?, fem. ?), Skr. tat (for tad, masc. sas, fem. s[=a]);
   cf. L. istud that. [root]184. Cf. {The}, {Their}, {They},
   {Them}, {This}, {Than}, {Since}.]
   1. As a demonstrative pronoun (pl. {Those}), that usually
      points out, or refers to, a person or thing previously
      mentioned, or supposed to be understood. That, as a
      demonstrative, may precede the noun to which it refers;
      as, that which he has said is true; those in the basket
      are good apples.

            The early fame of Gratian was equal to that of the
            most celebrated princes.              --Gibbon.

   Note: That may refer to an entire sentence or paragraph, and
         not merely to a word. It usually follows, but sometimes
         precedes, the sentence referred to.

               That be far from thee, to do after this manner,
               to slay the righteous with the wicked. --Gen.
                                                  xviii. 25.

               And when Moses heard that, he was content. --Lev.

               I will know your business, Harry, that I will.
                                                  --Shak.

   Note: That is often used in opposition to this, or by way of
         distinction, and in such cases this, like the Latin hic
         and French ceci, generally refers to that which is
         nearer, and that, like Latin ille and French cela, to
         that which is more remote. When they refer to foreign
         words or phrases, this generally refers to the latter,
         and that to the former.

               Two principles in human nature reign; Self-love,
               to urge, and Reason, to restrain; Nor this a
               good, nor that a bad we call.      --Pope.

               If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this or
               that.                              --James iv.
                                                  16.

   2. As an adjective, that has the same demonstrative force as
      the pronoun, but is followed by a noun.

            It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in
            the day of judgment, than for that city. --Matt. x.
                                                  15.

            The woman was made whole from that hour. --Matt. ix.
                                                  22.

   Note: That was formerly sometimes used with the force of the
         article the, especially in the phrases that one, that
         other, which were subsequently corrupted into th'tone,
         th'tother (now written t'other).

               Upon a day out riden knightes two . . . That one
               of them came home, that other not. --Chaucer.

   3. As a relative pronoun, that is equivalent to who or which,
      serving to point out, and make definite, a person or thing
      spoken of, or alluded to, before, and may be either
      singular or plural.

            He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself
            shame.                                --Prov. ix. 7.

            A judgment that is equal and impartial must incline
            to the greater probabilities.         --Bp. Wilkins.



   Note: If the relative clause simply conveys an additional
         idea, and is not properly explanatory or restrictive,
         who or which (rarely that) is employed; as, the king
         that (or who) rules well is generally popular;
         Victoria, who (not that) rules well, enjoys the
         confidence of her subjects. Ambiguity may in some cases
         be avoided in the use of that (which is restrictive)
         instead of who or which, likely to be understood in a
         co["o]rdinating sense. --Bain. That was formerly used
         for that which, as what is now; but such use is now
         archaic.

               We speak that we do know, and testify that we
               have seen.                         --John iii.
                                                  11.

               That I have done it is thyself to wite [blame].
                                                  --Chaucer.
         That, as a relative pronoun, cannot be governed by a
         preposition preceding it, but may be governed by one at
         the end of the sentence which it commences.

               The ship that somebody was sailing in. --Sir W.
                                                  Scott.
         In Old English, that was often used with the
         demonstratives he, his, him, etc., and the two together
         had the force of a relative pronoun; thus, that he =
         who; that his = whose; that him = whom.

               I saw to-day a corpse yborn to church That now on
               Monday last I saw him wirche [work]. --Chaucer.
         Formerly, that was used, where we now commonly use
         which, as a relative pronoun with the demonstrative
         pronoun that as its antecedent.

               That that dieth, let it die; and that that is to
               cut off, let it be cut off.        --Zech. xi. 9.

   4. As a conjunction, that retains much of its force as a
      demonstrative pronoun. It is used, specifically:
      (a) To introduce a clause employed as the object of the
          preceding verb, or as the subject or predicate
          nominative of a verb.

                She tells them 't is a causeless fantasy, And
                childish error, that they are afraid. --Shak.

                I have shewed before, that a mere possibility to
                the contrary, can by no means hinder a thing
                from being highly credible.       --Bp. Wilkins.
      (b) To introduce, a reason or cause; -- equivalent to for
          that, in that, for the reason that, because.

                He does hear me; And that he does, I weep.
                                                  --Shak.
      (c) To introduce a purpose; -- usually followed by may, or
          might, and frequently preceded by so, in order, to the
          end, etc.

                These things I say, that ye might be saved.
                                                  --John v. 34.

                To the end that he may prolong his days. --Deut.
                                                  xvii. 20.
      (d) To introduce a consequence, result, or effect; --
          usually preceded by so or such, sometimes by that.

                The birds their notes renew, and bleating herds
                Attest their joy, that hill and valley rings.
                                                  --Milton.

                He gazed so long That both his eyes were
                dazzled.                          --Tennyson.
      (e) To introduce a clause denoting time; -- equivalent to
          in which time, at which time, when.

                So wept Duessa until eventide, That shining
                lamps in Jove's high course were lit. --Spenser.

                Is not this the day That Hermia should give
                answer of her choice?             --Shak.
      (f) In an elliptical sentence to introduce a dependent
          sentence expressing a wish, or a cause of surprise,
          indignation, or the like.

                Ha, cousin Silence, that thou hadst seen that
                that this knight and I have seen! --Shak.



      O God, that right should thus overcome might! --Shak.

         convertible into hypothesis, and hypothesis is commonly
         used as another term for conjecture. The terms theory
         and theoretical are properly used in opposition to the
         terms practice and practical. In this sense, they were

         capillary bore, terminating in a bulb, and containing
         mercury or alcohol, which expanding or contracting
         according to the temperature to which it is exposed,
         indicates the degree of heat or cold by the amount of
         space occupied, as shown by the position of the top of
         the liquid column on a graduated scale. See
         {Centigrade}, {Fahrenheit}, and {R['e]aumur}. To reduce
         degrees Fahrenheit to degrees Centigrade, substract
         32[deg] and multiply by 5/9; to reduce degrees

   and probably to Skr. aditi unlimited, endless, where a- is a
   negative prefix. [root]58. Cf. {Tidings}, {Tidy}, {Till},

   2. The alternate rising and falling of the waters of the
      ocean, and of bays, rivers, etc., connected therewith. The
      tide ebbs and flows twice in each lunar day, or the space
      of a little more than twenty-four hours. It is occasioned
      by the attraction of the sun and moon (the influence of
      the latter being three times that of the former), acting
      unequally on the waters in different parts of the earth,
      thus disturbing their equilibrium. A high tide upon one
      side of the earth is accompanied by a high tide upon the
      opposite side. Hence, when the sun and moon are in
      conjunction or opposition, as at new moon and full moon,
      their action is such as to produce a greater than the
      usual tide, called the {spring tide}, as represented in
      the cut. When the moon is in the first or third quarter,
      the sun's attraction in part counteracts the effect of the
      moon's attraction, thus producing under the moon a smaller
      tide than usual, called the {neap tide}.

   Note: The flow or rising of the water is called flood tide,
         and the reflux, ebb tide.

   3. A stream; current; flood; as, a tide of blood. ``Let in
      the tide of knaves once more; my cook and I'll provide.''

      course; current.

   6. (Mining) The period of twelve hours.

   {Tide day}, the interval between the occurrences of two
      consecutive maxima of the resultant wave at the same
      place. Its length varies as the components of sun and moon
      waves approach to, or recede from, one another. A
      retardation from this cause is called the lagging of the
      tide, while the acceleration of the recurrence of high
      water is termed the priming of the tide. See {Lag of the
      tide}, under 2d {Lag}.

          intelligence from any quarter; the term tidings
          denotes intelligence expected from a particular

          impending battle. We may be curious to hear the news;
          we are always anxious for tidings.

                Evil news rides post, while good news baits.

   Syn: Temporizing.

   Usage: {Timeserving}, {Temporizing}. Both these words are
          applied to the conduct of one who adapts himself

          active, and a temporizer, passive. One whose policy is
          timeserving comes forward to act upon principles or
          opinions which may promote his advancement; one who is
          temporizing yields to the current of public sentiment
          or prejudice, and shrinks from a course of action
          which might injure him with others. The former is
          dishonest; the latter is weak; and both are
          contemptible.

                Trimming and timeserving, which are but two
                words for the same thing, . . . produce
                confusion.                        --South.

                [I] pronounce thee . . . a hovering temporizer,
                that Canst with thine eyes at once see good and

   An obsolete intensive prefix used in the formation of

   in endo, indu, in, Gr. ?, as in ? homeward. [root]200. Cf.
   {Too}, {Tatoo} a beat of drums.]
   1. The preposition to primarily indicates approach and

            Stay with us, go not to Wittenberg.   --Shak.

      being regarded as a limit to a tendency, movement, or
      action; as, he is going to a trade; he is rising to wealth
      and honor.

   Note: Formerly, by omission of the verb denoting motion, to
         sometimes followed a form of be, with the sense of at,
         or in. ``When the sun was [gone or declined] to rest.''
         --Chaucer.

   3. In a very general way, and with innumerable varieties of
      application, to connects transitive verbs with their
      remoter or indirect object, and adjectives, nouns, and
      neuter or passive verbs with a following noun which limits
      their action. Its sphere verges upon that of for, but it
      contains less the idea of design or appropriation; as,
      these remarks were addressed to a large audience; let us
      keep this seat to ourselves; a substance sweet to the
      taste; an event painful to the mind; duty to God and to
      our parents; a dislike to spirituous liquor.

            and to knowledge temperance; and to temperance
            patience; and to patience godliness; and to
            godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly
            kindness charity.                     --2 Pet. i.
                                                  5,6,7.

            I have a king's oath to the contrary. --Shak.

            Go, buckle to the law.                --Dryden.

   4. As sign of the infinitive, to had originally the use of
      last defined, governing the infinitive as a verbal noun,
      and connecting it as indirect object with a preceding verb
      or adjective; thus, ready to go, i.e., ready unto going;
      good to eat, i.e., good for eating; I do my utmost to lead
      my life pleasantly. But it has come to be the almost
      constant prefix to the infinitive, even in situations
      where it has no prepositional meaning, as where the
      infinitive is direct object or subject; thus, I love to
      learn, i.e., I love learning; to die for one's country is
      noble, i.e., the dying for one's country. Where the
      infinitive denotes the design or purpose, good usage
      formerly allowed the prefixing of for to the to; as, what
      went ye out for see? (--Matt. xi. 8).

            Then longen folk to go on pilgrimages, And palmers
            for to seeken strange stranders.      --Chaucer.

   Note: Such usage is now obsolete or illiterate. In colloquial
         usage, to often stands for, and supplies, an infinitive
         already mentioned; thus, he commands me to go with him,
         but I do not wish to.

   5. In many phrases, and in connection with many other words,
      to has a pregnant meaning, or is used elliptically. Thus,
      it denotes or implies:
      (a) Extent; limit; degree of comprehension; inclusion as
          far as; as, they met us to the number of three
          hundred.

                We ready are to try our fortunes To the last
                man.                              --Shak.

                                                  Rev.
      (b) Effect; end; consequence; as, the prince was flattered
          to his ruin; he engaged in a war to his cost; violent
          factions exist to the prejudice of the state.
      (c) Apposition; connection; antithesis; opposition; as,
          they engaged hand to hand.

                Now we see through a glass, darkly; but then
                face to face.                     --1 Cor. xiii.
                                                  12.
      (d) Accord; adaptation; as, an occupation to his taste;
          she has a husband to her mind.

                He to God's image, she to his was made.

      (e) Comparison; as, three is to nine as nine is to
          twenty-seven; it is ten to one that you will offend
          him.

                All that they did was piety to this. --B.
                                                  Jonson.

Toad \Toad\, n. [OE. tode, tade, AS. t[=a]die, t[=a]dige; of

   Any one of numerous species of batrachians belonging to the
   genus {Bufo} and allied genera, especially those of the
   family {Bufonid[ae]}. Toads are generally terrestrial in
   their habits except during the breeding season, when they
   seek the water. Most of the species burrow beneath the earth
   in the daytime and come forth to feed on insects at night.
   Most toads have a rough, warty skin in which are glands that
   secrete an acrid fluid.

         are familiar European species. The common American toad
         ({B. lentiginosus}) is similar to the European toad,

         leaping.

Tone \Tone\, n. [F. ton, L. tonus a sound, tone, fr. Gr. ? a

   measure or meter, in pl., modes or keys differing in pitch;
   akin to ? to stretch or strain. See {Thin}, and cf.

          the octave; she has good high tones.
      (b) The larger kind of interval between contiguous sounds
          in the diatonic scale, the smaller being called a

          instrument; as, a rich tone, a reedy tone.
      (d) A mode or tune or plain chant; as, the Gregorian
          tones.

   Note: The use of the word tone, both for a sound and for the
         interval between two sounds or tones, is confusing, but
         is common -- almost universal.

   Note: Nearly every musical sound is composite, consisting of
         several simultaneous tones having different rates of
         vibration according to fixed laws, which depend upon
         the nature of the vibrating body and the mode of
         excitation. The components (of a composite sound) are
         called partial tones; that one having the lowest rate
         of vibration is the fundamental tone, and the other
         partial tones are called harmonics, or overtones. The
         vibration ratios of the partial tones composing any
         sound are expressed by all, or by a part, of the
         numbers in the series 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc.; and the
         quality of any sound (the tone color) is due in part to
         the presence or absence of overtones as represented in
         this series, and in part to the greater or less
         intensity of those present as compared with the
         fundamental tone and with one another. Resultant tones,
         combination tones, summation tones, difference tones,
         Tartini's tones (terms only in part synonymous) are
         produced by the simultaneous sounding of two or more
         primary (simple or composite) tones.

   5. (Med.) That state of a body, or of any of its organs or
      parts, in which the animal functions are healthy and
      performed with due vigor.

   Note: In this sense, the word is metaphorically applied to
         character or faculties, intellectual and moral; as, his
         mind has lost its tone.

   6. (Physiol.) Tonicity; as, arterial tone.

   7. State of mind; temper; mood.

            state of public affairs, . . . drag the mind down .

            drudgery of private and public business.

   1. (Anat.) One of the hard, bony appendages which are borne
      on the jaws, or on other bones in the walls of the mouth
      or pharynx of most vertebrates, and which usually aid in
      the prehension and mastication of food.

   Note: The hard parts of teeth are principally made up of
         dentine, or ivory, and a very hard substance called
         enamel. These are variously combined in different
         animals. Each tooth consist of three parts, a crown, or
         body, projecting above the gum, one or more fangs
         imbedded in the jaw, and the neck, or intermediate
         part. In some animals one or more of the teeth are
         modified into tusks which project from the mouth, as in
         both sexes of the elephant and of the walrus, and in
         the male narwhal. In adult man there are thirty-two
         teeth, composed largely of dentine, but the crowns are
         covered with enamel, and the fangs with a layer of bone
         called cementum. Of the eight teeth on each half of
         each jaw, the two in front are incisors, then come one
         canine, cuspid, or dog tooth, two bicuspids, or false
         molars, and three molars, or grinding teeth. The milk,
         or temporary, teeth are only twenty in number, there
         being two incisors, one canine, and two molars on each
         half of each jaw. The last molars, or wisdom teeth,
         usually appear long after the others, and occasionally
         do not appear above the jaw at all.

         during the struggle in Parliament occasioned by the
         introduction of the bill for the exclusion of the duke
         of York from the line of succession, and was applied by
         the advocates of the bill to its opponents as a title
         of obloquy or contempt. The Tories subsequently took a
         broader ground, and their leading principle became the
         maintenance of things as they were. The name, however,
         has for several years ceased to designate an existing
         party, but is rather applied to certain traditional
         maxims of public policy. The political successors of
         the Tories are now commonly known as Conservatives.

         to S. W. on the north side of the equator, and from S.
         E. to N. W. on the south side of the equator. They are
         produced by the joint effect of the rotation of the
         earth and the movement of the air from the polar toward
         the equatorial regions, to supply the vacancy caused by
         heating, rarefaction, and consequent ascent of the air
         in the latter regions. The trade winds are principally
         limited to two belts in the tropical regions, one on
         each side of the equator, and separated by a belt which
         is characterized by calms or variable weather.

   2. (Philos.) In the Kantian system, of or pertaining to that
      which can be determined a priori in regard to the
      fundamental principles of all human knowledge. What is
      transcendental, therefore, transcends empiricism; but is
      does not transcend all human knowledge, or become
      transcendent. It simply signifies the a priori or
      necessary conditions of experience which, though affording
      the conditions of experience, transcend the sphere of that

   {Transcendental function}. (Math.) See under {Function}.

   Syn: {Transcendental}, {Empirical}.

   Usage: These terms, with the corresponding nouns,
          transcendentalism and empiricism, are of comparatively
          recent origin. Empirical refers to knowledge which is
          gained by the experience of actual phenomena, without
          reference to the principles or laws to which they are
          to be referred, or by which they are to be explained.
          Transcendental has reference to those beliefs or
          principles which are not derived from experience, and
          yet are absolutely necessary to make experience
          possible or useful. Such, in the better sense of the
          term, is the transcendental philosophy, or
          transcendentalism. Each of these words is also used in
          a bad sense, empiricism applying to that one-sided
          view of knowledge which neglects or loses sight of the
          truths or principles referred to above, and trusts to
          experience alone; transcendentalism, to the opposite
          extreme, which, in its deprecation of experience,
          loses sight of the relations which facts and phenomena
          sustain to principles, and hence to a kind of
          philosophy, or a use of language, which is vague,
          obscure, fantastic, or extravagant.

Transcendental \Tran`scen*den"tal\, n.
   A transcendentalist. [Obs.]

Transcendentalism \Tran`scen*den"tal*ism\, n. [Cf. F.
   transcendantalisme, G. transcendentalismus.]
   1. (Kantian Philos.) The transcending, or going beyond,
      empiricism, and ascertaining a priori the fundamental
      principles of human knowledge.

   Note: As Schelling and Hegel claim to have discovered the
         absolute identity of the objective and subjective in
         human knowledge, or of things and human conceptions of
         them, the Kantian distinction between transcendent and
         transcendental ideas can have no place in their
         philosophy; and hence, with them, transcendentalism
         claims to have a true knowledge of all things, material
         and immaterial, human and divine, so far as the mind is
         capable of knowing them. And in this sense the word
         transcendentalism is now most used. It is also
         sometimes used for that which is vague and illusive in
         philosophy.

   2. Ambitious and imaginative vagueness in thought, imagery,
      or diction.

Transcendentalist \Tran`scen*den"tal*ist\, n. [Cf. F.

      France, where it was first adopted in Europe. The troy
      ounce is supposed to have been brought from Cairo during
      the crusades. In this weight the pound is divided into 12
      ounces, the ounce into 20 pennyweights, and the
      pennyweight into 24 grains; hence, the troy ounce contains
      480 grains, and the troy pound contains 5760 grains. The
      avoirdupois pound contains 7000 troy grains; so that 175
      pounds troy equal 144 pounds avoirdupois, or 1 pound troy
      = 0.82286 of a pound avoirdupois, and 1 ounce troy =
      117/175 or 1.09714 ounce avoirdupois. Troy weight when
      divided, the pound into 12 ounces, the ounce into 8 drams,
      the dram into 3 scruples, and the scruple into 20 grains,
      is called apothecaries' weight, used in weighing
      medicines, etc. In the standard weights of the United
      States, the troy ounce is divided decimally down to the
      1/10000 part.

         surface, called the composition face, which is usually

   4. That which possesses or exemplifies characteristic
      qualities; the representative. Specifically:
      (a) (Biol.) A general form or structure common to a number

          quantity of them used in printing, spoken of
          collectively; any number or mass of such letters or
          characters, however disposed.

   Note: Type are mostly made by casting type metal in a mold,
         though some of the larger sizes are made from maple,
         mahogany, or boxwood. In the cut, a is the body; b, the
         face, or part from which the impression is taken; c,
         the shoulder, or top of the body; d, the nick
         (sometimes two or more are made), designed to assist
         the compositor in distinguishing the bottom of the face
         from the top; e, the groove made in the process of
         finishing, -- each type as cast having attached to the
         bottom of the body a jet, or small piece of metal
         (formed by the surplus metal poured into the mold),
         which, when broken off, leaves a roughness that
         requires to be removed. The fine lines at the top and
         bottom of a letter are technically called ceriphs, and
         when part of the face projects over the body, as in the
         letter f, the projection is called a kern. The type
         which compose an ordinary book font consist of Roman
         CAPITALS, small capitals, and lower-case letters, and
         Italic CAPITALS and lower-case letters, with
         accompanying figures, points, and reference marks, --
         in all about two hundred characters. Including the
         various modern styles of fancy type, some three or four
         hundred varieties of face are made. Besides the
         ordinary Roman and Italic, some of the most important
         of the varieties are -- Old English. Black Letter. Old
         Style. French Elzevir. Boldface. Antique. Clarendon.
         Gothic. Typewriter. Script. The smallest body in common
         use is diamond; then follow in order of size, pearl,
         agate, nonpareil, minion, brevier, bourgeois (or
         two-line diamond), long primer (or two-line pearl),
         small pica (or two-line agate), pica (or two-line
         nonpareil), English (or two-line minion), Columbian (or
         two-line brevier), great primer (two-line bourgeois),
         paragon (or two-line long primer), double small pica
         (or two-line small pica), double pica (or two-line
         pica), double English (or two-line English), double
         great primer (or two-line great primer), double paragon
         (or two-line paragon), canon (or two-line double pica).
         Above this, the sizes are called five-line pica,
         six-line pica, seven-line pica, and so on, being made
         mostly of wood. The following alphabets show the
         different sizes up to great primer. Brilliant . .

The foregoing account is conformed to the designations made use
of by American type founders, but is substantially correct for
England. Agate, however, is called ruby, in England, where,
also, a size intermediate between nonpareil and minion is
employed, called emerald.

   {Point system of type bodies} (Type Founding), a system
      adopted by the type founders of the United States by which
      the various sizes of type have been so modified and
      changed that each size bears an exact proportional
      relation to every other size. The system is a modification
      of a French system, and is based on the pica body. This
      pica body is divided into twelfths, which are termed
      ``points,'' and every type body consist of a given number
      of these points. Many of the type founders indicate the
      new sizes of type by the number of points, and the old
      names are gradually being done away with. By the point
      system type founders cast type of a uniform size and
      height, whereas formerly fonts of pica or other type made
      by different founders would often vary slightly so that
      they could not be used together. There are no type in
      actual use corresponding to the smaller theoretical sizes
      of the point system. In some cases, as in that of ruby,
      the term used designates a different size from that
      heretofore so called.

         hereditary sovereignties (basilei^ai), all who obtained
         absolute power in a state were called ty\rannoi,
         tyrants, or rather despots; -- for the term rather
         regards the irregular way in which the power was
         gained, whether force or fraud, than the way in which
         it was exercised, being applied to the mild
         Pisistratus, but not to the despotic kings of Persia.
         However, the word soon came to imply reproach, and was
         then used like our tyrant. --Liddell & Scott.

      oppressor. ``This false tyrant, this Nero.'' --Chaucer.
