O \O\ ([=o]).
   1. O, the fifteenth letter of the English alphabet, derives
      its form, value, and name from the Greek O, through the
      Latin. The letter came into the Greek from the
      Ph[oe]nician, which possibly derived it ultimately from
      the Egyptian. Etymologically, the letter o is most closely
      related to a, e, and u; as in E. bone, AS. b[=a]n; E.
      stone, AS. st[=a]n; E. broke, AS. brecan to break; E.
      bore, AS. beran to bear; E. dove, AS. d[=u]fe; E. toft,
      tuft; tone, tune; number, F. nombre. The letter o has
      several vowel sounds, the principal of which are its long
      sound, as in bone, its short sound, as in nod, and the
      sounds heard in the words orb, son, do (feod), and wolf
      (book). In connection with the other vowels it forms
      several digraphs and diphthongs. See Guide to
      Pronunciation, [sect][sect] 107-129.

   2. Among the ancients, O was a mark of triple time, from the
      notion that the ternary, or number 3, is the most perfect
      of numbers, and properly expressed by a circle, the most
      perfect figure. O was also anciently used to represent 11:
      with a dash over it ([=O]), 11,000.

O \O\ ([=o]), n.; pl. {O's} or {Oes} ([=o]z).
   1. The letter O, or its sound. ``Mouthing out his hollow oes
      and aes.'' --Tennyson.

   2. Something shaped like the letter O; a circle or oval.
      ``This wooden O [Globe Theater]''. --Shak.

   3. A cipher; zero. [R.]

            Thou art an O without a figure.       --Shak.

O' \O'\ [Ir. o a descendant.]
   A prefix to Irish family names, which signifies grandson or
   descendant of, and is a character of dignity; as, O'Neil,
   O'Carrol.

O' \O'\ ([=o]; unaccented [-o]), prep.
   A shortened form of of or on. ``At the turning o' the tide.''
   --Shak.

O \O\ ([=o]), a. [See {One}.]
   One. [Obs.] --Chaucer. ``Alle thre but o God.'' --Piers
   Plowman.

O \O\, interj.
   An exclamation used in calling or directly addressing a
   person or personified object; also, as an emotional or
   impassioned exclamation expressing pain, grief, surprise,
   desire, fear, etc.

         For ever, O Lord, thy word is settled in heaven. --Ps.
                                                  cxix. 89.

         O how love I thy law ! it is my meditation all the day.
                                                  --Ps. cxix.
                                                  97.

   Note: O is frequently followed by an ellipsis and that, an in
         expressing a wish: ``O [I wish] that Ishmael might live
         before thee !'' --Gen. xvii. 18; or in expressions of
         surprise, indignation, or regret: ``O [it is sad] that
         such eyes should e'er meet other object !'' --Sheridan
         Knowles.

   Note: A distinction between the use of O and oh is insisted
         upon by some, namely, that O should be used only in
         direct address to a person or personified object, and
         should never be followed by the exclamation point,
         while Oh (or oh) should be used in exclamations where
         no direct appeal or address to an object is made, and
         may be followed by the exclamation point or not,
         according to the nature or construction of the
         sentence. Some insist that oh should be used only as an
         interjection expressing strong feeling. The form O,
         however, is, it seems, the one most commonly employed
         for both uses by modern writers and correctors for the
         press. ``O, I am slain !'' --Shak. ``O what a fair and
         ministering angel !'' ``O sweet angel !'' --Longfellow.

               O for a kindling touch from that pure flame !
                                                  --Wordsworth.

               But she is in her grave, -- and oh The difference
               to me !                            --Wordsworth.

               Oh for a lodge in some vast wilderness !
                                                  --Cowper.

               We should distinguish between the sign of the
               vocative and the emotional interjection, writing
               O for the former, and oh for the latter. --Earle.

   {O dear}, & {O dear me!} [corrupted fr. F. O Dieu! or It. O
      Dio! O God! O Dio mio! O my God! --Wyman.], exclamations
      expressive of various emotions, but usually promoted by
      surprise, consternation, grief, pain, etc.

   2. (Metaph.) Of or pertaining to an object; contained in, or
      having the nature or position of, an object; outward;
      external; extrinsic; -- an epithet applied to whatever ir
      exterior to the mind, or which is simply an object of
      thought or feeling, and opposed to {subjective}.

            In the Middle Ages, subject meant substance, and has
            this sense in Descartes and Spinoza: sometimes,
            also, in Reid. Subjective is used by William of
            Occam to denote that which exists independent of
            mind; objective, what is formed by the mind. This
            shows what is meant by realitas objectiva in
            Descartes. Kant and Fichte have inverted the
            meanings. Subject, with them, is the mind which
            knows; object, that which is known; subjective, the
            varying conditions of the knowing mind; objective,
            that which is in the constant nature of the thing
            known.                                --Trendelenburg.

            Objective means that which belongs to, or proceeds
            from, the object known, and not from the subject
            knowing, and thus denotes what is real, in
            opposition to that which is ideal -- what exists in
            nature, in contrast to what exists merely in the
            thought of the individual.            --Sir. W.
                                                  Hamilton.

            Objective has come to mean that which has
            independent exostence or authority, apart from our
            experience or thought. Thus, moral law is said to
            have objective authority, that is, authority
            belonging to itself, and not drawn from anything in
            our nature.                           --Calderwood
                                                  (Fleming's
                                                  Vocabulary).

   3. (Gram.) Pertaining to, or designating, the case which
      follows a transitive verb or a preposition, being that
      case in which the direct object of the verb is placed. See
      {Accusative}, n.

   Note: The objective case is frequently used without a
         governing word, esp. in designations of time or space,
         where a preposition, as at, in, on, etc., may be
         supplied.

               My troublous dream [on] this night make me sad.
                                                  --Shak.

               To write of victories [in or for] next year.
                                                  --Hudibras.

   {Objective line} (Perspective), a line drawn on the
      geometrical plane which is represented or sought to be
      represented.

   {Objective plane} (Perspective), any plane in the horizontal
      plane that is represented.

   {Objective point}, the point or result to which the
      operations of an army are directed. By extension, the
      point or purpose to which anything, as a journey or an
      argument, is directed.

   Syn: {Objective}, {Subjective}.

   Usage: Objective is applied to things exterior to the mind,
          and objects of its attention; subjective, to the
          operations of the mind itself. Hence, an objective
          motive is some outward thing awakening desire; a
          subjective motive is some internal feeling or
          propensity. Objective views are those governed by
          outward things; subjective views are produced or
          modified by internal feeling. Sir Walter Scott's
          poetry is chiefly objective; that of Wordsworth is
          eminently subjective.

                In the philosophy of mind, subjective denotes
                what is to be referred to the thinking subject,
                the ego; objective what belongs to the object of
                thought, the non-ego.             --Sir. W.
                                                  Hamilton

   Syn: {Obstacle}; bar; barrier; impediment; clog; check;
        hindrance.

   Usage: {Obstruction}, {Obstacle}. The difference between
          these words is that indicated by their etymology; an
          obstacle is something standing in the way; an
          obstruction is something put in the way. Obstacle
          implies more fixedness and is the stronger word. We
          remove obstructions; we surmount obstacles.

                Disparity in age seems a greater obstacle to an
                intimate friendship than inequality of fortune.

   1. To hold; to keep; to possess. [Obs.]

      procure; to acquire, in any way.

            Some pray for riches; riches they obtain. --Dryden.

            By guileful fair words peace may be obtained.
                                                  --Shak.

            It may be that I may obtain children by her. --Gen.
                                                  xvi. 2.

   Syn: To attain; gain; procure; acquire; win; earn.

   Usage: See {Attain}. -- To {Obtain}, {Get}, {Gain}, {Earn},
          {Acquire}. The idea of getting is common to all these
          terms. We may, indeed, with only a slight change of
          sense, substitute get for either of them; as, to get
          or to gain a prize; to get or to obtain an employment;
          to get or to earn a living; to get or to acquire a
          language. To gain is to get by striving; and as this
          is often a part of our good fortune, the word gain is
          peculiarly applicable to whatever comes to us
          fortuitously. Thus, we gain a victory, we gain a
          cause, we gain an advantage, etc. To earn is to
          deserve by labor or service; as, to earn good wages;
          to earn a triumph. Unfortunately, one does not always
          get or obtain what he has earned. To obtain implies
          desire for possession, and some effort directed to the
          attainment of that which is not immediately within our
          reach. Whatever we thus seek and get, we obtain,
          whether by our own exertions or those of others;
          whether by good or bad means; whether permanently, or
          only for a time. Thus, a man obtains an employment; he
          obtains an answer to a letter, etc. To acquire is more
          limited and specific. We acquire what comes to us
          gradually in the regular exercise of our abilities,
          while we obtain what comes in any way, provided we
          desire it. Thus, we acquire knowledge, property,
          honor, reputation, etc. What we acquire becomes, to a
          great extent, permanently our own; as, to acquire a
          language; to acquire habits of industry, etc.

         property or possession, or a relation of some sort
         involving connection. These applications, however all
         proceeded from the same primary sense. That which
         proceeds from, or is produced by, a person or thing,
         either has had, or still has, a close connection with
         the same; and hence the word was applied to cases of
         mere connection, not involving at all the idea of
         separation.

   compounded with verbs, G. er-, ur-, Goth. us-, orig. meaning,
   out. See {Deal}, v. & n., and cf. {Arise}, {Ort}.]
   1. An ancient form of test to determine guilt or innocence,
      by appealing to a supernatural decision, -- once common in
      Europe, and still practiced in the East and by savage
      tribes.

   Note: In England ordeal by fire and ordeal by water were
         used, the former confined to persons of rank, the
         latter to the common people. The ordeal by fire was
         performed, either by handling red-hot iron, or by
         walking barefoot and blindfold over red-hot plowshares,
         laid at unequal distances. If the person escaped
         unhurt, he was adjudged innocent; otherwise he was
         condemned as guilty. The ordeal by water was performed,
         either by plunging the bare arm to the elbow in boiling
         water, an escape from injury being taken as proof of
         innocence, or by casting the accused person, bound hand
         and foot, into a river or pond, when if he floated it
         was an evidence of guilt, but if he sunk he was
         acquitted. It is probable that the proverbial phrase,
         to go through fire and water, denoting severe trial or
         danger, is derived from the ordeal. See {Wager of
         battle}, under {Wager}.

   2. Any severe trial, or test; a painful experience.

   {Ordeal bean}. (Bot.) See {Calabar bean}, under {Calabar}.

      lance dipped in the juice of the seeds.

      the doctrines taught in the Scriptures; -- opposed to
      {heretical} and {heterodox}; as, an orthodox Christian.

   Note: The term orthodox differs in its use among the various
         Christian communions. The Greek Church styles itself
         the ``Holy Orthodox Apostolic Church,'' regarding all
         other bodies of Christians as more or less heterodox.
         The Roman Catholic Church regards the Protestant
         churches as heterodox in many points. In the United
         States the term orthodox is frequently used with
         reference to divergent views on the doctrine of the
         Trinity. Thus it has been common to speak of the
         Trinitarian Congregational churches in distinction from
         the Unitarian, as Orthodox. The name is also applied to
         the conservative, in distinction from the ``liberal'',
         or Hicksite, body in the Society of Friends.

                                                  26.

         obligation, or the like, in the action or state

Oxide \Ox"ide\, n. [F. oxyg[`e]ne oxygen + acide acid: cf. F.
   oxyde. The French word was correctly spelt oxide, till about
   the year 1840, when, in ignorance or forgetfulness of the
   true history and composition of the word, the orthography was
   change to make it represent the [upsilon] of Gr. 'oxy`s, from
   which it was supposed to be directly derived.] (Chem.)
   A binary compound of oxygen with an atom or radical, or a
   compound which is regarded as binary; as, iron oxide, ethyl
   oxide, nitrogen oxide, etc.

   Note: In the chemical nomenclature adopted by Guyton de
         Morveau, Lavoisier,and their associates, the term
         oxides was made to include all compounds of oxygen
         which had no acid (F. acide) properties, as contrasted
         with the acids, all of which were at that time supposed
         to contain oxygen. The orthography oxyde, oxyd, etc.,
         was afterwards introduced in ignorance or disregard of
         the true etymology, but these forms are now obsolete in
         English. The spelling oxid is not common.

Oxidizable \Ox"i*di`za*ble\, a.
   Capable of being oxidized.

Oxidize \Ox"i*dize\, v. t. [imp. & p. p. {Oxidized}; p. pr. &
   vb. n. {Oxidizing}.] (Chem.)
   To combine with oxygen, or subject to the action of oxygen,
   or of an oxidizing agent. Specifically:
   (a) To combine with oxygen or with more oxygen; to add oxygen
       to; as, to oxidize nitrous acid so as to form nitric
       acid.
   (b) To remove hydrogen from (anything), as by the action of
       oxygen; as, to oxidize alcohol so as to form aldehyde.
   (c) To subject to the action of oxygen or of an oxidizing
       agent, so as to bring to a higher grade, as an -ous
       compound to an -ic compound; as, to oxidize mercurous
       chloride to mercuric chloride.

   Note: In certain cases to oxidize is identical with to
         acidify; for, in nearly all cases, the more oxygen a
         substance contains the more nearly does it approximate
         to acid qualities; thus, by oxidation many elements, as
         sulphur, nitrogen, carbon, chromium, manganese, etc.,
         pass into compounds which are acid anhydrides, and thus
         practically in the acid state.

   1. (Chem.) A colorless, tasteless, odorless, gaseous element
      occurring in the free state in the atmosphere, of which it
      forms about 23 per cent by weight and about 21 per cent by
      volume, being slightly heavier than nitrogen. Symbol O.
      Atomic weight 15.96.

   Note: It occurs combined in immense quantities, forming eight
         ninths by weight of water, and probably one half by
         weight of the entire solid crust of the globe, being an
         ingredient of silica, the silicates, sulphates,
         carbonates, nitrates, etc. Oxygen combines with all
         elements (except fluorine), forming oxides, bases,
         oxyacid anhydrides, etc., the process in general being
         called oxidation, of which combustion is only an
         intense modification. At ordinary temperatures with
         most substances it is moderately active, but at higher
         temperatures it is one of the most violent and powerful
         chemical agents known. It is indispensable in
         respiration, and in general is the most universally
         active and efficient element. It may be prepared in the
         pure state by heating potassium chlorate. This element
         (called dephlogisticated air by Priestley) was named
         oxygen by Lavoisier because he supposed it to be a
         constituent of all acids. This is not so in the case of
         a very few acids (as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydric
         sulphide, etc.), but these do contain elements
         analogous to oxygen in property and action. Moreover,
