   Syn: To cover; cloak; hide; extenuate; conceal.

   Usage: To {Palliate}, {Extenuate}, {Cloak}. These words, as
          here compared, are used in a figurative sense in
          reference to our treatment of wrong action. We cloak
          in order to conceal completely. We extenuate a crime
          when we endeavor to show that it is less than has been
          supposed; we palliate a crime when we endeavor to
          cover or conceal its enormity, at least in part. This
          naturally leads us to soften some of its features, and
          thus palliate approaches extenuate till they have
          become nearly or quite identical. ``To palliate is not
          now used, though it once was, in the sense of wholly
          cloaking or covering over, as it might be, our sins,
          but in that of extenuating; to palliate our faults is
          not to hide them altogether, but to seek to diminish
          their guilt in part.'' --Trench.

Palliation \Pal`li*a"tion\, n. [Cf. F. palliation.]
   1. The act of palliating, or state of being palliated;
      extenuation; excuse; as, the palliation of faults,
      offenses, vices.

   2. Mitigation; alleviation, as of a disease. --Bacon.

   3. That which cloaks or covers; disguise; also, the state of
      being covered or disguised. [Obs.]

   1. (Bot.) Any endogenous tree of the order {Palm[ae]} or

         unit, reproduces itself, the cells throwing off minute
         granules called gemmules, which circulate freely
         throughout the system and multiply by subdivision.
         These gemmules collect in the reproductive organs and
         products, or in buds, so that the egg or bud contains
         gemmules from all parts of the parent or parents, which
         in development give rise to cells in the offspring
         similar to those from which they were given off in the
         parent. The hypothesis also assumes that these gemmules
         need not in all cases develop into cells, but may lie
         dormant, and be transmitted from generation to
         generation without producing a noticeable effect until
         a case of atavism occurs.

          special and especial. They mark simply the relation of

          in this case more than ordinary; as, a special act of
          Congress; especial pains, etc.

   Syn: To discern; distinguish; observe; see; feel; know;
        understand.

   Usage: To {Perceive}, {Discern}. To perceive a thing is to
          apprehend it as presented to the senses or the
          intellect; to discern is to mark differences, or to
          see a thing as distinguished from others around it. We
          may perceive two persons afar off without being able
          to discern whether they are men or women. Hence,
          discern is often used of an act of the senses or the
          mind involving close, discriminating, analytical
          attention. We perceive that which is clear or obvious;
          we discern that which requires much attention to get
          an idea of it. ``We perceive light, darkness, colors,
          or the truth or falsehood of anything. We discern
          characters, motives, the tendency and consequences of
          actions, etc.'' --Crabb.

      conception. --Sir W. Hamilton.

            Matter hath no life nor perception, and is not
            conscious of its own existence.       --Bentley.

   3. The quality, state, or capability, of being affected by
      something external; sensation; sensibility. [Obs.]

            This experiment discovereth perception in plants.
                                                  --Bacon.

   4. An idea; a notion. [Obs.] --Sir M. Hale.

   Note: ``The word perception is, in the language of
         philosophers previous to Reid, used in a very extensive
         signification. By Descartes, Malebranche, Locke,
         Leibnitz, and others, it is employed in a sense almost
         as unexclusive as consciousness, in its widest
         signification. By Reid this word was limited to our
         faculty acquisitive of knowledge, and to that branch of
         this faculty whereby, through the senses, we obtain a
         knowledge of the external world. But his limitation did
         not stop here. In the act of external perception he
         distinguished two elements, to which he gave the names
         of perception and sensation. He ought perhaps to have
         called these perception proper and sensation proper,
         when employed in his special meaning.'' --Sir W.
         Hamilton.

Perceptive \Per*cep"tive\, a. [Cf. F. perceptif.]

   {Periodic law} (Chem.), the generalization that the
      properties of the chemical elements are periodic functions
      of their atomic wieghts. ``In other words, if the elements
      are grouped in the order of their atomic weights, it will
      be found that nearly the same properties recur
      periodically throughout the entire series.'' The following
      tabular arrangement of the atomic weights shows the
      regular recurrence of groups (under I., II., III., IV.,
      etc.), each consisting of members of the same natural
      family. The gaps in the table indicate the probable
      existence of unknown elements.

   Note: A similar relation had been enunciated in a crude way
         by Newlands; but the law in its effective form was
         developed and elaborated by Mendelejeff, whence it is
         sometimes called {Mendelejeff's law}. Important
         extensions of it were also made by L. Meyer. By this
         means Mendelejeff predicted with remarkable accuracy
         the hypothetical elements ekaboron, ekaluminium, and
         ekasilicon, afterwards discovered and named
         respectively scandium, gallium, and germanium.

   Syn: To allow; let; grant; admit; suffer; tolerate; endure;
        consent to.

   Usage: To {Allow}, {Permit}, {Suffer}, {Tolerate}. To allow
          is more positive, denoting (at least originally and

          prevention. The distinction, however, is often
          disregarded by good writers. To suffer has a stronger
          passive or negative sense than to permit, sometimes
          implying against the will, sometimes mere
          indifference. To tolerate is to endure what is
          contrary to will or desire. To suffer and to tolerate
          are sometimes used without discrimination.

         called physics; when it treats of man, it is called
         anthropology and psychology, with which are connected
         logic and ethics; when it treats of the necessary
         conceptions and relations by which philosophy is
         possible, it is called metaphysics.

   Note: ``Philosophy has been defined: tionscience of things
         divine and human, and the causes in which they are

         things possible, inasmuch as they are possible; -- the
         science of things evidently deduced from first
         principles; -- the science of truths sensible and

         all knowledge to the necessary ends of human reason; --
         the science of the original form of the ego, or mental
         self; -- the science of science; -- the science of the
         absolute; -- the scienceof the absolute indifference of
         the ideal and real.'' --Sir W. Hamilton.

Plant \Plant\, n. [AS. plante, L. planta.]
   1. A vegetable; an organized living being, generally without

      root, stem, and leaves, though consisting sometimes only
      of a single leafy expansion, or a series of cellules, or
      even a single cellule.

   Note: Plants are divided by their structure and methods of
         reproduction into two series, ph[ae]nogamous or
         flowering plants, which have true flowers and seeds,
         and cryptogamous or flowerless plants, which have no
         flowers, and reproduce by minute one-celled spores. In
         both series are minute and simple forms and others of
         great size and complexity. As to their mode of
         nutrition, plants may be considered as self-supporting
         and dependent. Self-supporting plants always contain
         chlorophyll, and subsist on air and moisture and the
         matter dissolved in moisture, and as a general rule
         they excrete oxygen, and use the carbonic acid to
         combine with water and form the material for their
         tissues. Dependent plants comprise all fungi and many
         flowering plants of a parasitic or saprophytic nature.
         As a rule, they have no chlorophyll, and subsist mainly
         or wholly on matter already organized, thus utilizing
         carbon compounds already existing, and not excreting
         oxygen. But there are plants which are partly dependent
         and partly self-supporting. The movements of climbing
         plants, of some insectivorous plants, of leaves,
         stamens, or pistils in certain plants, and the ciliary
         motion of zo["o]spores, etc., may be considered a kind
         of voluntary motion.

   2. A bush, or young tree; a sapling; hence, a stick or staff.

   3. The sole of the foot. [R.] ``Knotty legs and plants of

      business, but not including material worked upon or
      finished products; as, the plant of a foundry, a mill, or
      a railroad.

Platonism \Pla"to*nism\, n. [Cf. F. Platonisme.]
   1. The doctrines or philosophy by Plato or of his followers.

   Note: Plato believed God to be an infinitely wise, just, and
         powerful Spirit; and also that he formed the visible
         universe out of pre["e]xistent amorphous matter,
         according to perfect patterns of ideas eternally
         existent in his own mind. Philosophy he considered as
         being a knowledge of the true nature of things, as
         discoverable in those eternal ideas after which all
         things were fashioned. In other words, it is the
         knowledge of what is eternal, exists necessarily, and
         is unchangeable; not of the temporary, the dependent,
         and changeable; and of course it is not obtained
         through the senses; neither is it the product of the
         understanding, which concerns itself only with the
         variable and transitory; nor is it the result of
         experience and observation; but it is the product of
         our reason, which, as partaking of the divine nature,
         has innate ideas resembling the eternal ideas of God.
         By contemplating these innate ideas, reasoning about
         them, and comparing them with their copies in the
         visible universe, reason can attain that true knowledge
         of things which is called philosophy. Plato's professed
         followers, the Academics, and the New Platonists,
         differed considerably from him, yet are called
         Platonists. --Murdock.

   2. An elevated rational and ethical conception of the laws
      and forces of the universe; sometimes, imaginative or
      fantastic philosophical notions.

Platonist \Pla"to*nist\, n.

        enlivening; gay; lively; merry; sportive; humorous;
        jocose; amusing; witty.

   Usage: {Pleasant}, {Pleasing}, {Agreeable}. Agreeable is
          applied to that which agrees with, or is in harmony
          with, one's tastes, character, etc. Pleasant and
          pleasing denote a stronger degree of the agreeable.
          Pleasant refers rather to the state or condition;
          pleasing, to the act or effect. Where they are applied
          to the same object, pleasing is more energetic than
          pleasant; as, she is always pleasant and always
          pleasing. The distinction, however, is not radical and
          not rightly observed.

      swampy places. Both this plant and the poison ivy ({Rhus
      Toxicodendron}) have clusters of smooth greenish white
      berries, while the red-fruited species of this genus are
      harmless. The tree ({Rhus vernicifera}) which yields the
      celebrated Japan lacquer is almost identical with the
      poison sumac, and is also very poisonous. The juice of the
      poison sumac also forms a lacquer similar to that of
      Japan.

   Syn: Venom; virus; bane; pest; malignity.

   Usage: {Poison}, {Venom}. Poison usually denotes something
          received into the system by the mouth, breath, etc.
          Venom is something discharged from animals and
          received by means of a wound, as by the bite or sting
          of serpents, scorpions, etc. Hence, venom specifically
          implies some malignity of nature or purpose.

Polar \Po"lar\, n. (Conic Sections)
   The right line drawn through the two points of contact of the
   two tangents drawn from a given point to a given conic
   section. The given point is called the pole of the line. If

   tangents become imaginary, there is still a real polar line
   which does not meet the curve, but which possesses other
   properties of the polar. Thus the focus and directrix are
   pole and polar. There are also poles and polar curves to
   curves of higher degree than the second, and poles and polar

   Note: If a beam of light, which has been reflected from a
         plate of unsilvered glass at an angle of about 56[deg],
         be received upon a second plate of glass similar to the
         former, and at the same angle of incidence, the light
         will be readily reflected when the two planes of
         incidence are parallel to each other, but will not be
         reflected when the two planes of incidence are
         perpendicular to each other. The light has, therefore,
         acquired new properties by reflection from the first
         plate of glass, and is called polarized light, while
         the modification which the light has experienced by
         this reflection is called polarization. The plane in
         which the beam of light is reflected from the first
         mirror is called the plane of polarization. The angle
         of polarization is the angle at which a beam of light
         must be reflected, in order that the polarization may
         be the most complete. The term polarization was derived
         from the theory of emission, and it was conceived that
         each luminous molecule has two poles analogous to the
         poles of a magnet; but this view is not now held.
         According to the undulatory theory, ordinary light is
         produced by vibrations transverse or perpendicular to
         the direction of the ray, and distributed as to show no
         distinction as to any particular direction. But when,
         by any means, these, vibrations are made to take place
         in one plane, the light is said to be plane polarized.
         If only a portion of the vibrations lie in one plane
         the ray is said to be partially polarized. Light may be
         polarized by several methods other than by reflection,
         as by refraction through most crystalline media, or by
         being transmitted obliquely through several plates of
         glass with parallel faces. If a beam of polarized light
         be transmitted through a crystal of quartz in the
         direction of its axis, the plane of polarization will
         be changed by an angle proportional to the thickness of
         the crystal. This phenomenon is called rotatory
         polarization. A beam of light reflected from a metallic
         surface, or from glass surfaces under certain peculiar
         conditions, acquires properties still more complex, its
         vibrations being no longer rectilinear, but circular,
         or elliptical. This phenomenon is called circular or
         elliptical polarization.

   3. (Elec.) An effect produced upon the plates of a voltaic
      battery, or the electrodes in an electrolytic cell, by the
      deposition upon them of the gases liberated by the action
      of the current. It is chiefly due to the hydrogen, and
      results in an increase of the resistance, and the setting
      up of an opposing electro-motive force, both of which tend
      materially to weaken the current of the battery, or that
      passing through the cell.

   Usage: {Privilege}, {Prerogative}. Privilege, among the
          Romans, was something conferred upon an individual by
          a private law; and hence, it denotes some peculiar
          benefit or advantage, some right or immunity, not
          enjoyed by the world at large. Prerogative, among the
          Romans, was the right of voting first; and, hence, it
          denotes a right of precedence, or of doing certain
          acts, or enjoying certain privileges, to the exclusion
          of others. It is the privilege of a member of Congress
          not to be called in question elsewhere for words
          uttered in debate. It is the prerogative of the

      amount of alcohol. In the United States ``proof spirit is
      defined by law to be that mixture of alcohol and water
      which contains one half of its volume of alcohol, the
      alcohol when at a temperature of 60[deg] Fahrenheit being
      of specific gravity 0.7939 referred to water at its
      maximum density as unity. Proof spirit has at 60[deg]
      Fahrenheit a specific gravity of 0.93353, 100 parts by
      volume of the same consisting of 50 parts of absolute
      alcohol and 53.71 parts of water,'' the apparent excess of
      water being due to contraction of the liquids on mixture.
      In England proof spirit is defined by Act 58, George III.,
      to be such as shall at a temperature of 51[deg] Fahrenheit
      weigh exactly the 12/13 part of an equal measure of
      distilled water. This contains 49.3 per cent by weight, or
      57.09 by volume, of alcohol. Stronger spirits, as those of
      about 60, 70, and 80 per cent of alcohol, are sometimes
      called second, third, and fourth proof spirits
      respectively.

   Note: In physical science, the properties of matter are
         distinguished to the three following classes: 1.
         Physical properties, or those which result from the
         relations of bodies to the physical agents, light,
         heat, electricity, gravitation, cohesion, adhesion,
         etc., and which are exhibited without a change in the
         composition or kind of matter acted on. They are color,
         luster, opacity, transparency, hardness, sonorousness,
         density, crystalline form, solubility, capability of
         osmotic diffusion, vaporization, boiling, fusion, etc.
         2. Chemical properties, or those which are conditioned
         by affinity and composition; thus, combustion,
         explosion, and certain solutions are reactions
         occasioned by chemical properties. Chemical properties
         are identical when there is identity of composition and
         structure, and change according as the composition
         changes. 3. Organoleptic properties, or those forming a
         class which can not be included in either of the other
         two divisions. They manifest themselves in the contact
         of substances with the organs of taste, touch, and
         smell, or otherwise affect the living organism, as in
         the manner of medicines and poisons.

   2. An acquired or artificial quality; that which is given by
      art, or bestowed by man; as, the poem has the properties
      which constitute excellence.

   3. The exclusive right of possessing, enjoying, and disposing
      of a thing; ownership; title.

            Here I disclaim all my paternal care, Propinquity
            and property of blood.                --Shak.

      lands, goods, or money; as, a man of large property, or

          fourth; -- called also {geometrical proportion}, in
          distinction from arithmetical proportion, or that in
          which the difference of the first and second is equal
          to the difference of the third and fourth.

   Note: Proportion in the mathematical sense differs from
         ratio. Ratio is the relation of two quantities of the
         same kind, as the ratio of 5 to 10, or the ratio of 8
         to 16. Proportion is the sameness or likeness of two
         such relations. Thus, 5 to 10 as 8 to 16; that is, 5
         bears the same relation to 10 as 8 does to 16. Hence,
         such numbers are said to be in proportion. Proportion
         is expressed by symbols thus: a:b::c:d, or a:b = c:d,
         or a/b = c/d.
      (b) The rule of three, in arithmetic, in which the three
          given terms, together with the one sought, are
          proportional.

   {Continued proportion}, {Inverse proportion}, etc. See under
      {Continued}, {Inverse}, etc.

   {Harmonical, or Musical}, {proportion}, a relation of three
      or four quantities, such that the first is to the last as
      the difference between the first two is to the difference
      between the last two; thus, 2, 3, 6, are in harmonical
      proportion; for 2 is to 6 as 1 to 3. Thus, 24, 16, 12, 9,
      are harmonical, for 24:9::8:3.

   {In proportion}, according as; to the degree that. ``In
      proportion as they are metaphysically true, they are
      morally and politically false.'' --Burke.

Pulley \Pul"ley\, n.; pl. {Pulleys}. [F. poulie, perhaps of

   polive, pulley, LL. polanus, and F. poulain, properly, a
   colt, fr. L. pullus young animal, foal (cf. {Pullet},
   {Foal}). For the change of sense, cf. F. poutre beam,
   originally, a filly, and E. easel.] (Mach.)
   A wheel with a broad rim, or grooved rim, for transmitting
   power from, or imparting power to, the different parts of
   machinery, or for changing the direction of motion, by means
   of a belt, cord, rope, or chain.

   Note: The pulley, as one of the mechanical powers, consists,
         in its simplest form, of a grooved wheel, called a
         sheave, turning within a movable frame or block, by
         means of a cord or rope attached at one end to a fixed
         point. The force, acting on the free end of the rope,
         is thus doubled, but can move the load through only
         half the space traversed by itself. The rope may also
         pass over a sheave in another block that is fixed. The
         end of the rope may be fastened to the movable block,
         instead of a fixed point, with an additional gain of
         power, and using either one or two sheaves in the fixed
         block. Other sheaves may be added, and the power
         multiplied accordingly. Such an apparatus is called by
         workmen a block and tackle, or a fall and tackle. See
         {Block}. A single fixed pulley gives no increase of
         power, but serves simply for changing the direction of
         motion.

   {Band pulley}, or {Belt pulley}, a pulley with a broad face
      for transmitting power between revolving shafts by means
      of a belt, or for guiding a belt.

Pulse \Pulse\, n. [OE. pous, OF. pous, F. pouls, fr. L. pulsus

   pellere, pulsum, to beat, strike; cf. Gr. ? to swing, shake,
   ? to shake. Cf. {Appeal}, {Compel}, {Impel}, {Push}.]
   1. (Physiol.) The beating or throbbing of the heart or blood
      vessels, especially of the arteries.

   Note: In an artery the pulse is due to the expansion and
         contraction of the elastic walls of the artery by the
         action of the heart upon the column of blood in the
         arterial system. On the commencement of the diastole of
         the ventricle, the semilunar valves are closed, and the
         aorta recoils by its elasticity so as to force part of
         its contents into the vessels farther onwards. These,
         in turn, as they already contain a certain quantity of
         blood, expand, recover by an elastic recoil, and
         transmit the movement with diminished intensity. Thus a
         series of movements, gradually diminishing in
         intensity, pass along the arterial system (see the Note
         under {Heart}). For the sake of convenience, the radial
         artery at the wrist is generally chosen to detect the
         precise character of the pulse. The pulse rate varies
         with age, position, sex, stature, physical and
         psychical influences, etc.

   2. Any measured or regular beat; any short, quick motion,
      regularly repeated, as of a medium in the transmission of
      light, sound, etc.; oscillation; vibration; pulsation;
      impulse; beat; movement.

            The measured pulse of racing oars.    --Tennyson.

            When the ear receives any simple sound, it is struck
            by a single pulse of the air, which makes the
            eardrum and the other membranous parts vibrate
            according to the nature and species of the stroke.

   {Pulse glass}, an instrument consisting to a glass tube with
      terminal bulbs, and containing ether or alcohol, which the

   {Pulse wave} (Physiol.), the wave of increased pressure
      started by the ventricular systole, radiating from the
      semilunar valves over the arterial system, and gradually
      disappearing in the smaller branches.

            the pulse wave travels over the arterial system at
            the rate of about 29.5 feet in a second. --H. N.
                                                  Martin.
