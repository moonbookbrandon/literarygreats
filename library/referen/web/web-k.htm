K \K\, (k[=a]),
   the eleventh letter of the English alphabet, is nonvocal
   consonant. The form and sound of the letter K are from the
   Latin, which used the letter but little except in the early
   period of the language. It came into the Latin from the
   Greek, which received it from a Ph[oe]nician source, the
   ultimate origin probably being Egyptian. Etymologically K is
   most nearly related to c, g, h (which see).

   Note: In many words of one syllable k is used after c, as in
         crack, check, deck, being necessary to exhibit a
         correct pronunciation in the derivatives, cracked,
         checked, decked, cracking; since without it, c, before
         the vowels e and i, would be sounded like s. Formerly,
         k was added to c in certain words of Latin origin, as
         in musick, publick, republick; but now it is omitted.

   Note: See Guide to Pronunciation, [sect][sect] 240, 178, 179,
         185.

   1. (Anat.) A glandular organ which excretes urea and other
      waste products from the animal body; a urinary gland.

   Note: In man and in other mammals there are two kidneys, one
         each side of vertebral column in the back part of the
         abdomen, each kidney being connected with the bladder
         by a long tube, the ureter, through which the urine is
         constantly excreted into the bladder to be periodically
         discharged.

   Note: This use of the word perhaps arose from the fact that
         the kidneys and the fat about them are an easy test of
         the condition of an animal as to fatness. ``Think of
         that, -- a man of my kidney; -- . . . as subject to
