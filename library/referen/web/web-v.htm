V \V\ (v[=e]).
   1. V, the twenty-second letter of the English alphabet, is a
      vocal consonant. V and U are only varieties of the same
      character, U being the cursive form, while V is better
      adapted for engraving, as in stone. The two letters were
      formerly used indiscriminately, and till a comparatively
      recent date words containing them were often classed
      together in dictionaries and other books of reference (see
      {U}). The letter V is from the Latin alphabet, where it
      was used both as a consonant (about like English w) and as
      a vowel. The Latin derives it from it from a form (V) of
      the Greek vowel [Upsilon] (see {Y}), this Greek letter
      being either from the same Semitic letter as the digamma F
      (see {F}), or else added by the Greeks to the alphabet
      which they took from the Semitic. Etymologically v is most
      nearly related to u, w, f, b, p; as in vine, wine;
      avoirdupois, habit, have; safe, save; trover, troubadour,
      trope. See U, F, etc. See Guide to Pronunciation, [sect]
      265; also [sect][sect] 155, 169, 178-179, etc.

   2. As a numeral, V stands for five, in English and Latin.

   shown by the number of atoms of hydrogen (or of other monads,
   as chlorine, sodium, etc.) with which it will combine, or for
   which it can be substituted, or with which it can be
   compared; thus, an atom of hydrogen is a monad, and has a

   1. (Physics) Any substance in the gaseous, or a["e]riform,
      state, the condition of which is ordinarily that of a
      liquid or solid.

   Note: The term vapor is sometimes used in a more extended
         sense, as identical with gas; and the difference
         between the two is not so much one of kind as of
         degree, the latter being applied to all permanently
         elastic fluids except atmospheric air, the former to
         those elastic fluids which lose that condition at
         ordinary temperatures. The atmosphere contains more or
         less vapor of water, a portion of which, on a reduction
         of temperature, becomes condensed into liquid water in
         the form of rain or dew. The vapor of water produced by
         boiling, especially in its economic relations, is
         called steam.

               Vapor is any substance in the gaseous condition
               at the maximum of density consistent with that
               condition. This is the strict and proper meaning
               of the word vapor.                 --Nichol.

   2. In a loose and popular sense, any visible diffused
      substance floating in the atmosphere and impairing its
      transparency, as smoke, fog, etc.

            The vapour which that fro the earth glood [glided].

         conditions or influences, but generally by a sudden,
         rather than a gradual, development; and in tending in
         many cases to lose their distinctive peculiarities when
         the individuals are left to a state of nature, and
         especially if restored to the conditions that are
         natural to typical individuals of the species. Many
         varieties of domesticated animals and of cultivated
         plants have been directly produced by man.
      (d) In inorganic nature, one of those forms in which a
          species may occur, which differ in minor
          characteristics of structure, color, purity of
          composition, etc.

   Note: These may be viewed as variations from the typical
         species in its most perfect and purest form, or, as is
         more commonly the case, all the forms, including the
         latter, may rank as Varieties. Thus, the sapphire is a
         blue variety, and the ruby a red variety, of corundum;
         again, calcite has many Varieties differing in form and
         structure, as Iceland spar, dogtooth spar, satin spar,
         and also others characterized by the presence of small
         quantities of magnesia, iron, manganese, etc. Still
         again, there are Varieties of granite differing in
         structure, as graphic granite, porphyritic granite, and
         other Varieties differing in composition, as albitic
         granite, hornblendic, or syenitic, granite, etc.

   {Geographical variety} (Biol.), a variety of any species
      which is coincident with a geographical region, and is
      usually dependent upon, or caused by, peculiarities of
      climate.

   {Variety hybrid} (Biol.), a cross between two individuals of
      different varieties of the same species; a mongrel.

   Syn: Diversity; difference; kind.

   Usage: {Variety}, {Diversity}. A man has a variety of
          employments when he does many things which are not a
          mere repetition of the same act; he has a diversity of
          employments when the several acts performed are unlike
          each other, that is, diverse. In most cases, where
          there is variety there will be more or less of
          diversity, but not always. One who sells railroad
          tickets performs a great variety of acts in a day,
          while there is but little diversity in his employment.

                All sorts are here that all the earth yields!
                Variety without end.              --Milton.

                But see in all corporeal nature's scene, What
                changes, what diversities, have been!
                                                  --Blackmore.

   {Vegetable kingdom} (Nat. Hist.), that primary division of
      living things which includes all plants. The classes of
      the vegetable kingdom have been grouped differently by
      various botanists. The following is one of the best of the
      many arrangements of the principal subdivisions.

I. {Ph[ae]nogamia} (called also {Phanerogamia}). Plants having
distinct flowers and true seeds. [ 1. {Dicotyledons} (called
also {Exogens}). -- Seeds with two or more cotyledons. Stems
with the pith, woody fiber, and bark concentrically arranged.
Divided into two subclasses: {Angiosperms}, having the woody
fiber interspersed with dotted or annular ducts, and the seed
contained in a true ovary; {Gymnosperms}, having few or no ducts
in the woody fiber, and the seeds naked. 2. {Monocotyledons}
(called also {Endogens}). -- Seeds with single cotyledon. Stems
with slender bundles of woody fiber not concentrically arranged,
and with no true bark.] II. {Cryptogamia}. Plants without true
flowers, and reproduced by minute spores of various kinds, or by
simple cell division. [ 1. {Acrogens}. -- Plants usually with
distinct stems and leaves, existing in two alternate conditions,
one of which is nonsexual and sporophoric, the other sexual and
o["o]phoric. Divided into {Vascular Acrogens}, or
{Pteridophyta}, having the sporophoric plant conspicuous and
consisting partly of vascular tissue, as in Ferns, Lycopods, and
Equiseta, and {Cellular Acrogens}, or {Bryophyta}, having the
sexual plant most conspicuous, but destitute of vascular tissue,
as in Mosses and Scale Mosses. 2. {Thallogens}. -- Plants
without distinct stem and leaves, consisting of a simple or
branched mass of cellular tissue, or educed to a single cell.
Reproduction effected variously. Divided into {Alg[ae]}, which
contain chlorophyll or its equivalent, and which live upon air
and water, and {Fungi}, which contain no chlorophyll, and live
on organic matter. (Lichens are now believed to be fungi
parasitic on included alg[ae].]

   Note: Many botanists divide the Ph[ae]nogamia primarily into
         Gymnosperms and Angiosperms, and the latter into
         Dicotyledons and Monocotyledons. Others consider
         Pteridophyta and Bryophyta to be separate classes.
         Thallogens are variously divided by different writers,
         and the places for diatoms, slime molds, and stoneworts
         are altogether uncertain. For definitions, see these
         names in the Vocabulary.

Vegetable \Veg"e*ta*ble\, n.

   Note: Vegetables and fruits are sometimes loosely
         distinguished by the usual need of cooking the former
         for the use of man, while the latter may be eaten raw;
         but the distinction often fails, as in the case of
         quinces, barberries, and other fruits, and lettuce,
         celery, and other vegetables. Tomatoes if cooked are
         vegetables, if eaten raw are fruits.

   {Initial velocity}, the velocity of a moving body at
      starting; especially, the velocity of a projectile as it
      leaves the mouth of a firearm from which it is discharged.
      

   {Relative velocity}, the velocity with which a body
      approaches or recedes from another body, whether both are
      moving or only one.

   {Uniform velocity}, velocity in which the same number of
      units of space are described in each successive unit of
      time.

   {Variable velocity}, velocity in which the space described
      varies from instant, either increasing or decreasing; --
      in the former case called accelerated velocity, in the
      latter, retarded velocity; the acceleration or retardation
      itself being also either uniform or variable.

   {Virtual velocity}. See under {Virtual}.

   Note: In variable velocity, the velocity, strictly, at any
         given instant, is the rate of motion at that instant,
         and is expressed by the units of space, which, if the
         velocity at that instant were continued uniform during
         a unit of time, would be described in the unit of time;
         thus, the velocity of a falling body at a given instant
         is the number of feet which, if the motion which the
         body has at that instant were continued uniformly for
         one second, it would pass through in the second. The
         scientific sense of velocity differs from the popular
         sense in being applied to all rates of motion, however
         slow, while the latter implies more or less rapidity or
         quickness of motion.

   Syn: Swiftness; celerity; rapidity; fleetness; speed.

   Syn: Mercenary; hireling; vendible.

   Usage: {Venal}, {Mercenary}. One is mercenary who is either
          actually a hireling (as, mercenary soldiers, a
          mercenary judge, etc.), or is governed by a sordid
          love of gain; hence, we speak of mercenary motives, a
          mercenary marriage, etc. Venal goes further, and
          supposes either an actual purchase, or a readiness to
          be purchased, which places a person or thing wholly in
          the power of the purchaser; as, a venal press. Brissot
          played ingeniously on the latter word in his
          celebrated saying, `` My pen is venal that it may not
          be mercenary,'' meaning that he wrote books, and sold
          them to the publishers, in order to avoid the
          necessity of being the hireling of any political
          party.

                Thus needy wits a vile revenue made, And verse
                became a mercenary trade.         --Dryden.

                This verse be thine, my friend, nor thou refuse
                This, from no venal or ungrateful muse. --Pope.

   Note: This calendar was substituted for the ordinary

         the National Convention in 1793. The 22d of September,
         1792, which had been fixed upon as the day of the
         foundation of the republic, was also the date of the
         new calendar. In this calendar, the year, which began
         at midnight of the day of the autumnal equinox, was
         divided into twelve months of thirty days, with five
         additional days for festivals, and every fourth year
         six. Each month was divided into three decades of ten
         days each, the week being abolished. The names of the
         months in their order were, Vend['e]miaire, Brumaire,
         Frimaire Nivose, Pluviose, Ventose, Germinal,
         Flor['e]al, Prairial, Messidor, Thermidor (sometimes

   A vertebra. [Obs.]

Vertebra \Ver"te*bra\, n.; pl. {Vertebr[ae]}. [L. vertebra, fr.

   1. (Anat.) One of the serial segments of the spinal column.

   Note: In many fishes the vertebr[ae] are simple cartilaginous
         disks or short cylinders, but in the higher vertebrates
         they are composed of many parts, and the vertebr[ae] in
         different portions of the same column vary very
         greatly. A well-developed vertebra usually consists of
         a more or less cylindrical and solid body, or centrum,
         which is surmounted dorsally by an arch, leaving an
         opening which forms a part of the canal containing the
         spinal cord. From this dorsal, or neural, arch spring
         various processes, or apophyses, which have received
         special names: a dorsal, or neural, spine, spinous
         process, or neurapophysis, on the middle of the arch;
         two anterior and two posterior articular processes, or
         zygapophyses; and one or two transverse processes on
         each side. In those vertebr[ae] which bear
         well-developed ribs, a tubercle near the end of the rib
         articulates at a tubercular facet on the transverse
         process (diapophysis), while the end, or head, of the
         rib articulates at a more ventral capitular facet which
         is sometimes developed into a second, or ventral,
         transverse process (parapophysis). In vertebrates with
         well-developed hind limbs, the spinal column is divided
         into five regions in each of which the vertebr[ae] are
         specially designated: those vertebr[ae] in front of, or
         anterior to, the first vertebra which bears ribs
         connected with the sternum are cervical; all those
         which bear ribs and are back of the cervicals are
         dorsal; the one or more directly supporting the pelvis
         are sacral and form the sacrum; those between the
         sacral and dorsal are lumbar; and all those back of the
         sacral are caudal, or coccygeal. In man there are seven
         cervical vertebr[ae], twelve dorsal, five lumbar, five
         sacral, and usually four, but sometimes five and rarely
         three, coccygeal.

   Usage: {Vestibule}, {Hall}, {Passage}. A vestibule is a small

          the first large apartment beyond the vestibule, and,
          in the United States, is often long and narrow,
          serving as a passage to the several apartments. In

          not a hall, as in America. Vestibule is often used in
          a figurative sense to denote a place of entrance.

   Syn: Trace; mark; sign; token.

   Usage: {Vestige}, {Trace}. These words agree in marking some
          indications of the past, but differ to some extent in
          their use and application. Vestige is used chiefly in
          a figurative sense, for the remains something long
          passed away; as, the vestiges of ancient times;
          vestiges of the creation. A trace is literally
          something drawn out in a line, and may be used in this
          its primary sense, or figuratively, to denote a sign
          or evidence left by something that has passed by, or
          ceased to exist. Vestige usually supposes some
          definite object of the past to be left behind; while a
          trace may be a mere indication that something has been
          present or is present; as, traces of former
          population; a trace of poison in a given substance.

         manor; a tithing; a town; a township; a parish; a part
         of a parish; a village. The original meaning of vill,
         in England, seems to have been derived from the Roman
         sense of the term villa, a single country residence or
         farm; a manor. Later, the term was applied only to a
         collection of houses more than two, and hence came to
         comprehend towns. Burrill. The statute of Exeter, 14
         Edward I., mentions entire-vills, demivills, and

          too small to have a parish church. A village has a
          church, but no market. A town has both a market and a
          church or churches. A city is, in the legal sense, an
          incorporated borough town, which is, or has been, the

            become noble.                         --Jer. Taylor.

   Note: Villains were of two sorts; villains regardant, that
         is, annexed to the manor (LL. adscripti gleb[ae]); and

      several forces are in equilibrium, the algebraic sum of
      their virtual moments is equal to zero.

   {Virtual focus} (Opt.), the point from which rays, having

   {Virtual image}. (Optics) See under {Image}.

   {Virtual moment} (of a force) (Mech.), the product of the
      intensity of the force multiplied by the virtual velocity
      of its point of application; -- sometimes called {virtual
      work}.

   {Virtual velocity} (Mech.), a minute hypothetical
      displacement, assumed in analysis to facilitate the
      investigation of statical problems. With respect to any
      given force of a number of forces holding a material
      system in equilibrium, it is the projection, upon the
      direction of the force, of a line joining its point of
      application with a new position of that point indefinitely
      near to the first, to which the point is conceived to have
      been moved, without disturbing the equilibrium of the
      system, or the connections of its parts with each other.
      Strictly speaking, it is not a velocity but a length.

   {Advowson}, {Avouch}, {Convoke}, {Epic}, {Vocal}, {Vouch},
   {Vowel}.]
   1. Sound uttered by the mouth, especially that uttered by

      sonant, or intonated, utterance; tone; -- distinguished
      from mere breath sound as heard in f, s, sh, etc., and
      also whisper.

   Note: Voice, in this sense, is produced by vibration of the
         so-called vocal cords in the larynx (see Illust. of
         {Larynx}) which act upon the air, not in the manner of
         the strings of a stringed instrument, but as a pair of
         membranous tongues, or reeds, which, being continually
         forced apart by the outgoing current of breath, and
         continually brought together again by their own
         elasticity and muscular tension, break the breath
         current into a series of puffs, or pulses, sufficiently
         rapid to cause the sensation of tone. The power, or
         loudness, of such a tone depends on the force of the
         separate pulses, and this is determined by the pressure
         of the expired air, together with the resistance on the
         part of the vocal cords which is continually overcome.
         Its pitch depends on the number of a["e]rial pulses
         within a given time, that is, on the rapidity of their
         succession. See Guide to Pronunciation, [sect][sect] 5,
         146, 155.

   1. The act of willing or choosing; the act of forming a

            Volition is the actual exercise of the power the

            the forbearing to consider it.        --Locke.

            Volition is an act of the mind, knowingly exerting
            that dominion it takes itself to have over any part
            of the man, by employing it in, or withholding it
            from, any particular action.          --Locke.

      state of choice.

   3. The power of willing or determining; will.

   Usage: {Volition}, {Choice}. Choice is the familiar, and
          volition the scientific, term for the same state of
          the will; viz., an ``elective preference.'' When we
          have ``made up our minds'' (as we say) to a thing, i.
          e., have a settled state of choice respecting it, that
          state is called an immanent volition; when we put
          forth any particular act of choice, that act is called
          an emanent, or executive, or imperative, volition.
          When an immanent, or settled state of, choice, is one
          which controls or governs a series of actions, we call
          that state a predominant volition; while we give the
          name of subordinate volitions to those particular acts
          of choice which carry into effect the object sought
          for by the governing or ``predominant volition.'' See
          {Will}.
