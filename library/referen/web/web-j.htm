J \J\ (j[=a]).
   J is the tenth letter of the English alphabet. It is a later
   variant form of the Roman letter I, used to express a
   consonantal sound, that is, originally, the sound of English
   y in yet. The forms J and I have, until a recent time, been
   classed together, and they have been used interchangeably.

   Note: In medical prescriptions j is still used in place of i
         at the end of a number, as a Roman numeral; as, vj,
         xij. J is etymologically most closely related to i, y,
         g; as in jot, iota; jest, gesture; join, jugular, yoke.
         See {I}. J is a compound vocal consonant, nearly
         equivalent in sound to dzh. It is exactly the same as g
         in gem. See Guide to Pronunciation, [sect][sect] 179,
         211, 239.

Jesuit \Jes"u*it\, n. [F. J['e]suite, Sp. Jesuita: cf. It.

   1. (R. C. Ch.) One of a religious order founded by Ignatius
      Loyola, and approved in 1540, under the title of The
      Society of Jesus.

   Note: The order consists of Scholastics, the Professed, the
         Spiritual Coadjutors, and the Temporal Coadjutors or
         Lay Brothers. The Jesuit novice after two years becomes
         a Scholastic, and takes his first vows of poverty,
         chastity, and obedience simply. Some years after, at
         the close of a second novitiate, he takes his second
         vows and is ranked among the Coadjutors or Professed.
         The Professed are bound by a fourth vow, from which
         only the pope can dispense, requiring them to go
         wherever the pope may send them for missionary duty.
         The Coadjutors teach in the schools, and are employed
         in general missionary labors. The Society is governed
         by a General who holds office for life. He has
         associated with him ``Assistants'' (five at the present
         time), representing different provinces. The Society
         was first established in the United States in 1807. The
         Jesuits have displayed in their enterprises a high
         degree of zeal, learning, and skill, but, by their
         enemies, have been generally reputed to use art and
         intrigue in promoting or accomplishing their purposes,
         whence the words Jesuit, Jesuitical, and the like, have
         acquired an opprobrious sense.

         to judicial officers and magistrates of every grade.

   {Bed of justice}. See under {Bed}.

   {Chief justice}. See in the Vocabulary.

   {Justice of the peace} (Law), a judicial officer or
      subordinate magistrate appointed for the conservation of
      the peace in a specified district, with other incidental
      powers specified in his commission. In the United States a
      justice of the peace has jurisdiction to adjudicate
      certain minor cases, commit offenders, etc.

   Syn: Equity; law; right; rectitude; honesty; integrity;
        uprightness; fairness; impartiality.

   Usage: {Justice}, {Equity}, {Law}. Justice and equity are the
          same; but human laws, though designed to secure
          justice, are of necessity imperfect, and hence what is
          strictly legal is at times far from being equitable or
          just. Here a court of equity comes in to redress the
          grievances. It does so, as distinguished from courts
          of law; and as the latter are often styled courts of
          justice, some have fancied that there is in this case
          a conflict between justice and equity. The real
          conflict is against the working of the law; this a
          court of equity brings into accordance with the claims
          of justice. It would be an unfortunate use of language
          which should lead any one to imagine he might have
          justice on his side while practicing iniquity
          (inequity). {Justice}, {Rectitude}. Rectitude, in its
          widest sense, is one of the most comprehensive words
          in our language, denoting absolute conformity to the
          rule of right in principle and practice. Justice
          refers more especially to the carrying out of law, and
          has been considered by moralists as of three kinds:
          (1) Commutative justice, which gives every man his own
          property, including things pledged by promise. (2)
          Distributive justice, which gives every man his exact
          deserts. (3) General justice, which carries out all
          the ends of law, though not in every case through the
          precise channels of commutative or distributive
          justice; as we see often done by a parent or a ruler
          in his dealings with those who are subject to his
          control.
