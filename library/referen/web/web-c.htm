C \C\ (s[=e])
   1. C is the third letter of the English alphabet. It is from
      the Latin letter C, which in old Latin represented the
      sounds of k, and g (in go); its original value being the
      latter. In Anglo-Saxon words, or Old English before the
      Norman Conquest, it always has the sound of k. The Latin C
      was the same letter as the Greek [Gamma], [gamma], and
      came from the Greek alphabet. The Greeks got it from the
      Ph[oe]nicians. The English name of C is from the Latin
      name ce, and was derived, probably, through the French.
      Etymologically C is related to g, h, k, q, s (and other
      sibilant sounds). Examples of these relations are in L.
      acutus, E. acute, ague; E. acrid, eager, vinegar; L.
      cornu, E. horn; E. cat, kitten; E. coy, quiet; L. circare,
      OF. cerchier, E. search.

      (b) C after the clef is the mark of common time, in which
          each measure is a semibreve (four fourths or
          crotchets); for alla breve time it is written ?.
      (c) The ``C clef,'' a modification of the letter C, placed
          on any line of the staff, shows that line to be middle
          C.

      200, etc.

         from heaven. Before the time of Mohammed, the Caaba was
         an idolatrous temple, but it has since been the chief
         sanctuary and object of pilgrimage of the Mohammedan
         world.

   LL. cabala cabala, fr. Heb. qabb[=a]l[=e]h reception,
   tradition, mysterious doctrine, fr. q[=a]bal to take or

   Syn: Junto; intrigue; plot; combination; conspiracy.

   Usage: {Cabal}, {Combination}, {Faction}. An association for
          some purpose considered to be bad is the idea common
          to these terms. A combination is an organized union of
          individuals for mutual support, in urging their
          demands or resisting the claims of others, and may be
          good or bad according to circumstances; as, a
          combiniation of workmen or of employers to effect or
          to prevent a change in prices. A cabal is a secret
          association of a few individuals who seek by cunning
          practices to obtain office and power. A faction is a
          larger body than a cabal, employed for selfish
          purposes in agitating the community and working up an
          excitement with a view to change the existing order of
          things. ``Selfishness, insubordination, and laxity of
          morals give rise to combinations, which belong
          particularly to the lower orders of society. Restless,
          jealous, ambitious, and little minds are ever forming
          cabals. Factions belong especially to free
          governments, and are raised by busy and turbulent
          spirits for selfish purposes''.         --Crabb.

      of the Scriptures among Jewish rabbis and certain
      medi[ae]val Christians, which treats of the nature of god
      and the mystery of human existence. It assumes that every
      letter, word, number, and accent of Scripture contains a
      hidden sense; and it teaches the methods of interpretation
      for ascertaining these occult meanings. The cabalists
      pretend even to foretell events by this means.

   Usage: {Calamity}, {Disaster}, {Misfortune}, {Mishap},
          {Mischance}. Of these words, calamity is the
          strongest. It supposes a somewhat continuous state,
          produced not usually by the direct agency of man, but
          by natural causes, such as fire, flood, tempest,
          disease, etc, Disaster denotes literally ill-starred,
          and is some unforeseen and distressing event which
          comes suddenly upon us, as if from hostile planet.
          Misfortune is often due to no specific cause; it is
          simply the bad fortune of an individual; a link in the
          chain of events; an evil independent of his own
          conduct, and not to be charged as a fault. Mischance
          and mishap are misfortunes of a trivial nature,
          occurring usually to individuals. ``A calamity is
          either public or private, but more frequently the
          former; a disaster is rather particular than private;
          it affects things rather than persons; journey,
          expedition, and military movements are often attended
          with disasters; misfortunes are usually personal; they
          immediately affect the interests of the individual.''
          --Crabb.

         cunnen, cannen (1st sing. pres. I can), to know, know
         how, be able, AS. cunnan, 1st sing. pres. ic cann or
         can, pl. cunnon, 1st sing. imp. c[=u][eth]e (for
         cun[eth]e); p. p. c[=u][eth] (for cun[eth]); akin to
         OS. Kunnan, D. Kunnen, OHG. chunnan, G. k["o]nnen,
         Icel. kunna, Goth. Kunnan, and E. ken to know. The
         present tense I can (AS. ic cann) was originally a
         preterit, meaning I have known or Learned, and hence I
         know, know how. [root]45. See {Ken}, {Know}; cf. {Con},
         {Cunning}, {Uncouth}.]
   1. To know; to understand. [Obs.]

            I can rimes of Rodin Hood.            --Piers
                                                  Plowman.

            Let the priest in surplice white, That defunctive

            C[ae]sar.                             --Beau. & Fl.

   3. To be able; -- followed by an infinitive without to; as, I
      can go, but do not wish to.

   Syn: {Can but}, {Can not but}. It is an error to use the
        former of these phrases where the sens requires the
        latter. If we say, ``I can but perish if I go,'' ``But''
        means only, and denotes that this is all or the worst
        that can happen. When the apostle Peter said. ``We can
        not but speak of the things which we have seen and
        heard.'' he referred to a moral constraint or necessety
        which rested upon him and his associates; and the
        meaning was, We cannot help speaking, We cannot refrain
        from speaking. This idea of a moral necessity or
        constraint is of frequent occurrence, and is also
        expressed in the phrase, ``I can not help it.'' Thus we
        say. ``I can not but hope,'' ``I can not but believe,''
        ``I can not but think,'' ``I can not but remark,'' etc.,
        in cases in which it would be an error to use the phrase
        can but.

              Yet he could not but acknowledge to himself that
              there was something calculated to impress awe, . .
              . in the sudden appearances and vanishings . . .
              of the masque                       --De Quincey.

              Tom felt that this was a rebuff for him, and could
              not but understand it as a left-handed hit at his
              employer.                           --Dickens.

      or radicals, forms carbonates. In common language the term
      is very generally applied to a compound of carbon and
      oxygen, {CO2}, more correctly called {carbon dioxide}. It
      is a colorless, heavy, irrespirable gas, extinguishing
      flame, and when breathed destroys life. It can be reduced
      to a liquid and solid form by intense pressure. It is
      produced in the fermentation of liquors, and by the
      combustion and decomposition of organic substances, or
      other substances containing carbon. It is formed in the
      explosion of fire damp in mines, and is hence called
      {after damp}; it is also know as {choke damp}, and
      {mephitic air}. Water will absorb its own volume of it,
      and more than this under pressure, and in this state
      becomes the common soda water of the shops, and the
      carbonated water of natural springs. Combined with lime it
      constitutes limestone, or common marble and chalk. Plants
      imbibe it for their nutrition and growth, the carbon being
      retained and the oxygen given out.

      odor, called more correctly {carbon monoxide}. It is
      almost the only definitely known compound in which carbon
      seems to be divalent. It is a product of the incomplete
      combustion of carbon, and is an abundant constituent of
      water gas. It is fatal to animal life, extinguishes
      combustion, and burns with a pale blue flame, forming
      carbon dioxide.

         containing in its center a nucleus which in turn
         frequently contains one or more nucleoli, the whole
         being surrounded by a thin membrane, the cell wall. In
         some cells, as in those of blood, in the am[oe]ba, and
         in embryonic cells (both vegetable and animal), there
         is no restricting cell wall, while in some of the
         unicelluliar organisms the nucleus is wholly wanting.

   {Centrifugal force} (Mech.), a force whose direction is from
      a center.

   Note: When a body moves in a circle with uniform velocity, a
         force must act on the body to keep it in the circle
         without change of velocity. The direction of this force
         is towards the center of the circle. If this force is
         applied by means of a string to the body, the string
         will be in a state of tension. To a person holding the
         other end of the string, this tension will appear to be
         directed toward the body as if the body had a tendency
         to move away from the center of the circle which it is
         describing. Hence this latter force is often called
         centrifugal force. The force which really acts on the
         body being directed towards the center of the circle is
         called centripetal force, and in some popular treatises
         the centripetal and centrifugal forces are described as
         opposing and balancing each other. But they are merely
         the different aspects of the same stress. --Clerk
         Maxwell.

   Syn: Vexation; mortification; peevishness; fretfulness;
        disgust; disquiet.

   Usage: {Chagrin}, {Vexation}, {Mortification}. These words
          agree in the general sense of pain produced by
          untoward circumstances. Vexation is a feeling of
          disquietude or irritating uneasiness from numerous

          Mortification is a stronger word, and denotes that
          keen sense of pain which results from wounded pride or
          humiliating occurrences. Chagrin is literally the
          cutting pain produced by the friction of Shagreen

          meaning, denoting in its lower degrees simply a state

          of mortification. ``Vexation arises chiefly from our
          wishes and views being crossed: mortification, from
          our self-importance being hurt; chagrin, from a
          mixture of the two.''                   --Crabb.

         ways, and each of these a + b ways is equally likely,

   surrounded the seat of judgment. See {Chancel}.]
   A judicial court of chancery, which in England and in the
   United States is distinctively a court with equity
   jurisdiction.

   Note: The chancellor was originally a chief scribe or
         secretary under the Roman emperors, but afterward was
         invested with judicial powers, and had superintendence
         over the other officers of the empire. From the Roman
         empire this office passed to the church, and every
         bishop has his chancellor, the principal judge of his
         consistory. In later times, in most countries of
         Europe, the chancellor was a high officer of state,
         keeper of the great seal of the kingdom, and having the
         supervision of all charters, and like public
         instruments of the crown, which were authenticated in
         the most solemn manner. In France a secretary is in
         some cases called a chancellor. In Scotland, the
         appellation is given to the foreman of a jury, or
         assize. In the present German empire, the chancellor is
         the president of the federal council and the head of
         the imperial administration. In the United States, the
         title is given to certain judges of courts of chancery
         or equity, established by the statutes of separate
         States. --Blackstone. Wharton.

Chancery \Chan"cer*y\, n. [F. chancellerie, LL. cancellaria,
   from L. cancellarius. See {Chancellor}, and cf.
   {Chancellery}.]
   1. In England, formerly, the highest court of judicature next
      to the Parliament, exercising jurisdiction at law, but
      chiefly in equity; but under the jurisdiction act of 1873
      it became the chancery division of the High Court of
      Justice, and now exercises jurisdiction only in equity.

   2. In the Unites States, a court of equity; equity;
      proceeding in equity.

   Note: A court of chancery, so far as it is a court of equity,
         in the English and American sense, may be generally, if
         not precisely, described as one having jurisdiction in
         cases of rights, recognized and protected by the
         municipal jurisprudence, where a plain, adequate, and
         complete remedy can not be had in the courts of common
         law. In some of the American States, jurisdiction at
         law and in equity centers in the same tribunal. The
         courts of the United States also have jurisdiction both
         at law and in equity, and in all such cases they
         exercise their jurisdiction, as courts of law, or as
         courts of equity, as the subject of adjudication may
         require. In others of the American States, the courts
         that administer equity are distinct tribunals, having
         their appropriate judicial officers, and it is to the
         latter that the appellation courts of chancery is
         usually applied; but, in American law, the terms equity
         and court of equity are more frequently employed than
         the corresponding terms chancery and court of chancery.
         --Burrill.

Cloud \Cloud\ (kloud), n. [Prob. fr. AS. cl[=u]d a rock or

      suspended in the upper atmosphere.

            I do set my bow in the cloud.         --Gen. ix. 13.

   Note: A classification of clouds according to their chief
         forms was first proposed by the meteorologist Howard,
         and this is still substantially employed. The following
         varieties and subvarieties are recognized:
      (a) {Cirrus}. This is the most elevated of all the forms
          of clouds; is thin, long-drawn, sometimes looking like
          carded wool or hair, sometimes like a brush or room,
          sometimes in curl-like or fleecelike patches. It is
          the cat's-tail of the sailor, and the mare's-tail of
          the landsman.
      (b) {Cumulus}. This form appears in large masses of a
          hemispherical form, or nearly so, above, but flat
          below, one often piled above another, forming great
          clouds, common in the summer, and presenting the
          appearance of gigantic mountains crowned with snow. It
          often affords rain and thunder gusts.
      (c) {Stratus}. This form appears in layers or bands
          extending horizontally.
      (d) {Nimbus}. This form is characterized by its uniform
          gray tint and ragged edges; it covers the sky in
          seasons of continued rain, as in easterly storms, and
          is the proper rain cloud. The name is sometimes used
          to denote a raining cumulus, or cumulostratus.
      (e) {Cirro-cumulus}. This form consists, like the cirrus,
          of thin, broken, fleecelice clouds, but the parts are
          more or less rounded and regulary grouped. It is
          popularly called mackerel sky.
      (f) {Cirro-stratus}. In this form the patches of cirrus
          coalesce in long strata, between cirrus and stratus.
      (g) {Cumulo-stratus}. A form between cumulus and stratus,
          often assuming at the horizon a black or bluish tint.
          -- {Fog}, cloud, motionless, or nearly so, lying near
          or in contact with the earth's surface. -- {Storm
          scud}, cloud lying quite low, without form, and driven
          rapidly with the wind.

   2. A mass or volume of smoke, or flying dust, resembling
      vapor. ``A thick cloud of incense.'' --Ezek. viii. 11.

   3. A dark vein or spot on a lighter material, as in marble;
      hence, a blemish or defect; as, a cloud upon one's
      reputation; a cloud on a title.

   4. That which has a dark, lowering, or threatening aspect;
      that which temporarily overshadows, obscures, or
      depresses; as, a cloud of sorrow; a cloud of war; a cloud
      upon the intellect.

   5. A great crowd or multitude; a vast collection. ``So great
      a cloud of witnesses.'' --Heb. xii. 1.

   6. A large, loosely-knitted scarf, worn by women about the
      head.

   press together. See {Ark}.]
   1. To restrain by force, especially by law or authority; to
      repress; to curb. --Burke.

            Punishments are manifold, that they may coerce this
            profligate sort.                      --Ayliffe.

   2. To compel or constrain to any action; as, to coerce a man
      to vote for a certain candidate.

   3. To compel or enforce; as, to coerce obedience.

   Syn: To {Coerce}, {Compel}.

   Usage: To compel denotes to urge on by force which cannot be
          resisted. The term aplies equally to physical and
          moral force; as, compelled by hunger; compelled
          adverse circumstances; compelled by parental
          affection. Coerce had at first only the negative sense
          of checking or restraining by force; as, to coerce a
          bad man by punishments or a prisoner with fetters. It
          has now gained a positive sense., viz., that of
          driving a person into the performance of some act
          which is required of him by another; as, to coerce a
          man to sign a contract; to coerce obedience. In this
          sense (which is now the prevailing one), coerce
          differs but little from compel, and yet there is a
          distinction between them. Coercion is usually
          acomplished by indirect means, as threats and
          intimidation, physical force being more rarely
          employed in coercing.

Coercible \Co"er"ci*ble\, a.
   Capable of being coerced. -- {Co*er"ci*ble*ness}, n.

Coercion \Co*er"cion\, n. [L. coercio, fr. coercere. See
   {Coerce}.]
   1. The act or process of coercing.

   2. (Law) The application to another of either physical or
      moral force. When the force is physical, and cannot be
      resisted, then the act produced by it is a nullity, so far
      as concerns the party coerced. When the force is moral,
      then the act, though voidable, is imputable to the party
      doing it, unless he be so paralyzed by terror as to act
      convulsively. At the same time coercion is not negatived
      by the fact of submission under force. ``Coactus volui''
      (I consented under compulsion) is the condition of mind
      which, when there is volition forced by coercion, annuls
      the result of such coercion. --Wharton.

Coercitive \Co*er"ci*tive\, a.
   Coercive. ``Coercitive power in laws.'' --Jer. Taylor.

Coercive \Co*er"cive\, a.

      by which individual and specific differences in the hues
      and tints of objects are apprehended in vision; as, gay

         the length of their waves or undulations, waves of a
         certain length producing the sensation of red, shorter
         waves green, and those still shorter blue, etc. White,
         or ordinary, light consists of waves of various lengths
         so blended as to produce no effect of color, and the
         color of objects depends upon their power to absorb or
         reflect a greater or less proportion of the rays which
         fall upon them.

      -- so called because each color makes up to the other what

      when mixed, produce effects differing from those of the
      primary colors, in consequence of partial absorption.

         be gives a clearer adjectival significance to the

         completion of the action signified by the verb.

         to an approach to the person addressed; as, I shall
         come home next week; he will come to your house to-day.
         It is used with other verbs almost as an auxiliary,
         indicative of approach to the action or state expressed
         by the verb; as, how came you to do it? Come is used
         colloquially, with reference to a definite future time
         approaching, without an auxiliary; as, it will be two
         years, come next Christmas; i. e., when Christmas shall
         come.

               They were cried In meeting, come next Sunday.

   Syn: To cheer; solace; console; revive; encourage; enliven;
        invigorate; inspirit; gladden; recreate; exhilarate;
        refresh; animate; confirm; strengthen.

   Usage: {To Comfort}, {Console}, {Solace}. These verbs all
          suppose some antecedent state of suffering or sorrow.
          Console is confined to the act giving sympathetic
          relief to the mind under affliction or sorrow, and
          points to some definite source of that relief; as, the
          presence of his friend consoled him; he was much
          consoled by this intelligence. The act of consoling
          commonly implies the inculcation of resignation.
          Comfort points to relief afforded by the communication
          of positive pleasure, hope, and strength, as well as
          by the diminution of pain; as, ``They brought the
          young man alive, and were not a little comforted.''
          --Acts xx. 12. Solace is from L. solacium, which means
          according to Dumesnil, consolation inwardly felt or
          applied to the case of the sufferer. Hence, the verb
          to solace denotes the using of things for the purpose
          of affording relief under sorrow or suffering; as, to
          solace one's self with reflections, with books, or
          with active employments.

Comfort \Com"fort\, n. [OF. confort, fr. conforter.]
   1. Assistance; relief; support. [Obs. except in the phrase
      ``aid and comfort.'' See 5 below.] --Shak.

   2. Encouragement; solace; consolation in trouble; also, that

            availed not.                          --Longfellow.

   3. A state of quiet enjoyment; freedom from pain, want, or
      anxiety; also, whatever contributes to such a condition.

            I had much joy and comfort in thy love. --Phil. 7
                                                  (Rev. Ver.).

            He had the means of living in comfort. --Macaulay.

   4. A wadded bedquilt; a comfortable. [U. S.]

   5. (Law) Unlawful support, countenance, or encouragement; as,
      to give aid and comfort to the enemy.

   Syn: {Comfort}, {Consolation}.

   Usage: Comfort has two meanings:

   1. Strength and relief received under affliction;

   2. Positive enjoyment, of a quiet, permanent nature, together
      with the sources thereof; as, the comfort of love;
      surrounded with comforts; but it is with the former only
      that the word consolation is brought into comparison. As
      thus compared, consolation points to some specific source
      of relief for the afflicted mind; as, the consolations of
      religion. Comfort supposes the relief to be afforded by
      imparting positive enjoyment, as well as a diminution of
      pain. ``Consolation, or comfort, signifies some
      alleviation to that pain to which it is not in our power
      to afford the proper and adequate remedy; they imply
      rather an augmentation of the power of bearing, than a
      diminution of the burden.'' --Johnson.

   Syn: Admit; grant; concede; avow; own; assent; recognize;
        prove; exhibit; attest.

   Usage: {To Confess}, {Acknowledge}, {Avow}. Acknowledge is
          opposed to conceal. We acknowledge what we feel must
          or ought to be made known. (See {Acknowledge}.) Avow
          is opposed to withhold. We avow when we make an open
          and public declaration, as against obloquy or
          opposition; as, to avow one's principles; to avow
          one's participation in some act. Confess is opposed to
          deny. We confess (in the ordinary sense of the word)
          what we feel to have been wrong; as, to confess one's
          errors or faults. We sometimes use confess and
          acknowledge when there is no admission of our being in
          the wrong; as, this, I confess, is my opinion; I
          acknowledge I have always thought so; but in these
          cases we mean simply to imply that others may perhaps
          think us in the wrong, and hence we use the words by
          way of deference to their opinions. It was in this way
          that the early Christians were led to use the Latin
          confiteor and confessio fidei to denote the public
          declaration of their faith in Christianity; and hence
          the corresponding use in English of the verb confess
          and the noun confession.

   {To congratulate one's self}, to rejoice; to feel
      satisfaction; to consider one's self happy or fortunate.

   Syn: {To Congratulate}, {Felicitate}.

   Usage: To felicitate is simply to wish a person joy. To
          congratulate has the additional signification of
          uniting in the joy of him whom we congratulate. Hence
          they are by no means synonymous. One who has lost the
          object of his affections by her marriage to a rival,
          might perhaps felicitate that rival on his success,
          but could never be expected to congratulate him on
          such an event.

                Felicitations are little better than

                of a genuine sympathy and joy.    --Trench.

         Senate consists of two Senators from each State, chosen
         by the State legislature for a term of six years, in

         consists of members elected by the people of the
         several Congressional districts, for a term of two
         years, the term of all ending at the same time. The
         united body of Senators and Representatives for any
         term of two years for which the whole body of
         Representatives is chosen is called one Congress. Thus
         the session which began in December, 1887, was the

          power by the exertion of force. Conquer is wider and
          more general than vanquish, denoting usually a
          succession of conflicts. Vanquish is more individual,
          and refers usually to a single conflict. Thus,
          Alexander conquered Asia in a succession of battles,
          and vanquished Darius in one decisive engagement.
          Subdue implies a more gradual and continual pressure,
          but a surer and more final subjection. We speak of a
          nation as subdued when its spirit is at last broken,
          so that no further resistance is offered. Subjugate is
          to bring completely under the yoke of bondage. The
          ancient Gauls were never finally subdued by the Romans
          until they were completely subjugated. These words,
          when used figuratively, have correspondent meanings.
          We conquer our prejudices or aversions by a succesion
          of conflicts; but we sometimes vanquish our reluctance
          to duty by one decided effort: we endeavor to subdue
          our evil propensities by watchful and persevering
          exertions. Subjugate is more commonly taken in its
          primary meaning, and when used figuratively has
          generally a bad sense; as, his reason was completely
          subjugated to the sway of his passions.

Consonant \Con"so*nant\, n. [L. consonans, -antis.]
   An articulate sound which in utterance is usually combined
   and sounded with an open sound called a vowel; a member of
   the spoken alphabet other than a vowel; also, a letter or
   character representing such a sound.

   Note: Consonants are divided into various classes, as mutes,
         spirants, sibilants, nasals, semivowels, etc. All of
         them are sounds uttered through a closer position of
         the organs than that of a vowel proper, although the
         most open of them, as the semivowels and nasals, are
         capable of being used as if vowels, and forming
         syllables with other closer consonants, as in the
         English feeble (-b'l), taken (-k'n). All the consonants
         excepting the mutes may be indefinitely, prolonged in
         utterance without the help of a vowel, and even the
         mutes may be produced with an aspirate instead of a
         vocal explosion. Vowels and consonants may be regarded
         as the two poles in the scale of sounds produced by
         gradual approximation of the organ, of speech from the
         most open to the closest positions, the vowel being
         more open, the consonant closer; but there is a
         territory between them where the sounds produced
         partake of the qualities of both.

   Note: ``A consonant is the result of audible friction,
         squeezing, or stopping of the breath in some part of
         the mouth (or occasionally of the throath.) The main
         distinction between vowels and consonants is, that
         while in the former the mouth configuration merely
         modifies the vocalized breath, which is therefore an
         essential element of the vowels, in consonants the
         narrowing or stopping of the oral passage is the
         foundation of the sound, and the state of the glottis
         is something secondary.'' --H. Sweet.

      Middle Ages.



   Note: The constable of France was the first officer of the
         crown, and had the chief command of the army. It was
         also his duty to regulate all matters of chivalry. The
         office was suppressed in 1627. The constable, or lord
         high constable, of England, was one of the highest
         officers of the crown, commander in chief of the
         forces, and keeper of the peace of the nation. He also
         had judicial cognizance of many important matters. The
         office was as early as the Conquest, but has been
         disused (except on great and solemn occasions), since
         the attainder of Stafford, duke of Buckingham, in the
         reign of Henry VIII.

   2. (Law) An officer of the peace having power as a
      conservator of the public peace, and bound to execute the
      warrants of judicial officers. --Bouvier.

   Note: In England, at the present time, the constable is a
         conservator of the peace within his district, and is
         also charged by various statutes with other duties,
         such as serving summons, precepts, warrants, etc. In
         the United States, constables are town or city officers
         of the peace, with powers similar to those of the
         constables of England. In addition to their duties as
         conservators of the peace, they are invested with
         others by statute, such as to execute civil as well as
         criminal process in certain cases, to attend courts,
         keep juries, etc. In some cities, there are officers
         called {high constables}, who act as chiefs of the
         constabulary or police force. In other cities the title
         of constable, as well as the office, is merged in that
         of the police officer.

      powers within a hundred. [Eng.]

   Syn: Scornful; insolent; haughty; disdainful; supercilious;
        insulting; contumelious.

   Usage: {Contemptuous}, {Contemptible}. These words, from
          their similarity of sound, are sometimes erroneously
          interchanged, as when a person speaks of having ``a
          very contemptible opinion of another.'' Contemptible
          is applied to that which is the object of contempt;

          is personal, as an action, an expression, a feeling,

   Syn: Struggle; strife; contest; quarrel; combat; conflict;
        feud; litigation; controversy; dissension; variance;
        disagreement; debate; competition; emulation.

   Usage: {Contention}, {Strife}. A struggle between two parties
          is the idea common to these two words. Strife is a
          struggle for mastery; contention is a struggle for the
          possession of some desired object, or the
          accomplishment of some favorite end. Neither of the
          words is necessarily used in a bad sense, since there
          may be a generous strife or contention between two
          friends as to which shall incur danger or submit to
          sacrifices. Ordinarily, however, these words denote a
          struggle arising from bad passions. In that case,
          strife usually springs from a quarrelsome temper, and
          contention from, a selfish spirit which seeks its own
          aggrandizement, or is fearful lest others should
          obtain too much. Strife has more reference to the
          manner than to the object of a struggle, while
          contention takes more account of the end to be gained.

   Syn: Conflict; combat; battle; encounter; shock; struggle;
        dispute; altercation; debate; controvesy; difference;
        disagreement; strife.

   Usage: {Contest}, {Conflict}, {Combat}, {Encounter}. Contest
          is the broadest term, and had originally no reference
          to actual fighting. It was, on the contrary, a legal
          term signifying to call witnesses, and hence came to
          denote first a struggle in argument, and then a
          struggle for some common object between opposing
          parties, usually one of considerable duration, and
          implying successive stages or acts. Conflict denotes
          literally a close personal engagement, in which sense
          it is applied to actual fighting. It is, however, more
          commonly used in a figurative sense to denote
          strenuous or direct opposition; as, a mental conflict;
          conflicting interests or passions; a conflict of laws.
          An encounter is a direct meeting face to face. Usually
          it is a hostile meeting, and is then very nearly
          coincident with conflict; as, an encounter of opposing
          hosts. Sometimes it is used in a looser sense; as,
          ``this keen encounter of our wits.'' --Shak. Combat is
          commonly applied to actual fighting, but may be used
          figuratively in reference to a strife or words or a
          struggle of feeling.

   Syn: Intercourse; communion; commerce; familiarity;
        discourse; dialogue; colloquy; talk; chat.

   Usage: {Conversation}, {Talk}. There is a looser sense of
          these words, in which they are synonymous; there is a
          stricter sense, in which they differ. Talk is usually
          broken, familiar, and versatile. Conversation is more
          continuous and sustained, and turns ordinarily upon
          topics or higher interest. Children talk to their
          parents or to their companions; men converse together
          in mixed assemblies. Dr. Johnson once remarked, of an
          evening spent in society, that there had been a great
          deal of talk, but no conversation.

   Syn: Proselyte; neophyte.

   Usage: {Convert}, {Proselyte}, {Pervert}. A convert is one
          who turns from what he believes to have been a decided
          error of faith or practice. Such a change may relate
          to religion, politics, or other subjects. properly
          considered, it is not confined to speculation alone,
          but affects the whole current of one's feelings and
          the tenor of his actions. As such a change carries
          with it the appearance of sincerity, the term convert
          is usually taken in a good sense. Proselyte is a term
          of more ambiguous use and application. It was first
          applied to an adherent of one religious system who had
          transferred himself externally to some other religious
          system; and is also applied to one who makes a similar
          transfer in respect to systems of philosophy or
          speculation. The term has little or no reference to
          the state of the heart. Pervert is a term of recent
          origin, designed to express the contrary of convert,
          and to stigmatize a person as drawn off perverted from
          the true faith. It has been more particulary applied
          by members of the Church of England to those who have
          joined the Roman Catholic Church.

Corporation \Cor`po*ra"tion\ (k[^o]r`p[-o]*r[=a]"sh[u^]n), n.
   [L. corporatio incarnation: cf. F. corporation corporation.]
   A body politic or corporate, formed and authorized by law to
   act as a single person, and endowed by law with the capacity
   of succession; a society having the capacity of transacting
   business as an individual.

   Note: Corporations are aggregate or sole. {Corporations
         aggregate} consist of two or more persons united in a
         society, which is preserved by a succession of members,
         either forever or till the corporation is dissolved by
         the power that formed it, by the death of all its
         members, by surrender of its charter or franchises, or
         by forfeiture. Such corporations are the mayor and
         aldermen of cities, the head and fellows of a college,
         the dean and chapter of a cathedral church, the
         stockholders of a bank or insurance company, etc. A
         {corporation sole} consists of a single person, who is
         made a body corporate and politic, in order to give him
         some legal capacities, and especially that of
         succession, which as a natural person he can not have.
         Kings, bishops, deans, parsons, and vicars, are in
         England sole corporations. A fee will not pass to a
         corporation sole without the word ``successors'' in the
         grant. There are instances in the United States of a
         minister of a parish seized of parsonage lands in the
         right of his parish, being a corporation sole, as in
         Massachusetts. Corporations are sometimes classified as
         public and private; public being convertible with
         municipal, and {private corporations} being all
         corporations not municipal.

   Syn: Heroism; bravery; intrepidity; valor; gallantry; daring;
        firmness; hardihood; boldness; dauntlessness;

   Usage: See {Heroism}. -- {Courage}, {Bravery}, {Fortitude},
          {Intrepidity}, {Gallantry}, {Valor}. Courage is that
          firmness of spirit and swell of soul which meets
          danger without fear. Bravery is daring and impetuous
          courage, like that of one who has the reward
          continually in view, and displays his courage in
          daring acts. Fortitude has often been styled ``passive
          courage,'' and consist in the habit of encountering
          danger and enduring pain with a steadfast and unbroken
          spirit. Valor is courage exhibited in war, and can not
          be applied to single combats; it is never used
          figuratively. Intrepidity is firm, unshaken courage.
          Gallantry is adventurous courage, which courts danger
          with a high and cheerful spirit. A man may show
          courage, fortitude, or intrepidity in the common
          pursuits of life, as well as in war. Valor, bravery,
          and gallantry are displayed in the contest of arms.
          Valor belongs only to battle; bravery may be shown in
          single combat; gallantry may be manifested either in
          attack or defense; but in the latter ease, the defense
          is usually turned into an attack.

   Usage: {Covenant}, {Contract}, {Compact}, {Stipulation}.
          These words all denote a mutual agreement between two
          parties. Covenant is frequently used in a religious
          sense; as, the covenant of works or of grace; a church
          covenant; the Solemn League and Covenant. Contract is
          the word most used in the business of life. Crabb and
          Taylor are wrong in saying that a contract must always
          be in writing. There are oral and implied contracts as
          well as written ones, and these are equally enforced
          by law. In legal usage, the word covenant has an
          important place as connected with contracts. A compact
          is only a stronger and more solemn contract. The term
          is chiefly applied to political alliances. Thus, the
          old Confederation was a compact between the States.
          Under the present Federal Constitution, no individual
          State can, without consent of Congress, enter into a
          compact with any other State or foreign power. A
          stipulation is one of the articles or provisions of a
          contract.

   One born of European parents in the American colonies of
   France or Spain or in the States which were once such
   colonies, esp. a person of French or Spanish descent, who is
   a native inhabitant of Louisiana, or one of the States
   adjoining, bordering on the Gulf of of Mexico.

   Note: ``The term creole negro is employed in the English West
         Indies to distinguish the negroes born there from the
         Africans imported during the time of the slave trade.
         The application of this term to the colored people has
         led to an idea common in some parts of the United
         States, though wholly unfounded, that it implies an
         admixture greater or less of African blood.'' --R.
         Hildreth.

   Note: ``The title [Creole] did not first belong to the
         descendants of Spanish, but of French, settlers, But
         such a meaning implied a certain excellence of origin,
         and so came early to include any native of French or
         Spanish descent by either parent, whose nonalliance
         with the slave race entitled him to social rank. Later,
         the term was adopted by, not conceded to, the natives
         of mixed blood, and is still so used among themselves.
         . . . Besides French and Spanish, there are even, for
         convenience of speech, 'colored' Creoles; but there are
         no Italian, or Sicilian, nor any English, Scotch,
         Irish, or 'Yankee' Creoles, unless of parentage married
         into, and themselves thoroughly proselyted in, Creole
         society.'' --G. W. Cable.

Creole \Cre"ole\ (kr?"?l), a.

Creosol \Cre"o*sol\ (kr?"?-s?l), n. [Cresote + phenol.] (Chem.)
   A colorless liquid resembling phenol or carbolic acid,
   homologous with pyrocatechin, and obtained from beechwood tar
   and gum guaiacum. [Written also {creasol}.]

Creosote \Cre"o*sote\ (kr?"?-s?t), n. [Gr. ???, gen. ???, flesh
   + ??? to preserve.] (Chem.)
   Wood-tar oil; an oily antiseptic liquid, of a burning smoky
   taste, colorless when pure, but usually colored yellow or
   brown by impurity or exposure. It is a complex mixture of
   various phenols and their ethers, and is obtained by the
   distillation of wood tar, especially that of beechwood.

   Note: It is remarkable as an antiseptic and deodorizer in the
         preservation of wood, flesh, etc., and in the
         prevention of putrefaction; but it is a poor germicide,
         and in this respect has been overrated. Smoked meat, as
         ham, owes its preservation and taste to a small
         quantity of creosote absorbed from the smoke to which
         it is exposed. Carbolic acid is phenol proper, while
         creosote is a mixture of several phenols.

   {Coal-tar creosote} (Chem.), a colorless or yellow, oily
      liquid, obtained in the distillation of coal tar, and
      resembling wood-tar oil, or creosote proper, in

          strictly a violation of law either human or divine;

          inordinate indulgence of the natural appetites, which
          are in themselves innocent. Thus intemperance,
          unchastity, duplicity, etc., are vices; while murder,

          selfish passions, are crimes.

         macrodiagonal and brachydiagonal. -- The preceding are
         erect forms, the axes intersecting at right angles. The
         following are oblique. 4. {The Monoclinic system},
         having one of the intersections oblique, as in the
         oblique rhombic prism. In this system, the lateral axes
         are called respectively, clinodiagonal and
         orthodiagonal. 5. {The Triclinic system}, having all
         the three intersections oblique, as in the oblique
         rhomboidal prism. There is also: 6. {The Hexagonal
         system} (one division of which is called Rhombohedral),
         in which there are three equal lateral axes, and a
         vertical axis of variable length, as in the hexagonal
         prism and the rhombohedron.

   Note: The Diclinic system, sometimes recognized, with two
         oblique intersections, is only a variety of the
         Triclinic.

   Syn: {Cunning}, {Artful}, {Sly}, {Wily}, {Crafty}.

   Usage: These epithets agree in expressing an aptitude for
          attaining some end by peculiar and secret means.
          Cunning is usually low; as, a cunning trick. Artful is
          more ingenious and inventive; as, an artful device.
          Sly implies a turn for what is double or concealed;
          as, sly humor; a sly evasion. Crafty denotes a talent
          for dexterously deceiving; as, a crafty manager. Wily
          describes a talent for the use of stratagems; as, a
          wily politician. ``Acunning man often shows his
          dexterity in simply concealing. An artful man goes
          further, and exerts his ingenuity in misleading. A
          crafty man mingles cunning with art, and so shapes his
          actions as to lull suspicions. The young may be
          cunning, but the experienced only can be crafty.
          Slyness is a vulgar kind of cunning; the sly man goes
          cautiously and silently to work. Wiliness is a species
          of cunning or craft applicable only to cases of attack
          and defense.'' --Crabb.
