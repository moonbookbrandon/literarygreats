L \L\ ([e^]l).
   1. L is the twelfth letter of the English alphabet, and a
      vocal consonant. It is usually called a semivowel or
      liquid. Its form and value are from the Greek, through the
      Latin, the form of the Greek letter being from the
      Ph[oe]nician, and the ultimate origin prob. Egyptian.
      Etymologically, it is most closely related to r and u; as
      in pilgrim, peregrine, couch (fr. collocare), aubura (fr.
      LL. alburnus).

   Note: At the end of monosyllables containing a single vowel,
         it is often doubled, as in fall, full, bell; but not
         after digraphs, as in foul, fool, prowl, growl, foal.
         In English words, the terminating syllable le is
         unaccented, the e is silent, and l is preceded by a
         voice glide, as in able, eagle, pronounced [=a]"b'l,
         ?"g'l. See Guide to Pronunciation, [sect] 241.

   2. As a numeral, L stands for fifty in the English, as in the
      Latin language.

            For 50 the Romans used the Chalcidian chi, ?, which
            assumed the less difficult lapidary type, ?, and was
            then easily assimilated to L.         --I. Taylor

         communicate the thoughts of one person to another

         represented to the eye by letters, marks, or
         characters, which form words.

   {Lasso cell} (Zo["o]l.), one of a peculiar kind of defensive
      and offensive stinging cells, found in great numbers in
      all c[oe]lenterates, and in a few animals of other groups.
      They are most highly developed in the tentacles of
      jellyfishes, hydroids, and Actini[ae]. Each of these cells
      is filled with, fluid, and contains a long, slender, often
      barbed, hollow thread coiled up within it. When the cell
      contracts the thread is quickly ejected, being at the same
      time turned inside out. The thread is able to penetrate
      the flesh of various small, soft-bodied animals, and
      carries a subtle poison by which they are speedily
      paralyzed and killed. The threads, at the same time, hold
      the prey in position, attached to the tentacles. Some of
      the jellyfishes, as the Portuguese man-of-war, and
      {Cyanea}, are able to penetrate the human skin, and
      inflict painful stings in the same way. Called also
      {nettling cell}, {cnida}, {cnidocell}.

   2. (Zo["o]l.) Any one of numerous genera and species of
      annulose worms, belonging to the order {Hirudinea}, or
      Bdelloidea, esp. those species

used in medicine, as {Hirudo medicinalis} of Europe, and allied
species.

   Note: In the mouth of bloodsucking leeches are three
         convergent, serrated jaws, moved by strong muscles. By
         the motion of these jaws a stellate incision is made in
         the skin, through which the leech sucks blood till it
         is gorged, and then drops off. The stomach has large
         pouches on each side to hold the blood. The common
         large bloodsucking leech of America ({Macrobdella
         decora}) is dark olive above, and red below, with black
         spots. Many kinds of leeches are parasitic on fishes;
         others feed upon worms and mollusks, and have no jaws
         for drawing blood. See {Bdelloidea}. {Hirudinea}, and
         {Clepsine}.

         shining, depressed white patches or scales, the hair on

         other English verbs, is often used in a passive sense;
         as, a house to let (i. e., for letting, or to be let).
         This form of expression conforms to the use of the
         Anglo-Saxon gerund with to (dative infinitive) which
         was commonly so employed. See {Gerund}, 2. `` Your
         elegant house in Harley Street is to let.''

   Usage: {Liberty}, {Freedom}. These words, though often
          interchanged, are distinct in some of their
          applications. Liberty has reference to previous
          restraint; freedom, to the simple, unrepressed
          exercise of our powers. A slave is set at liberty; his
          master had always been in a state of freedom. A
          prisoner under trial may ask liberty (exemption from
          restraint) to speak his sentiments with freedom (the
          spontaneous and bold utterance of his feelings). The
          liberty of the press is our great security for freedom
          of thought.

   1. (Bot.) One of a class of cellular, flowerless plants,
      (technically called {Lichenes}), having no distinction of
      leaf and stem, usually of scaly, expanded, frond-like
      forms, but sometimes erect or pendulous and variously
      branched. They derive their nourishment from the air, and
      generate by means of spores. The species are very widely
      distributed, and form irregular spots or patches, usually
      of a greenish or yellowish color, upon rocks, trees, and
      various bodies, to which they adhere with great tenacity.
      They are often improperly called {rock moss} or {tree
      moss}.

   Note: A favorite modern theory of lichens (called after its
         inventor the Schwendener hypothesis), is that they are
         not autonomous plants, but that they consist of
         ascigerous fungi, parasitic on alg[ae]. Each lichen is
         composed of white filaments and green, or greenish,
         rounded cells, and it is argued that the two are of
         different nature, the one living at the expense of the
         other. See {Hyph[ae]}, and {Gonidia}.

   See {Lie} to utter a falsehood.]
   1. A falsehood uttered or acted for the purpose of deception;
      an intentional violation of truth; an untruth spoken with
      the intention to deceive.

            The proper notion of a lie is an endeavoring to
            deceive another by signifying that to him as true,
            which we ourselves think not to be so. --S. Clarke.

            It is willful deceit that makes a lie. A man may act
            a lie, as by pointing his finger in a wrong
            direction when a traveler inquires of him his road.
                                                  --Paley.

   {White lie}, a euphemism for such lies as one finds it
      convenient to tell, and excuses himself for telling.

   Syn: Untruth; falsehood; fiction; deception.

   Usage: {Lie}, {Untruth}. A man may state what is untrue from
          ignorance or misconception; hence, to impute an
          untruth to one is not necessarily the same as charging
          him with a lie. Every lie is an untruth, but not every
          untruth is a lie. Cf. {Falsity}.

Lie \Lie\, v. i. [imp. & p. p. {Lied} (l[imac]d); p. pr. & vb.

   ligan, Russ. lejate, L. lectus bed, Gr. le`chos bed,

   {Low}, adj.]
   1. To rest extended on the ground, a bed, or any support; to
      be, or to put one's self, in an horizontal position, or
      nearly so; to be prostate; to be stretched out; -- often

      book lies on the table; the snow lies on the roof; he lies
      in his coffin.

            Envy lies between beings equal in nature, though
            unequal in circumstances.             --Collier.

            He that thinks that diversion may not lie in hard
            labor, forgets the early rising and hard riding of
            huntsmen.                             --Locke.

   5. To lodge; to sleep.

   7. (Law) To be sustainable; to be capable of being

   Note: Through ignorance or carelessness speakers and writers
         often confuse the forms of the two distinct verbs lay
         and lie. Lay is a transitive verb, and has for its
         preterit laid; as, he told me to lay it down, and I
         laid it down. Lie is intransitive, and has for its
         preterit lay; as, he told me to lie down, and I lay
         down. Some persons blunder by using laid for the
         preterit of lie; as, he told me to lie down, and I laid
         down. So persons often say incorrectly, the ship laid
         at anchor; they laid by during the storm; the book was
         laying on the shelf, etc. It is only necessary to
         remember, in all such cases, that laid is the preterit
         of lay, and not of lie.

   akin to OS. lioht, D. & G. licht, OHG. lioht, Goth.
   liuha[thorn], Icel. lj[=o]s, L. lux light, lucere to shine,
   Gr. leyko`s white, Skr. ruc to shine. [root]122. Cf. {Lucid},
   {Lunar}, {Luminous}, {Lynx}.]
   1. That agent, force, or action in nature by the operation of
      which upon the organs of sight, objects are rendered
      visible or luminous.

   Note: Light was regarded formerly as consisting of material
         particles, or corpuscules, sent off in all directions
         from luminous bodies, and traversing space, in right
         lines, with the known velocity of about 186,300 miles
         per second; but it is now generally understood to
         consist, not in any actual transmission of particles or
         substance, but in the propagation of vibrations or
         undulations in a subtile, elastic medium, or ether,
         assumed to pervade all space, and to be thus set in
         vibratory motion by the action of luminous bodies, as
         the atmosphere is by sonorous bodies. This view of the
         nature of light is known as the undulatory or wave
         theory; the other, advocated by Newton (but long since
         abandoned), as the corpuscular, emission, or Newtonian
         theory. A more recent theory makes light to consist in
         electrical oscillations, and is known as the
         electro-magnetic theory of light.

   2. That which furnishes, or is a source of, light, as the
      sun, a star, a candle, a lighthouse, etc.

      day; especially, the dawn of day.

   Syn: Science; learning; erudition; belles-lettres.

   Usage: See {Science}. -- {Literature}, {Learning},
          {Erudition}. Literature, in its widest sense, embraces
          all compositions in writing or print which preserve
          the results of observation, thought, or fancy; but
          those upon the positive sciences (mathematics, etc.)
          are usually excluded. It is often confined, however,
          to belles-lettres, or works of taste and sentiment, as
          poetry, eloquence, history, etc., excluding abstract
          discussions and mere erudition. A man of literature
          (in this narrowest sense) is one who is versed in
          belles-lettres; a man of learning excels in what is
          taught in the schools, and has a wide extent of
          knowledge, especially, in respect to the past; a man
          of erudition is one who is skilled in the more
          recondite branches of learned inquiry.

                The origin of all positive science and
                philosophy, as well as of all literature and
                art, in the forms in which they exist in
                civilized Europe, must be traced to the Greeks.
                                                  --Sir G.
                                                  Lewis.

                Learning thy talent is, but mine is sense.

                liveries for all night: first, the officers
                brought into the house a cast of fine manchet

                meat, as to keep horses at livery, the which
                word, I guess, is derived of livering or
                delivering forth their nightly food. --Spenser.

                It need hardly be observed that the explanation
                of livery which Spenser offers is perfectly
                correct, but . . . it is no longer applied to
                the ration or stated portion of food delivered
                at stated periods.                --Trench.

   2. [Prob. the same word as in sense 1; cf. LG. log, lock,
      Dan. log, Sw. logg.] (Naut.) An apparatus for measuring
      the rate of a ship's motion through the water.

   Note: The common log consists of the log-chip, or logship,
         often exclusively called the log, and the log line, the
         former being commonly a thin wooden quadrant of five or
         six inches radius, loaded with lead on the arc to make
         it float with the point up. It is attached to the log
         line by cords from each corner. This line is divided
         into equal spaces, called knots, each bearing the same
         proportion to a mile that half a minute does to an
         hour. The line is wound on a reel which is so held as
         to let it run off freely. When the log is thrown, the
         log-chip is kept by the water from being drawn forward,
         and the speed of the ship is shown by the number of
         knots run out in half a minute. There are improved
         logs, consisting of a piece of mechanism which, being
         towed astern, shows the distance actually gone through
         by the ship, by means of the revolutions of a fly,
         which are registered on a dial plate.

   3. Hence: The record of the rate of ship's speed or of her
      daily progress; also, the full nautical record of a ship's
      cruise or voyage; a log slate; a log book.

   4. A record and tabulated statement of the work done by an
      engine, as of a steamship, of the coal consumed, and of
      other items relating to the performance of machinery
      during a given time.

   5. (Mining) A weight or block near the free end of a hoisting
      rope to prevent it from being drawn through the sheave.

      transferred to the log book. A folding slate is now used
      instead.

   {Log book}, or {Logbook} (Naut.), a book in which is entered

Logarithm \Log"a*rithm\ (l[o^]g"[.a]*r[i^][th]'m), n. [Gr.
   lo`gos word, account, proportion + 'ariqmo`s number: cf. F.
   logarithme.] (Math.)
   One of a class of auxiliary numbers, devised by John Napier,
   of Merchiston, Scotland (1550-1617), to abridge arithmetical
   calculations, by the use of addition and subtraction in place
   of multiplication and division.

   Note: The relation of logarithms to common numbers is that of
         numbers in an arithmetical series to corresponding
         numbers in a geometrical series, so that sums and
         differences of the former indicate respectively
         products and quotients of the latter; thus, 0 1 2 3 4
         Indices or logarithms 1 10 100 1000 10,000 Numbers in
         geometrical progression Hence, the logarithm of any
         given number is the exponent of a power to which
         another given invariable number, called the base, must
         be raised in order to produce that given number. Thus,
         let 10 be the base, then 2 is the logarithm of 100,
         because 10^{2} = 100, and 3 is the logarithm of 1,000,
         because 10^{3} = 1,000.

   {Arithmetical complement of a logarithm}, the difference
      between a logarithm and the number ten.

   {Binary logarithms}. See under {Binary}.

      which the base is 10; -- so called from Henry Briggs, who
      invented them.

   {Gauss's logarithms}, tables of logarithms constructed for
      facilitating the operation of finding the logarithm of the
      sum of difference of two quantities from the logarithms of
      the quantities, one entry of those tables and two
      additions or subtractions answering the purpose of three
      entries of the common tables and one addition or
      subtraction. They were suggested by the celebrated German
      mathematician Karl Friedrich Gauss (died in 1855), and are
      of great service in many astronomical computations.

   {Hyperbolic, or Napierian}, {logarithms}

, those logarithms (devised by John Speidell, 1619) of which the
base is 2.7182818; -- so called from Napier, the inventor of
logarithms.

   Note: In all air-breathing vertebrates the lungs are
         developed from the ventral wall of the esophagus as a
         pouch which divides into two sacs. In amphibians and
         many reptiles the lungs retain very nearly this
         primitive saclike character, but in the higher forms
         the connection with the esophagus becomes elongated
         into the windpipe and the inner walls of the sacs
         become more and more divided, until, in the mammals,
         the air spaces become minutely divided into tubes
         ending in small air cells, in the walls of which the
         blood circulates in a fine network of capillaries. In
         mammals the lungs are more or less divided into lobes,
         and each lung occupies a separate cavity in the thorax.
