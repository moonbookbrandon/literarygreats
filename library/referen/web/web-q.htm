Q \Q\ (k[=u]),
   the seventeenth letter of the English alphabet, has but one
   sound (that of k), and is always followed by u, the two
   letters together being sounded like kw, except in some words
   in which the u is silent. See Guide to Pronunciation, [sect]
   249. Q is not found in Anglo-Saxon, cw being used instead of
   qu; as in cwic, quick; cwen, queen. The name (k[=u]) is from
   the French ku, which is from the Latin name of the same
   letter; its form is from the Latin, which derived it, through
   a Greek alphabet, from the Ph[oe]nician, the ultimate origin
   being Egyptian. Etymologically, q or qu is most nearly
   related to a (ch, tch), p, q, and wh; as in cud, quid, L.
   equus, ecus, horse, Gr. ?, whence E. equine, hippic; L. quod

   {Previous question}, a question put to a parliamentary
      assembly upon the motion of a member, in order to
      ascertain whether it is the will of the body to vote at
      once, without further debate, on the subject under
      consideration.

   Note: The form of the question is: ``Shall the main question
         be now put?'' If the vote is in the affirmative, the
         matter before the body must be voted upon as it then
         stands, without further general debate or the
         submission of new amendments. In the House of
         Representatives of the United States, and generally in
         America, a negative decision operates to keep the
         business before the body as if the motion had not been
         made; but in the English Parliament, it operates to
         postpone consideration for the day, and until the
         subject may be again introduced. In American practice,
         the object of the motion is to hasten action, and it is
         made by a friend of the measure. In English practice,
         the object is to get rid of the subject for the time
         being, and the motion is made with a purpose of voting
         against it. --Cushing.

      matter under debate.
