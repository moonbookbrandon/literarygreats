U \U\ ([=u]),
   the twenty-first letter of the English alphabet, is a cursive
   form of the letter V, with which it was formerly used
   interchangeably, both letters being then used both as vowels
   and consonants. U and V are now, however, differentiated, U
   being used only as a vowel or semivowel, and V only as a
   consonant. The true primary vowel sound of U, in Anglo-Saxon,
   was the sound which it still retains in most of the languages
   of Europe, that of long oo, as in tool, and short oo, as in
   wood, answering to the French ou in tour. Etymologically U is
   most closely related to o, y (vowel), w, and v; as in two,
   duet, dyad, twice; top, tuft; sop, sup; auspice, aviary. See
   V, also O and Y. See Guide to Pronunciation, [sect][sect]

---- and the like.




   (c) To present particles which come from intransitive verbs,
       or are themselves employed as adjectives, to mark the
       absence of the activity, disposition, or condition
       implied by the participle; as, 

---- and the like.

   Note: The above classes of words are unlimited in extent, and
         such compounds may be formed by any writer or speaker
         at will from almost all the adjectives or participles
         in the language, excepting those which have a
         recognized and usual negative correspondent with the
         prefix -in. No attempt will be made, therefore, to
         define them all in this Dictionary; many will be
         omitted from its Vocabulary which are negations of the
         simple word, and are readily explained by prefixing a
         not to the latter. Derivatives of these words in -ly
         and -ness will also, for the most part, be omitted for
         the same or similar reasons. There will be inserted as
         separate articles with definitions, the following: --
         1. Those which have acquired an opposed or contrary,
         instead of a merely negative, meaning; as, unfriendly,
         ungraceful, unpalatable, unquiet, and the like; or else
         an intensive sense more than a prefixed not would
         express; as, unending, unparalleled, undisciplined,
         undoubted, unsafe, and the like. 2. Those which have
         the value of independent words, inasmuch as the simple
         words are either not used at all, or are rarely, or at
         least much less frequently, used; as, unavoidable,
         unconscionable, undeniable, unspeakable, unprecedented,
         unruly, and the like; or inasmuch as they are used in a
         different sense from the usual meaning of the
         primitive, or especially in one of the significations
         of the latter; as, unaccountable, unalloyed,
         unbelieving, unpretending, unreserved, and the like; or
         inasmuch as they are so frequently and familiarly used
         that they are hardly felt to be of negative origin; as,
         uncertain, uneven, and the like. 3. Those which are
         anomalous, provincial, or, for some other reason, not
         desirable to be used, and are so indicated; as, unpure
         for impure, unsatisfaction for dissatisfaction,
         unexpressible for inexpressible, and the like.
   II . Un- is prefixed to nouns to express the absence of, or
      the contrary of, that which the noun signifies; as,
      unbelief, unfaith, unhealth, unrest, untruth, and the
      like.

   Note: Compounds of this last class are given in full in their
         proper order in the Vocabulary.

   3. The power to understand; the intellectual faculty; the

            There is a spirit in man; and the inspiration of the

                                                  8.

            The power of perception is that which we call the
            understanding. Perception, which we make the act of
            the understanding, is of three sorts: 1. The
            perception of ideas in our mind; 2. The perception
            of the signification of signs; 3. The perception of
            the connection or repugnancy, agreement or
            disagreement, that there is between any of our
            ideas. All these are attributed to the
            understanding, or perceptive power, though it be the
            two latter only that use allows us to say we
            understand.                           --Locke.

            In its wider acceptation, understanding is the
            entire power of perceiving an conceiving, exclusive
            of the sensibility: the power of dealing with the
            impressions of sense, and composing them into
            wholes, according to a law of unity; and in its most
            comprehensive meaning it includes even simple
            apprehension.                         --Coleridge.

   4. Specifically, the discursive faculty; the faculty of
      knowing by the medium or use of general conceptions or
      relations. In this sense it is contrasted with, and
      distinguished from, the reason.

            I use the term understanding, not for the noetic
            faculty, intellect proper, or place of principles,
            but for the dianoetic or discursive faculty in its
            widest signification, for the faculty of relations
            or comparisons; and thus in the meaning in which
            ``verstand'' is now employed by the Germans. --Sir
                                                  W. Hamilton.

Undulatory \Un"du*la*to*ry\ (?; 277), a. [Cf. F. ondulatoire.]
   Moving in the manner of undulations, or waves; resembling the
   motion of waves, which successively rise or swell rise or
   swell and fall; pertaining to a propagated alternating
   motion, similar to that of waves.

   {Undulatory theory}, or {Wave theory} (of light) (Opt.), that
      theory which regards its various phenomena as due to
      undulations in an ethereal medium, propagated from the
      radiant with immense, but measurable, velocities, and
      producing different impressions on the retina according to
      their amplitude and frequency, the sensation of brightness
      depending on the former, that of color on the latter. The
      undulations are supposed to take place, not in the
      direction of propagation, as in the air waves constituting
      sound, but transversely, and the various phenomena of
      refraction, polarization, interference, etc., are
      attributable to the different affections of these
      undulations in different circumstances of propagation. It
      is computed that the frequency of the undulations
      corresponding to the several colors of the spectrum ranges
      from 458 millions of millions per second for the extreme
      red ray, to 727 millions of millions for the extreme
      violet, and their lengths for the same colors, from the
      thirty-eight thousandth to the sixty thousandth part of an
      inch. The theory of ethereal undulations is applicable not
      only to the phenomena of light, but also to those of heat.

   1. The act of uniting or joining two or more things into one,
      or the state of being united or joined; junction;

      Britain, covering the whole field; sometimes, as in the
      flag of the United States, and the English naval and
      marine flag, occupying the upper inner corner, the rest of
      the flag being called the fly. Also, a flag having such a
      device; especially, the flag of Great Britain.

   Note: The union of the United States ensign is a cluster of

         properly, equal in number to that of the States,
         displayed on a blue field; the fly being composed of
         alternate stripes of red and white. The union of the
         British ensign is the three crosses of St. George, St.
         Andrew, and St. Patrick in combination, denoting the
         union of England, Scotland and Ireland, displayed on a
         blue field in the national banner used on shore, on a

          simple oneness, either of essence, as the unity of
          God, or of action, feeling, etc., as unity of design,
          of affection, etc. Thus, we may speak of effecting a
          union of interests which shall result in a unity of
          labor and interest in securing a given object.

                One kingdom, joy, and union without end.

   Note: If two cords of the same substance have equal length,
         thickness, and tension, they are said to be in unison,
         and their sounds will be in unison. Sounds of very
         different qualities and force may be in unison, as the
         sound of a bell may be in unison with a sound of a
         flute. Unison, then, consists in identity of pitch
         alone, irrespective of quality of sound, or timbre,
         whether of instruments or of human voices. A piece or
         passage is said to be sung or played in unison when all
         the voices or instruments perform the same part, in
         which sense unison is contradistinguished from harmony.

   {Unit of heat} (Physics), a determinate quantity of heat
      adopted as a unit of measure; a thermal unit (see under
      {Thermal}). Water is the substance generally employed, the
      unit being one gram or one pound, and the temperature
      interval one degree of the Centigrade or Fahrenheit scale.
      When referred to the gram, it is called the gram degree.
      The British unit of heat, or thermal unit, used by
      engineers in England and in the United States, is the
      quantity of heat necessary to raise one pound of pure
      water at and near its temperature of greatest density
      (39.1[deg] Fahr.) through one degree of the Fahrenheit
      scale. --Rankine.

   {Unit of illumination}, the light of a sperm candle burning

   6. (Law) The peculiar characteristics of an estate held by
      several in joint tenancy.

   Note: The properties of it are derived from its unity, which
         is fourfold; unity of interest, unity of title, unity
         of time, and unity of possession; in other words, joint
         tenants have one and the same interest, accruing by one
         and the same conveyance, commencing at the same time,
         and held by one and the same undivided possession.
         Unity of possession is also a joint possession of two
         rights in the same thing by several titles, as when a
         man, having a lease of land, afterward buys the fee
         simple, or, having an easement in the land of another,
         buys the servient estate.

            farmers of the revenue, scribes, and others. --Eng.

      law, medicine, music, etc. A university may exist without
      having any college connected with it, or it may consist of
      but one college, or it may comprise an assemblage of
      colleges established in any place, with professors for
      instructing students in the sciences and other branches of
      learning.

            The present universities of Europe were, originally,
            the greater part of them, ecclesiastical
            corporations, instituted for the education of
            churchmen . . . What was taught in the greater part

            their institutions, either theology or something
            that was merely preparatory to theology. --A. Smith.

   Note: From the Roman words universitas, collegium, corpus,
         are derived the terms university, college, and
         corporation, of modern languages; and though these
         words have obtained modified significations in modern
         times, so as to be indifferently applicable to the same
         things, they all agree in retaining the fundamental
         signification of the terms, whatever may have been
         added to them. There is now no university, college, or
         corporation, which is not a juristical person in the
         sense above explained [see def. 2, above]; wherever
         these words are applied to any association of persons
         not stamped with this mark, it is an abuse of terms.
         --Eng. Cyc.

         with it of something that literally or metaphorically
         bears or supports. It is less employed than it used to
         be, on having for the most part taken its place. Some
         expressions formed with it belong only to old style;
         as, upon pity they were taken away; that is, in
         consequence of pity: upon the rate of thirty thousand;
         that is, amounting to the rate: to die upon the hand;

         that is, upon himself: the time is coming fast upon;
         that is, upon the present time. By the omission of its
         object, upon acquires an adverbial sense, as in the
         last two examples.

      as a urate, of urinary or renal calculi and of the
      so-called gouty concretions. From acid urines, uric acid
      is frequently deposited, on standing in a cool place, in
      the form of a reddish yellow sediment, nearly always
      crystalline. Chemically, it is composed of carbon,
      hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen, {C5H4N4O3}, and by
      decomposition yields urea, among other products. It can be
      made synthetically by heating together urea and glycocoll.
      It was formerly called also {lithic acid}, in allusion to
      its occurrence in stone, or calculus.

Urim \U"rim\, n. [Heb. ?r[=i]m, pl. of ?r, fire ?r light.]
   A part or decoration of the breastplate of the high priest
   among the ancient Jews, by which Jehovah revealed his will on
   certain occasions. Its nature has been the subject of
   conflicting conjectures.

         Thou shall put in the breastplate of judgment the Urim
         and the Thummim.                         --Ex. xxviii.
                                                  30.

         And when Saul inquired of the Lord, the Lord answered
         him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by
         prophets.                                --1 Sam.
                                                  xxviii. 6.

   Note: Professor Plumptre supposes the Urim to have been a
         clear and colorless stone set in the breastplate of the
         high priest as a symbol of light, answering to the
         mystic scarab in the pectoral plate of the ancient
         Egyptian priests, and that the Thummim was an image
         corresponding to that worn by the priestly judges of
         Egypt as a symbol of truth and purity of motive. By
         gazing steadfastly on these, he may have been thrown
         into a mysterious, half ecstatic state, akin to
         hypnotism, in which he lost all personal consciousness,
         and received a spiritual illumination and insight.

         from 40 to 60 ounces (about 1,200 cubic centimeters).
         Chemically, the urine is mainly an aqueous solution of
         urea, salt (sodium chloride), and uric acid, together
         with some hippuric acid and peculiar pigments. It
         usually has an acid reaction, owing to the presence of
         acid phosphates of soda or free uric acid. Normally, it
         contains about 960 parts of water to 40 parts of solid
         matter, and the daily average excretion is 35 grams
         (540 grains) of urea, 0.75 gram (11 grains) of uric
         acid, and 16.5 grams (260 grains) of salt. Abnormally,
         it may contain sugar as in diabetes, albumen as in

   Syn: Custom; use; habit.

   Usage: {Usage}, {Custom}. These words, as here compared,
          agree in expressing the idea of habitual practice; but
          a custom is not necessarily a usage. A custom may
          belong to many, or to a single individual. A usage
          properly belongs to the great body of a people. Hence,
          we speak of usage, not of custom, as the law of
          language. Again, a custom is merely that which has
          been often repeated, so as to have become, in a good
          degree, established. A usage must be both often
          repeated and of long standing. Hence, we speak of a
          ``hew custom,'' but not of a ``new usage.'' Thus,
          also, the ``customs of society'' is not so strong an
          expression as the ``usages of society.'' ``Custom, a
          greater power than nature, seldom fails to make them
          worship.'' --Locke. ``Of things once received and
          confirmed by use, long usage is a law sufficient.''
          --Hooker. In law, the words usage and custom are often
          used interchangeably, but the word custom also has a
          technical and restricted sense. See {Custom}, n., 3.

Use \Use\, v. t. [imp. & p. p. {Used}; p. pr. & vb. n. {Using}.]
   [OE. usen, F. user to use, use up, wear out, LL. usare to
   use, from L. uti, p. p. usus, to use, OL. oeti, oesus; of
   uncertain origin. Cf. {Utility}.]
   1. To make use of; to convert to one's service; to avail
      one's self of; to employ; to put a purpose; as, to use a
      plow; to use a chair; to use time; to use flour for food;

   Syn: Employ.

   Usage: {Use}, {Employ}. We use a thing, or make use of it,
          when we derive from it some enjoyment or service. We
          employ it when we turn that service into a particular
          channel. We use words to express our general meaning;
          we employ certain technical terms in reference to a
          given subject. To make use of, implies passivity in
          the thing; as, to make use of a pen; and hence there
          is often a material difference between the two words
          when applied to persons. To speak of ``making use of
          another'' generally implies a degrading idea, as if we
          had used him as a tool; while employ has no such
          sense. A confidential friend is employed to negotiate;
          an inferior agent is made use of on an intrigue.

                I would, my son, that thou wouldst use the power
                Which thy discretion gives thee, to control And

                and innocence are perfect joy.    --Dryden.

Use \Use\, v. i.
   1. To be wont or accustomed; to be in the habit or practice;
      as, he used to ride daily; -- now disused in the present
      tense, perhaps because of the similarity in sound, between
      ``use to,'' and ``used to.''

            They use to place him that shall be their captain on
            a stone.                              --Spenser.

            Fears use to be represented in an imaginary.
                                                  --Bacon.

            Thus we use to say, it is the room that smokes, when
            indeed it is the fire in the room.    --South.

            Now Moses used to take the tent and to pitch it
            without the camp.                     --Ex. xxxiii.
                                                  7 (Rev. Ver.)

      use.'' --Spenser.

                                                  Jonson.

            Ye valleys low, where the mild whispers use Of
            shades, and wanton winds, and gushing brooks.
                                                  --Milton.

Useful \Use"ful\, a.
   Full of use, advantage, or profit; producing, or having power
   to produce, good; serviceable for any end or object; helpful
   toward advancing any purpose; beneficial; profitable;
   advantageous; as, vessels and instruments useful in a family;
   books useful for improvement; useful knowledge; useful arts.

         thence ridiculous.                       --Milton.

   Syn: Fruitless; ineffectual.

   Usage: {Useless}, {Fruitless}, {Ineffectual}. We speak of an
          attempt, effort, etc., as being useless when there are
          in it inherent difficulties which forbid the hope of
          success, as fruitless when it fails, not from any such
          difficulties, but from some unexpected hindrance
          arising to frustrate it; as, the design was rendered
          fruitless by the death of its projector. Ineffectual
          nearly resembles fruitless, but implies a failure of a
          less hopeless character; as, after several ineffectual
          efforts, I at last succeeded.

                Useless are all words Till you have writ
                ``performance'' with your swords. The other is
                for waiving.                      --Beau. & Fl.

                Waiving all searches into antiquity, in relation
                to this controversy, as being either needless or
                fruitless.                        --Waterland.

                Even our blessed Savior's preaching, who spake
                as never man spake, was ineffectual to many.

   3. (Law) Interest in excess of a legal rate charged to a
      borrower for the use of money.

   Note: The practice of requiring in repayment of money lent
         anything more than the amount lent, was formerly
         thought to be a great moral wrong, and the greater, the
         more was taken. Now it is not deemed more wrong to take
         pay for the use of money than for the use of a house,
         or a horse, or any other property. But the lingering
         influence of the former opinion, together with the fact
         that the nature of money makes it easier for the lender
         to oppress the borrower, has caused nearly all
         Christian nations to fix by law the rate of
         compensation for the use of money. Of late years,
         however, the opinion that money should be borrowed and
         repaid, or bought and sold, upon whatever terms the
         parties should agree to, like any other property, has
         gained ground everywhere. --Am. Cyc.

      S. Mill.

   Syn: Usefulness; advantageous; benefit; profit; avail;
        service.

   Usage: {Utility}, {Usefulness}. Usefulness has an Anglo-Saxon
          prefix, utility is Latin; and hence the former is used
          chiefly of things in the concrete, while the latter is
          employed more in a general and abstract sense. Thus,
          we speak of the utility of an invention, and the
          usefulness of the thing invented; of the utility of an
          institution, and the usefulness of an individual. So
          beauty and utility (not usefulness) are brought into
          comparison. Still, the words are often used
          interchangeably.
