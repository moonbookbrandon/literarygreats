F \F\ ([e^]f).
   1. F is the sixth letter of the English alphabet, and a
      nonvocal consonant. Its form and sound are from the Latin.

      b; as in E. five, Gr. pe`nte; E. wolf, L. lupus, Gr.
      ly`kos; E. fox, vixen; fragile, break; fruit, brook, v.

Fat \Fat\, n.
   1. (Physiol. Chem.) An oily liquid or greasy substance making
      up the main bulk of the adipose tissue of animals, and
      widely distributed in the seeds of plants. See {Adipose
      tissue}, under {Adipose}.

   Note: Animal fats are composed mainly of three distinct fats,
         tristearin, tripalmitin, and triolein, mixed in varying
         proportions. As olein is liquid at ordinary
         temperatures, while the other two fats are solid, it
         follows that the consistency or hardness of fats
         depends upon the relative proportion of the three
         individual fats. During the life of an animal, the fat
         is mainly in a liquid state in the fat cells, owing to
         the solubility of the two solid fats in the more liquid
         olein at the body temperature. Chemically, fats are
         composed of fatty acid, as stearic, palmitic, oleic,
         etc., united with glyceryl. In butter fat, olein and
         palmitin predominate, mixed with another fat
         characteristic of butter, butyrin. In the vegetable
         kingdom many other fats or glycerides are to be found,
         as myristin from nutmegs, a glyceride of lauric acid in
         the fat of the bay tree, etc.

   2. The best or richest productions; the best part; as, to
      live on the fat of the land.

   3. (Typog.) Work. containing much blank, or its equivalent,
      and, therefore, profitable to the compositor.

   4. pl. [L. Fata, pl. of fatum.] (Myth.) The three goddesses,
      Clotho, Lachesis, and Atropos, sometimes called the
      {Destinies}, or {Parc[ae]}who were supposed to determine
      the course of human life. They are represented, one as
      holding the distaff, a second as spinning, and the third

   Note: Among all nations it has been common to speak of fate
         or destiny as a power superior to gods and men --

         the sum of the laws of the universe, the product of
         eternal intelligence and the blind properties of
         matter. Theological fate represents Deity as above the
         laws of nature, and ordaining all things according to
         his will -- the expression of that will being the law.
         --Krauth-Fleming.

          negative, some weakness or falling short in a man's
          character, disposition, or habits; a defect is also
          negative, and as applied to character is the absence
          of anything which is necessary to its completeness or
          perfection; a foible is a less important weakness,
          which we overlook or smile at. A man may have many
          failings, and yet commit but few faults; or his faults
          and failings may be few, while his foibles are obvious
          to all. The faults of a friend are often palliated or
          explained away into mere defects, and the defects or
          foibles of an enemy exaggerated into faults. ``I have
          failings in common with every human being, besides my
          own peculiar faults; but of avarice I have generally
          held myself guiltless.'' --Fox. ``Presumption and
          self-applause are the foibles of mankind.''
          --Waterland.

   A name given to a group of minerals, closely related in
   crystalline form, and all silicates of alumina with either
   potash, soda, lime, or, in one case, baryta. They occur in
   crystals and crystalline masses, vitreous in luster, and
   breaking rather easily in two directions at right angles to
   each other, or nearly so. The colors are usually white or
   nearly white, flesh-red, bluish, or greenish.

   Note: The group includes the monoclinic (orthoclastic)
         species orthoclase or common potash feldspar, and the
         rare hyalophane or baryta feldspar; also the triclinic
         species (called in general plagioclase) microcline,

         nearly all crystalline rocks, as granite, gneiss, mica,
         slate, most kinds of basalt and trachyte, etc. The
         decomposition of feldspar has yielded a large part of
         the clay of the soil, also the mineral kaolin, an

      either lands or goods, or both, at the common law, and to

      to the degree of guilt.

   3. A heinous crime; especially, a crime punishable by death
      or imprisonment.

   Note: Forfeiture for crime having been generally abolished in
         the United States, the term felony, in American law,
         has lost this point of distinction; and its meaning,
         where not fixed by statute, is somewhat vague and
         undefined; generally, however, it is used to denote an
         offense of a high grade, punishable either capitally or
         by a term of imprisonment. In Massachusetts, by
         statute, any crime punishable by death or imprisonment
         in the state prison, and no other, is a felony; so in
         New York. the tendency now is to obliterate the
         distinction between felonies and misdemeanors; and this
         has been done partially in England, and completely in
         some of the States of the Union. The distinction is
         purely arbitrary, and its entire abolition is only a
         question of time.

   Note: There is no lawyer who would undertake to tell what a
         felony is, otherwise than by enumerating the various
         kinds of offenses which are so called. originally, the
         word felony had a meaning: it denoted all offenses the
         penalty of which included forfeiture of goods; but
         subsequent acts of Parliament have declared various
         offenses to be felonies, without enjoining that
         penalty, and have taken away the penalty from others,
         which continue, nevertheless, to be called felonies,
         insomuch that the acts so called have now no property
         whatever in common, save that of being unlawful and
         purnishable. --J. S. Mill.

Fermentation \Fer`men*ta"tion\, n. [Cf. F. fermentation.]
   1. The process of undergoing an effervescent change, as by
      the action of yeast; in a wider sense (Physiol. Chem.),
      the transformation of an organic substance into new
      compounds by the action of a ferment, either formed or

   {Acetous, or Acetic}, {fermentation}, a form of oxidation in
      which alcohol is converted into vinegar or acetic acid by
      the agency of a specific fungus or ferment ({Mycoderma
      aceti}). The process involves two distinct reactions, in
      which the oxygen of the air is essential. An intermediate
      product, aldehyde, is formed in the first process. 1.
      C2H6O + O = H2O + C2H4O

   Note: Alcohol. Water. Aldehyde. 2. C2H4O + O = C2H4O2

   Note: Aldehyde. Acetic acid.

   {Alcoholic fermentation}, the fermentation which saccharine
      bodies undergo when brought in contact with the yeast
      plant or Torula. The sugar is converted, either directly
      or indirectly, into alcohol and carbonic acid, the rate of
      action being dependent on the rapidity with which the
      Torul[ae] develop.

   {Ammoniacal fermentation}, the conversion of the urea of the
      urine into ammonium carbonate, through the growth of the
      special urea ferment. CON2H4 + 2H2O = (NH4)2CO3

   Note: Urea. Water. Ammonium carbonate.

   Note: Whenever urine is exposed to the air in open vessels
         for several days it undergoes this alkaline
         fermentation.

   {Butyric fermentation}, the decomposition of various forms of
      organic matter, through the agency of a peculiar
      worm-shaped vibrio, with formation of more or less butyric
      acid. It is one of the many forms of fermentation that
      collectively constitute putrefaction. See {Lactic
      fermentation}.

   {Fermentation by an} {unorganized ferment or enzyme}.
      Fermentations of this class are purely chemical reactions,
      in which the ferment acts as a simple catalytic agent. Of
      this nature are the decomposition or inversion of cane
      sugar into levulose and dextrose by boiling with dilute
      acids, the conversion of starch into dextrin and sugar by
      similar treatment, the conversion of starch into like
      products by the action of diastase of malt or ptyalin of
      saliva, the conversion of albuminous food into peptones
      and other like products by the action of
      pepsin-hydrochloric acid of the gastric juice or by the
      ferment of the pancreatic juice.

   {Fermentation theory of disease} (Biol. & Med.), the theory
      that most if not all, infectious or zymotic disease are
      caused by the introduction into the organism of the living
      germs of ferments, or ferments already developed
      (organized ferments), by which processes of fermentation
      are set up injurious to health. See {Germ theory}.

   {Glycerin fermentation}, the fermentation which occurs on
      mixing a dilute solution of glycerin with a peculiar
      species of schizomycetes and some carbonate of lime, and
      other matter favorable to the growth of the plant, the
      glycerin being changed into butyric acid, caproic acid,
      butyl, and ethyl alcohol. With another form of bacterium
      ({Bacillus subtilis}) ethyl alcohol and butyric acid are
      mainly formed.

   {Lactic fermentation}, the transformation of milk sugar or
      other saccharine body into lactic acid, as in the souring
      of milk, through the agency of a special bacterium
      ({Bacterium lactis} of Lister). In this change the milk
      sugar, before assuming the form of lactic acid, presumably
      passes through the stage of glucose. C12H22O11.H2O =
      4C3H6O3

   Note: Hydrated milk sugar. Lactic acid.

   Note: In the lactic fermentation of dextrose or glucose, the
         lactic acid which is formed is very prone to undergo
         butyric fermentation after the manner indicated in the
         following equation: 2C3H6O3 (lactic acid) = C4H8O2
         (butyric acid) + 2CO2 (carbonic acid) + 2H2 (hydrogen
         gas).

          of particulars, viz., all the qualities which become a
          woman, -- breeding, sentiment, tact, etc. The term is
          equally comprehensive when we speak of a fine garden,
          landscape, horse, poem, etc.; and, though applied to a
          great variety of objects, the word has still a very
          definite sense, denoting a high degree of
          characteristic excellence.

          finical gentleman clips his words and screws his body
          into as small a compass as possible, to give himself
          the air of a delicate person; a spruce gentleman
          strives not to have a fold wrong in his frill or

      wavering or unsteady; to be irresolute or undetermined; to
      vacillate.

   Syn: To waver; vacillate; hesitate; scruple.

   Usage: To {Fluctuate}, {Vacillate}, {Waver}. -- Fluctuate is
          applied both to things and persons and denotes that
          they move as they are acted upon. The stocks
          fluctuate; a man fluctuates between conflicting
          influences. Vacillate and waver are applied to persons
          to represent them as acting themselves. A man
          vacillates when he goes backward and forward in his
          opinions and purposes, without any fixity of mind or
          principles. A man wavers when he shrinks back or
          hesitates at the approach of difficulty or danger. One
          who is fluctuating in his feelings is usually
          vacillating in resolve, and wavering in execution.

Focus \Fo"cus\, n.; pl. E. {Focuses}, L. {Foci}. [L. focus
   hearth, fireplace; perh. akin to E. bake. Cf. {Curfew},

   1. (Opt.) A point in which the rays of light meet, after
      being reflected or refrcted, and at which the image is
      formed; as, the focus of a lens or mirror.

   2. (Geom.) A point so related to a conic section and certain
      straight line called the directrix that the ratio of the
      distace between any point of the curve and the focus to
      the distance of the same point from the directrix is
      constant.

   Note: Thus, in the ellipse FGHKLM, A is the focus and CD the
         directrix, when the ratios FA:FE, GA:GD, MA:MC, etc.,
         are all equal. So in the hyperbola, A is the focus and
         CD the directrix when the ratio HA:HK is constant for
         all points of the curve; and in the parabola, A is the
         focus and CD the directrix when the ratio BA:BC is
         constant. In the ellipse this ratio is less than unity,
         in the parabola equal to unity, and in the hyperbola
         greater than unity. The ellipse and hyperbola have each
         two foci, and two corresponding directrixes, and the
         parabola has one focus and one directrix. In the
         ellipse the sum of the two lines from any point of the
         curve to the two foci is constant; that is:
         AG+GB=AH+HB; and in the hyperbola the difference of the
         corresponding lines is constant. The diameter which
         passes through the foci of the ellipse is the major
         axis. The diameter which being produced passes through
         the foci of the hyperbola is the transverse axis. The
         middle point of the major or the transverse axis is the
         center of the curve. Certain other curves, as the
         lemniscate and the Cartesian ovals, have points called
         foci, possessing properties similar to those of the
         foci of conic sections. In an ellipse, rays of light
         coming from one focus, and reflected from the curve,
         proceed in lines directed toward the other; in an
         hyperbola, in lines directed from the other; in a
         parabola, rays from the focus, after reflection at the
         curve, proceed in lines parallel to the axis. Thus rays
         from A in the ellipse are reflected to B; rays from A
         in the hyperbola are reflected toward L and M away from
         B.

   3. A central point; a point of concentration.

   {Aplanatic focus}. (Opt.) See under {Aplanatic}.

   {Conjugate focus} (Opt.), the focus for rays which have a
      sensible divergence, as from a near object; -- so called

   f[ae][eth]a, f[ae][eth]i, Sw. f["o]da, Dan. & LG. f["o]de,
   OHG. fatunga, Gr. patei^sthai to eat, and perh. to Skr. p[=a]
   to protect, L. pascere to feed, pasture, pabulum food, E.
   pasture. [root]75. Cf. {Feed}, {Fodder} food, {Foster} to
   cherish.]
   1. What is fed upon; that which goes to support life by being
      received within, and assimilated by, the organism of an
      animal or a plant; nutriment; aliment; especially, what is
      eaten by animals for nourishment.

   Note: In a physiological sense, true aliment is to be
         distinguished as that portion of the food which is
         capable of being digested and absorbed into the blood,
         thus furnishing nourishment, in distinction from the
         indigestible matter which passes out through the
         alimentary canal as f[ae]ces.

   Note: Foods are divided into two main groups: nitrogenous, or
         proteid, foods, i.e., those which contain nitrogen, and
         nonnitrogenous, i.e., those which do not contain
         nitrogen. The latter group embraces the fats and
         carbohydrates, which collectively are sometimes termed
         heat producers or respiratory foods, since by oxidation
         in the body they especially subserve the production of
         heat. The proteids, on the other hand, are known as
         plastic foods or tissue formers, since no tissue can be
         formed without them. These latter terms, however, are
         misleading, since proteid foods may also give rise to
         heat both directly and indirectly, and the fats and
         carbohydrates are useful in other ways than in
         producing heat.

   2. Anything that instructs the intellect, excites the
      feelings, or molds habits of character; that which
      nourishes.

            This may prove food to my displeasure. --Shak.

            years.                                --Wordsworth.

   Note: Food is often used adjectively or in self-explaining
         compounds, as in food fish or food-fish, food supply.

   Syn: Strength; vigor; might; energy; stress; vehemence;
        violence; compulsion; coaction; constraint; coercion.

   Usage: {Force}, {Strength}. Strength looks rather to power as
          an inward capability or energy. Thus we speak of the
          strength of timber, bodily strength, mental strength,
          strength of emotion, etc. Force, on the other hand,
          looks more to the outward; as, the force of
          gravitation, force of circumstances, force of habit,
          etc. We do, indeed, speak of strength of will and
          force of will; but even here the former may lean
          toward the internal tenacity of purpose, and the
          latter toward the outward expression of it in action.
          But, though the two words do in a few cases touch thus
          closely on each other, there is, on the whole, a
          marked distinction in our use of force and strength.
          ``Force is the name given, in mechanical science, to
          whatever produces, or can produce, motion.'' --Nichol.

                Thy tears are of no force to mollify This flinty
                man.                              --Heywood.

                More huge in strength than wise in works he was.
                                                  --Spenser.

                Adam and first matron Eve Had ended now their
                orisons, and found Strength added from above,

   Syn:

Pardon \Pardon\, remission \remission\

   Usage: {Forgiveness}, {Pardon}. Forgiveness is Anglo-Saxon,
          and pardon Norman French, both implying a giving back.
          The word pardon, being early used in our Bible, has,
          in religious matters, the same sense as forgiveness;
          but in the language of common life there is a
          difference between them, such as we often find between
          corresponding Anglo-Saxon and Norman words. Forgive
          points to inward feeling, and suppose alienated
          affection; when we ask forgiveness, we primarily seek
          the removal of anger. Pardon looks more to outward
          things or consequences, and is often applied to
          trifling matters, as when we beg pardon for
          interrupting a man, or for jostling him in a crowd.
          The civil magistrate also grants a pardon, and not
          forgiveness. The two words are, therefore, very
          clearly distinguished from each other in most cases
          which relate to the common concerns of life. Forgiver

        ceremonial; external; outward.

   Usage: {Formal}, {Ceremonious}. When applied to things, these
          words usually denote a mere accordance with the rules
          of form or ceremony; as, to make a formal call; to
          take a ceremonious leave. When applied to a person or

          too much stress on the conventional laws of social
          intercourse. Formal manners render a man stiff or
          ridiculous; a ceremonious carriage puts a stop to the
          ease and freedom of social intercourse.

   function}, a quantity whose relation to the variable is the
      same as that of a certain straight line drawn in a circle
      whose radius is unity, to the length of a corresponding
      are of the circle. Let AB be an arc in a circle, whose
      radius OA is unity let AC be a quadrant, and let OC, DB,
      and AF be drawnpependicular to OA, and EB and CG parallel
      to OA, and let OB be produced to G and F. E Then BD is the
      sine of the arc AB; OD or EB is the cosine, AF is the
      tangent, CG is the cotangent, OF is the secant OG is the
      cosecant, AD is the versed sine, and CE is the coversed
      sine of the are AB. If the length of AB be represented by
      x (OA being unity) then the lengths of Functions. these
      lines (OA being unity) are the trigonometrical functions
      of x, and are written sin x, cos x, tan x (or tang x), cot
      x, sec x, cosec x, versin x, coversin x. These quantities
      are also considered as functions of the angle BOA.
