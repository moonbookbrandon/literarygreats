S \S\ ([e^]s),
   the nineteenth letter of the English alphabet, is a
   consonant, and is often called a sibilant, in allusion to its
   hissing sound. It has two principal sounds; one a mere
   hissing, as in sack, this; the other a vocal hissing (the
   same as that of z), as in is, wise. Besides these it
   sometimes has the sounds of sh and zh, as in sure, measure.
   It generally has its hissing sound at the beginning of words,
   but in the middle and at the end of words its sound is
   determined by usage. In a few words it is silent, as in isle,
   d['e]bris. With the letter h it forms the digraph sh. See
   Guide to pronunciation, [sect][sect] 255-261.

   Note: Both the form and the name of the letter S are derived
         from the Latin, which got the letter through the Greek
         from the Ph[ae]nician. The ultimate origin is Egyptian.
         S is etymologically most nearly related to c, z, t, and
         r; as, in ice, OE. is; E. hence, OE. hennes; E. rase,
         raze; erase, razor; that, G. das; E. reason, F. raison,

          all parts of the United States, as it is in England.

   Syn: {Sacrament}, {Eucharist}.

   Usage: Protestants apply the term sacrament to baptism and
          the Lord's Supper, especially the latter. The R. Cath.
          and Greek churches have five other sacraments, viz.,
          confirmation, penance, holy orders, matrimony, and
          extreme unction. As sacrament denotes an oath or vow,
          the word has been applied by way of emphasis to the
          Lord's Supper, where the most sacred vows are renewed
          by the Christian in commemorating the death of his
          Redeemer. Eucharist denotes the giving of thanks; and
          this term also has been applied to the same ordinance,
          as expressing the grateful remembrance of Christ's
          sufferings and death. ``Some receive the sacrament as
          a means to procure great graces and blessings; others
          as an eucharist and an office of thanksgiving for what
          they have received.'' --Jer. Taylor.

         internal organ, a series of the other kind. These are
         united together, side by side, so as to form a chain,
         or cluster, often of large size. Each of the
         individuals composing the chain carries a single egg,
         which develops into the solitary kind.

          meeting. It is used especially of uttered expressions
          of good will. Salute, while formerly and sometimes
          still in the sense of either greeting or salutation,
          is now used specifically to denote a conventional

   Syn: Plan; project; contrivance; purpose; device; plot.

   Usage: {Scheme}, {Plan}. Scheme and plan are subordinate to
          design; they propose modes of carrying our designs
          into effect. Scheme is the least definite of the two,
          and lies more in speculation. A plan is drawn out into
          details with a view to being carried into effect. As
          schemes are speculative, they often prove visionary;
          hence the opprobrious use of the words schemer and
          scheming. Plans, being more practical, are more
          frequently carried into effect.

                'T is fixed, 't is done, and both are doomed to
                death.                            --Rowe.

Schooner \Schoon"er\, n. [See the Note below. Cf. {Shun}.]
   (Naut.)
   Originally, a small, sharp-built vessel, with two masts and
   fore-and-aft rig. Sometimes it carried square topsails on one
   or both masts and was called a {topsail schooner}. About
   1840, longer vessels with three masts, fore-and-aft rigged,
   came into use, and since that time vessels with four masts
   and even with six masts, so rigged, are built. Schooners with
   more than two masts are designated three-masted schooners,
   four-masted schooners, etc. See Illustration in Appendix.



   Note: The first schooner ever constructed is said to have
         been built in Gloucester, Massachusetts, about the year
         1713, by a Captain Andrew Robinson, and to have
         received its name from the following trivial
         circumstance: When the vessel went off the stocks into
         the water, a bystander cried out,``O, how she scoons!''
         Robinson replied, `` A scooner let her be;'' and, from
         that time, vessels thus masted and rigged have gone by
         this name. The word scoon is popularly used in some
         parts of New England to denote the act of making stones
         skip along the surface of water. The Scottish scon
         means the same thing. Both words are probably allied to
         the Icel. skunda, skynda, to make haste, hurry, AS.
         scunian to avoid, shun, Prov. E. scun. In the New
         England records, the word appears to have been
         originally written scooner. Babson, in his ``History of
         Gloucester,'' gives the following extract from a letter
         written in that place Sept. 25, 1721, by Dr. Moses
         Prince, brother of the Rev. Thomas Prince, the annalist
         of New England: ``This gentleman (Captain Robinson) was
         first contriver of schooners, and built the first of
         that sort about eight years since.''

   1. Knowledge; knowledge of principles and causes; ascertained
      truth of facts.

            If we conceive God's sight or science, before the
            creation, to be extended to all and every part of
            the world, seeing everything as it is, . . . his
            science or sight from all eternity lays no necessity
            on anything to come to pass.          --Hammond.

            Shakespeare's deep and accurate science in mental
            philosophy.                           --Coleridge.

   2. Accumulated and established knowledge, which has been
      systematized and formulated with reference to the
      discovery of general truths or the operation of general
      laws; knowledge classified and made available in work,

      philosophical knowledge.

            All this new science that men lere [teach].
                                                  --Chaucer.

            Science is . . . a complement of cognitions, having,
            in point of form, the character of logical
            perfection, and in point of matter, the character of
            real truth.                           --Sir W.
                                                  Hamilton.

   3. Especially, such knowledge when it relates to the physical
      world and its phenomena, the nature, constitution, and
      forces of matter, the qualities and functions of living
      tissues, etc.; -- called also {natural science}, and
      {physical science}.

            Voltaire hardly left a single corner of the field
            entirely unexplored in science, poetry, history,
            philosophy.                           --J. Morley.

   4. Any branch or department of systematized knowledge
      considered as a distinct field of investigation or object
      of study; as, the science of astronomy, of chemistry, or

   Note: The ancients reckoned seven sciences, namely, grammar,
         rhetoric, logic, arithmetic, music, geometry, and
         astronomy; -- the first three being included in the
         Trivium, the remaining four in the Quadrivium.

               Good sense, which only is the gift of Heaven, And
               though no science, fairly worth the seven.
                                                  --Pope.

   5. Art, skill, or expertness, regarded as the result of
      knowledge of laws and principles.

            His science, coolness, and great strength. --G. A.
                                                  Lawrence.

   Note: Science is applied or pure. Applied science is a
         knowledge of facts, events, or phenomena, as explained,
         accounted for, or produced, by means of powers, causes,
         or laws. Pure science is the knowledge of these powers,
         causes, or laws, considered apart, or as pure from all
         applications. Both these terms have a similar and
         special signification when applied to the science of
         quantity; as, the applied and pure mathematics. Exact
         science is knowledge so systematized that prediction
         and verification, by measurement, experiment,
         observation, etc., are possible. The mathematical and
         physical sciences are called the exact sciences.

   {Comparative sciences}, {Inductive sciences}. See under
      {Comparative}, and {Inductive}.

   Syn: Literature; art; knowledge.

   Usage: {Science}, {Literature}, {Art}. Science is literally
          knowledge, but more usually denotes a systematic and
          orderly arrangement of knowledge. In a more
          distinctive sense, science embraces those branches of
          knowledge of which the subject-matter is either
          ultimate principles, or facts as explained by
          principles or laws thus arranged in natural order. The
          term literature sometimes denotes all compositions not
          embraced under science, but usually confined to the
          belles-lettres. [See {Literature}.] Art is that which
          depends on practice and skill in performance. ``In
          science, scimus ut sciamus; in art, scimus ut
          producamus. And, therefore, science and art may be
          said to be investigations of truth; but one, science,
          inquires for the sake of knowledge; the other, art,
          for the sake of production; and hence science is more
          concerned with the higher truths, art with the lower;
          and science never is engaged, as art is, in productive
          application. And the most perfect state of science,
          therefore, will be the most high and accurate inquiry;
          the perfection of art will be the most apt and
          efficient system of rules; art always throwing itself
          into the form of rules.'' --Karslake.

      process by which the embryos of all the higher plants and
      animals are derived from the germ cell. In the simplest
      case, that of small ova destitute of food yolk, the ovum
      or egg divides into two similar halves or segments
      (blastomeres), each of these again divides into two, and
      so on, thus giving rise to a mass of cells (mulberry mass,
      or morula), all equal and similar, from the growth and
      development of which the future animal is to be formed.
      This constitutes regular segmentation. Quite frequently,
      however, the equality and regularity of cleavage is
      interfered with by the presence of food yolk, from which
      results unequal segmentation. See {Holoblastic},

      money of the pieces coined from it.

            If government, however, throws the expense of
            coinage, as is reasonable, upon the holders, by
            making a charge to cover the expense (which is done
            by giving back rather less in coin than has been
            received in bullion, and is called ``levying a

   Syn: Selfishness.

   Usage: {Self-love}, {Selfishness}. The term self-love is used
          in a twofold sense: 1. It denotes that longing for
          good or for well-being which actuates the breasts of
          all, entering into and characterizing every special
          desire. In this sense it has no moral quality, being,
          from the nature of the case, neither good nor evil. 2.
          It is applied to a voluntary regard for the
          gratification of special desires. In this sense it is
          morally good or bad according as these desires are
          conformed to duty or opposed to it. Selfishness is
          always voluntary and always wrong, being that regard
          to our own interests, gratification, etc., which is
          sought or indulged at the expense, and to the injury,
          of others. ``So long as self-love does not degenerate
          into selfishness, it is quite compatible with true
          benevolence.'' --Fleming. ``Not only is the phrase
          self-love used as synonymous with the desire of
          happiness, but it is often confounded with the word
          selfishness, which certainly, in strict propriety,
          denotes a very different disposition of mind.''
          --Slewart.

      whether agreeable or disagreeable, produced either by an
      external object (stimulus), or by some change in the
      internal state of the body.

            Perception is only a special kind of knowledge, and
            sensation a special kind of feeling. . . . Knowledge
            and feeling, perception and sensation, though always
            coexistent, are always in the inverse ratio of each
            other.                                --Sir W.
                                                  Hamilton.

   Syn: Perception.

   Usage: {Sensation}, {Perseption}. The distinction between
          these words, when used in mental philosophy, may be
          thus stated; if I simply smell a rose, I have a
          sensation; if I refer that smell to the external
          object which occasioned it, I have a perception. Thus,
          the former is mere feeling, without the idea of an
          object; the latter is the mind's apprehension of some
          external object as occasioning that feeling.
          ``Sensation properly expresses that change in the
          state of the mind which is produced by an impression
          upon an organ of sense (of which change we can
          conceive the mind to be conscious, without any
          knowledge of external objects). Perception, on the
          other hand, expresses the knowledge or the intimations
          we obtain by means of our sensations concerning the
          qualities of matter, and consequently involves, in
          every instance, the notion of externality, or outness,
          which it is necessary to exclude in order to seize the
          precise import of the word sensation.'' --Fleming.

Sensational \Sen*sa"tion*al\, a.
   1. Of or pertaining to sensation; as, sensational nerves.

   2. Of or pertaining to sensationalism, or the doctrine that
      sensation is the sole origin of knowledge.

   3. Suited or intended to excite temporarily great interest or

      sensational report.

Sensationalism \Sen*sa"tion*al*ism\, n.
   1. (Metaph.) The doctrine held by Condillac, and by some
      ascribed to Locke, that our ideas originate solely in
      sensation, and consist of sensations transformed;
      sensualism; -- opposed to {intuitionalism}, and
      {rationalism}.

   2. The practice or methods of sensational writing or
      speaking; as, the sensationalism of a novel.

Sensationalist \Sen*sa"tion*al*ist\, n.
   1. (Metaph.) An advocate of, or believer in, philosophical
      sensationalism.

   2. One who practices sensational writing or speaking.

Sense \Sense\, n. [L. sensus, from sentire, sensum, to perceive,
   to feel, from the same root as E. send; cf. OHG. sin sense,
   mind, sinnan to go, to journey, G. sinnen to meditate, to
   think: cf. F. sens. For the change of meaning cf. {See}, v.
   t. See {Send}, and cf. {Assent}, {Consent}, {Scent}, v. t.,

      perceiving changes in the condition of the body; as, the
      senses of sight, smell, hearing, taste, and touch. See
      {Muscular sense}, under {Muscular}, and {Temperature
      sense}, under {Temperature}.

            Let fancy still my sense in Lethe steep. --Shak.

            What surmounts the reach Of human sense I shall
            delineate.                            --Milton.

   2. Perception by the sensory organs of the body; sensation;
      sensibility; feeling.

            instantly make a transcursion through the whole.

          common, and by which they test the truth of knowledge
          and the morality of actions.''
      (b) ``The faculty of first principles.'' These two are the
          philosophical significations.
      (c) ``Such ordinary complement of intelligence, that,if a
          person be deficient therein, he is accounted mad or

          intelligence, natural prudence, mother wit, tact in

   Syn: Understanding; reason.

   Usage: {Sense}, {Understanding}, {Reason}. Some philosophers
          have given a technical signification to these terms,
          which may here be stated. Sense is the mind's acting
          in the direct cognition either of material objects or
          of its own mental states. In the first case it is
          called the outer, in the second the inner, sense.
          Understanding is the logical faculty, i. e., the power
          of apprehending under general conceptions, or the
          power of classifying, arranging, and making
          deductions. Reason is the power of apprehending those
          first or fundamental truths or principles which are
          the conditions of all real and scientific knowledge,
          and which control the mind in all its processes of
          investigation and deduction. These distinctions are
          given, not as established, but simply because they
          often occur in writers of the present day.

            The word sentiment, agreeably to the use made of it
            by our best English writers, expresses, in my own
            opinion very happily, those complex determinations
            of the mind which result from the co["o]peration of
            our rational powers and of our moral feelings.

            Mr. Hume sometimes employs (after the manner of the
            French metaphysicians) sentiment as synonymous with
            feeling; a use of the word quite unprecedented in
            our tongue.                           --Stewart.

            Less of sentiment than sense.         --Tennyson.

   Syn: Thought; opinion; notion; sensibility; feeling.

   Usage: {Sentiment}, {Opinion}, {Feeling}. An opinion is an
          intellectual judgment in respect to any and every kind
          of truth. Feeling describes those affections of
          pleasure and pain which spring from the exercise of
          our sentient and emotional powers. Sentiment
          (particularly in the plural) lies between them,
          denoting settled opinions or principles in regard to
          subjects which interest the feelings strongly, and are
          presented more or less constantly in practical life.
          Hence, it is more appropriate to speak of our
          religious sentiments than opinions, unless we mean to
          exclude all reference to our feelings. The word
          sentiment, in the singular, leans ordinarily more to
          the side of feeling, and denotes a refined sensibility
          on subjects affecting the heart. ``On questions of
          feeling, taste, observation, or report, we define our
          sentiments. On questions of science, argument, or
          metaphysical abstraction, we define our opinions. The
          sentiments of the heart. The opinions of the mind . .
          . There is more of instinct in sentiment, and more of
          definition in opinion. The admiration of a work of art
          which results from first impressions is classed with
          our sentiments; and, when we have accounted to
          ourselves for the approbation, it is classed with our
          opinions.'' --W. Taylor.

   1. Having, expressing, or containing a sentiment or

      moral reflection; didactic. [Obsoles.]

            Nay, ev'n each moral sentimental stroke, Where not
            the character, but poet, spoke, He lopped, as
            foreign to his chaste design, Nor spared a useless,
            though a golden line.                 --Whitehead.

   2. Inclined to sentiment; having an excess of sentiment or
      sensibility; indulging the sensibilities for their own

   Syn: Romantic.

   Usage: {Sentimental}, {Romantic}. Sentimental usually
          describes an error or excess of the sensibilities;
          romantic, a vice of the imagination. The votary of the
          former gives indulgence to his sensibilities for the
          mere luxury of their excitement; the votary of the
          latter allows his imagination to rove for the pleasure
          of creating scenes of ideal enjoiment. ``Perhaps there
          is no less danger in works called sentimental. They
          attack the heart more successfully, because more
          cautiously.'' --V. Knox. ``I can not but look on an
          indifferency of mind, as to the good or evil things of
          this life, as a mere romantic fancy of such who would
          be thought to be much wiser than they ever were, or
          could be.'' --Bp. Stillingfleet.

Shall \Shall\, v. i. & auxiliary. [imp. {Should}.] [OE. shal,
   schal, imp. sholde, scholde, AS. scal, sceal, I am obliged,
   imp. scolde, sceolde, inf. sculan; akin to OS. skulan, pres.
   skal, imp. skolda, D. zullen, pres. zal, imp. zoude, zou,
   OHG. solan, scolan, pres. scal, sol. imp. scolta, solta, G.
   sollen, pres. soll, imp. sollte, Icel. skulu, pres. skal,
   imp. skyldi, SW. skola, pres. skall, imp. skulle, Dan.
   skulle, pres. skal, imp. skulde, Goth. skulan, pres. skal,
   imp. skulda, and to AS. scyld guilt, G. schuld guilt, fault,
   debt, and perhaps to L. scelus crime.]

   Note: [Shall is defective, having no infinitive, imperative,
         or participle.]
   1. To owe; to be under obligation for. [Obs.] ``By the faith
      I shall to God'' --Court of Love.

   2. To be obliged; must. [Obs.] ``Me athinketh [I am sorry]
      that I shall rehearse it her.'' --Chaucer.

   3. As an auxiliary, shall indicates a duty or necessity whose
      obligation is derived from the person speaking; as, you
      shall go; he shall go; that is, I order or promise your
      going. It thus ordinarily expresses, in the second and
      third persons, a command, a threat, or a promise. If the
      auxillary be emphasized, the command is made more
      imperative, the promise or that more positive and sure. It
      is also employed in the language of prophecy; as, ``the
      day shall come when . . ., '' since a promise or threat
      and an authoritative prophecy nearly coincide in
      significance. In shall with the first person, the
      necessity of the action is sometimes implied as residing
      elsewhere than in the speaker; as, I shall suffer; we
      shall see; and there is always a less distinct and
      positive assertion of his volition than is indicated by
      will. ``I shall go'' implies nearly a simple futurity;
      more exactly, a foretelling or an expectation of my going,
      in which, naturally enough, a certain degree of plan or
      intention may be included; emphasize the shall, and the
      event is described as certain to occur, and the expression
      approximates in meaning to our emphatic ``I will go.'' In
      a question, the relation of speaker and source of
      obligation is of course transferred to the person
      addressed; as, ``Shall you go?'' (answer, ``I shall go'');
      ``Shall he go?'' i. e., ``Do you require or promise his
      going?'' (answer, ``He shall go''.) The same relation is
      transferred to either second or third person in such
      phrases as ``You say, or think, you shall go;'' ``He says,
      or thinks, he shall go.'' After a conditional conjunction
      (as if, whether) shall is used in all persons to express
      futurity simply; as, if I, you, or he shall say they are
      right. Should is everywhere used in the same connection
      and the same senses as shall, as its imperfect. It also
      expresses duty or moral obligation; as, he should do it
      whether he will or not. In the early English, and hence in
      our English Bible, shall is the auxiliary mainly used, in
      all the persons, to express simple futurity. (Cf. {Will},
      v. t.) Shall may be used elliptically; thus, with an
      adverb or other word expressive of motion go may be
      omitted. ``He to England shall along with you.'' --Shak.

   Note: Shall and will are often confounded by inaccurate
         speakers and writers. Say: I shall be glad to see you.
         Shall I do this? Shall I help you? (not Will I do
         this?) See {Will}.

         grow to an enormous size, the former becoming forty
         feet or more, and the latter sixty feet or more, in
         length. Most of them are harmless to man, but some are
         exceedingly voracious. The man-eating sharks mostly
         belong to the genera {Carcharhinus}, {Carcharodon}, and
         related genera. They have several rows of large sharp
         teeth with serrated edges, as the great white shark
         ({Carcharodon carcharias, or Rondeleti}) of tropical
         seas, and the great blue shark ({Carcharhinus glaucus})

         voracious and dangerous species known. The rare
         man-eating shark of the United States coast
         ({Charcarodon Atwoodi}) is thought by some to be a

         shark ({Carcharhinus obscurus}), and the smaller blue
         shark ({C. caudatus}), both common species on the coast

   Usage: {Shining}, {Brilliant}, {Sparking}. Shining describes
          the steady emission of a strong light, or the steady
          reflection of light from a clear or polished surface.
          Brilliant denotes a shining of great brightness, but
          with gleams or flashes. Sparkling implies a fitful,
          intense shining from radiant points or sparks, by
          which the eye is dazzled. The same distinctions obtain
          when these epithets are figuratively applied. A man of
          shining talents is made conspicious by possessing
          them; if they flash upon the mind with a peculiarly
          striking effect, we call them brilliant; if his
          brilliancy is marked by great vivacity and occasional
          intensity, he is sparkling.

                True paradise . . . inclosed with shining rock.

            vowels are generally wide, the long narrow, besides

            originally short vowels can be lengthened and yet

         {Pisces} ([Pisces]). These names were originally the
         names of the constellations occupying severally the
         divisions of the zodiac, by which they are still
         retained; but, in consequence of the procession of the
         equinoxes, the signs have, in process of time, become
         separated about 30 degrees from these constellations,
         and each of the latter now lies in the sign next in

       appreciable by some one other than the patient.

         synonymously; but they may be discriminated. A sign
         differs from a symptom in that the latter is perceived
         only by the patient himself. The term sign is often
         further restricted to the purely local evidences of
         disease afforded by direct examination of the organs
         involved, as distinguished from those evidence of
         general disturbance afforded by observation of the
         temperature, pulse, etc. In this sense it is often
         called physical sign.
   (m) (Mus.) Any character, as a flat, sharp, dot, etc.
   (n) (Theol.) That which, being external, stands for, or
       signifies, something internal or spiritual; -- a term

   sense, one, one and the same; cf. L. semel once, singuli one
   to each, single. Cg. {Single}, a., {Same}, a., and for the
   last part of the word cf. {Double}, {Complex}.]

   Usage: {Simple}, {Silly}. One who is simple is sincere,
          unaffected, and inexperienced in duplicity, -- hence
          liable to be duped. A silly person is one who is
          ignorant or weak and also self-confident; hence, one
          who shows in speech and act a lack of good sense.
          Simplicity is incompatible with duplicity, artfulness,
          or vanity, while silliness is consistent with all
          three. Simplicity denotes lack of knowledge or of
          guile; silliness denotes want of judgment or right
          purpose, a defect of character as well as of
          education.

            simple itself as it comes over from the Indies.
                                                  --Sir W.

   [Written also {sceptic}.]

      philosophical grounds; sometimes, a critical inquirer, in
      opposition to a dogmatist.

            All this criticism [of Hume] proceeds upon the
            erroneous hypothesis that he was a dogmatist. He was
            a skeptic; that is, he accepted the principles
            asserted by the prevailing dogmatism: and only
            showed that such and such conclusions were, on these
            principles, inevitable.               --Sir W.

            sophistries of skeptics.              --S. Clarke.

   Note: This word and its derivatives are often written with c
         instead of k in the first syllable, -- sceptic,
         sceptical, scepticism, etc. Dr. Johnson, struck with
         the extraordinary irregularity of giving c its hard
         sound before e, altered the spelling, and his example
         has been followed by most of the lexicographers who
         have succeeded him; yet the prevalent practice among
         English writers and printers is in favor of the other
         mode. In the United States this practice is reversed, a
         large and increasing majority of educated persons
         preferring the orthography which is most in accordance
         with etymology and analogy.

                                                  --Hune.

   2. (Metaph.) The doctrine that no fact or principle can be
      certainly known; the tenet that all knowledge is
      uncertain; Pyrrohonism; universal doubt; the position that
      no fact or truth, however worthy of confidence, can be
      established on philosophical grounds; critical
      investigation or inquiry, as opposed to the positive

Sketch \Sketch\, n. [D. schets, fr. It. schizzo a sketch, a
   splash (whence also F. esquisse; cf. {Esquisse}.); cf. It.
   schizzare to splash, to sketch.]
   An outline or general delineation of anything; a first rough
   or incomplete draught or plan of any design; especially, in
   the fine arts, such a representation of an object or scene as
   serves the artist's purpose by recording its chief features;
   also, a preliminary study for an original work.

   Syn: Outline; delineation; draught; plan; design.

   Usage: {Sketch}, {Outline}, {Delineation}. An outline gives
          only the bounding lines of some scene or picture. A
          sketch fills up the outline in part, giving broad
          touches, by which an imperfect idea may be conveyed. A
          delineation goes further, carrying out the more
          striking features of the picture, and going so much
          into detail as to furnish a clear conception of the
          whole. Figuratively, we may speak of the outlines of a
          plan, of a work, of a project, etc., which serve as a
          basis on which the subordinate parts are formed, or of
          sketches of countries, characters, manners, etc.,
          which give us a general idea of the things described.
          --Crabb.

      (2) 4 -1 71 8 -2-7 2 1

   Note: This requires that the numbers in the diagonal from the
         upper left to lower right corner be zeros. A like
         determinant in which the numbers in the diagonal are
         not zeros is a skew determinant, as in (2), above.

   Syn: Dexterity; adroitness; expertness; art; aptitude;
        ability.

   Usage: {Skill}, {Dexterity}, {Adroitness}. Skill is more
          intelligent, denoting familiar knowledge united to
          readiness of performance. Dexterity, when applied to
          the body, is more mechanical, and refers to habitual
          ease of execution. Adroitness involves the same image
          with dexterity, and differs from it as implaying a
          general facility of movement (especially in avoidance
          of danger or in escaping from a difficalty). The same
          distinctions apply to the figurative sense of the
          words. A man is skillful in any employment when he
          understands both its theory and its practice. He is
          dexterous when he maneuvers with great lightness. He
          is adroit in the use od quick, sudden, and
          well-directed movements of the body or the mind, so as

   sl["a]t, Goth. sla['i]hts; or uncertain origin.]
   1. Not decidedly marked; not forcible; inconsiderable;
      unimportant; insignificant; not severe; weak; gentle; --

          other concerns. To slight is always a positive and
          intentional act, resulting from feelings of dislike or
          contempt. We ought to put a kind construction on what
          appears neglect on the part of a friend; but when he
          slights us, it is obvious that he is our friend no
          longer.

                Beware . . . lest the like befall . . . If they
                transgress and slight that sole command.

   perhaps to AS. s[=i]pan to drip, MHG. s[=i]fen, and L. sebum
   tallow. Cf. {Saponaceous}.]
   A substance which dissolves in water, thus forming a lather,
   and is used as a cleansing agent. Soap is produced by
   combining fats or oils with alkalies or alkaline earths,
   usually by boiling, and consists of salts of sodium,
   potassium, etc., with the fatty acids (oleic, stearic,
   palmitic, etc.). See the Note below, and cf.
   {Saponification}. By extension, any compound of similar
   composition or properties, whether used as a cleaning agent
   or not.

   Note: In general, soaps are of two classes, hard and soft.
         Calcium, magnesium, lead, etc., form soaps, but they
         are insoluble and useless.

               The purifying action of soap depends upon the
               fact that it is decomposed by a large quantity of
               water into free alkali and an insoluble acid

         reform which disturbs the present system of private

   Syn: Hard; firm; compact; strong; substantial; stable; sound;
        real; valid; true; just; weighty; profound; grave;
        important.

   Usage: {Solid}, {Hard}. These words both relate to the

          and solid to fluid, liquid, open, or hollow. Wood is
          usually solid; but some kinds of wood are hard, and
          others are soft.

   Syn: Syn. Loneliness; soitariness; loneness; retiredness;
        recluseness. -- {Solitude}, {Retirement}, {Seclusion},
        {Loneliness}.

   Usage: Retirement is a withdrawal from general society,
          implying that a person has been engaged in its scenes.
          Solitude describes the fact that a person is alone;
          seclusion, that he is shut out from others, usually by
          his own choice; loneliness, that he feels the pain and
          oppression of being alone. Hence, retirement is
          opposed to a gay, active, or public life; solitude, to
          society; seclusion, to freedom of access on the part
          of others; and loneliness, enjoyment of that society
          which the heart demands.

                O blest retirement, friend to life's decline.
                                                  --Goldsmith.

                Such only can enjoy the country who are capable
                of thinking when they are there; then they are
                prepared for solitude; and in that [the country]
                solitude is prepared for them.    --Dryden.

                It is a place of seclusion from the external
                world.                            --Bp. Horsley.

                These evils . . . seem likely to reduce it [a
                city] ere long to the loneliness and the
                insignificance of a village.      --Eustace.

   to sol-fa; -- called from the musical notes sol, mi. See
   {Sol-fa}.] (Mus.)
   The act of sol-faing. [Written also {solmisation}.]

   Note: This art was practiced by the Greeks; but six of the
         seven syllables now in use are generally attributed to
         Guido d' Arezzo, an Italian monk of the eleventh
         century, who is said to have taken them from the first
         syllables of the first six lines of the following
         stanza of a monkish hymn to St. John the Baptist.

               Ut queant laxis Resonare fibris Mira gestorum
               Famuli tuorum Solve polluti Labii reatum, Sancte
               Joannes. Professor Skeat says the name of the
         seventh note, si, was also formed by him [Guido] from
         the initials of the two words of the last line; but
         this is disputed, Littr['e] attributing the first use
         of it to Anselm of Flanders long afterwards. The
         syllable do is often substituted for ut.

            It is unquestionably an enterprise of more promise
            to assail the nations in their hour of faintness and
            solution, than at a time when magnificent and
            seductive systems of worship were at their height of

   4. (Chem.Phys.) The act or process by which a body (whether
      solid, liquid, or gaseous) is absorbed into a liquid, and,
      remaining or becoming fluid, is diffused throughout the
      solvent; also, the product reulting from such absorption.

   Note: When a solvent will not take in any more of a substance
         the solution is said to be saturated. Solution is two
         kinds; viz.: (a) {Mechanical solution}, in which no
         marked chemical change takes place, and in which, in
         the case of solids, the dissolved body can be regained
         by evaporation, as in the solution of salt or sugar in
         water. (b) {Chemical solution}, in which there is
         involved a decided chemical change, as when limestone
         or zinc undergoes solution in hydrochloric acid.
         {Mechanical solution} is regarded as a form of
         molecular or atomic attraction, and is probably
         occasioned by the formation of certain very weak and
         unstable compounds which are easily dissociated and
         pass into new and similar compounds.

   Note: This word is not used in chemistry or mineralogy for
         fusion, or the melting of bodies by the heat of fire.

   Usage: {Sort}, {Kind}. Kind originally denoted things of the

          assemblage. the two words are now used to a great
          extent interchangeably, though sort (perhaps from its
          original meaning of lot) sometimes carries with it a
          slight tone of disparagement or contempt, as when we
          say, that sort of people, that sort of language.

      Came summoned over Eden to receive Their names of there.

Specie \Spe"cie\, n. [Formed as a singular from species, in
   sense 5.]

Species \Spe"cies\, n. sing. & pl. [L., a sight, outward
   appearance, shape, form, a particular sort, kind, or quality,
   a species. See {Spice}, n., and cf. {Specie}, {Special}.]
   1. Visible or sensible presentation; appearance; a sensible
      percept received by the imagination; an image. [R.] ``The
      species of the letters illuminated with indigo and
      violet.'' --Sir I. Newton.

            Wit, . . . the faculty of imagination in the writer,
            which searches over all the memory for the species
            or ideas of those things which it designs to
            represent.                            --Dryden.

   Note: In the scholastic philosophy, the species was sensible
         and intelligible. The sensible species was that in any
         material, object which was in fact discerned by the
         mind through the organ of perception, or that in any
         object which rendered it possible that it should be
         perceived. The sensible species, as apprehended by the
         understanding in any of the relations of thought, was
         called an intelligible species. ``An apparent diversity
         between the species visible and audible is, that the
         visible doth not mingle in the medium, but the audible
         doth.'' --Bacon.

   2. (Logic) A group of individuals agreeing in common
      attributes, and designated by a common name; a conception
      subordinated to another conception, called a genus, or
      generic conception, from which it differs in containing or
      comprehending more attributes, and extending to fewer
      individuals. Thus, {man} is a species, under {animal} as a
      genus; and man, in its turn, may be regarded as a genus
      with respect to {European}, {American}, or the like, as
      species.

   3. In science, a more or less permanent group of existing
      things or beings, associated according to attributes, or
      properties determined by scientific observation.

   Note: In mineralogy and chemistry, objects which possess the
         same definite chemical structure, and are fundamentally
         the same in crystallization and physical characters,
         are classed as belonging to a species. In zo["o]logy
         and botany, a species is an ideal group of individuals

         and are capable of indefinitely continued fertile
         reproduction through the sexes. A species, as thus
         defined, differs from a variety or subspecies only in
         the greater stability of its characters and in the
         absence of individuals intermediate between the related
         groups.

   Syn: Voluntary; uncompelled; willing.

   Usage: {Spontaneous}, {Voluntary}. What is voluntary is the
          result of a volition, or act of choice; it therefore
          implies some degree of consideration, and may be the
          result of mere reason without excited feeling. What is
          spontaneous springs wholly from feeling, or a sudden
          impulse which admits of no reflection; as, a
          spontaneous burst of applause. Hence, the term is also
          applied to things inanimate when they are produced
          without the determinate purpose or care of man.

Steam engine \Steam" en"gine\
   An engine moved by steam.

   Note: In its most common forms its essential parts are a
         piston, a cylinder, and a valve gear. The piston works
         in the cylinder, to which steam is admitted by the
         action of the valve gear, and communicates motion to
         the machinery to be actuated. Steam engines are thus
         classified: 1. According to the wat the steam is used
         or applied, as condencing, noncondencing, compound,
         double-acting, single-acting, triple-expansion, etc. 2.
         According to the motion of the piston, as
         reciprocating, rotary, etc. 3. According to the motion
         imparted by the engine, as rotative and nonrotative. 4.
         According to the arrangement of the engine, as
         stationary, portable, and semiportable engines, beam
         engine, oscillating engine, direct-acting and
         back-acting engines, etc. 5. According to their uses,
         as portable, marine, locomotive, pumping, blowing,
         winding, and stationary engines. Locomotive and
         portable engines are usually high-pressure,
         noncondencing, rotative, and direct-acting. Marine
         engines are high or low pressure, rotative, and
         generally condencing, double-acting, and compound.
         Paddle engines are generally beam, side?lever,
         oscillating, or direct-acting. Screw engines are
         generally direct-acting, back-acting, or oscillating.
         Stationary engines belong to various classes, but are
         generally rotative. A horizontal or inclined stationary
         steam engine is called a left-hand or a right-hand
         engine when the crank shaft and driving pulley are on
         the left-hand side, or the right-hand side,
         respectively, or the engine, to a person looking at
         them from the cylinder, and is said to run forward or
         backward when the crank traverses the upward half, or
         lower half, respectively, of its path, while the piston
         rod makes its stroke outward from the cylinder. A
         marine engine, or the engine of a locomotive, is said
         to run forward when its motion is such as would propel
         the vessel or the locomotive forward. Steam engines are
         further classified as double-cylinder, disk,
         semicylinder, trunk engines, etc. Machines, such as
         cranes, hammers, etc., of which the steam engine forms
         a part, are called steam cranes, steam hammers, etc.
         See Illustration in Appendix.

   {Back-acting}, or {Back-action}, {steam engine}, a steam
      engine in which the motion is transmitted backward from
      the crosshead to a crank which is between the crosshead
      and the cylinder, or beyond the cylinder.

   {Portable steam engine}, a steam engine combined with, and
      attached to, a boiler which is mounted on wheels so as to
      admit of easy transportation; -- used for driving
      machinery in the field, as trashing machines, draining
      pumps, etc.

   {Semiportable steam engine}, a steam engine combined with,
      and attached to, a steam boiler, but not mounted on
      wheels.

   Syn: Tempest; violence; agitation; calamity.

   Usage: {Storm}, {Tempest}. Storm is violent agitation, a
          commotion of the elements by wind, etc., but not
          necessarily implying the fall of anything from the
          clouds. Hence, to call a mere fall or rain without
          wind a storm is a departure from the true sense of the
          word. A tempest is a sudden and violent storm, such as
          those common on the coast of Italy, where the term
          originated, and is usually attended by a heavy rain,
          with lightning and thunder.

          sense of strong or bold; as, a stout champion; a stout
          heart; a stout resistance, etc. At a later period it
          was used for thickset or bulky, and more recently,
          especially in England, the idea has been carried still
          further, so that Taylor says in his Synonyms: ``The
          stout man has the proportions of an ox; he is
          corpulent, fat, and fleshy in relation to his size.''
          In America, stout is still commonly used in the
          original sense of strong as, a stout boy; a stout
          pole.

         calendar as established by Julius C[ae]sar, in which
         every fourth year consists of 366 days, and the other
         years of 365 days. This is about 11 minutes in a year
         too much. Pope Georgy XIII. reformed the calendar by
         retrenching 10 days in October, 1582, in order to bring
         back the vernal equinox to the same day as at the time
         of the Council of Nice, a. d. 325. This reformation was
         adopted by act of the British Parliament in 1751, by
         which act 11 days in September, 1752, were retrenched,
         and the third day was reckoned the fourteenth. This
         mode of reckoning is called New Style, according to
         which every year divisible by 4, unless it is divisible
         by 100 without being divisible by 400, has 366 days,
         and any other year 365 days.

   (a) A grand or lofty style in speaking or writing; a style

             lively turn of the phrase.           --Addison.

                                                  Whipple.

   2. (Chem.) To subject to the process of sublimation; to heat,
      volatilize, and condense in crystals or powder; to distill

   3. To exalt; to heighten; to improve; to purify.

            sublimes, But ripens spirits in cold, northern

Sublimification \Sub*lim`i*fi*ca"tion\, n. [L. sublimis sublime
   + -ficare to make. See {-ry}.]
   The act of making sublime, or state of being made sublime.

Sublimity \Sub*lim"i*ty\, n.; pl. {Sublimities}. [L. sublimitas:
   cf. F. sublimit['e].]
   1. The quality or state of being sublime (in any sense of the
      adjective).

   2. That which is sublime; as, the sublimities of nature.

   Syn: Grandeur; magnificence.

   Usage: {Sublimity}, {Grandeur}. The mental state indicated by
          these two words is the same, namely, a mingled emotion
          of astonishment and awe. In speaking of the quality
          which produces this emotion, we call it grandeur when
          it springs from what is vast in space, power, etc.; we
          call it sublimity when it springs from what is
          elevated far above the ordinary incidents of humanity.
          An immense plain is grand. The heavens are not only
          grand, but sublime (as the predominating emotion),
          from their immense height. Exalted intellect, and
          especially exalted virtue under severe trials, give us
          the sense of moral sublimity, as in the case of our
          Savior in his prayer for his murderers. We do not
          speak of Satan, when standing by the fiery gulf, with
          his ``unconquerable will and study of revenge,'' as a
          sublime object; but there is a melancholy grandeur
          thrown around him, as of an ``archangel ruined.''

         sugar (dextrose and levulose), which then breaks down

         invert sugar by heating with acids, whence it is also

. Sucrose possesses at once the properties of an alcohol and a
ketone, and also forms compounds (called sucrates) analogous to
salts. Cf. {Sugar}.

   az['u]car), fr. Ar. sukkar, assukkar, fr. Skr. [,c]arkar[=a]
   sugar, gravel; cf. Per. shakar. Cf. {Saccharine}, {Sucrose}.]
   1. A sweet white (or brownish yellow) crystalline substance,
      of a sandy or granular consistency, obtained by
      crystallizing the evaporated juice of certain plants, as
      the sugar cane, sorghum, beet root, sugar maple, etc. It
      is used for seasoning and preserving many kinds of food
      and drink. Ordinary sugar is essentially sucrose. See the
      Note below.

   Note: The term sugar includes several commercial grades, as
         the white or refined, granulated, loaf or lump, and the
         raw brown or muscovado. In a more general sense, it
         includes several distinct chemical compounds, as the
         glucoses, or grape sugars (including glucose proper,
         dextrose, and levulose), and the sucroses, or true
         sugars (as cane sugar). All sugars are carbohydrates.
         See {Carbohydrate}. The glucoses, or grape sugars, are
         ketone alcohols of the formula {C6H12O6}, and they turn
         the plane of polarization to the right or the left.
         They are produced from the amyloses and sucroses, as by
         the action of heat and acids of ferments, and are
         themselves decomposed by fermentation into alcohol and
         carbon dioxide. The only sugar (called acrose) as yet
         produced artificially belongs to this class. The
         sucroses, or cane sugars, are doubled glucose
         anhydrides of the formula {C12H22O11}. They are usually
         not fermentable as such (cf. {Sucrose}), and they act
         on polarized light.

   2. By extension, anything resembling sugar in taste or
      appearance; as, sugar of lead (lead acetate), a poisonous
      white crystalline substance having a sweet taste.

   3. Compliment or flattery used to disguise or render
      acceptable something obnoxious; honeyed or soothing words.

      materials, from which it is melted out. Symbol S. Atomic
      weight 32. The specific gravity of ordinary octohedral
      sulphur is 2.05; of prismatic sulphur, 1.96.

   Note: It is purified by distillation, and is obtained as a
         lemon-yellow powder (by sublimation), called flour, or
         flowers, of sulphur, or in cast sticks called roll
         sulphur, or brimstone. It burns with a blue flame and a

   Syn: Fanaticism.

   Usage: {Superstition}, {Fanaticism}. Superstition springs

          Fanaticism arises from this same feeling in a state of
          high-wrought and self-confident excitement. The former
          leads in some cases to excessive rigor in religious
          opinions or practice; in others, to unfounded belief
          in extraordinary events or in charms, omens, and
          prognostics, hence producing weak fears, or excessive
          scrupulosity as to outward observances. The latter
          gives rise to an utter disregard of reason under the
          false assumption of enjoying a guidance directly
          inspired. Fanaticism has a secondary sense as applied
          to politics, etc., which corresponds to the primary.

Swan \Swan\, n. [AS. swan; akin to D. zwaan, OHG. swan, G.
   schwan, Icel. svanr, Sw. svan, Dan. svane; and perhaps to E.
   sound something audible.]
   1. (Zo["o]l.) Any one of numerous species of large aquatic
      birds belonging to {Cygnus}, {Olor}, and allied genera of
      the subfamily {Cygnin[ae]}. They have a large and strong
      beak and a long neck, and are noted for their graceful
      movements when swimming. Most of the northern species are
      white. In literature the swan was fabled to sing a
      melodious song, especially at the time of its death.

   Note: The European white, or mute, swan ({Cygnus gibbus}),
         which is most commonly domesticated, bends its neck in
         an S-shaped curve. The whistling, or trumpeting, swans
         of the genus {Olor} do not bend the neck in an S-shaped
         curve, and are noted for their loud and sonorous cry,
         due to complex convolutions of the windpipe. To this
         genus belong the European whooper, or whistling swan
         ({Olor cygnus}), the American whistling swan ({O.
         Columbianus}), and the trumpeter swan ({O.
         buccinator}). The Australian black swan ({Chenopis
         atrata}) is dull black with white on the wings, and has
         the bill carmine, crossed with a white band. It is a
         very graceful species and is often domesticated. The
         South American black-necked swan ({Sthenelides
         melancorypha}) is a very beautiful and graceful
         species, entirely white, except the head and neck,
         which are dark velvety seal-brown. Its bill has a
         double bright rose-colored knob.

   2. Fig.: An appellation for a sweet singer, or a poet noted
      for grace and melody; as Shakespeare is called the swan of
      Avon.

   3. (Astron.) The constellation Cygnus.

   Syn: Pity; fellow-feeling; compassion; commiseration;

   Usage: {Sympathy}, {Commiseration}. Sympathy is literally a
          fellow-feeling with others in their varied conditions
          of joy or of grief. This term, however, is now more
          commonly applied to a fellow-feeling with others under
          affliction, and then coincides very nearly with
          commiseration. In this case it is commonly followed by
          for; as, to feel sympathy for a friend when we see him
          distressed. The verb sympathize is followed by with;
          as, to sympathize with a friend in his distresses or
          enjoyments. ``Every man would be a distinct species to
          himself, were there no sympathy among individuals.''
          --South. See {Pity}.

          movements, as the allegro, the adagio, the minuet and
          trio, or scherzo, and the finale in quick time. The
          term has recently been applied to large orchestral
          works in freer form, with arguments or programmes to
          explain their meaning, such as the ``symphonic poems''
          of Liszt. The term was formerly applied to any
          composition for an orchestra, as overtures, etc., and
          still earlier, to certain compositions partly vocal,
          partly instrumental.

   portion of the instrument, compresses an elastic gas in the
   upper part.



   Note: The column of oil of a lower part BC of a glass tube
         compresses hydrogen gas in the upper part AB, and is
         thus measured on the scale pq by the position of a
         surface of the oil in the tube. The scale pq is
         adjustable, and its index must be set to the division
         on the scale rs corresponding to the temperature
         indicated by the termometer t, in order to correct for
         the effects of temperature on the gas. It is sensitive,
         and convenient for use at sea, but inferior in accuracy
         to the mercurial barometer.

   Syn: Identical; interchangeable. -- {Synonymous},
        {Identical}. If no words are synonymous except those

        more properly denotes that the words in question
        approach so near to each other, that, in many or most
        cases, they can be used interchangeably. 1. Words may
        thus coincide in certain connections, and so be
        interchanged, when they can not be interchanged in other
        connections; thus we may speak either strength of mind
        or of force of mind, but we say the force (not strength)
        of gravitation. 2. Two words may differ slightly, but
        this difference may be unimportant to the speaker's
        object, so that he may freely interchange them; thus it
        makes but little difference, in most cases, whether we
        speak of a man's having secured his object or having
        attained his object. For these and other causes we have
        numerous words which may, in many cases or connections,
        be used interchangeably, and these are properly called
        synonyms. Synonymous words ``are words which, with great
        and essential resemblances of meaning, have, at the same
        time, small, subordinate, and partial differences, --
        these differences being such as either originally and on
        the ground of their etymology inhered in them; or
        differences which they have by usage acquired in the
        eyes of all; or such as, though nearly latent now, they
        are capable of receiving at the hands of wise and
        discreet masters of the tongue. Synonyms are words of
        like significance in the main, but with a certain
        unlikeness as well.'' --Trench.
