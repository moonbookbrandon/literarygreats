H \H\ ([=a]ch),
   the eighth letter of the English alphabet, is classed among
   the consonants, and is formed with the mouth organs in the
   same position as that of the succeeding vowel. It is used
   with certain consonants to form digraphs representing sounds
   which are not found in the alphabet, as sh, th, [th], as in
   shall, thing, [th]ine (for zh see [sect]274); also, to modify
   the sounds of some other letters, as when placed after c and
   p, with the former of which it represents a compound sound
   like that of tsh, as in charm (written also tch as in catch),
   with the latter, the sound of f, as in phase, phantom. In
   some words, mostly derived or introduced from foreign
   languages, h following c and g indicates that those
   consonants have the hard sound before e, i, and y, as in
   chemistry, chiromancy, chyle, Ghent, Ghibelline, etc.; in
   some others, ch has the sound of sh, as in chicane. See
   {Guide to Pronunciation}, [sect][sect] 153, 179, 181-3,
   237-8.

   Note: The name (aitch) is from the French ache; its form is
         from the Latin, and this from the Greek H, which was
         used as the sign of the spiritus asper (rough
         breathing) before it came to represent the long vowel,
         Gr. [eta]. The Greek H is from Ph[oe]nician, the
         ultimate origin probably being Egyptian. Etymologically
         H is most closely related to c; as in E. horn, L.
         cornu, Gr. ke`ras; E. hele, v. t., conceal; E. hide, L.
         cutis, Gr. ky`tos; E. hundred, L. centum, Gr.
         'e-kat-on, Skr. [.c]ata.

   satisfaction, or triumph, sometimes of derisive laughter; or
   sometimes it is equivalent to ``Well, it is so.''

   Syn: Practice; mode; manner; way; custom; fashion.

   Usage: {Habit}, {Custom.} Habit is a disposition or tendency
          leading us to do easily, naturally, and with growing
          certainty, what we do often; custom is external, being
          habitual use or the frequent repetition of the same
          act. The two operate reciprocally on each other. The
          custom of giving produces a habit of liberality;
          habits of devotion promote the custom of going to
          church. Custom also supposes an act of the will,
          selecting given modes of procedure; habit is a law of
          our being, a kind of ``second nature'' which grows up
          within us.

Had \Had\, imp. & p. p. of {Have}. [OE. had, hafde, hefde, AS.

   See {Have}.

   {Had as lief}, {Had rather}, {Had better}, {Had as soon},
      etc., with a nominative and followed by the infinitive
      without to, are well established idiomatic forms. The
      original construction was that of the dative with forms of
      be, followed by the infinitive. See {Had better}, under
      {Better}.

            And lever me is be pore and trewe. [And more
            agreeable to me it is to be poor and true.] --C.

   Note: Gradually the nominative was substituted for the
         dative, and had for the forms of be. During the process
         of transition, the nominative with was or were, and the
         dative with had, are found.

               Poor lady, she were better love a dream. --Shak.

   {To do the handsome thing}, to act liberally. [Colloq.]

   Syn: {Handsome}, {Pretty}.

   Usage: Pretty applies to things comparatively small, which
          please by their delicacy and grace; as, a pretty girl,
          a pretty flower, a pretty cottage. Handsome rises
          higher, and is applied to objects on a larger scale.
          We admire what is handsome, we are pleased with what
          is pretty. The word is connected with hand, and has
          thus acquired the idea of training, cultivation,
          symmetry, and proportion, which enters so largely into
          our conception of handsome. Thus Drayton makes mention
          of handsome players, meaning those, who are well
          trained; and hence we speak of a man's having a
          handsome address, which is the result of culture; of a
          handsome horse or dog, which implies well proportioned
          limbs; of a handsome face, to which, among other
          qualities, the idea of proportion and a graceful
          contour are essential; of a handsome tree, and a
          handsome house or villa. So, from this idea of
          proportion or suitableness, we have, with a different
          application, the expressions, a handsome fortune, a
          handsome offer.

          what contradicts so utterly our principles and moral

          our moral and religious sentiments. What we loathe is
          offensive to our own nature, and excites unmingled
          disgust. Our Savior is said to have hated the deeds of
          the Nicolaitanes; his language shows that he loathed
          the lukewarmness of the Laodiceans; he detested the

      rhythmically, keeps up the circulation of the blood.

            Why does my blood thus muster to my heart! --Shak.

   Note: In adult mammals and birds, the heart is
         four-chambered, the right auricle and ventricle being
         completely separated from the left auricle and
         ventricle; and the blood flows from the systematic
         veins to the right auricle, thence to the right
         ventricle, from which it is forced to the lungs, then
         returned to the left auricle, thence passes to the left
         ventricle, from which it is driven into the systematic
         arteries. See Illust. under {Aorta}. In fishes there
         are but one auricle and one ventricle, the blood being
         pumped from the ventricle through the gills to the
         system, and thence returned to the auricle. In most
         amphibians and reptiles, the separation of the auricles
         is partial or complete, and in reptiles the ventricles
         also are separated more or less completely. The
         so-called lymph hearts, found in many amphibians,
         reptiles, and birds, are contractile sacs, which pump
         the lymph into the veins.

   Syn: To aid; assist; succor; relieve; serve; support;
        sustain; befriend.

   Usage: To {Help}, {Aid}, {Assist}. These words all agree in
          the idea of affording relief or support to a person
          under difficulties. Help turns attention especially to
          the source of relief. If I fall into a pit, I call for
          help; and he who helps me out does it by an act of his
          own. Aid turns attention to the other side, and
          supposes co["o]peration on the part of him who is
          relieved; as, he aided me in getting out of the pit; I
          got out by the aid of a ladder which he brought.
          Assist has a primary reference to relief afforded by a
          person who ``stands by'' in order to relieve. It
          denotes both help and aid. Thus, we say of a person
          who is weak, I assisted him upstairs, or, he mounted
          the stairs by my assistance. When help is used as a
          noun, it points less distinctively and exclusively to
          the source of relief, or, in other words, agrees more
          closely with aid. Thus we say, I got out of a pit by
          the help of my friend.

            were employed only for sacred, while the third, the

   Note: In the United States legal holidays, so called, are

         several States. The holidays most generally observed
         are: the 22d day of February (Washington's birthday),
         the 30th day of May (Memorial day), the 4th day of July
         (Independence day), the 25th day of December (Christmas
         day). In most of the States the 1st day of January is a
         holiday. When any of these days falls on Sunday,
         usually the Monday following is observed as the
         holiday. In many of the States a day in the spring (as
         Good Friday, or the first Thursday in April), and a day
         in the fall (as the last Thursday in November) are now
         regularly appointed by Executive proclamation to be
         observed, the former as a day of fasting and prayer,
         the latter as a day of thanksgiving and are kept as
         holidays. In England, the days of the greater church
         feasts (designated in the calendar by a red letter, and
         commonly called red-letter days) are observed as
         general holidays. Bank holidays are those on which, by
         act of Parliament, banks may suspend business. Although
         Sunday is a holiday in the sense of a day when business
         is legally suspended, it is not usually included in the
         general term, the phrase ``Sundays and holidays'' being
         more common.

      festivity; especially, Christmas and New Year's day with

Horse \Horse\ (h[^o]rs), n. [AS. hors; akin to OS. hros, D. &
   OHG. ros, G. ross, Icel. hross; and perh. to L. currere to
   run, E. course, current Cf. {Walrus}.]
   1. (Zo["o]l.) A hoofed quadruped of the genus {Equus};
      especially, the domestic horse ({E. caballus}), which was
      domesticated in Egypt and Asia at a very early period. It
      has six broad molars, on each side of each jaw, with six
      incisors, and two canine teeth, both above and below. The
      mares usually have the canine teeth rudimentary or
      wanting. The horse differs from the true asses, in having
      a long, flowing mane, and the tail bushy to the base.
      Unlike the asses it has callosities, or chestnuts, on all
      its legs. The horse excels in strength, speed, docility,
      courage, and nobleness of character, and is used for
      drawing, carrying, bearing a rider, and like purposes.

   Note: Many varieties, differing in form, size, color, gait,
         speed, etc., are known, but all are believed to have
         been derived from the same original species. It is
         supposed to have been a native of the plains of Central
         Asia, but the wild species from which it was derived is
         not certainly known. The feral horses of America are
         domestic horses that have run wild; and it is probably
         true that most of those of Asia have a similar origin.
         Some of the true wild Asiatic horses do, however,
         approach the domestic horse in several characteristics.
         Several species of fossil ({Equus}) are known from the
         later Tertiary formations of Europe and America. The
         fossil species of other genera of the family
         {Equid[ae]} are also often called horses, in general
         sense.

   2. The male of the genus horse, in distinction from the
      female or male; usually, a castrated male.



   3. Mounted soldiery; cavalry; -- used without the plural
      termination; as, a regiment of horse; -- distinguished
      from foot.

   4. A frame with legs, used to support something; as, a

   7. (Mining) A mass of earthy matter, or rock of the same

   Syn: {However}, {At least}, {Nevertheless}, {Yet}.

   Usage: These words, as here compared, have an adversative
          sense in reference to something referred to in the
          context. However is the most general, and leads to a
          final conclusion or decision. Thus we say, the truth,
          however, has not yet fully come out; i.e., such is the
          speaker's conclusion in view of the whole case. So
          also we say, however, you may rely on my assistance to
          that amount; i. e., at all events, whatever may
          happen, this is my final decision. At least is
          adversative in another way. It points out the utmost
          concession that can possibly be required, and still
          marks the adversative conclusion; as, at least, this
          must be done; whatever may be our love of peace, we
          must at least maintain the rights of conscience.
          Nevertheless denotes that though the concession be
          fully made, it has no bearing of the question; as,
          nevertheless, we must go forward. Yet signifies that
          however extreme the supposition or fact comceded may
          be, the consequence which might naturally be expected
          does not and will not follow; as, though I should die
          with thee, yet will I not deny thee; though he slay
          me, yet will I trust in him. Cf. {But}.

   Syn: Lowliness; humbleness; meekness; modesty; diffidence.

   Usage: {Humility}, {Modesty}, {Diffidence}. Diffidence is a
          distrust of our powers, combined with a fear lest our
          failure should be censured, since a dread of failure
          unconnected with a dread of censure is not usually
          called diffidence. It may be carried too far, and is
          not always, like modesty and humility, a virtue.
          Modesty, without supposing self-distrust, implies an
          unwillingness to put ourselves forward, and an absence
          of all over-confidence in our own powers. Humility
          consists in rating our claims low, in being willing to
          waive our rights, and take a lower place than might be
          our due. It does not require of us to underrate
          ourselves.

   A gaseous element, colorless, tasteless, and odorless, the
   lightest known substance, being fourteen and a half times
   lighter than air (hence its use in filling balloons), and
   over eleven thousand times lighter than water. It is very
   abundant, being an ingredient of water and of many other
   substances, especially those of animal or vegetable origin.
   It may by produced in many ways, but is chiefly obtained by
   the action of acids (as sulphuric) on metals, as zinc, iron,
   etc. It is very inflammable, and is an ingredient of coal gas
   and water gas. It is standard of chemical equivalents or
   combining weights, and also of valence, being the typical
   monad. Symbol H. Atomic weight 1.



   Note: Although a gas, hydrogen is chemically similar to the
         metals in its nature, having the properties of a weak
         base. It is, in all acids, the base which is replaced
         by metals and basic radicals to form salts. Like all
         other gases, it is condensed by great cold and pressure
         to a liquid which freezes and solidifies by its own
         evaporation. It is absorbed in large quantities by
         certain metals (esp. palladium), forming alloy-like
         compounds; hence, in view of quasi-metallic nature, it
         is sometimes called {hydrogenium}. It is the typical
         reducing agent, as opposed to oxidizers, as oxygen,
         chlorine, etc.

Hypothecation \Hy*poth`e*ca"tion\, n. [LL. hypothecatio.]
   1. (Civ. Law) The act or contract by which property is
      hypothecated; a right which a creditor has in or to the
      property of his debtor, in virtue of which he may cause it
      to be sold and the price appropriated in payment of his
      debt. This is a right in the thing, or jus in re.
      --Pothier. B. R. Curtis.

            There are but few cases, if any, in our law, where
            an hypothecation, in the strict sense of the Roman
            law, exists; that is a pledge without possession by
            the pledgee.                          --Story.

   Note: In the modern civil law, this contract has no
         application to movable property, not even to ships, to
         which and their cargoes it is most frequently applied
         in England and America. See {Hypothecate}. --B. R.
         Curtis. Domat.
