I \I\ ([imac]).
   1. I, the ninth letter of the English alphabet, takes its
      form from the Ph[oe]nician, through the Latin and the
      Greek. The Ph[oe]nician letter was probably of Egyptian
      origin. Its original value was nearly the same as that of
      the Italian I, or long e as in mete. Etymologically I is
      most closely related to e, y, j, g; as in dint, dent,
      beverage, L. bibere; E. kin, AS. cynn; E. thin, AS.
      [thorn]ynne; E. dominion, donjon, dungeon. In English I
      has two principal vowel sounds: the long sound, as in
      p[=i]ne, [=i]ce; and the short sound, as in p[i^]n. It has
      also three other sounds: (a) That of e in term, as in
      thirst. (b) That of e in mete (in words of foreign
      origin), as in machine, pique, regime. (c) That of
      consonant y (in many words in which it precedes another
      vowel), as in bunion, million, filial, Christian, etc. It
      enters into several digraphs, as in fail, field, seize,
      feign. friend; and with o often forms a proper diphtong,
      as in oil, join, coin. See Guide to Pronunciation,
      [sect][sect] 98-106.

   Note: The dot which we place over the small or lower case i
         dates only from the 14th century. The sounds of I and J
         were originally represented by the same character, and
         even after the introduction of the form J into English
         dictionaries, words containing these letters were, till
         a comparatively recent time, classed together.

   2. In our old authors, I was often used for ay (or aye), yes,
      which is pronounced nearly like it.

   3. As a numeral, I stands for 1, II for 2, etc.

-ics \-ics\
   A suffix used in forming the names of certain sciences,
   systems, etc., as acoustics, mathematics, dynamics,
   statistics, politics, athletics.

   Note: The names sciences ending in ics, as mathematics,
         mechanics, metaphysics, optics, etc., are, with respect
         to their form, nouns in the plural number. The plural
         form was probably introduced to mark the complex nature
         of such sciences; and it may have been in imitation of
         the use of the Greek plurals ?, ?, ?, ?, etc., to
         designate parts of Aristotle's writings. Previously to
         the present century, nouns ending in ics were construed
         with a verb or a pronoun in the plural; but it is now
         generally considered preferable to treat them as
         singular. In Greman we have die Mathematik, die
         Mechanik, etc., and in French la metaphysique, la
         optique, etc., corresponding to our mathematics,
         mechanics, metaphysics, optics, etc.

               Mathematics have for their object the
               consideration of whatever is capable of being
               numbered or measured.              --John
                                                  Davidson.
         The citations subjoined will serve as examples of the
         best present usage.

               Ethics is the sciences of the laws which govern
               our actions as moral agents.       --Sir W.
                                                  Hamilton.

               All parts of knowledge have their origin in
               metaphysics, and finally, perhaps, revolve into
               it.                                --De Quincey.

               Mechanics, like pure mathematics, may be
               geometrical, or may be analytical; that is, it
               may treat space either by a direct consideration
               of its properties, or by a symbolical
               representation.                    --Whewell.

            ``how it showed . . . Answering his great idea,'' -

Imagination \Im*ag`i*na"tion\, n. [OE. imaginacionum, F.

   1. The imagine-making power of the mind; the power to create
      or reproduce ideally an object of sense previously
      perceived; the power to call up mental imagines.

            Our simple apprehension of corporeal objects, if
            present, is sense; if absent, is imagination.
                                                  --Glanvill.

            Imagination is of three kinds: joined with belief of
            that which is to come; joined with memory of that
            which is past; and of things present, or as if they
            were present.                         --Bacon.

   2. The representative power; the power to reconstruct or
      recombine the materials furnished by direct apprehension;
      the complex faculty usually termed the plastic or creative
      power; the fancy.

            The imagination of common language -- the productive
            imagination of philosophers -- is nothing but the
            representative process plus the process to which I
            would give the name of the ``comparative.'' --Sir W.
                                                  Hamilton.

            The power of the mind to decompose its conceptions,
            and to recombine the elements of them at its
            pleasure, is called its faculty of imagination. --I.
                                                  Taylor.

            The business of conception is to present us with an
            exact transcript of what we have felt or perceived.
            But we have moreover a power of modifying our
            conceptions, by combining the parts of different
            ones together, so as to form new wholes of our
            creation. I shall employ the word imagination to
            express this power.                   --Stewart.

   3. The power to recombine the materials furnished by
      experience or memory, for the accomplishment of an
      elevated purpose; the power of conceiving and expressing
      the ideal.

            The lunatic, the lover, and the poet Are of
            imagination all compact . . . The poet's eye, in a
            fine frenzy rolling, Doth glance from heaven to
            earth, from earth to heaven, And as imagination
            bodies forth The forms of things unknown, the poet's
            pen Turns them to shapes, and gives to airy nothing
            A local habitation and a name.        --Shak.

   4. A mental image formed by the action of the imagination as
      a faculty; a conception; a notion. --Shak.

   Syn: Conception; idea; conceit; fancy; device; origination;
        invention; scheme; design; purpose; contrivance.

   Usage: {Imagination}, {Fancy}. These words have, to a great
          extent, been interchanged by our best writers, and
          considered as strictly synonymous. A distinction,
          however, is now made between them which more fully
          exhibits their nature. Properly speaking, they are
          different exercises of the same general power -- the
          plastic or creative faculty. Imagination consists in
          taking parts of our conceptions and combining them
          into new forms and images more select, more striking,
          more delightful, more terrible, etc., than those of
          ordinary nature. It is the higher exercise of the two.
          It creates by laws more closely connected with the
          reason; it has strong emotion as its actuating and
          formative cause; it aims at results of a definite and
          weighty character. Milton's fiery lake, the debates of
          his Pandemonium, the exquisite scenes of his Paradise,
          are all products of the imagination. Fancy moves on a
          lighter wing; it is governed by laws of association
          which are more remote, and sometimes arbitrary or
          capricious. Hence the term fanciful, which exhibits
          fancy in its wilder flights. It has for its actuating
          spirit feelings of a lively, gay, and versatile
          character; it seeks to please by unexpected
          combinations of thought, startling contrasts, flashes
          of brilliant imagery, etc. Pope's Rape of the Lock is
          an exhibition of fancy which has scarcely its equal in
          the literature of any country. -- ``This, for
          instance, Wordsworth did in respect of the words
          `imagination' and `fancy.' Before he wrote, it was, I
          suppose, obscurely felt by most that in `imagination'
          there was more of the earnest, in `fancy' of the play
          of the spirit; that the first was a loftier faculty
          and gift than the second; yet for all this words were
          continually, and not without loss, confounded. He
          first, in the preface to his Lyrical Ballads, rendered
          it henceforth impossible that any one, who had read
          and mastered what he has written on the two words,
          should remain unconscious any longer of the important
          difference between them.'' --Trench.

                The same power, which we should call fancy if
                employed on a production of a light nature,
                would be dignified with the title of imagination
                if shown on a grander scale.      --C. J. Smith.

   2. A cycle of fifteen years.

   Note: This mode of reckoning time is said to have been
         introduced by Constantine the Great, in connection with
         the payment of tribute. It was adopted at various times
         by the Greek emperors of Constantinople, the popes, and
         the parliaments of France. Through the influence of the
         popes, it was extensively used in the ecclesiastical
         chronology of the Middle Ages. The number of indictions
         was reckoned at first from 312 a. d., but since the
         twelfth century it has been reckoned from the birth of
         Christ. The papal indiction is the only one ever used
         at the present day. To find the indiction and year of
         the indiction by the first method, subtract 312 from
         the given year a. d., and divide by 15; by the second
         method, add 3 to the given year a. d., and the divide
         by 15. In either case, the quotient is the number of
         the current indiction, and the remainder the year of
         the indiction. See {Cycle of indiction}, under {Cycle}.

         presentation by the prosecuting authority.

   3. An accusation in general; a formal accusation.

      induced, when a current (as from a voltaic battery),
      passing through the inner coil, is made, broken, or
      varied. The inner coil has within it a core of soft iron,
      and is connected at its terminals with a condenser; --
      called also {inductorium}, and {Ruhmkorff's coil}.

   {Induction pipe}, {port}, or {valve}, a pipe, passageway, or
      valve, for leading or admitting a fluid to a receiver, as

   {Magnetic induction}, the action by which magnetic polarity
      is developed in a body susceptible to magnetic effects
      when brought under the influence of a magnet.

   {Magneto-electric induction}, the influence by which a magnet
      excites electric currents in closed circuits.

   {Logical induction}, (Philos.), an act or method of reasoning
      from all the parts separately to the whole which they
      constitute, or into which they may be united collectively;
      the operation of discovering and proving general
      propositions; the scientific method.

   {Philosophical induction}, the inference, or the act of
      inferring, that what has been observed or established in
      respect to a part, individual, or species, may, on the
      ground of analogy, be affirmed or received of the whole to
      which it belongs. This last is the inductive method of
      Bacon. It ascends from the parts to the whole, and forms,
      from the general analogy of nature, or special
      presumptions in the case, conclusions which have greater
      or less degrees of force, and which may be strengthened or
      weakened by subsequent experience and experiment. It
      relates to actual existences, as in physical science or
      the concerns of life. Logical induction is founded on the
      necessary laws of thought; philosophical induction, on the
      interpretation of the indications or analogy of nature.



   Syn: Deduction.

   Usage: {Induction}, {Deduction}. In induction we observe a
          sufficient number of individual facts, and, on the
          ground of analogy, extend what is true of them to
          others of the same class, thus arriving at general
          principles or laws. This is the kind of reasoning in
          physical science. In deduction we begin with a general
          truth, which is already proven or provisionally
          assumed, and seek to connect it with some particular
          case by means of a middle term, or class of objects,
          known to be equally connected with both. Thus, we
          bring down the general into the particular, affirming
          of the latter the distinctive qualities of the former.
          This is the syllogistic method. By induction Franklin
          established the identity of lightning and electricity;
          by deduction he inferred that dwellings might be
          protected by lightning rods.

Inference \In"fer*ence\, n. [From {Infer}.]
   1. The act or process of inferring by deduction or induction.

   2. That which inferred; a truth or proposition drawn from
      another which is admitted or supposed to be true; a
      conclusion; a deduction. --Milton.

            These inferences, or conclusions, are the effects of
            reasoning, and the three propositions, taken all
            together, are called syllogism, or argument. --I.
                                                  Watts.

   Syn: Conclusion; deduction; consequence.

   Usage: {Inference}, {Conclusion}. An inference is literally
          that which is brought in; and hence, a deduction or
          induction from premises, -- something which follows as
          certainly or probably true. A conclusion is stronger
          than an inference; it shuts us up to the result, and
          terminates inquiry. We infer what is particular or
          probable; we conclude what is certain. In a chain of
          reasoning we have many inferences, which lead to the
          ultimate conclusion. ``An inference is a proposition
          which is perceived to be true, because of its
          connection with some known fact.'' ``When something is
          simply affirmed to be true, it is called a
          proposition; after it has been found to be true by
          several reasons or arguments, it is called a
          conclusion.'' --I. Taylor.

Inferential \In`fer*en"tial\, a.
   Deduced or deducible by inference. ``Inferential proofs.''

                                                  Knox.

Infidel \In"fi*del\, n.
   One who does not believe in the prevailing religious faith;
   especially, one who does not believe in the divine origin and
   authority of Christianity; a Mohammedan; a heathen; a
   freethinker.

   Note: Infidel is used by English writers to translate the
         equivalent word used Mohammedans in speaking of
         Christians and other disbelievers in Mohammedanism.

   Syn: {Infidel}, {Unbeliever}, {Freethinker}, {Deist},
        {Atheist}, {Sceptic}, {Agnostic}.

   Usage: An infidel, in common usage, is one who denies
          Christianity and the truth of the Scriptures. Some
          have endeavored to widen the sense of infidel so as to
          embrace atheism and every form of unbelief; but this
          use does not generally prevail. A freethinker is now
          only another name for an infidel. An unbeliever is not
          necessarily a disbeliever or infidel, because he may
          still be inquiring after evidence to satisfy his mind;
          the word, however, is more commonly used in the
          extreme sense. A deist believes in one God and a
          divine providence, but rejects revelation. An atheist
          denies the being of God. A sceptic is one whose faith
          in the credibility of evidence is weakened or
          destroyed, so that religion, to the same extent, has
          no practical hold on his mind. An agnostic remains in
          a state of suspended judgment, neither affirming nor
          denying the existence of a personal Deity.

Infidelity \In`fi*del"i*ty\, n.; pl. {Infidelities}. [L.
   infidelitas: cf. F. infid['e]lit['e].]
   1. Want of faith or belief in some religious system;
      especially, a want of faith in, or disbelief of, the
      inspiration of the Scriptures, of the divine origin of
      Christianity.

            There is, indeed, no doubt but that vanity is one of
            the principal causes of infidelity.   --V. Knox.

      of the marriage covenant by adultery.

   {Infinitive mood} (Gram.), that form of the verb which merely
      names the action, and performs the office of a verbal
      noun. Some grammarians make two forms in English: ({a})
      The simple form, as, speak, go, hear, before which to is
      commonly placed, as, to speak; to go; to hear. ({b}) The
      form of the imperfect participle, called the infinitive in
      -ing; as, going is as easy as standing.

   Note: With the auxiliary verbs may, can, must, might, could,
         would, and should, the simple infinitive is expressed
         without to; as, you may speak; they must hear, etc. The
         infinitive usually omits to with the verbs let, dare,
         do, bid, make, see, hear, need, etc.; as, let me go;
         you dare not tell; make him work; hear him talk, etc.

   Note: In Anglo-Saxon, the simple infinitive was not preceded
         by to (the sign of modern simple infinitive), but it
         had a dative form (sometimes called the gerundial
         infinitive) which was preceded by to, and was chiefly
         employed in expressing purpose. See {Gerund}, 2.

   Note: The gerundial ending (-anne) not only took the same
         form as the simple infinitive (-an), but it was
         confounded with the present participle in -ende, or
         -inde (later -inge).

Infinitive \In*fin"i*tive\, n. (Gram.)

         it. --Davies & Peck (Math. Dict.).

   5. (Geom.) That part of a line, or of a plane, or of space,

   Syn: To intervene; intercede; mediate; interfere;

   Usage: To {Interpose}, {Intermeddle}, {Interfere}. A man may
          often interpose with propriety in the concerns of
          others; he can never intermeddle without being
          impertinent or officious; nor can be interfere without
          being liable to the same charge, unless he has rights
          which are interfered with. ``In our practical use,
          interference is something offensive. It is the pushing
          in of himself between two parties on the part of a
          third who was not asked, and is not thanked for his
          pains, and who, as the feeling of the word implies,
          had no business there; while interposition is employed
          to express the friendly, peacemaking mediation of one
          whom the act well became, and who, even if he was not
          specially invited thereunto, is still thanked for what
          he has done.'' --Trench.

        embarrass; overwhelm.

   Usage: To {Involve}, {Imply}. Imply is opposed to express, or
          set forth; thus, an implied engagement is one fairly
          to be understood from the words used or the
          circumstances of the case, though not set forth in
          form. Involve goes beyond the mere interpretation of
          things into their necessary relations; and hence, if
          one thing involves another, it so contains it that the
          two must go together by an indissoluble connection.
          War, for example, involves wide spread misery and
          death; the premises of a syllogism involve the
          conclusion.

Iron \I"ron\ ([imac]"[u^]rn), n. [OE. iren, AS. [=i]ren,
   [=i]sen, [=i]sern; akin to D. ijzer, OS. [=i]sarn, OHG.
   [=i]sarn, [=i]san, G. eisen, Icel. [=i]sarn, j[=a]rn, Sw. &
   Dan. jern, and perh. to E. ice; cf. Ir. iarann, W. haiarn,
   Armor. houarn.]
   1. (Chem.) The most common and most useful metallic element,
      being of almost universal occurrence, usually in the form
      of an oxide (as hematite, magnetite, etc.), or a hydrous
      oxide (as limonite, turgite, etc.). It is reduced on an
      enormous scale in three principal forms; viz., cast iron,
      steel, and wrought iron. Iron usually appears dark brown,
      from oxidation or impurity, but when pure, or on a fresh
      surface, is a gray or white metal. It is easily oxidized
      (rusted) by moisture, and is attacked by many corrosive
      agents. Symbol Fe (Latin Ferrum). Atomic weight 55.9.
      Specific gravity, pure iron, 7.86; cast iron, 7.1. In
      magnetic properties, it is superior to all other
      substances.

   Note: The value of iron is largely due to the facility with
         which it can be worked. Thus, when heated it is
         malleable and ductile, and can be easily welded and
         forged at a high temperature. As cast iron, it is
         easily fusible; as steel, is very tough, and (when
         tempered) very hard and elastic. Chemically, iron is
         grouped with cobalt and nickel. Steel is a variety of
         iron containing more carbon than wrought iron, but less
         that cast iron. It is made either from wrought iron, by
         roasting in a packing of carbon (cementation) or from
         cast iron, by burning off the impurities in a Bessemer
         converter (then called Bessemer steel), or directly
         from the iron ore (as in the Siemens rotatory and
         generating furnace).

   2. An instrument or utensil made of iron; -- chiefly in
      composition; as, a flatiron, a smoothing iron, etc.

            My young soldier, put up your iron.   --Shak.

   3. pl. Fetters; chains; handcuffs; manacles.

            Four of the sufferers were left to rot in irons.
                                                  --Macaulay.

   4. Strength; power; firmness; inflexibility; as, to rule with
      a rod of iron.

   {Cast iron} (Metal.), an impure variety of iron, containing
      from three to six percent of carbon, part of which is
      united with a part of the iron, as a carbide, and the rest
      is uncombined, as graphite. It there is little free
      carbon, the product is white iron; if much of the carbon
      has separated as graphite, it is called gray iron. See
      also {Cast iron}, in the Vocabulary.

   {Malleable iron} (Metal.), iron sufficiently pure or soft to
      be capable of extension under the hammer; also, specif., a
      kind of iron produced by removing a portion of the carbon
      or other impurities from cast iron, rendering it less
      brittle, and to some extent malleable.

   {Wrought iron} (Metal.), the purest form of iron commonly
      known in the arts, containing only about half of one per
      cent of carbon. It is made either directly from the ore,
      as in the Catalan forge or bloomery, or by purifying
      (puddling) cast iron in a reverberatory furnace or
      refinery. It is tough, malleable, and ductile. When formed
      into bars, it is called bar iron.

   The neuter pronoun of the third person, corresponding to the

         all in the original King James's version of the Bible.
         During the transition from the regular his to the
         anomalous its, it was to some extent employed in the
         possessive without the case ending. See {His}, and
         {He}. In Dryden's time its had become quite established

   Note: In the course of time, the nature of the neuter sign i
         in it, the form being found in but a few words, became
         misunderstood. Instead of being looked upon as an
         affix, it passed for part of the original word. Hence
         was formed from it the anomalous genitive it,
         superseding the Saxon his. --Latham.

               The fruit tree yielding fruit after his (its)
               kind.                              --Gen. i. 11.

      affairs, the condition of things, and the like; as, how is
      it with the sick man?

            Think on me when it shall be well with thee. --Gen.
                                                  xl. 14.
