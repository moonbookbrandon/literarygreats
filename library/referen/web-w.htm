W \W\ (d[u^]b"'l [=u]),
   the twenty-third letter of the English alphabet, is usually a
   consonant, but sometimes it is a vowel, forming the second
   element of certain diphthongs, as in few, how. It takes its
   written form and its name from the repetition of a V, this
   being the original form of the Roman capital letter which we
   call U. Etymologically it is most related to v and u. See V,
   and U. Some of the uneducated classes in England, especially
   in London, confuse w and v, substituting the one for the
   other, as weal for veal, and veal for weal; wine for vine,
   and vine for wine, etc. See Guide to Pronunciation,

         invasion, or the attacks of an enemy, is called
         defensive.

   [root]134. See {Wake}, v. i. ]
   1. The act of watching; forbearance of sleep; vigil; wakeful,
      vigilant, or constantly observant attention; close
      observation; guard; preservative or preventive vigilance;
      formerly, a watching or guarding by night.

            Shepherds keeping watch by night.     --Milton.

                                                  --Addison.

   Note: Watch was formerly distinguished from ward, the former
         signifying a watching or guarding by night, and the
         latter a watching, guarding, or protecting by day
         Hence, they were not unfrequently used together,
         especially in the phrase to keep watch and ward, to
         denote continuous and uninterrupted vigilance or
         protection, or both watching and guarding. This
         distinction is now rarely recognized, watch being used
         to signify a watching or guarding both by night and by
         day, and ward, which is now rarely used, having simply
         the meaning of guard, or protection, without reference
         to time.

               Still, when she slept, he kept both watch and
               ward.                              --Spenser.

               Ward, guard, or custodia, is chiefly applied to

               applicable to the night only, . . . and it begins
               when ward ends, and ends when that begins.
                                                  --Blackstone.

      called {miner's inch}, and {water inch}. The shape of the
      orifice and the head vary in different localities. In the
      Western United States, for hydraulic mining, the standard
      aperture is square and the head from 4 to 9 inches above
      its center. In Europe, for experimental hydraulics, the
      orifice is usually round and the head from 1/2 of an inch
      to 1 inch above its top.

      containing it. Thus, while pure copper sulphate, {CuSO4},
      is a white amorphous substance, blue vitriol, the
      crystallized form, {CuSO4.5H2O}, contains five molecules
      of water of crystallization.

   [root]182. See {Who}.]

                                                  27.

   Note: Originally, what, when, where, which, who, why, etc.,
         were interrogatives only, and it is often difficult to
         determine whether they are used as interrogatives or
         relatives. What in this sense, when it refers to
         things, may be used either substantively or
         adjectively; when it refers to persons, it is used only
         adjectively with a noun expressed, who being the
         pronoun used substantively.

   Note: What in this use has a or an between itself and its
         noun if the qualitative or quantitative importance of
         the object is emphasized.

          sense, as nearly equivalent to how; as, what happy

                I know well . . . how little you will be
                disposed to criticise what comes to you from me.
                                                  --J. H.

                                                  --Chaucer.

            Thus, what with the war, what with the sweat, what
            with the gallows, and what with poverty, I am custom

            by force, what by policy, he had taken from the
            Christians above thirty small castles. --Knolles.

   Note: In such phrases as I tell you what, what anticipates
         the following statement, being elliptical for what I
         think, what it is, how it is, etc. ``I tell thee what,
         corporal Bardolph, I could tear her.'' --Shak. Here
         what relates to the last clause, ``I could tear her;''
         this is what I tell you. What not is often used at the
         close of an enumeration of several particulars or
         articles, it being an abbreviated clause, the verb of
         which, being either the same as that of the principal
         clause or a general word, as be, say, mention,
         enumerate, etc., is omitted. ``Men hunt, hawk, and what
         not.'' --Becon. ``Some dead puppy, or log, orwhat
         not.'' --C. Kingsley. ``Battles, tournaments, hunts,
         and what not.'' --De Quincey. Hence, the words are
         often used in a general sense with the force of a
         substantive, equivalent to anything you please, a
         miscellany, a variety, etc. From this arises the name
         whatnot, applied to an ['e]tag[`e]re, as being a piece
         of furniture intended for receiving miscellaneous
         articles of use or ornament.

But what is used for but that, usually after a negative, and
excludes everything contrary to the assertion in the following
sentence. ``Her needle is not so absolutely perfect in tent and
cross stitch but what my superintendence is advisable.'' --Sir
W. Scott. ``Never fear but what our kite shall fly as high.''
--Ld. Lytton.

   {What ho!} an exclamation of calling.

   {What if}, what will it matter if; what will happen or be the
      result if. ``What if it be a poison?'' --Shak.

   {What of this}? {that?} {it?} etc., what follows from this,
      that, it, etc., often with the implication that it is of
      no consequence. ``All this is so; but what of this, my
      lord?'' --Shak. ``The night is spent, why, what of that?''
      --Shak.

   {What though}, even granting that; allowing that; supposing
      it true that. ``What though the rose have prickles, yet't
      is plucked.'' --Shak.

   {What time}, or {What time as}, when. [Obs. or Archaic]
      ``What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee.'' --Ps.
      lvi. 3.

   Note: This mode of torture is said to have been first
         employed in Germany, in the fourteenth century. The
         criminal was laid on a cart wheel with his legs and
         arms extended, and his limbs in that posture were
         fractured with an iron bar. In France, where its use
         was restricted to the most atrocious crimes, the
         criminal was first laid on a frame of wood in the form
         of a St. Andrew's cross, with grooves cut transversely
         in it above and below the knees and elbows, and the
         executioner struck eight blows with an iron bar, so as
         to break the limbs in those places, sometimes finishing
         by two or three blows on the chest or stomach, which
         usually put an end to the life of the criminal, and
         were hence called coups-de-grace -- blows of mercy. The
         criminal was then unbound, and laid on a small wheel,
         with his face upward, and his arms and legs doubled
         under him, there to expire, if he had survived the
         previous treatment. --Brande.
      (c) (Naut.) A circular frame having handles on the
          periphery, and an axle which is so connected with the
          tiller as to form a means of controlling the rudder
          for the purpose of steering.
      (d) (Pottery) A potter's wheel. See under {Potter}.

                Then I went down to the potter's house, and,
                behold, he wrought a work on the wheels. --Jer.

      course; one who uses shifts and evasions in argument;
      hence, a trifler.

      house shall talk of the constitution.       --Swift.

   2. One who plays on a whiffle; a fifer or piper. [Obs.]

   3. An officer who went before procession to clear the way by
      blowing a horn, or otherwise; hence, any person who
      marched at the head of a procession; a harbinger.

            to prepare his way.                   --Shak.



   Note: ``Whifflers, or fifers, generally went first in a
         procession, from which circumstance the name was
         transferred to other persons who succeeded to that
         office, and at length was given to those who went
         forward merely to clear the way for the procession. . .
         . In the city of London, young freemen, who march at
         the head of their proper companies on the Lord Mayor's
         day, sometimes with flags, were called whifflers, or
         bachelor whifflers, not because they cleared the way,
         but because they went first, as whifflers did.''
         --Nares.

   OS. willeo, willio, D. wil, G. wille, Icel. vili, Dan.
   villie, Sw. vilja, Goth wilja. See {Will}, v.]
   1. The power of choosing; the faculty or endowment of the
      soul by which it is capable of choosing; the faculty or
      power of the mind by which we decide to do or not to do;
      the power or faculty of preferring or selecting one of two
      or more objects.

            It is necessary to form a distinct notion of what is
            meant by the word ``volition'' in order to
            understand the import of the word will, for this
            last word expresses the power of mind of which
            ``volition'' is the act.              --Stewart.

            Will is an ambiguous word, being sometimes put for
            the faculty of willing; sometimes for the act of
            that faculty, besides [having] other meanings. But
            ``volition'' always signifies the act of willing,
            and nothing else.                     --Reid.

            Appetite is the will's solicitor, and the will is
            appetite's controller; what we covet according to
            the one, by the other we often reject. --Hooker.

            The will is plainly that by which the mind chooses
            anything.                             --J. Edwards.

   2. The choice which is made; a determination or preference
      which results from the act or exercise of the power of
      choice; a volition.

            The word ``will,'' however, is not always used in
            this its proper acceptation, but is frequently
            substituted for ``volition'', as when I say that my
            hand mover in obedience to my will.   --Stewart.

   3. The choice or determination of one who has authority; a
      decree; a command; discretionary pleasure.

            Thy will be done.                     --Matt. vi.
                                                  10.

            Our prayers should be according to the will of God.
                                                  --Law.

   4. Strong wish or inclination; desire; purpose.

   Note: ``Inclination is another word with which will is
         frequently confounded. Thus, when the apothecary says,
         in Romeo and Juliet,

               My poverty, but not my will, consents; . . . Put
               this in any liquid thing you will, And drink it
               off. the word will is plainly used as, synonymous
         with inclination; not in the strict logical sense, as
         the immediate antecedent of action. It is with the same
         latitude that the word is used in common conversation,
         when we speak of doing a thing which duty prescribes,
         against one's own will; or when we speak of doing a
         thing willingly or unwillingly.'' --Stewart.

   5. That which is strongly wished or desired.

            What's your will, good friar?         --Shak.

            The mariner hath his will.            --Coleridge.

   6. Arbitrary disposal; power to control, dispose, or
      determine.

            Deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies.
                                                  --Ps. xxvii.
                                                  12.

   7. (Law) The legal declaration of a person's mind as to the
      manner in which he would have his property or estate
      disposed of after his death; the written instrument,
      legally executed, by which a man makes disposition of his
      estate, to take effect after his death; testament; devise.
      See the Note under {Testament}, 1.

   Note: Wills are written or nuncupative, that is, oral. See
         {Nuncupative will}, under {Nuncupative}.

   {At will} (Law), at pleasure. To hold an estate at the will
      of another, is to enjoy the possession at his pleasure,
      and be liable to be ousted at any time by the lessor or
      proprietor. An estate at will is at the will of both
      parties.

   {Good will}. See under {Good}.

   {Ill will}, enmity; unfriendliness; malevolence.

   {To have one's will}, to obtain what is desired; to do what
      one pleases.

   {Will worship}, worship according to the dictates of the will
      or fancy; formal worship. [Obs.]

      Taylor.

   {With a will}, with willingness and zeal; with all one's
      heart or strength; earnestly; heartily.

Will \Will\, v. t. & auxiliary. [imp. {Would}. Indic. present, I
   will (Obs. I wol), thou wilt, he will (Obs. he wol); we, ye,
   they will.] [OE. willen, imp. wolde; akin to OS. willan,
   OFries. willa, D. willen, G. wollen, OHG. wollan, wellan,
   Icel. & Sw. vilja, Dan. ville, Goth. wiljan, OSlav. voliti,
   L. velle to wish, volo I wish; cf. Skr. v[.r] to choose, to
   prefer. Cf. {Voluntary}, {Welcome}, {Well}, adv.]
   1. To wish; to desire; to incline to have.

            A wife as of herself no thing ne sholde [should]
            Wille in effect, but as her husband wolde [would].
                                                  --Chaucer.

            Caleb said unto her, What will thou ? --Judg. i. 14.

            They would none of my counsel.        --Prov. i. 30.

   2. As an auxiliary, will is used to denote futurity dependent
      on the verb. Thus, in first person, ``I will'' denotes
      willingness, consent, promise; and when ``will'' is
      emphasized, it denotes determination or fixed purpose; as,
      I will go if you wish; I will go at all hazards. In the
      second and third persons, the idea of distinct volition,
      wish, or purpose is evanescent, and simple certainty is
      appropriately expressed; as, ``You will go,'' or ``He will
      go,'' describes a future event as a fact only. To
      emphasize will denotes (according to the tone or context)
      certain futurity or fixed determination.

   Note: Will, auxiliary, may be used elliptically for will go.
         ``I'll to her lodgings.'' --Marlowe.

   Note: As in shall (which see), the second and third persons
         may be virtually converted into the first, either by
         question or indirect statement, so as to receive the
         meaning which belongs to will in that person; thus,
         ``Will you go?'' (answer, ``I will go'') asks assent,
         requests, etc.; while ``Will he go?'' simply inquires
         concerning futurity; thus, also,``He says or thinks he
         will go,'' ``You say or think you will go,'' both
         signify willingness or consent.

   Note: Would, as the preterit of will, is chiefly employed in
         conditional, subjunctive, or optative senses; as, he
         would go if he could; he could go if he would; he said
         that he would go; I would fain go, but can not; I would
         that I were young again; and other like phrases. In the
         last use, the first personal pronoun is often omitted;
         as, would that he were here; would to Heaven that it
         were so; and, omitting the to in such an adjuration.
         ``Would God I had died for thee.'' Would is used for
         both present and future time, in conditional
         propositions, and would have for past time; as, he
         would go now if he were ready; if it should rain, he
         would not go; he would have gone, had he been able.
         Would not, as also will not, signifies refusal. ``He
         was angry, and would not go in.'' --Luke xv. 28. Would
         is never a past participle.

   Note: In Ireland, Scotland, and the United States, especially
         in the southern and western portions of the United
         States, shall and will, should and would, are often
         misused, as in the following examples:

               I am able to devote as much time and attention to
               other subjects as I will [shall] be under the
               necessity of doing next winter.    --Chalmers.

               A countryman, telling us what he had seen,
               remarked that if the conflagration went on, as it
               was doing, we would [should] have, as our next
               season's employment, the Old Town of Edinburgh to
               rebuild.                           --H. Miller.

               I feel assured that I will [shall] not have the
               misfortune to find conflicting views held by one
               so enlightened as your excellency. --J. Y. Mason.

                                                  22.

   Syn: Prudence; knowledge.

   Usage: {Wisdom}, {Prudence}, {Knowledge}. Wisdom has been
          defined to be ``the use of the best means for
          attaining the best ends.'' ``We conceive,'' says
          Whewell, `` prudence as the virtue by which we select
          right means for given ends, while wisdom implies the
          selection of right ends as well as of right means.''
          Hence, wisdom implies the union of high mental and
          moral excellence. Prudence (that is, providence, or
          forecast) is of a more negative character; it rather
          consists in avoiding danger than in taking decisive
          measures for the accomplishment of an object. Sir
          Robert Walpole was in many respects a prudent
          statesman, but he was far from being a wise one. Burke
          has said that prudence, when carried too far,
          degenerates into a ``reptile virtue,'' which is the
          more dangerous for its plausible appearance.
          Knowledge, a more comprehensive term, signifies the
          simple apprehension of facts or relations. ``In
          strictness of language,'' says Paley, `` there is a
          difference between knowledge and wisdom; wisdom always
          supposing action, and action directed by it.''

                Knowledge and wisdom, far from being one, Have
                ofttimes no connection. Knowledge dwells In
                heads replete with thoughts of other men;
                Wisdom, in minds attentive to their own.
                Knowledge, a rude, unprofitable mass, The mere
                materials with which wisdom builds, Till
                smoothed, and squared, and fitted to its place,
                Does but encumber whom it seems to enrich.
                Knowledge is proud that he has learned so much;
                Wisdom is humble that he knows no more.
                                                  --Cowper.

   {Wisdom tooth}, the last, or back, tooth of the full set on
      each half of each jaw in man; -- familiarly so called,
      because appearing comparatively late, after the person may
      be supposed to have arrived at the age of wisdom. See the
      Note under {Tooth}, 1.

            thoughts and words elegantly adapted to the subject.

            thereby to make up pleasant pictures in the fancy.

            take notice of; those either blasphemous and
            atheistical, or libelous.             --Milton.

            foolish heart from serving thee.      --Shak.

   Syn: Ingenuity; humor; satire; sarcasm; irony; burlesque.

   Usage: {Wit}, {Humor}. Wit primarily meant mind; and now
          denotes the power of seizing on some thought or
          occurrence, and, by a sudden turn, presenting it under
          aspects wholly new and unexpected -- apparently
          natural and admissible, if not perfectly just, and
          bearing on the subject, or the parties concerned, with
          a laughable keenness and force. ``What I want,'' said
          a pompous orator, aiming at his antagonist, ``is
          common sense.'' ``Exactly!'' was the whispered reply.
          The pleasure we find in wit arises from the ingenuity
          of the turn, the sudden surprise it brings, and the
          patness of its application to the case, in the new and
          ludicrous relations thus flashed upon the view. Humor
          is a quality more congenial to the English mind than
          wit. It consists primarily in taking up the
          peculiarities of a humorist (or eccentric person) and
          drawing them out, as Addison did those of Sir Roger de
          Coverley, so that we enjoy a hearty, good-natured
          laugh at his unconscious manifestation of whims and
          oddities. From this original sense the term has been
          widened to embrace other sources of kindly mirth of
          the same general character. In a well-known caricature
          of English reserve, an Oxford student is represented
          as standing on the brink of a river, greatly agitated
          at the sight of a drowning man before him, and crying
          out, ``O that I had been introduced to this gentleman,
          that I might save his life! The, ``Silent Woman'' of
          Ben Jonson is one of the most humorous productions, in
          the original sense of the term, which we have in our
          language.

   Note: Walker condemns the pronunciation woond as a
         ``capricious novelty.'' It is certainly opposed to an
         important principle of our language, namely, that the
         Old English long sound written ou, and pronounced like
         French ou or modern English oo, has regularly changed,
         when accented, into the diphthongal sound usually
         written with the same letters ou in modern English, as
         in ground, hound, round, sound. The use of ou in Old
         English to represent the sound of modern English oo was
         borrowed from the French, and replaced the older and
         Anglo-Saxon spelling with u. It makes no difference
         whether the word was taken from the French or not,
         provided it is old enough in English to have suffered
         this change to what is now the common sound of ou; but
         words taken from the French at a later time, or
         influenced by French, may have the French sound.

         began and in order to begin the same; the latter were
         issued out of the court where the original was
         returned, after the suit was begun and during the
         pendency of it. Tomlins. Brande. Encyc. Brit. The term
         writ is supposed by Mr. Reeves to have been derived
         from the fact of these formul[ae] having always been
         expressed in writing, being, in this respect,
         distinguished from the other proceedings in the ancient
         action, which were conducted orally.
