N \N\ ([e^]n),
   the fourteenth letter of English alphabet, is a vocal
   consonent, and, in allusion to its mode of formation, is
   called the dentinasal or linguanasal consonent. Its commoner
   sound is that heard in ran, done; but when immediately
   followed in the same word by the sound of g hard or k (as in
   single, sink, conquer), it usually represents the same sound
   as the digraph ng in sing, bring, etc. This is a simple but
   related sound, and is called the gutturo-nasal consonent. See
   {Guide to Pronunciation}, [sect][sect] 243-246.

   Note: The letter N came into English through the Latin and
         Greek from the Ph[oe]nician, which probably derived it
         from the Egyptian as the ultimate origin. It is
         etymologically most closely related to M. See {M}.

      and wrong, which is native in mankind, as distinguished
      from specifically revealed divine law, and formulated

      by gradual changes of environment which have led to
      corresponding changes of structure, and that those forms
      which have become so modified as to be best adapted to the
      changed environment have tended to survive and leave

      cephalopods. About four species are found living in the

      The shell is spiral, symmetrical, and chambered, or
      divided into several cavities by simple curved partitions,
      which are traversed and connected together by a continuous
      and nearly central tube or siphuncle. See
      {Tetrabranchiata}.

   Note: The head of the animal bears numerous simple tapered
         arms, or tentacles, arranged in groups, but not
         furnished with suckers. The siphon, unlike, that of
         ordinary cephalopods, is not a closed tube, and is not

         conduct water to and from the gill cavity, which
         contains two pairs of gills. The animal occupies only
         the outer chamber of the shell; the others are filled
         with gas. It creeps over the bottom of the sea, not
         coming to the surface to swim or sail, as was formerly

   Without prevention, or obstruction from or by; in spite of.

         We gentil women bee Loth to displease any wight,
         Notwithstanding our great right.         --Chaucer's
                                                  Dream.

         Those on whom Christ bestowed miraculous cures were so
         transported that their gratitude made them,
         notwithstanding his prohibition, proclaim the wonders
         he had done.                             --Dr. H. More.

   Note: Notwithstanding was, by Johnson and Webster, viewed as
         a participle absolute, an English equivalent of the
         Latin non obstante. Its several meanings, either as
         preposition, adverb, or conjunction, are capable of
         being explained in this view. Later grammarians, while
         admitting that the word was originally a participle,
         and can be treated as such, prefer to class it as a
         preposition or disjunctive conjunction.

   Syn: In spite of; despite.

   Usage: {Notwithstanding}, {In spite of}, {Despite}. These
          words and phrases are often interchanged, but there is
          a difference between them, chiefly in strength.
          Notwithstanding is the weaker term, and simply points
          to some obstacle that may exist; as, I shall go,
          notwithstanding the rain. In spite or despite of has
          reference primarily to active opposition to be
          encountered from others; as, ``I'll be, in man's
          despite, a monarch; '' ``I'll keep mine own, despite
          of all the world.'' --Shak. Hence, these words, when
          applied to things, suppose greater opposition than
          notwithstanding. We should say. ''He was thrust rudely
          out of doors in spite of his entreaties,'' rather than
          ``notwithstanding''. On the other hand, it would be
          more civil to say, ``Notwithstanding all you have
          said, I must still differ with you.''



Notwithstanding \Not`with*stand"ing\, adv. or conj. [Originally
   the participle of withstand, with not prefixed.]
   Nevertheless; however; although; as, I shall go,
   notwithstanding it rains.

         I will surely rend the kingdom from thee, and will give
         it to thy servant. Notwithstanding, in thy days I will
         not do it.                               --1 Kings xi.
                                                  11, 12.

         They which honor the law as an image of the wisdom of
         God himself, are, notwithstanding, to know that the
         same had an end in Christ.               --Hooker.

         You did wisely and honestly too, notwithstanding She is
         the greatest beauty in the parish.       --Fielding.

   or thing, existing in fact or in thought; a substantive.

         include adjectives, as being descriptive; but in
         general it is limited to substantives.
