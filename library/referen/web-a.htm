A \A\ (named [=a] in the English, and most commonly ["a] in
   other languages).
   The first letter of the English and of many other alphabets.
   The capital A of the alphabets of Middle and Western Europe,
   as also the small letter (a), besides the forms in Italic,
   black letter, etc., are all descended from the old Latin A,
   which was borrowed from the Greek {Alpha}, of the same form;
   and this was made from the first letter (?) of the
   Ph[oe]nician alphabet, the equivalent of the Hebrew Aleph,
   and itself from the Egyptian origin. The Aleph was a
   consonant letter, with a guttural breath sound that was not
   an element of Greek articulation; and the Greeks took it to
   represent their vowel Alpha with the ["a] sound, the
   Ph[oe]nician alphabet having no vowel symbols. This letter,
   in English, is used for several different vowel sounds. See
   Guide to pronunciation, [sect][sect] 43-74. The regular long
   a, as in fate, etc., is a comparatively modern sound, and has
   taken the place of what, till about the early part of the
   17th century, was a sound of the quality of ["a] (as in far).

   2. (Mus.) The name of the sixth tone in the model major scale
      (that in C), or the first tone of the minor scale, which
      is named after it the scale in A minor. The second string
      of the violin is tuned to the A in the treble staff. -- A
      sharp (A[sharp]) is the name of a musical tone
      intermediate between A and B. -- A flat (A[flat]) is the
      name of a tone intermediate between A and G.

   {A per se} (L. per se by itself), one pre["e]minent; a
      nonesuch. [Obs.]

            O fair Creseide, the flower and A per se Of Troy and
            Greece.                               --Chaucer.

A \A\ ([.a] emph. [=a]).
   1. [Shortened form of an. AS. [=a]n one. See {One}.] An
      adjective, commonly called the indefinite article, and
      signifying one or any, but less emphatically. ``At a
      birth''; ``In a word''; ``At a blow''. --Shak.

   Note: It is placed before nouns of the singular number
         denoting an individual object, or a quality
         individualized, before collective nouns, and also
         before plural nouns when the adjective few or the
         phrase great many or good many is interposed; as, a
         dog, a house, a man; a color; a sweetness; a hundred, a
         fleet, a regiment; a few persons, a great many days. It
         is used for an, for the sake of euphony, before words
         beginning with a consonant sound [for exception of
         certain words beginning with h, see {An}]; as, a table,
         a woman, a year, a unit, a eulogy, a ewe, a oneness,
         such a one, etc. Formally an was used both before
         vowels and consonants.

   2. [Originally the preposition a (an, on).] In each; to or
      for each; as, ``twenty leagues a day'', ``a hundred pounds
      a year'', ``a dollar a yard'', etc.

A \A\ ([.a]), prep. [Abbreviated form of an (AS. on). See {On}.]
   1. In; on; at; by. [Obs.] ``A God's name.'' ``Torn a
      pieces.'' ``Stand a tiptoe.'' ``A Sundays'' --Shak. ``Wit
      that men have now a days.'' --Chaucer. ``Set them a
      work.'' --Robynson (More's Utopia).

   2. In process of; in the act of; into; to; -- used with
      verbal substantives in -ing which begin with a consonant.
      This is a shortened form of the preposition an (which was
      used before the vowel sound); as in a hunting, a building,
      a begging. ``Jacob, when he was a dying'' --Heb. xi. 21.
      ``We'll a birding together.'' `` It was a doing.'' --Shak.
      ``He burst out a laughing.'' --Macaulay.

   Note: The hyphen may be used to connect a with the verbal
         substantive (as, a-hunting, a-building) or the words
         may be written separately. This form of expression is
         now for the most part obsolete, the a being omitted and
         the verbal substantive treated as a participle.

A \A\ [From AS. of off, from. See {Of}.]
   Of. [Obs.] ``The name of John a Gaunt.'' ``What time a day is
   it ?'' --Shak. ``It's six a clock.'' --B. Jonson.

         A merry heart goes all the day, Your sad tires in a
         mile-a.                                  --Shak.

A- \A-\
   A, as a prefix to English words, is derived from various
   sources. (1) It frequently signifies on or in (from an, a
   forms of AS. on), denoting a state, as in afoot, on foot,
   abed, amiss, asleep, aground, aloft, away (AS. onweg), and
   analogically, ablaze, atremble, etc. (2) AS. of off, from, as
   in adown (AS. ofd[=u]ne off the dun or hill). (3) AS. [=a]-
   (Goth. us-, ur-, Ger. er-), usually giving an intensive
   force, and sometimes the sense of away, on, back, as in
   arise, abide, ago. (4) Old English y- or i- (corrupted from
   the AS. inseparable particle ge-, cognate with OHG. ga-, gi-,
   Goth. ga-), which, as a prefix, made no essential addition to
   the meaning, as in aware. (5) French [`a] (L. ad to), as in
   abase, achieve. (6) L. a, ab, abs, from, as in avert. (7)
   Greek insep. prefix [alpha] without, or privative, not, as in
   abyss, atheist; akin to E. un-.

   Note: Besides these, there are other sources from which the
         prefix a takes its origin.

   {Abandoned} (-d[u^]nd); p. pr. & vb. n. {Abandoning}.] [OF.
   abandoner, F. abandonner; a (L. ad) + bandon permission,
   authority, LL. bandum, bannum, public proclamation,
   interdiction, bannire to proclaim, summon: of Germanic
   origin; cf. Goth. bandwjan to show by signs, to designate
   OHG. ban proclamation. The word meant to proclaim, put under
   a ban, put under control; hence, as in OE., to compel,
   subject, or to leave in the control of another, and hence, to
   give up. See {Ban}.]
   1. To cast or drive out; to banish; to expel; to reject.
      [Obs.]

   4. (Mar. Law) To relinquish all claim to; -- used when an
      insured person gives up to underwriters all claim to the

   Syn: To give up; yield; forego; cede; surrender; resign;
        abdicate; quit; relinquish; renounce; desert; forsake;
        leave; retire; withdraw from.

   Usage: {To Abandon}, {Desert}, {Forsake}. These words agree
          in representing a person as giving up or leaving some
          object, but differ as to the mode of doing it. The
          distinctive sense of abandon is that of giving up a
          thing absolutely and finally; as, to abandon one's
          friends, places, opinions, good or evil habits, a
          hopeless enterprise, a shipwrecked vessel. Abandon is
          more widely applicable than forsake or desert. The
          Latin original of desert appears to have been
          originally applied to the case of deserters from
          military service. Hence, the verb, when used of
          persons in the active voice, has usually or always a
          bad sense, implying some breach of fidelity, honor,
          etc., the leaving of something which the person should
          rightfully stand by and support; as, to desert one's
          colors, to desert one's post, to desert one's
          principles or duty. When used in the passive, the
          sense is not necessarily bad; as, the fields were
          deserted, a deserted village, deserted halls. Forsake
          implies the breaking off of previous habit,
          association, personal connection, or that the thing
          left had been familiar or frequented; as, to forsake
          old friends, to forsake the paths of rectitude, the
          blood forsook his cheeks. It may be used either in a
          good or in a bad sense.

Abandon \A*ban"don\, n. [F. abandon. fr. abandonner. See
   {Abandon}, v.]

Abandon \A`ban`don"\ ([.a]`b[aum]N`d[^o]N"), n. [F. See

   2. Self-abandoned, or given up to vice; extremely wicked, or
      sinning without restraint; irreclaimably wicked; as, an
      abandoned villain.

   Syn: Profligate; dissolute; corrupt; vicious; depraved;
        reprobate; wicked; unprincipled; graceless; vile.

   Usage: {Abandoned}, {Profligate}, {Reprobate}. These
          adjectives agree in expressing the idea of great
          personal depravity. {Profligate} has reference to open
          and shameless immoralities, either in private life or
          political conduct; as, a {profligate} court, a
          {profligate} ministry. {Abandoned} is stronger, and
          has reference to the searing of conscience and
          hardening of heart produced by a man's giving himself
          wholly up to iniquity; as, a man of {abandoned}
          character. {Reprobate} describes the condition of one
          who has become insensible to reproof, and who is
          morally abandoned and lost beyond hope of recovery.

                God gave them over to a reprobate mind. --Rom.

                                                  xiv. ll.

   Syn: To {Abase}, {Debase}, {Degrade}. These words agree in
        the idea of bringing down from a higher to a lower
        state. Abase has reference to a bringing down in
        condition or feelings; as, to abase the proud, to abase
        one's self before God. Debase has reference to the
        bringing down of a thing in purity, or making it base.
        It is, therefore, always used in a bad sense, as, to
        debase the coin of the kingdom, to debase the mind by
        vicious indulgence, to debase one's style by coarse or
        vulgar expressions. Degrade has reference to a bringing
        down from some higher grade or from some standard. Thus,
        a priest is degraded from the clerical office. When used
        in a moral sense, it denotes a bringing down in
        character and just estimation; as, degraded by
        intemperance, a degrading employment, etc. ``Art is
        degraded when it is regarded only as a trade.''

Abased \A*based"\ ([.a]*b[=a]st"), a.
   1. Lowered; humbled.

   2. (Her.) [F. abaiss['e].] Borne lower than usual, as a fess;
      also, having the ends of the wings turned downward towards
      the point of the shield.

Abasedly \A*bas"ed*ly\ ([.a]*b[=a]s"[e^]d*l[y^]), adv.
   Abjectly; downcastly.

Abasement \A*base"ment\ ([.a]*b[=a]s"ment), n. [Cf. F.
   abaissement.]
   The act of abasing, humbling, or bringing low; the state of
   being abased or humbled; humiliation.

Abaser \A*bas"er\ ([.a]*b[=a]s"[~e]r), n.
   He who, or that which, abases.

Abash \A*bash"\ ([.a]*b[a^]sh"), v. t. [imp. & p. p. {Abashed}
   ([.a]*b[a^]sht"); p. pr. & vb. n. {Abashing}.] [OE. abaissen,
   abaisshen, abashen, OF. esbahir, F. ['e]bahir, to astonish,
   fr. L. ex + the interjection bah, expressing astonishment. In
   OE. somewhat confused with abase. Cf. {Finish}.]
   To destroy the self-possession of; to confuse or confound, as
   by exciting suddenly a consciousness of guilt, mistake, or
   inferiority; to put to shame; to disconcert; to discomfit.

         Abashed, the devil stood, And felt how awful goodness
         is.                                      --Milton.

         He was a man whom no check could abash.  --Macaulay.

   Syn: To confuse; confound; disconcert; shame.

   Usage: To {Abash}, Confuse, {Confound}. Abash is a stronger
          word than confuse, but not so strong as confound. We
          are abashed when struck either with sudden shame or
          with a humbling sense of inferiority; as, Peter was
          abashed by the look of his Master. So a modest youth
          is abashed in the presence of those who are greatly
          his superiors. We are confused when, from some
          unexpected or startling occurrence, we lose clearness
          of thought and self-possession. Thus, a witness is
          often confused by a severe cross-examination; a timid
          person is apt to be confused in entering a room full
          of strangers. We are confounded when our minds are
          overwhelmed, as it were, by something wholly
          unexpected, amazing, dreadful, etc., so that we have
          nothing to say. Thus, a criminal is usually confounded
          at the discovery of his guilt.

                Satan stood Awhile as mute, confounded what to
                say.                              --Milton.

Abashedly \A*bash"ed*ly\ (-[e^]d*l[y^]), adv.

Abate \A*bate"\ ([.a]*b[=a]t"), v. t. [imp. & p. p. {Abated}, p.
   pr. & vb. n. {Abating}.] [OF. abatre to beat down, F.
   abattre, LL. abatere; ab or ad + batere, battere (popular
   form for L. batuere to beat). Cf. {Bate}, {Batter}.]
   1. To beat down; to overthrow. [Obs.]

            The King of Scots . . . sore abated the walls.
                                                  --Edw. Hall.

   2. To bring down or reduce from a higher to a lower state,
      number, or degree; to lessen; to diminish; to contract; to
      moderate; to cut short; as, to abate a demand; to abate
      pride, zeal, hope.

            His eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated.
                                                  --Deut. xxxiv.
                                                  7.

   3. To deduct; to omit; as, to abate something from a price.

   4. To blunt. [Obs.]

   5. To reduce in estimation; to deprive. [Obs.]

            She hath abated me of half my train.  --Shak.

   6. (Law)
      (a) To bring entirely down or put an end to; to do away
          with; as, to abate a nuisance, to abate a writ.
      (b) (Eng. Law) To diminish; to reduce. Legacies are liable
          to be abated entirely or in proportion, upon a
          deficiency of assets.

   {To abate a tax}, to remit it either wholly or in part.

Abate \A*bate"\ ([.a]*b[=a]t"), v. i. [See {Abate}, v. t.]
   1. To decrease, or become less in strength or violence; as,
      pain abates, a storm abates.

            The fury of Glengarry . . . rapidly abated.
                                                  --Macaulay.

   2. To be defeated, or come to naught; to fall through; to
      fail; as, a writ abates.

   {To abate into a freehold}, {To abate in lands} (Law), to
      enter into a freehold after the death of the last
      possessor, and before the heir takes possession. See
      {Abatement}, 4.

   Syn: To subside; decrease; intermit; decline; diminish;
        lessen.

   Usage: To {Abate}, {Subside}. These words, as here compared,
          imply a coming down from some previously raised or
          excited state. Abate expresses this in respect to
          degrees, and implies a diminution of force or of
          intensity; as, the storm abates, the cold abates, the
          force of the wind abates; or, the wind abates, a fever
          abates. Subside (to settle down) has reference to a
          previous state of agitation or commotion; as, the
          waves subside after a storm, the wind subsides into a
          calm. When the words are used figuratively, the same
          distinction should be observed. If we conceive of a
          thing as having different degrees of intensity or
          strength, the word to be used is abate. Thus we say, a
          man's anger abates, the ardor of one's love abates,
          ``Winter's rage abates''. But if the image be that of
          a sinking down into quiet from preceding excitement or
          commotion, the word to be used is subside; as, the
          tumult of the people subsides, the public mind
          subsided into a calm. The same is the case with those
          emotions which are tumultuous in their nature; as, his
          passion subsides, his joy quickly subsided, his grief
          subsided into a pleasing melancholy. Yet if, in such
          cases, we were thinking of the degree of violence of
          the emotion, we might use abate; as, his joy will
          abate in the progress of time; and so in other
          instances.

   Usage: To {Abdicate}, {Resign}. Abdicate commonly expresses
          the act of a monarch in voluntary and formally
          yielding up sovereign authority; as, to abdicate the
          government. Resign is applied to the act of any
          person, high or low, who gives back an office or trust
          into the hands of him who conferred it. Thus, a
          minister resigns, a military officer resigns, a clerk
          resigns. The expression, ``The king resigned his
          crown,'' sometimes occurs in our later literature,

   Note: The form abettor is the legal term and also in general
         use.

   Syn: {Abettor}, {Accessory}, {Accomplice}.

   Usage: These words denote different degrees of complicity in
          some deed or crime. An abettor is one who incites or
          encourages to the act, without sharing in its
          performance. An accessory supposes a principal
          offender. One who is neither the chief actor in an
          offense, nor present at its performance, but accedes
          to or becomes involved in its guilt, either by some
          previous or subsequent act, as of instigating,
          encouraging, aiding, or concealing, etc., is an
          accessory. An accomplice is one who participates in
          the commission of an offense, whether as principal or
          accessory. Thus in treason, there are no abettors or
          accessories, but all are held to be principals or
          accomplices.

   1. (Law) Expectancy; condition of being undetermined.

   Note: When there is no person in existence in whom an
         inheritance (or a dignity) can vest, it is said to be
         in abeyance, that is, in expectation; the law
         considering it as always potentially existing, and
         ready to vest whenever a proper owner appears.

   Syn: Capacity; talent; cleverness; faculty; capability;
        efficiency; aptitude; aptness; address; dexterity;
        skill.

   Usage: {Ability}, {Capacity}. These words come into
          comparison when applied to the higher intellectual
          powers. Ability has reference to the active exercise
          of our faculties. It implies not only native vigor of
          mind, but that ease and promptitude of execution which
          arise from mental training. Thus, we speak of the
          ability with which a book is written, an argument
          maintained, a negotiation carried on, etc. It always
          something to be done, and the power of doing it.
          Capacity has reference to the receptive powers. In its
          higher exercises it supposes great quickness of
          apprehension and breadth of intellect, with an
          uncommon aptitude for acquiring and retaining
          knowledge. Hence it carries with it the idea of
          resources and undeveloped power. Thus we speak of the
          extraordinary capacity of such men as Lord Bacon,
          Blaise Pascal, and Edmund Burke. ``Capacity,'' says H.
          Taylor, ``is requisite to devise, and ability to
          execute, a great enterprise.'' The word abilities, in
          the plural, embraces both these qualities, and denotes
          high mental endowments.

          to things of a permanent nature, such as institutions,
          usages, customs, etc.; as, to abolish monopolies,
          serfdom, slavery. Repeal describes the act by which
          the legislature of a state sets aside a law which it
          had previously enacted. Abrogate was originally
          applied to the repeal of a law by the Roman people;
          and hence, when the power of making laws was usurped
          by the emperors, the term was applied to their act of
          setting aside the laws. Thus it came to express that
          act by which a sovereign or an executive government
          sets aside laws, ordinances, regulations, treaties,
          conventions, etc. Revoke denotes the act of recalling
          some previous grant which conferred, privilege, etc.;
          as, to revoke a decree, to revoke a power of attorney,
          a promise, etc. Thus, also, we speak of the revocation
          of the Edict of Nantes. Annul is used in a more
          general sense, denoting simply to make void; as, to
          annul a contract, to annul an agreement. Nullify is an
          old word revived in this country, and applied to the
          setting of things aside either by force or by total
          disregard; as, to nullify an act of Congress. Cancel
          is to strike out or annul, by a deliberate exercise of
          power, something which has operative force.

         the axis of ordinates, or of Y, the abscissa of the
         point is the distance cut off from the axis of X by a
         line drawn through it and parallel to the axis of Y.
         When a point in space is referred to three axes having
         a common intersection, the abscissa may be the distance
         measured parallel to either of them, from the point to
         the plane of the other two axes. Abscissas and
         ordinates taken together are called co["o]rdinates. --

   Syn: {Absent}, {Abstracted}.

   Usage: These words both imply a want of attention to
          surrounding objects. We speak of a man as absent when
          his thoughts wander unconsciously from present scenes
          or topics of discourse; we speak of him as abstracted
          when his mind (usually for a brief period) is drawn
          off from present things by some weighty matter for
          reflection. Absence of mind is usually the result of
          loose habits of thought; abstraction commonly arises
          either from engrossing interests and cares, or from
          unfortunate habits of association.

   Note: It is in dispute among philosopher whether the term, in
         this sense, is not applied to a mere logical fiction or
         abstraction, or whether the absolute, as thus defined,
         can be known, as a reality, by the human intellect.

               To Cusa we can indeed articulately trace, word
               and thing, the recent philosophy of the absolute.

   Syn: To {Absolve}, {Exonerate}, {Acquit}.

   Usage: We speak of a man as absolved from something that
          binds his conscience, or involves the charge of
          wrongdoing; as, to absolve from allegiance or from the
          obligation of an oath, or a promise. We speak of a

          burden which had rested upon him; as, to exonerate
          from suspicion, to exonerate from blame or odium. It
          implies a purely moral acquittal. We speak of a person

          favor with reference to a specific charge, either by a
          jury or by disinterested persons; as, he was acquitted

   Syn: To {Absorb}, {Engross}, {Swallow up}, {Engulf}.

   Usage: These words agree in one general idea, that of
          completely taking up. They are chiefly used in a
          figurative sense and may be distinguished by a
          reference to their etymology. We speak of a person as
          absorbed (lit., drawn in, swallowed up) in study or
          some other employment of the highest interest. We
          speak of a person as ebgrossed (lit., seized upon in
          the gross, or wholly) by something which occupies his
          whole time and thoughts, as the acquisition of wealth,
          or the attainment of honor. We speak of a person
          (under a stronger image) as swallowed up and lost in
          that which completely occupies his thoughts and
          feelings, as in grief at the death of a friend, or in
          the multiplied cares of life. We speak of a person as
          engulfed in that which (like a gulf) takes in all his
          hopes and interests; as, engulfed in misery, ruin,
          etc.

      (a) Expressing a particular property of an object viewed

          word. --J. S. Mill.
      (b) Resulting from the mental faculty of abstraction;

                A concrete name is a name which stands for a
                thing; an abstract name which stands for an
                attribute of a thing. A practice has grown up in
                more modern times, which, if not introduced by
                Locke, has gained currency from his example, of
                applying the expression ``abstract name'' to all
                names which are the result of abstraction and
                generalization, and consequently to all general
                names, instead of confining it to the names of
                attributes.                       --J. S. Mill.

      combination of similar qualities.

   {Abstract numbers} (Math.), numbers used without application
      to things, as 6, 8, 10; but when applied to any thing, as

   2. (Metaph.) The act process of leaving out of consideration
      one or more properties of a complex object so as to attend
      to others; analysis. Thus, when the mind considers the
      form of a tree by itself, or the color of the leaves as
      separate from their size or figure, the act is called
      abstraction. So, also, when it considers whiteness,
      softness, virtue, existence, as separate from any
      particular objects.

   Note: Abstraction is necessary to classification, by which
         things are arranged in genera and species. We separate
         in idea the qualities of certain objects, which are of
         the same kind, from others which are different, in
         each, and arrange the objects having the same
         properties in a class, or collected body.

               Abstraction is no positive act: it is simply the
               negative of attention.             --Sir W.
                                                  Hamilton.

   Usage: {Absurd}, {Irrational}, {Foolish}, {Preposterous}. Of

   Syn: Exuberance; plenteousness; plenty; copiousness;

          Plenty denotes a sufficiency to supply every want; as,
          plenty of food, plenty of money, etc. Abundance
          express more, and gives the idea of superfluity or
          excess; as, abundance of riches, an abundance of wit
          and humor; often, however, it only denotes plenty in a
          high degree. Exuberance rises still higher, and
          implies a bursting forth on every side, producing
          great superfluity or redundance; as, an exuberance of
          mirth, an exuberance of animal spirits, etc.

      to a {deficient} number, as 14, whose aliquot parts are 1,
      2, 7, the sum of which is 10; and to a {perfect} number,
      which is equal to the sum of its aliquot parts, as 6,
      whose aliquot parts are 1, 2., 3.

   Syn: Casual; fortuitous; contingent; occasional;
        adventitious.

   Usage: {Accidental}, {Incidental}, {Casual}, {Fortuitous},
          {Contingent}. We speak of a thing as accidental when
          it falls out as by chance, and not in the regular
          course of things; as, an accidental meeting, an
          accidental advantage, etc. We call a thing incidental
          when it falls, as it were, into some regular course of
          things, but is secondary, and forms no essential part
          thereof; as, an incremental remark, an incidental
          evil, an incidental benefit. We speak of a thing as
          casual, when it falls out or happens, as it were, by
          mere chance, without being prearranged or
          premeditated; as, a casual remark or encounter; a
          casual observer. An idea of the unimportant is
          attached to what is casual. Fortuitous is applied to
          what occurs without any known cause, and in opposition
          to what has been foreseen; as, a fortuitous concourse
          of atoms. We call a thing contingent when it is such
          that, considered in itself, it may or may not happen,
          but is dependent for its existence on something else;
          as, the time of my coming will be contingent on
          intelligence yet to be received.

          To execute (to follow out to the end, to carry out, or
          into effect) implies a set mode of operation; as, to
          execute the laws or the orders of another; to execute
          a work, a purpose, design, plan, project. To perform
          is much like to do, though less generally applied. It
          conveys a notion of protracted and methodical effort;
          as, to perform a mission, a part, a task, a work.
          ``Thou canst best perform that office.'' --Milton.

          words are applied to different modes of rehearsing a

   2. (Chem.) One of a class of compounds, generally but not
      always distinguished by their sour taste, solubility in
      water, and reddening of vegetable blue or violet colors.
      They are also characterized by the power of destroying the
      distinctive properties of alkalies or bases, combining
      with them to form salts, at the same time losing their own
      peculiar properties. They all contain hydrogen, united
      with a more negative element or radical, either alone, or
      more generally with oxygen, and take their names from this
      negative element or radical. Those which contain no oxygen
      are sometimes called {hydracids} in distinction from the
      others which are called {oxygen acids} or {oxacids}.

   Note: In certain cases, sulphur, selenium, or tellurium may
         take the place of oxygen, and the corresponding
         compounds are called respectively {sulphur acids} or
         {sulphacids}, {selenium acids}, or {tellurium acids}.
         When the hydrogen of an acid is replaced by a positive
         element or radical, a salt is formed, and hence acids
         are sometimes named as salts of hydrogen; as hydrogen
         nitrate for nitric acid, hydrogen sulphate for
         sulphuric acid, etc. In the old chemistry the name acid
         was applied to the oxides of the negative or
         nonmetallic elements, now sometimes called anhydrides.

   Usage: {Acknowledge}, {Recognize}. Acknowledge is opposed to
          keep back, or conceal, and supposes that something had
          been previously known to us (though perhaps not to
          others) which we now feel bound to lay open or make
          public. Thus, a man acknowledges a secret marriage;
          one who has done wrong acknowledges his fault; and
          author acknowledges his obligation to those who have
          aided him; we acknowledge our ignorance. Recognize
          supposes that we have either forgotten or not had the
          evidence of a thing distinctly before our minds, but
          that now we know it (as it were) anew, or receive and
          admit in on the ground of the evidence it brings.
          Thus, we recognize a friend after a long absence. We
          recognize facts, principles, truths, etc., when their
          evidence is brought up fresh to the mind; as, bad men
          usually recognize the providence of God in seasons of
          danger. A foreign minister, consul, or agent, of any
          kind, is recognized on the ground of his producing
          satisfactory credentials. See also {Confess}.

   Usage: {Admittance}, {Admission}. These words are, to some
          extent, in a state of transition and change.
          Admittance is now chiefly confined to its primary
          sense of access into some locality or building. Thus
          we see on the doors of factories, shops, etc. ``No
          admittance.'' Its secondary or moral sense, as
          ``admittance to the church,'' is almost entirely laid
          aside. Admission has taken to itself the secondary or
          figurative senses; as, admission to the rights of
          citizenship; admission to the church; the admissions
          made by one of the parties in a dispute. And even when
          used in its primary sense, it is not identical with
          admittance. Thus, we speak of admission into a
          country, territory, and other larger localities, etc.,
          where admittance could not be used. So, when we speak
          of admission to a concert or other public assembly,
          the meaning is not perhaps exactly that of admittance,
          viz., access within the walls of the building, but
          rather a reception into the audience, or access to the
          performances. But the lines of distinction on this
          subject are one definitely drawn.

Admonition \Ad`mo*ni"tion\, n. [OE. amonicioun, OF. amonition,

   {Admonish}.]
   Gentle or friendly reproof; counseling against a fault or
   error; expression of authoritative advice; friendly caution
   or warning.

   Syn: {Admonition}, {Reprehension}, {Reproof}.

   Usage: Admonition is prospective, and relates to moral
          delinquencies; its object is to prevent further
          transgression. Reprehension and reproof are
          retrospective, the former being milder than the
          latter. A person of any age or station may be liable
          to reprehension in case of wrong conduct; but reproof
          is the act of a superior. It is authoritative
          fault-finding or censure addressed to children or to
          inferiors.

   L. aaornare; ad + ornare to furnish, embellish. See {Adore},
   {Ornate}.]
   To deck or dress with ornaments; to embellish; to set off to
   advantage; to render pleasing or attractive.

         As a bride adorneth herself with her jewels. --Isa.
                                                  lxi. 10.

   Syn: To deck; decorate; embellish; ornament; beautify; grace;
        dignify; exalt; honor.

   Usage: To {Adorn}, {Ornament}, {Decorate}, {Embellish}. We
          decorate and ornament by putting on some adjunct which
          is attractive or beautiful, and which serves to
          heighten the general effect. Thus, a lady's head-dress
          may be ornament or decorated with flowers or jewelry;
          a hall may be decorated or ornament with carving or
          gilding, with wreaths of flowers, or with hangings.
          Ornament is used in a wider sense than decorate. To
          embellish is to beautify or ornament richly, not so
          much by mere additions or details as by modifying the
          thing itself as a whole. It sometimes means gaudy and
          artificial decoration. We embellish a book with rich
          engravings; a style is embellished with rich and
          beautiful imagery; a shopkeeper embellishes his front
          window to attract attention. Adorn is sometimes
          identical with decorate, as when we say, a lady was
          adorned with jewels. In other cases, it seems to imply
          something more. Thus, we speak of a gallery of
          paintings as adorned with the works of some of the
          great masters, or adorned with noble statuary and
          columns. Here decorated and ornamented would hardly be
          appropriate. There is a value in these works of genius
          beyond mere show and ornament. Adorn may be used of

      ``You have the advantage of me; I don't remember ever to
      have had the honor.'' --Sheridan.

   {To take advantage of}, to profit by; (often used in a bad
      sense) to overreach, to outwit.

   Syn: {Advantage}, {Advantageous}, {Benefit}, {Beneficial}.

   Usage: We speak of a thing as a benefit, or as beneficial,
          when it is simply productive of good; as, the benefits
          of early discipline; the beneficial effects of
          adversity. We speak of a thing as an advantage, or as
          advantageous, when it affords us the means of getting
          forward, and places us on a ``vantage ground'' for
          further effort. Hence, there is a difference between
          the benefits and the advantages of early education;
          between a beneficial and an advantageous investment of
          money.

   Syn: Calamity; sorrow; distress; grief; pain; adversity;
        misery; wretchedness; misfortune; trouble; hardship.

   Usage: {Affliction}, {Sorrow}, {Grief}, {Distress}.
          Affliction and sorrow are terms of wide and general
          application; grief and distress have reference to
          particular cases. Affliction is the stronger term. The
          suffering lies deeper in the soul, and usually arises
          from some powerful cause, such as the loss of what is
          most dear -- friends, health, etc. We do not speak of
          mere sickness or pain as ``an affliction,'' though one
          who suffers from either is said to be afflicted; but
          deprivations of every kind, such as deafness,
          blindness, loss of limbs, etc., are called
          afflictions, showing that term applies particularly to
          prolonged sources of suffering. Sorrow and grief are
          much alike in meaning, but grief is the stronger term
          of the two, usually denoting poignant mental suffering
          for some definite cause, as, grief for the death of a
          dear friend; sorrow is more reflective, and is tinged
          with regret, as, the misconduct of a child is looked
          upon with sorrow. Grief is often violent and
          demonstrative; sorrow deep and brooding. Distress
          implies extreme suffering, either bodily or mental. In
          its higher stages, it denotes pain of a restless,
          agitating kind, and almost always supposes some
          struggle of mind or body. Affliction is allayed, grief
          subsides, sorrow is soothed, distress is mitigated.

   Syn: Fright; affright; terror; trepidation; apprehension;
        consternation; dismay; agitation; disquiet; disquietude.

   Usage: {Alarm}, {Fright}, {Terror}, {Consternation}. These
          words express different degrees of fear at the
          approach of danger. Fright is fear suddenly excited,
          producing confusion of the senses, and hence it is
          unreflecting. Alarm is the hurried agitation of
          feeling which springs from a sense of immediate and
          extreme exposure. Terror is agitating and excessive
          fear, which usually benumbs the faculties.
          Consternation is overwhelming fear, and carries a
          notion of powerlessness and amazement. Alarm agitates
          the feelings; terror disorders the understanding and
          affects the will; fright seizes on and confuses the
          sense; consternation takes possession of the soul, and
          subdues its faculties. See {Apprehension}.

   allr. Dan. al, Sw. all, Goth. alls; and perh. to Ir. and
   Gael. uile, W. oll.]
   1. The whole quantity, extent, duration, amount, quality, or
      degree of; the whole; the whole number of; any whatever;
      every; as, all the wheat; all the land; all the year; all
      the strength; all happiness; all abundance; loss of all
      power; beyond all doubt; you will see us all (or all of
      us).

            Prove all things: hold fast that which is good. --1
                                                  Thess. v. 21.

   2. Any. [Obs.] ``Without all remedy.'' --Shak.

   Note: When the definite article ``the,'' or a possessive or a
         demonstrative pronoun, is joined to the noun that all
         qualifies, all precedes the article or the pronoun; as,
         all the cattle; all my labor; all his wealth; all our
         families; all your citizens; all their property; all
         other joys.

   Note: This word, not only in popular language, but in the
         Scriptures, often signifies, indefinitely, a large
         portion or number, or a great part. Thus, all the
         cattle in Egypt died, all Judea and all the region
         round about Jordan, all men held John as a prophet, are
         not to be understood in a literal sense, but as
         including a large part, or very great numbers.

   3. Only; alone; nothing but.

            I was born to speak all mirth and no matter. --Shak.

   {All the whole}, the whole (emphatically). [Obs.] ``All the
      whole army.'' --Shak.

All \All\, adv.
   1. Wholly; completely; altogether; entirely; quite; very; as,
      all bedewed; my friend is all for amusement. ``And cheeks
      all pale.'' --Byron.



   Note: In the ancient phrases, all too dear, all too much, all
         so long, etc., this word retains its appropriate sense
         or becomes intensive.

   2. Even; just. (Often a mere intensive adjunct.) [Obs. or
      Poet.]

            All as his straying flock he fed.     --Spenser.

            A damsel lay deploring All on a rock reclined.
                                                  --Gay.

   {All to}, or {All-to}. In such phrases as ``all to rent,''
      ``all to break,'' ``all-to frozen,'' etc., which are of
      frequent occurrence in our old authors, the all and the to
      have commonly been regarded as forming a compound adverb,
      equivalent in meaning to entirely, completely, altogether.
      But the sense of entireness lies wholly in the word all
      (as it does in ``all forlorn,'' and similar expressions),
      and the to properly belongs to the following word, being a
      kind of intensive prefix (orig. meaning asunder and
      answering to the LG. ter-, HG. zer-). It is frequently to
      be met with in old books, used without the all. Thus
      Wyclif says, ``The vail of the temple was to rent:'' and
      of Judas, ``He was hanged and to-burst the middle:'' i.
      e., burst in two, or asunder.

   {All along}. See under {Along}.

   {All and some}, individually and collectively, one and all.
      [Obs.] ``Displeased all and some.'' --Fairfax.

   {All but}.

         completely incorporated into words, and its final
         consonant is dropped, as in almighty, already, always:

         adjectives or participles, but usually with a hyphen,
         as, all-bountiful, all-glorious, allimportant,
         all-surrounding, etc. In others it is an adjective; as,

         now written separately.

   and even by lex, legis, law. See {Liege}, {Ligeance}.]
   1. The tie or obligation, implied or expressed, which a
      subject owes to his sovereign or government; the duty of
      fidelity to one's king, government, or state.

   2. Devotion; loyalty; as, allegiance to science.

   Syn: Loyalty; fealty.

   Usage: {Allegiance}, {Loyalty}. These words agree in
          expressing the general idea of fidelity and attachment
          to the ``powers that be.'' Allegiance is an obligation
          to a ruling power. Loyalty is a feeling or sentiment
          towards such power. Allegiance may exist under any
          form of government, and, in a republic, we generally
          speak of allegiance to the government, to the state,
          etc. In well conducted monarchies, loyalty is a
          warm-hearted feeling of fidelity and obedience to the
          sovereign. It is personal in its nature; and hence we
          speak of the loyalty of a wife to her husband, not of
          her allegiance. In cases where we personify, loyalty
          is more commonly the word used; as, loyalty to the
          constitution; loyalty to the cause of virtue; loyalty
          to truth and religion, etc.

                Hear me, recreant, on thine allegiance hear me!
                                                  --Shak.

                So spake the Seraph Abdiel, faithful found, . .
                . Unshaken, unseduced, unterrified, His loyalty
                he kept, his love, his zeal.      --Milton.

   1. To form or turn into allegory; as, to allegorize the
      history of a people.

   2. To treat as allegorical; to understand in an allegorical
      sense; as, when a passage in a writer may understood
      literally or figuratively, he who gives it a figurative

Allegorizer \Al"le*go*ri`zer\, n.

   ?, description of one thing under the image of another; ?
   other + ? to speak in the assembly, harangue, ? place of
   assembly, fr. ? to assemble: cf. F. all['e]gorie.]
   1. A figurative sentence or discourse, in which the principal
      subject is described by another subject resembling it in
      its properties and circumstances. The real subject is thus
      kept out of view, and we are left to collect the
      intentions of the writer or speaker by the resemblance of
      the secondary to the primary subject.

   2. Anything which represents by suggestive resemblance; an
      emblem.

   3. (Paint. & Sculpt.) A figure representation which has a
      meaning beyond notion directly conveyed by the object
      painted or sculptured.

   Syn: Metaphor; fable.

   Usage: {Allegory}, {Parable}. ``An allegory differs both from
          fable and parable, in that the properties of persons
          are fictitiously represented as attached to things, to
          which they are as it were transferred. . . . A figure
          of Peace and Victory crowning some historical
          personage is an allegory. ``I am the Vine, ye are the
          branches'' [--John xv. 1-6] is a spoken allegory. In
          the parable there is no transference of properties.
          The parable of the sower [--Matt. xiii. 3-23]
          represents all things as according to their proper
          nature. In the allegory quoted above the properties of
          the vine and the relation of the branches are
          transferred to the person of Christ and His apostles
          and disciples.'' --C. J. Smith.

   Note: An allegory is a prolonged metaphor. Bunyan's
         ``Pilgrim's Progress'' and Spenser's ``Fa["e]rie
         Queene'' are celebrated examples of the allegory.

            He alleviates his fault by an excuse. --Johnson.

   Syn: To lessen; diminish; soften; mitigate; assuage; abate;
        relieve; nullify; allay.

   Usage: To {Alleviate}, {Mitigate}, {Assuage}, {Allay}. These
          words have in common the idea of relief from some
          painful state; and being all figurative, they differ
          in their application, according to the image under
          which this idea is presented. Alleviate supposes a
          load which is lightened or taken off; as, to alleviate
          one's cares. Mitigate supposes something fierce which
          is made mild; as, to mitigate one's anguish. Assuage
          supposes something violent which is quieted; as, to

          strong controlling influence, and differ according to

          appearances or representations. We are seduced when
          drawn aside from the path of rectitude. What allures
          draws by gentle means; what entices leads us by
          promises and persuasions; what decoys betrays us, as
          it were, into a snare or net; what seduces deceives us
          by artful appeals to the passions.

   Usage: These words are used by way of transition, in leaving
          one thought and passing to another. Also is the widest
          term. It denotes that what follows is all so, or
          entirely like that which preceded, or may be affirmed
          with the same truth; as, ``If you were there, I was
          there also;'' ``If our situation has some discomforts,
          it has also many sources of enjoyment.'' Too is simply
          less formal and pointed than also; it marks the
          transition with a lighter touch; as, ``I was there
          too;'' ``a courtier yet a patriot too.'' --Pope.
          Likewise denotes literally ``in like manner,'' and
          hence has been thought by some to be more specific
          than also. ``It implies,'' says Whately, ``some
          connection or agreement between the words it unites.
          We may say, ` He is a poet, and likewise a musician; '
          but we should not say, ` He is a prince, and likewise
          a musician,' because there is no natural connection
          between these qualities.'' This distinction, however,
          is often disregarded.

   Syn: To {Amend}, {Emend}, {Correct}, {Reform}, {Rectify}.

   midden, AS. on middan, in the middle, fr. midde the middle.
   The s is an adverbial ending, originally marking the
   genitive; the t is a later addition, as in whilst, amongst,

   among. ``This fair tree amidst the garden.'' ``Unseen amid
   the throng.'' ``Amidst thick clouds.'' --Milton. ``Amidst
   acclamations.'' ``Amidst the splendor and festivity of a
   court.'' --Macaulay.

         But rather famish them amid their plenty. --Shak.

   Syn: {Amidst}, {Among}.

   Usage: These words differ to some extent from each other, as
          will be seen from their etymology. Amidst denotes in
          the midst or middle of, and hence surrounded by; as,
          this work was written amidst many interruptions. Among
          denotes a mingling or intermixing with distinct or
          separable objects; as, ``He fell among thieves.''
          ``Blessed art thou among women.'' Hence, we say, among
          the moderns, among the ancients, among the thickest of
          trees, among these considerations, among the reasons I
          have to offer. Amid and amidst are commonly used when
          the idea of separate or distinguishable objects is not
          prominent. Hence, we say, they kept on amidst the
          storm, amidst the gloom, he was sinking amidst the
          waves, he persevered amidst many difficulties; in none
          of which cases could among be used. In like manner,
          Milton speaks of Abdiel,

                The seraph Abdiel, faithful found; Among the
                faithless faithful only he, because he was then
          considered as one of the angels. But when the poet
          adds,

                From amidst them forth he passed, we have rather
          the idea of the angels as a collective body.

                Those squalid cabins and uncleared woods amidst
                which he was born.                --Macaulay.

          agreeable contact with others, as conversation, or a
          book. We are diverted by that which turns off our

                gratifies the fancy. Whatever diverts is lively
                in its nature, and sometimes tumultuous in its

   {Ancient lights} (Law), windows and other openings which have
      been enjoined without molestation for more than twenty

   Syn: Old; primitive; pristine; antique; antiquated;
        old-fashioned; obsolete.

   Usage: {Ancient}, {Antiquated}, {Obsolete}, {Antique},
          {Antic}, {Old}. -- Ancient is opposed to modern, and
          has antiquity; as, an ancient family, ancient
          landmarks, ancient institutions, systems of thought,
          etc. Antiquated describes that which has gone out of
          use or fashion; as, antiquated furniture, antiquated
          laws, rules, etc. Obsolete is commonly used, instead
          of antiquated, in reference to language, customs,
          etc.; as, an obsolete word or phrase, an obsolete
          expression. Antique is applied, in present usage,
          either to that which has come down from the ancients;
          as, an antique cameo, bust, etc.; or to that which is
          made to imitate some ancient work of art; as, an
          antique temple. In the days of Shakespeare, antique
          was often used for ancient; as, ``an antique song,''
          ``an antique Roman;'' and hence, from singularity
          often attached to what is ancient, it was used in the
          sense of grotesque; as, ``an oak whose antique root
          peeps out; '' and hence came our present word antic,
          denoting grotesque or ridiculous. We usually apply
          both ancient and old to things subject to gradual
          decay. We say, an old man, an ancient record; but
          never, the old stars, an old river or mountain. In
          general, however, ancient is opposed to modern, and
          old to new, fresh, or recent. When we speak of a thing
          that existed formerly, which has ceased to exist, we
          commonly use ancient; as, ancient republics, ancient
          heroes; and not old republics, old heroes. But when
          the thing which began or existed in former times is
          still in existence, we use either ancient or old; as,
          ancient statues or paintings, or old statues or
          paintings; ancient authors, or old authors, meaning
          books.

            his way, Self-mettle tires him.       --Shak.

   Syn: Resentment; wrath; rage; fury; passion; ire gall;
        choler; indignation; displeasure; vexation; grudge;
        spleen.

   Usage: {Anger}, {Indignation}, {Resentment}, {Wrath}, {Ire},
          {Rage}, {Fury}. Anger is a feeling of keen displeasure
          (usually with a desire to punish) for what we regard
          as wrong toward ourselves or others. It may be
          excessive or misplaced, but is not necessarily
          criminal. Indignation is a generous outburst of anger
          in view of things which are indigna, or unworthy to be
          done, involving what is mean, cruel, flagitious, etc.,
          in character or conduct. Resentment is often a moody
          feeling, leading one to brood over his supposed
          personal wrongs with a deep and lasting anger. See
          {Resentment}. Wrath and ire (the last poetical)
          express the feelings of one who is bitterly provoked.
          Rage is a vehement ebullition of anger; and fury is an
          excess of rage, amounting almost to madness. Warmth of
          constitution often gives rise to anger; a high sense
          of honor creates indignation at crime; a man of quick
          sensibilities is apt to cherish resentment; the wrath
          and ire of men are often connected with a haughty and
          vindictive spirit; rage and fury are distempers of the
          soul to be regarded only with abhorrence.

   {Angering}.] [Cf. Icel. angra.]

      which will be desired.

   4. To foretaste or foresee; to have a previous view or
      impression of; as, to anticipate the pleasures of a visit;
      to anticipate the evils of life.

   Syn: To prevent; obviate; preclude; forestall; expect.

   Usage: To {Anticipate}, {Expect}. These words, as here
          compared, agree in regarding some future event as
          about to take place. Expect is the stringer. It
          supposes some ground or reason in the mind for
          considering the event as likely to happen. Anticipate
          is, literally, to take beforehand, and here denotes
          simply to take into the mind as conception of the
          future. Hence, to say, ``I did not anticipate a
          refusal,'' expresses something less definite and
          strong than to say, `` did not expect it.'' Still,
          anticipate is a convenient word to be interchanged
          with expect in cases where the thought will allow.

                Good with bad Expect to hear; supernal grace
                contending With sinfulness of men. --Milton.

                I would not anticipate the relish of any
                happiness, nor feel the weight of any misery,
                before it actually arrives.       --Spectator.

                Timid men were anticipating another civil war.
                                                  --Macaulay.

   Syn: {Excuse}.

   Usage: An apology, in the original sense of the word, was a
          pleading off from some charge or imputation, by
          explaining and defending one's principles or conduct.
          It therefore amounted to a vindication. One who offers
          an apology, admits himself to have been, at least
          apparently, in the wrong, but brings forward some
          palliating circumstance, or tenders a frank
          acknowledgment, by way of reparation. We make an
          apology for some breach of propriety or decorum (like
          rude expressions, unbecoming conduct, etc.), or some
          deficiency in what might be reasonably expected. We
          offer an excuse when we have been guilty of some
          breach or neglect of duty; and we do it by way of
          extenuating our fault, and with a view to be forgiven.
          When an excuse has been accepted, an apology may
          still, in some cases, be necessary or appropriate.
          ``An excuse is not grounded on the claim of innocence,
          but is rather an appeal for favor resting on some
          collateral circumstance. An apology mostly respects
          the conduct of individuals toward each other as
          equals; it is a voluntary act produced by feelings of
          decorum, or a desire for the good opinion of others.''
          --Crabb.

   Syn: To {Appreciate}, {Estimate}, {Esteem}.

   Usage: Estimate is an act of judgment; esteem is an act of
          valuing or prizing, and when applied to individuals,
          denotes a sentiment of moral approbation. See
          {Estimate}. Appreciate lies between the two. As
          compared with estimate, it supposes a union of
          sensibility with judgment, producing a nice and
          delicate perception. As compared with esteem, it
          denotes a valuation of things according to their
          appropriate and distinctive excellence, and not simply
          their moral worth. Thus, with reference to the former
          of these (delicate perception), an able writer says.
          ``Women have a truer appreciation of character than
          men;'' and another remarks, ``It is difficult to
          appreciate the true force and distinctive sense of
          terms which we are every day using.'' So, also, we
          speak of the difference between two things, as
          sometimes hardly appreciable. With reference to the
          latter of these (that of valuation as the result of a
          nice perception), we say, ``It requires a peculiar
          cast of character to appreciate the poetry of
          Wordsworth;'' ``He who has no delicacy himself, can
          not appreciate it in others;'' ``The thought of death
          is salutary, because it leads us to appreciate worldly
          things aright.'' Appreciate is much used in cases
          where something is in danger of being overlooked or
          undervalued; as when we speak of appreciating the
          difficulties of a subject, or the risk of an
          undertaking. So Lord Plunket, referring to an
          ``ominous silence'' which prevailed among the Irish
          peasantry, says, ``If you knew how to appreciate that
          silence, it is more formidable than the most clamorous
          opposition.'' In like manner, a person who asks some
          favor of another is apt to say, ``I trust you will
          appreciate my motives in this request.'' Here we have
          the key to a very frequent use of the word. It is
          hardly necessary to say that appreciate looks on the
          favorable side of things. we never speak of
          appreciating a man's faults, but his merits. This idea
          of regarding things favorably appears more fully in
          the word appreciative; as when we speak of an
          appreciative audience, or an appreciative review,
          meaning one that manifests a quick perception and a
          ready valuation of excellence.

Apprehend \Ap`pre*hend"\ ([a^]p`pr[-e]*h[e^]nd"), v. t. [imp. &
   p. p. {Apprehended}; p. pr. & vb. n. {Apprehending}.] [L.
   apprehendere; ad + prehendere to lay hold of, seize; prae
   before + -hendere (used only in comp.); akin to Gr.
   chanda`nein to hold, contain, and E. get: cf. F.
   appr['e]hender. See {Prehensile}, {Get}.]
   1. To take or seize; to take hold of. [Archaic]

            a buzz, soon got a sting in the king's head, and he
            violently apprehended it.             --Fuller.

            The eternal laws, such as the heroic age apprehended
            them.                                 --Gladstone.

   4. To know or learn with certainty. [Obs.]

            G. You are too much distrustful of my truth. E. Then

            The opposition had more reason than the king to

   Syn: To catch; seize; arrest; detain; capture; conceive;
        understand; imagine; believe; fear; dread.

   Usage: To {Apprehend}, {Comprehend}. These words come into
          comparison as describing acts of the mind. Apprehend
          denotes the laying hold of a thing mentally, so as to
          understand it clearly, at least in part. Comprehend
          denotes the embracing or understanding it in all its
          compass and extent. We may apprehended many truths
          which we do not comprehend. The very idea of God
          supposes that he may be apprehended, though not
          comprehended, by rational beings. ``We may apprehended
          much of Shakespeare's aim and intention in the
          character of Hamlet or King Lear; but few will claim
          that they have comprehended all that is embraced in

            naked intellection of an object.      --Glanvill.

   4. Opinion; conception; sentiment; idea.

   Note: In this sense, the word often denotes a belief, founded
         on sufficient evidence to give preponderation to the
         mind, but insufficient to induce certainty; as, in our
         apprehension, the facts prove the issue.

               To false, and to be thought false, is all one in
               respect of men, who act not according to truth,
               but apprehension.                  --South.

   Usage: Apprehension springs from a sense of danger when

          calmer and more permanent; alarm is more agitating and

   Usage: To {Argue}, {Dispute}, {Debate}. These words, as here
          compared, suppose a contest between two parties in
          respect to some point at issue. To argue is to adduce
          arguments or reasons in support of one's cause or
          position. To dispute is to call in question or deny
          the statements or arguments of the opposing party. To
          debate is to strive for or against in a somewhat
          formal manner by arguments.

                Men of many words sometimes argue for the sake
                of talking; men of ready tongues frequently
                dispute for the sake of victory; men in public
                life often debate for the sake of opposing the
                ruling party, or from any other motive than the
                love of truth.                    --Crabb.

      trades.

   {The fine arts} are those which have primarily to do with

   Syn: Artificer; artist.

   Usage: {Artisan}, {Artist}, {Artificer}. An artist is one who
          is skilled in some one of the fine arts; an artisan is
          one who exercises any mechanical employment. A
          portrait painter is an artist; a sign painter is an
          artisan, although he may have the taste and skill of
          an artist. The occupation of the former requires a
          fine taste and delicate manipulation; that of the
          latter demands only an ordinary degree of contrivance
          and imitative power. An artificer is one who requires
          power of contrivance and adaptation in the exercise of
          his profession. The word suggest neither the idea of
          mechanical conformity to rule which attaches to the
          term artisan, nor the ideas of refinement and of
          peculiar skill which belong to the term artist.

   Syn: To slander; defame; detract from; calumniate; vilify.

   Usage: To {Asperse}, {Defame}, {Slander}, {Calumniate}. These
          words have in common the idea of falsely assailing the
          character of another. To asperse is figuratively to
          cast upon a character hitherto unsullied the
          imputation of blemishes or faults which render it
          offensive or loathsome. To defame is to detract from a

          load him with infamy. Slander (etymologically the same
          as scandal) and calumniate, from the Latin, have in
          common the sense of circulating reports to a man's
          injury from unworthy or malicious motives. Men asperse
          their neighbors by malignant insinuations; they defame
          by advancing charges to blacken or sully their fair
          fame; they slander or calumniate by spreading
          injurious reports which are false, or by magnifying
          slight faults into serious errors or crimes.

          end, such as to hear, to deliberate, to unite in
          music, dancing, etc. An assemblage of skaters on a
          lake, or of horse jockeys at a race course, is not an
          assembly, but might be turned into one by collecting
          into a body with a view to discuss and decide as to
          some object of common interest.

   To admit a thing as true; to express one's agreement,
   acquiescence, concurrence, or concession.

      bill which has passed both houses of Parliament, after
      which it becomes law.

   Syn: Concurrence; acquiescence; approval; accord.

   Usage: {Assent}, {Consent}. Assent is an act of the
          understanding, consent of the will or feelings. We
          assent to the views of others when our minds come to
          the same conclusion with theirs as to what is true,
          right, or admissible. We consent when there is such a
          concurrence of our will with their desires and wishes
          that we decide to comply with their requests. The king
          of England gives his assent, not his consent, to acts
          of Parliament, because, in theory at least, he is not
          governed by personal feelings or choice, but by a
          deliberate, judgment as to the common good. We also
          use assent in cases where a proposal is made which
          involves but little interest or feeling. A lady may
          assent to a gentleman's opening the window; but if he
          offers himself in marriage, he must wait for her
          consent.

   v.]

         as much as indiscriminate contradiction and noisy
         debate disgust.                          --Ld.
                                                  Chesterfield.

      position; to demand recognition.

   Syn: To affirm; aver; asseverate; maintain; protest;
        pronounce; declare; vindicate.

   Usage: To {Assert}, {Affirm}, {Maintain}, {Vindicate}. To
          assert is to fasten to one's self, and hence to claim.
          It is, therefore, adversative in its nature. We assert
          our rights and privileges, or the cause of tree
          institutions, as against opposition or denial. To
          affirm is to declare as true. We assert boldly; we
          affirm positively. To maintain is to uphold, and
          insist upon with earnestness, whatever we have once
          asserted; as, to maintain one's cause, to maintain an
          argument, to maintain the ground we have taken. To
          vindicate is to use language and measures of the
          strongest kind, in defense of ourselves and those for
          whom we act. We maintain our assertions by adducing
          proofs, facts, or arguments; we are ready to vindicate
          our rights or interests by the utmost exertion of our
          powers.

          violent and savage spirit. If Lord Chatham, instead of
          saying ``the atrocious crime of being a young man,''
          had used either of the other two words, his irony
          would have lost all its point, in his celebrated reply
          to Sir Robert Walpole, as reported by Dr. Johnson. --

   4. (Giv. Law)
      (a) A seizure or taking into custody by virtue of a legal
          process.
      (b) The writ or percept commanding such seizure or taking.

   Note: The term is applied to a seizure or taking either of
         persons or property. In the serving of process in a
         civil suit, it is most generally applied to the taking
         of property, whether at common law, as a species of
         distress, to compel defendant's appearance, or under
         local statutes, to satisfy the judgment the plaintiff
         may recover in the action. The terms attachment and
         arrest are both applied to the taking or apprehension
         of a defendant to compel an appearance in a civil
         action. Attachments are issued at common law and in
         chancery, against persons for contempt of court. In
         England, attachment is employed in some cases where
         capias is with us, as against a witness who fails to
         appear on summons. In some of the New England States a
         writ of attachment is a species of mesne process upon
         which the property of a defendant may be seized at the
         commencement of a suit and before summons to him, and
         may be held to satisfy the judgment the plaintiff may
         recover. In other States this writ can issue only
         against absconding debtors and those who conceal
         themselves. See {Foreign}, {Garnishment}, {Trustee
         process}. --Bouvier. --Burrill. --Blackstone.

   Syn: {Attachment}, {Affection}.

   Usage: The leading idea of affection is that of warmth and
          tenderness; the leading idea of attachment is that of
          being bound to some object by strong and lasting ties.
          There is more of sentiment (and sometimes of romance)
          in affection, and more of principle in preserving
          attachment. We speak of the ardor of the one, and the
          fidelity of the other. There is another distinction in
          the use and application of these words. The term
          attachment is applied to a wider range of objects than
          affection. A man may have a strong attachment to his
          country, to his profession, to his principles, and
          even to favorite places; in respect to none of these
          could we use the word affection.

Attack \At*tack"\, v. t. [imp. & p. p. {Attacked}; p. pr. & vb.
   n. {Attacking}.] [F. attaquer, orig. another form of attacher
   to attack: cf. It. attacare to fasten, attack. See {Attach},
   {Tack} a small nail.]
   1. To fall upon with force; to assail, as with force and
      arms; to assault. ``Attack their lines.'' --Dryden.

   2. To assail with unfriendly speech or writing; to begin a
      controversy with; to attempt to overthrow or bring into
      disrepute, by criticism or satire; to censure; as, to

   3. To set to work upon, as upon a task or problem, or some
      object of labor or investigation.

   4. To begin to affect; to begin to act upon, injuriously or
      destructively; to begin to decompose or waste.

            On the fourth of March he was attacked by fever.
                                                  --Macaulay.

            Hydrofluoric acid . . . attacks the glass. --B.
                                                  Stewart.

   Syn: To {Attack}, {Assail}, {Assault}, {Invade}.

   Usage: These words all denote a violent onset; attack being
          the generic term, and the others specific forms of
          attack. To attack is to commence the onset; to assail
          is to make a sudden and violent attack, or to make
          repeated attacks; to assault (literally, to leap upon)
          is to attack physically by a had-to-hand approach or
          by unlawful and insulting violence; to invade is to
          enter by force on what belongs to another. Thus, a
          person may attack by offering violence of any kind; he
          may assail by means of missile weapons; he may assault
          by direct personal violence; a king may invade by
          marching an army into a country. Figuratively, we may
          say, men attack with argument or satire; they assail
          with abuse or reproaches; they may be assaulted by
          severe temptations; the rights of the people may be
          invaded by the encroachments of the crown.

Attack \At*tack"\, v. i.
   To make an onset or attack.

Attack \At*tack"\, n. [Cf. F. attaque.]

   atteinen, atteignen, atainen, OF. ateindre, ataindre, F.
   atteindre, fr. L. attingere; ad + tangere to touch, reach.
   See {Tangent}, and cf. {Attinge}, {Attaint}.]
   1. To achieve or accomplish, that is, to reach by efforts; to
      gain; to compass; as, to attain rest.

            Is he wise who hopes to attain the end without the
            means?                                --Abp.

   5. To overtake. [Obs.] --Bacon.

   6. To reach in excellence or degree; to equal.

   Syn: To {Attain}, {Obtain}, {Procure}.

   Usage: Attain always implies an effort toward an object.
          Hence it is not synonymous with obtain and procure,
          which do not necessarily imply such effort or motion.
          We procure or obtain a thing by purchase or loan, and
          we obtain by inheritance, but we do not attain it by
          such means.

Attain \At*tain"\, v. i.

   1. The act of attainting, or the state of being attainted;
      the extinction of the civil rights and capacities of a
      person, consequent upon sentence of death or outlawry; as,
      an act of attainder. --Abbott.

   Note: Formerly attainder was the inseparable consequence of a
         judicial or legislative sentence for treason or felony,
         and involved the forfeiture of all the real and
         personal property of the condemned person, and such
         ``corruption of blood'' that he could neither receive
         nor transmit by inheritance, nor could he sue or
         testify in any court, or claim any legal protection or
         rights. In England attainders are now abolished, and in
         the United States the Constitution provides that no
         bill of attainder shall be passed; and no attainder of
         treason (in consequence of a judicial sentence) shall
         work corruption of blood or forfeiture, except during
         the life of the person attainted.

   2. A stain or staining; state of being in dishonor or

   {To strike an attitude}, to take an attitude for mere effect.

   Syn: {Attitude}, {Posture}.

   Usage: Both of these words describe the visible disposition
          of the limbs. Posture relates to their position
          merely; attitude refers to their fitness for some
          specific object. The object of an attitude is to set
          forth exhibit some internal feeling; as, attitude of
          wonder, of admiration, of grief, etc. It is,
          therefore, essentially and designedly expressive. Its
          object is the same with that of gesture; viz., to hold
          forth and represent. Posture has no such design. If we
          speak of posture in prayer, or the posture of
          devotion, it is only the natural disposition of the
          limbs, without any intention to show forth or exhibit.

                'T is business of a painter in his choice of
                attitudes (positur[ae]) to foresee the effect
                and harmony of the lights and shadows. --Dryden.

                Never to keep the body in the same posture half

   t.]

         attorney, or an attorney in fact, is a person appointed
         by another, by a letter or power of attorney, to
         transact any business for him out of court; but in a
         more extended sense, this class includes any agent
         employed in any business, or to do any act in pais, for
         another. A public attorney, or attorney at law, is a
         practitioner in a court of law, legally qualified to
         prosecute and defend actions in such court, on the
         retainer of clients. --Bouvier. -- The attorney at law
         answers to the procurator of the civilians, to the
         solicitor in chancery, and to the proctor in the
         ecclesiastical and admiralty courts, and all of these
         are comprehended under the more general term lawyer. In
         Great Britain and in some states of the United States,
         attorneys are distinguished from counselors in that the
         business of the former is to carry on the practical and
         formal parts of the suit. In many states of the United
         States however, no such distinction exists. In England,
         since 1873, attorneys at law are by statute called
         solicitors.

      together, or to produce their cohesion or combination, and
      conversely resisting separation.

   Note: Attraction is exerted at both sensible and insensible
         distances, and is variously denominated according to
         its qualities or phenomena. Under attraction at
         sensible distances, there are, -- (1.)

   {Attraction of gravitation}, which acts at all distances
      throughout the universe, with a force proportional
      directly to the product of the masses of the bodies and
      inversely to the square of their distances apart. (2.)

   {Magnetic}, {diamagnetic}, and {electrical attraction}, each
      of which is limited in its sensible range and is polar in
      its action, a property dependent on the quality or
      condition of matter, and not on its quantity. Under
      attraction at insensible distances, there are, -- (1.)

   {Adhesive attraction}, attraction between surfaces of
      sensible extent, or by the medium of an intervening
      substance. (2.)

   {Cohesive attraction}, attraction between ultimate particles,
      whether like or unlike, and causing simply an aggregation
      or a union of those particles, as in the absorption of
      gases by charcoal, or of oxygen by spongy platinum, or the
      process of solidification or crystallization. The power in
      adhesive attraction is strictly the same as that of
      cohesion. (3.)

   {Capillary attraction}, attraction causing a liquid to rise,
      in capillary tubes or interstices, above its level
      outside, as in very small glass tubes, or a sponge, or any
      porous substance, when one end is inserted in the liquid.
      It is a special case of cohesive attraction. (4.)

   {Chemical attraction}, or

   {affinity}, that peculiar force which causes elementary
      atoms, or groups of atoms, to unite to form molecules.

   2. The act or property of attracting; the effect of the power
      or operation of attraction. --Newton.

   3. The power or act of alluring, drawing to, inviting, or
      engaging; an attractive quality; as, the attraction of
      beauty or eloquence.

   4. That which attracts; an attractive object or feature.

   Syn: Allurement; enticement; charm.

   a'yto`s self + a form "enths (not found), akin to L. sons and
   perh. orig. from the p. pr. of e'i^nai to be, root as, and

   {Effendi}.]
   1. Having a genuine original or authority, in opposition to

   5. (Mus.) Having as immediate relation to the tonic, in
      distinction from plagal, which has a correspondent
      relation to the dominant in the octave below the tonic.

   Syn: {Authentic}, {Genuine}.

   Usage: These words, as here compared, have reference to
          historical documents. We call a document genuine when
          it can be traced back ultimately to the author or
          authors from whom it professes to emanate. Hence, the
          word has the meaning, ``not changed from the original,
          uncorrupted, unadulterated:'' as, a genuine text. We
          call a document authentic when, on the ground of its
          being thus traced back, it may be relied on as true
          and authoritative (from the primary sense of ``having
          an author, vouched for''); hence its extended
          signification, in general literature, of trustworthy,
          as resting on unquestionable authority or evidence;
          as, an authentic history; an authentic report of
          facts.

                A genuine book is that which was written by the
                person whose name it bears, as the author of it.
                An authentic book is that which relates matters
                of fact as they really happened. A book may be
                genuine without being, authentic, and a book may
                be authentic without being genuine. --Bp.
                                                  Watson.

   Note: It may be said, however, that some writers use
         authentic (as, an authentic document) in the sense of
         ``produced by its professed author, not counterfeit.''

         distilled water at 62[deg] Fahrenheit, the barometer

   Syn: Ungainly; unhandy; clownish; lubberly; gawky; maladroit;
        bungling; inelegant; ungraceful; unbecoming.

   Usage: {Awkward}, {Clumsy}, {Uncouth}. Awkward has a special
          reference to outward deportment. A man is clumsy in
          his whole person, he is awkward in his gait and the
          movement of his limbs. Clumsiness is seen at the first
          view. Awkwardness is discovered only when a person
          begins to move. Hence the expressions, a clumsy
          appearance, and an awkward manner. When we speak
          figuratively of an awkward excuse, we think of a want
          of ease and grace in making it; when we speak of a
          clumsy excuse, we think of the whole thing as coarse
          and stupid. We apply the term uncouth most frequently
          to that which results from the want of instruction or
          training; as, uncouth manners; uncouth language. --

Awsome \Aw"some\, a.
   Same as {Awesome}.

Ax \Ax\, Axe \Axe\,, n. [OE. ax, axe, AS. eax, [ae]x, acas; akin
   to D. akse, OS. accus, OHG. acchus, G. axt, Icel. ["o]x,
   ["o]xi, Sw. yxe, Dan. ["o]kse, Goth. aqizi, Gr. ?, L. ascia;
   not akin to E. acute.]
   A tool or instrument of steel, or of iron with a steel edge
   or blade, for felling trees, chopping and splitting wood,
   hewing timber, etc. It is wielded by a wooden helve or
   handle, so fixed in a socket or eye as to be in the same
   plane with the blade. The broadax, or carpenter's ax, is an
   ax for hewing timber, made heavier than the chopping ax, and
   with a broader and thinner blade and a shorter handle.

   Note: The ancient battle-ax had sometimes a double edge.

   Note: The word is used adjectively or in combination; as,
         axhead or ax head; ax helve; ax handle; ax shaft;
         ax-shaped; axlike.

   Note: This word was originally spelt with e, axe; and so also
         was nearly every corresponding word of one syllable:
         as, flaxe, taxe, waxe, sixe, mixe, pixe, oxe, fluxe,
         etc. This superfluous e is not dropped; so that, in
         more than a hundred words ending in x, no one thinks of
         retaining the e except in axe. Analogy requires its
         exclusion here.

   Note: ``The spelling ax is better on every ground, of
         etymology, phonology, and analogy, than axe, which has
         of late become prevalent.'' --New English Dict.
         (Murray).

Ax \Ax\, v. t. & i. [OE. axien and asken. See {Ask}.]
   To ask; to inquire or inquire of.

   Note: This word is from Saxon, and is as old as the English
         language. Formerly it was in good use, but now is
         regarded as a vulgarism. It is still dialectic in
         England, and is sometimes heard among the uneducated in
         the United States. ``And Pilate axide him, Art thou
         king of Jewis?'' ``Or if he axea fish.'' --Wyclif.
         'bdThe king axed after your Grace's welfare.'' --Pegge.

   Usage: An axiom is a self-evident truth which is taken for
          granted as the basis of reasoning. A maxim is a
