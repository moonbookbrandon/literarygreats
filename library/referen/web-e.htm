E \E\ ([=e]).
   1. The fifth letter of the English alphabet.

   Note: It derives its form, name, and value from the Latin,
         the form and value being further derived from the
         Greek, into which it came from the Ph[oe]nician, and
         ultimately, probably, from the Egyptian. Its
         etymological relations are closest with the vowels i,
         a, and o, as illustrated by to fall, to fell; man, pl.
         men; drink, drank, drench; dint, dent; doom, deem;
         goose, pl. geese; beef, OF. boef, L. bos; and E. cheer,
         OF. chiere, LL. cara.

   Note: The letter e has in English several vowel sounds, the
         two principal being its long or name sound, as in eve,
         me, and the short, as in end, best. Usually at the end
         of words it is silent, but serves to indicate that the
         preceding vowel has its long sound, where otherwise it
         would be short, as in m[=a]ne, c[=a]ne, m[=e]te, which
         without the final e would be pronounced m[a^]n, c[a^]n,
         m[e^]t. After c and g, the final e indicates that these
         letters are to be pronounced as s and j; respectively,
         as in lace, rage. See Guide to Pronunciation,
         [sect][sect] 74-97.

   2. (Mus.) E is the third tone of the model diatonic scale.
      E[flat] (E flat) is a tone which is intermediate between D
      and E.

E- \E-\
   A Latin prefix meaning out, out of, from; also, without. See
   {Ex-}.

Each \Each\ ([=e]ch), a. or a. pron. [OE. eche, [ae]lc, elk,
   ilk, AS. [ae]lc; [=a] always + gel[=i]c like; akin to OD.
   iegelik, OHG. [=e]ogil[=i]h, MHG. iegel[=i]ch, G. jeglich.
   [root]209. See 3d {Aye}, {Like}, and cf. {Either}, {Every},
   {Ilk}.]
   1. Every one of the two or more individuals composing a
      number of objects, considered separately from the rest. It
      is used either with or without a following noun; as, each
      of you or each one of you. ``Each of the combatants.''
      --Fielding.

   Note: To each corresponds other. ``Let each esteem other
         better than himself.'' Each other, used elliptically
         for each the other. It is our duty to assist each
         other; that is, it is our duty, each to assist the
         other, each being in the nominative and other in the
         objective case.

               It is a bad thing that men should hate each
               other; but it is far worse that they should
               contract the habit of cutting one another's
               throats without hatred.            --Macaulay.

               Let each His adamantine coat gird well. --Milton.

               brethren, all to God.              --Keble.

               The oak and the elm have each a distinct
               character.                         --Gilpin.

   2. Every; -- sometimes used interchangeably with every.
      --Shak.

            In short each man's happiness depends upon himself.
                                                  --Sterne.

   Note: This use of each for every, though common in Scotland
         and in America, is now un-English. --Fitzed. Hall.

   Syn: Earnest; ardent; vehement; hot; impetuous; fervent;

          a covetous man is eager for gain. Eagerness is liable
          to frequent abuses, and is good or bad, as the case
          may be. It relates to what is praiseworthy or the
          contrary. Earnest denotes a permanent state of mind,
          feeling, or sentiment. It is always taken in a good
          sense; as, a preacher is earnest in his appeals to the

   1. The organ of hearing; the external ear.

   Note: In man and the higher vertebrates, the organ of hearing
         is very complicated, and is divisible into three parts:
         the external ear, which includes the pinna or auricle
         and meatus or external opening; the middle ear, drum,
         or tympanum; and the internal ear, or labyrinth. The
         middle ear is a cavity connected by the Eustachian tube
         with the pharynx, separated from the opening of the
         external ear by the tympanic membrane, and containing a
         chain of three small bones, or ossicles, named malleus,
         incus, and stapes, which connect this membrane with the
         internal ear. The essential part of the internal ear
         where the fibers of the auditory nerve terminate, is
         the membranous labyrinth, a complicated system of sacs
         and tubes filled with a fluid (the endolymph), and
         lodged in a cavity, called the bony labyrinth, in the
         periotic bone. The membranous labyrinth does not
         completely fill the bony labyrinth, but is partially
         suspended in it in a fluid (the perilymph). The bony
         labyrinth consists of a central cavity, the vestibule,
         into which three semicircular canals and the canal of
         the cochlea (spirally coiled in mammals) open. The
         vestibular portion of the membranous labyrinth consists
         of two sacs, the utriculus and sacculus, connected by a
         narrow tube, into the former of which three membranous
         semicircular canals open, while the latter is connected
         with a membranous tube in the cochlea containing the
         organ of Corti. By the help of the external ear the
         sonorous vibrations of the air are concentrated upon
         the tympanic membrane and set it vibrating, the chain
         of bones in the middle ear transmits these vibrations
         to the internal ear, where they cause certain delicate
         structures in the organ of Corti, and other parts of
         the membranous labyrinth, to stimulate the fibers of
         the auditory nerve to transmit sonorous impulses to the
         brain.

   2. The sense of hearing; the perception of sounds; the power
      of discriminating between different tones; as, a nice ear
      for music; -- in the singular only.

            Songs . . . not all ungrateful to thine ear.
                                                  --Tennyson.

   3. That which resembles in shape or position the ear of an
      animal; any prominence or projection on an object, --
      usually one for support or attachment; a lug; a handle;
      as, the ears of a tub, a skillet, or dish. The ears of a
      boat are outside kneepieces near the bow. See Illust. of
      {Bell}.

   Syn: {Economy}, {Frugality}, {Parsimony}. Economy avoids all
        waste and extravagance, and applies money to the best
        advantage; frugality cuts off indulgences, and proceeds
        on a system of saving. The latter conveys the idea of
        not using or spending superfluously, and is opposed to
        lavishness or profusion. Frugality is usually applied to
        matters of consumption, and commonly points to
        simplicity of manners; parsimony is frugality carried to
        an extreme, involving meanness of spirit, and a sordid
        mode of living. Economy is a virtue, and parsimony a
        vice.



      I have no other notion of economy than that it is the
      parent to liberty and ease.                 --Swift.

   Syn: {Effect}, {Consequence}, {Result}.

   Usage: These words indicate things which arise out of some
          antecedent, or follow as a consequent. Effect, which
          may be regarded as the generic term, denotes that
          which springs directly from something which can
          properly be termed a cause. A consequence is more
          remote, not being strictly caused, nor yet a mere
          sequence, but following out of and following
          indirectly, or in the train of events, something on
          which it truly depends. A result is still more remote
          and variable, like the rebound of an elastic body
          which falls in very different directions. We may
          foresee the effects of a measure, may conjecture its
          consequences, but can rarely discover its final
          results.

                Resolving all events, with their effects And
                manifold results, into the will And arbitration
                wise of the Supreme.              --Cowper.

                Shun the bitter consequence, for know, The day
                thou eatest thereof, . . . thou shalt die.
                                                  --Milton.

Element \El"e*ment\, n. [F. ['e]l['e]ment, L. elementum.]
   1. One of the simplest or essential parts or principles of
      which anything consists, or upon which the constitution or
      fundamental powers of anything are based.

   2. One of the ultimate, undecomposable constituents of any
      kind of matter. Specifically: (Chem.) A substance which
      cannot be decomposed into different kinds of matter by any
      means at present employed; as, the elements of water are
      oxygen and hydrogen.

   Note: The elements are naturally classified in several
         families or groups, as the group of the alkaline
         elements, the halogen group, and the like. They are
         roughly divided into two great classes, the metals, as
         sodium, calcium, etc., which form basic compounds, and
         the nonmetals or metalloids, as oxygen, sulphur,
         chlorine, which form acid compounds; but the
         distinction is only relative, and some, as arsenic,
         tin, aluminium, etc., form both acid and basic
         compounds. The essential fact regarding every element
         is its relative atomic weight or equivalent. When the
         elements are tabulated in the order of their ascending
         atomic weights, the arrangement constitutes the series
         of the Periodic law of Mendelejeff. See {Periodic law},
         under {Periodic}. This Periodic law enables us to
         predict the qualities of unknown elements. The number
         of elements known is about seventy-five, but the gaps
         in the Periodic law indicate the possibility of many
         more. Many of the elements with which we are familiar,
         as hydrogen, carbon, iron, gold, etc., have been
         recognized, by means of spectrum analysis, in the sun
         and the fixed stars. From certain evidence (as that
         afforded by the Periodic law, spectrum analysis, etc.)
         it appears that the chemical elements probably may not
         be simple bodies, but only very stable compounds of
         some simpler body or bodies. In formulas, the elements
         are designated by abbreviations of their names in Latin
         or New Latin. The Elements

   Note: Several other elements have been announced, as holmium,
         vesbium, austrium, etc., but their properties, and in
         some cases their existence, have not yet been
         definitely established.

   3. One of the ultimate parts which are variously combined in
      anything; as, letters are the elements of written
      language; hence, also, a simple portion of that which is
      complex, as a shaft, lever, wheel, or any simple part in a
      machine; one of the essential ingredients of any mixture;
      a constituent part; as, quartz, feldspar, and mica are the
      elements of granite.

            The simplicity which is so large an element in a
            noble nature was laughed to scorn.    --Jowett

          element may be the infinitesimal portion between any
          two planes that are separated an indefinitely small
          distance. In the calculus, element is sometimes used
          as synonymous with differential.
      (b) Sometimes a curve, or surface, or volume is considered
          as described by a moving point, or curve, or surface,
          the latter being at any instant called an element of
          the former.
      (c) One of the terms in an algebraic expression.

   7. One of the necessary data or values upon which a system of
      calculations depends, or general conclusions are based;
      as, the elements of a planet's orbit.

   8. pl. The simplest or fundamental principles of any system
      in philosophy, science, or art; rudiments; as, the
      elements of geometry, or of music.

   9. pl. Any outline or sketch, regarded as containing the
      fundamental ideas or features of the thing in question;
      as, the elements of a plan.

   10. One of the simple substances, as supposed by the ancient
       philosophers; one of the imaginary principles of matter.
       (a) The four elements were, air, earth, water, and fire;

   Note: whence it is said, water is the proper element of
         fishes; air is the element of birds. Hence, the state
         or sphere natural to anything or suited for its
         existence.

               Of elements The grosser feeds the purer: Earth
               the Sea; Earth and the Sea feed Air; the Air
               those Fires Ethereal.              --Milton.

               Does not our life consist of the four elements?

   Syn: Sign; symbol; type; device; signal; token.

   Usage: {Sign}, {Emblem}, {Symbol}, {Type}. Sign is the
          generic word comprehending all significant
          representations. An emblem is a visible object
          representing another by a natural suggestion of
          characteristic qualities, or an habitual and
          recognized association; as, a circle, having no
          apparent beginning or end, is an emblem of eternity; a
          particular flag is the emblem of the country or ship
          which has adopted it for a sign and with which it is
          habitually associated. Between emblem and symbol the
          distinction is slight, and often one may be
          substituted for the other without impropriety. See
          {Symbol}. Thus, a circle is either an emblem or a
          symbol of eternity; a scepter, either an emblem or a
          symbol of authority; a lamb, either an emblem or a
          symbol of meekness. ``An emblem is always of something
          simple; a symbol may be of something complex, as of a
          transaction . . . In consequence we do not speak of
          actions emblematic.'' --C. J. Smith. A type is a
          representative example, or model, exhibiting the
          qualities common to all individuals of the class to
          which it belongs; as, the Monitor is a type of a class
          of war vessels.

   4. (Physics) Capacity for performing work.

   Note: The kinetic energy of a body is the energy it has in
         virtue of being in motion. It is measured by one half
         of the product of the mass of each element of the body
         multiplied by the square of the velocity of the
         element, relative to some given body or point. The
         available kinetic energy of a material system
         unconnected with any other system is that energy which
         is due to the motions of the parts of the system
         relative to its center of mass. The potential energy of
         a body or system is that energy which is not kinetic;
         -- energy due to configuration. Kinetic energy is
         sometimes called actual energy. Kinetic energy is
         exemplified in the vis viva of moving bodies, in heat,
         electric currents, etc.; potential energy, in a bent
         spring, or a body suspended a given distance above the
         earth and acted on by gravity.

         commonly recognized, the first period dates from about
         450 to 1150. This is the period of full inflection, and
         is called Anglo-Saxon, or, by many recent writers, Old
         English. The second period dates from about 1150 to
         1550 (or, if four periods be recognized, from about
         1150 to 1350), and is called Early English, Middle
         English, or more commonly (as in the usage of this
         book), Old English. During this period most of the
         inflections were dropped, and there was a great
         addition of French words to the language. The third
         period extends from about 1350 to 1550, and is Middle
         English. During this period orthography became
         comparatively fixed. The last period, from about 1550,
         is called Modern English.

   Syn: Huge; vast; immoderate; immense; excessive; prodigious;
        monstrous.

   Usage: -- {Enormous}, {Immense}, {Excessive}. We speak of a
          thing as enormous when it overpasses its ordinary law
          of existence or far exceeds its proper average or
          standard, and becomes -- so to speak -- abnormal in
          its magnitude, degree, etc.; as, a man of enormous
          strength; a deed of enormous wickedness. Immense
          expresses somewhat indefinitely an immeasurable
          quantity or extent. Excessive is applied to what is
          beyond a just measure or amount, and is always used in
          an evil; as, enormous size; an enormous crime; an
          immense expenditure; the expanse of ocean is immense.

   Usage: The name epithet was formerly extended to nouns which
          give a title or describe character (as the ``epithet
          of liar''), but is now confined wholly to adjectives.
          Some rhetoricians, as Whately, restrict it still
          further, considering the term epithet as belonging
          only to a limited class of adjectives, viz., those
          which add nothing to the sense of their noun, but
          simply hold forth some quality necessarily implied
          therein; as, the bright sun, the lofty heavens, etc.
          But this restriction does not prevail in general
          literature. Epithet is sometimes confounded with
          application, which is always a noun or its equivalent.

                                                  --Macaulay.

   Note: Equitable jurisprudence in England and in the United
         States grew up from the inadequacy of common-law forms
         to secure justice in all cases; and this led to
         distinct courts by which equity was applied in the way
         of injunctions, bills of discovery, bills for specified
         performance, and other processes by which the merits of
         a case could be reached more summarily or more
         effectively than by common-law suits. By the recent
         English Judicature Act (1873), however, the English
         judges are bound to give effect, in common-law suits,
         to all equitable rights and remedies; and when the
         rules of equity and of common law, in any particular
         case, conflict, the rules of equity are to prevail. In
         many jurisdictions in the United States, equity and
         common law are thus blended; in others distinct equity
         tribunals are still maintained. See {Chancery}.

   {Equity of redemption} (Law), the advantage, allowed to a
      mortgageor, of a certain or reasonable time to redeem

            Protestants were entitled to some equivalent. . . .
            During some weeks the word equivalent, then lately
            imported from France, was in the mouths of all the
            coffeehouse.                          --Macaulay.

   2. (Chem.) That comparative quantity by weight of an element
      which possesses the same chemical value as other elements,
      as determined by actual experiment and reference to the
      same standard. Specifically:
      (a) The comparative proportions by which one element
          replaces another in any particular compound; thus, as
          zinc replaces hydrogen in hydrochloric acid, their
          equivalents are 32.5 and 1.
      (b) The combining proportion by weight of a substance, or
          the number expressing this proportion, in any
          particular compound; as, the equivalents of hydrogen
          and oxygen in water are respectively 1 and 8, and in
          hydric dioxide 1 and 16.



   Note: This term was adopted by Wollaston to avoid using the
         conjectural expression atomic weight, with which,
         however, for a time it was practically synonymous. The
         attempt to limit the term to the meaning of a
         universally comparative combining weight failed,
         because of the possibility of several compounds of the
         substances by reason of the variation in combining
         power which most elements exhibit. The equivalent was
         really identical with, or a multiple of submultiple of,
         the atomic weight.

   3. (Chem.) A combining unit, whether an atom, a radical, or a
      molecule; as, in acid salt two or more equivalents of acid

   {Mechanical equivalent of heat} (Physics), the number of
      units of work which the unit of heat can perform; the
      mechanical energy which must be expended to raise the
      temperature of a unit weight of water from 0[deg] C. to
      1[deg] C., or from 32[deg] F. to 33[deg] F. The term was
      introduced by Dr. Mayer of Heilbronn. Its value was found
      by Joule to be 1390 foot pounds upon the Centigrade, or
      772 foot pounds upon the Fahrenheit, thermometric scale,
      whence it is often called {Joule's equivalent}, and
      represented by the symbol J. This is equal to 424 kilogram
      meters (Centigrade scale). A more recent determination by
      Professor Rowland gives the value 426.9 kilogram meters,
      for the latitude of Baltimore.

   {Equivocal chord} (Mus.), a chord which can be resolved into

   Syn: Ambiguous; doubtful; uncertain; indeterminate.

   Usage: {Equivocal}, {Ambiguous}. We call an expression
          ambiguous when it has one general meaning, and yet
          contains certain words which may be taken in two
          different senses; or certain clauses which can be so
          connected with other clauses as to divide the mind
          between different views of part of the meaning
          intended. We call an expression equivocal when, taken
          as a whole, it conveys a given thought with perfect
          clearness and propriety, and also another thought with
          equal propriety and clearness. Such were the responses
          often given by the Delphic oracle; as that to Cr?sus
          when consulting about a war with Persia: ``If you
          cross the Halys, you will destroy a great empire.''
          This he applied to the Persian empire, which lay
          beyond that river, and, having crossed, destroyed his
          own, empire in the conflict. What is ambiguous is a
          mere blunder of language; what is equivocal is usually
          intended to deceive, though it may occur at times from
          mere inadvertence. Equivocation is applied only to
          cases where there is a design to deceive.

      at each vibration.

   Note: Escapements are of several kinds, as the vertical, or
         verge, or crown, escapement, formerly used in watches,
         in which two pallets on the balance arbor engage with a
         crown wheel; the anchor escapement, in which an

         cylinder on the balance arbor to control the escape
         wheel; the duplex escapement, having two sets of teeth
         on the wheel; the lever escapement, which is a kind of
         detached escapement, because the pallets are on a lever
         so arranged that the balance which vibrates it is
         detached during the greater part of its vibration and
         thus swings more freely; the detent escapement, used in
         chronometers; the remontoir escapement, in which the
         escape wheel is driven by an independent spring or

         sometimes used in astronomical clocks. When the shape
         of an escape-wheel tooth is such that it falls dead on
         the pallet without recoil, it forms a deadbeat
         escapement.

   vb. n. {Estimating}.] [L. aestimatus, p. p. of aestimare. See
   {Esteem}, v. t.]
   1. To judge and form an opinion of the value of, from
      imperfect data, -- either the extrinsic (money), or
      intrinsic (moral), value; to fix the worth of roughly or
      in a general way; as, to estimate the value of goods or
      land; to estimate the worth or talents of a person.

            It is by the weight of silver, and not the name of
            the piece, that men estimate commodities and
            exchange them.                        --Locke.

            It is always very difficult to estimate the age in
            which you are living.                 --J. C.
                                                  Shairp.

   2. To from an opinion of, as to amount,, number, etc., from
      imperfect data, comparison, or experience; to make an
      estimate of; to calculate roughly; to rate; as, to
      estimate the cost of a trip, the number of feet in a piece
      of land.

   Syn: To appreciate; value; appraise; prize; rate; esteem;
        count; calculate; number. -- To {Estimate}, {Esteem}.
        Both these words imply an exercise of the judgment.
        Estimate has reference especially to the external
        relations of things, such as amount, magnitude,
        importance, etc. It usually involves computation or
        calculation; as, to estimate the loss or gain of an
        enterprise. Esteem has reference to the intrinsic or
        moral worth of a person or thing. Thus, we esteem a man
        for his kindness, or his uniform integrity. In this
        sense it implies a mingled sentiment of respect and
        attachment. We esteem it an honor to live in a free
        country. See {Appreciate}.

Estimate \Es"ti*mate\, n.
   A valuing or rating by the mind, without actually measuring,
   weighing, or the like; rough or approximate calculation; as,
   an estimate of the cost of a building, or of the quantity of
   water in a pond.

         Weigh success in a moral balance, and our whole
         estimate is changed.                     --J. C.
                                                  Shairp.

   Syn: {Estimate}, {Estimation}, {Esteem}.

   Usage: The noun estimate, like its verb, supposes chiefly an
          exercise of judgment in determining the amount,
          importance, or magnitude of things, with their other
          exterior relations; as, an estimate of expenses
          incurred; a true estimate of life, etc. Esteem is a
          moral sentiment made up of respect and attachment, --
          the valuation of a person as possessing useful
          qualities or real worth. Thus we speak of the esteem
          of the wise and good as a thing greatly to be desired.
          Estimation seems to waver between the two. In our
          version of the Scriptures it is used simply for
          estimate; as, ``If he be poorer than thy estimation.''
          --Lev. xxvii. 8. In other cases, it verges toward
          esteem; as, ``I know him to be of worth and worthy
          estimation.'' --Shak. It will probably settle down at
          last on this latter sense. ``Esteem is the value we
          place upon some degree of worth. It is higher than
          simple approbation, which is a decision of judgment.
          It is the commencement of affection.'' --Gogan.

                No; dear as freedom is, and in my heart's Just
                estimation prized above all price. --Cowper.

Estimation \Es`ti*ma"tion\, n. [L. aestimatio, fr. aestimare:
   cf. F. estimation. See {Esteem}, v. t.]
   1. The act of estimating. --Shak.

   2. An opinion or judgment of the worth, extent, or quantity
      of anything, formed without using precise data; valuation;
      as, estimations of distance, magnitude, amount, or moral
      qualities.

            If he be poorer that thy estimation, then he shall
            present himself before the priest, and the priest,
            and the priest shall value him.       --Lev. xxvii.
                                                  8.

   3. Favorable opinion; esteem; regard; honor.

            I shall have estimation among multitude, and honor
            with the elders.                      --Wisdom viii.
                                                  10.

   4. Supposition; conjecture.

            I speak not this in estimation, As what I think
            might be, but what I know.            --Shak.

   Syn: Encomium; praise; panegyric; applause.

   Usage: {Eulogy}, {Eulogium}, {Encomium}, {Panegyric}. The
          idea of praise is common to all these words. The word
          encomium is used of both persons and things which are
          the result of human action, and denotes warm praise.
          Eulogium and eulogy apply only to persons and are more
          studied and of greater length. A panegyric was
          originally a set speech in a full assembly of the
          people, and hence denotes a more formal eulogy,
          couched in terms of warm and continuous praise,
          especially as to personal character. We may bestow
          encomiums on any work of art, on production of genius,
          without reference to the performer; we bestow
          eulogies, or pronounce a eulogium, upon some
          individual distinguished for his merit public
          services; we pronounce a panegyric before an assembly
          gathered for the occasion.

   Syn: Incident; occurrence; adventure; issue; result;
        termination; consequence; conclusion.

   Usage: {Event}, {Occurrence}, {Incident}, {Circumstance}. An
          event denotes that which arises from a preceding state
          of things. Hence we speak or watching the event; of
          tracing the progress of events. An occurrence has no
          reference to any antecedents, but simply marks that
          which meets us in our progress through life, as if by
          chance, or in the course of divine providence. The
          things which thus meet us, if important, are usually
          connected with antecedents; and hence event is the
          leading term. In the ``Declaration of Independence''
          it is said, ``When, in the cource of human events, it
          becomes necessary.'' etc. Here, occurrences would be
          out of place. An incident is that which falls into a
          state of things to which is does not primarily belong;
          as, the incidents of a journey. The term is usually
          applied to things of secondary importance. A
          circumstance is one of the things surrounding us in
          our path of life. These may differ greatly in
          importance; but they are always outsiders, which
          operate upon us from without, exerting greater or less
          influence according to their intrinsic importance. A
          person giving an account of a campaign might dwell on
          the leading events which it produced; might mention
          some of its striking occurrences; might allude to some
          remarkable incidents which attended it; and might give
          the details of the favorable or adverse circumstances
          which marked its progress.

   Syn: Precedent; case; instance.

   Usage: {Example}, {Instance}. The discrimination to be made
          between these two words relates to cases in which we
          give ``instances'' or ``examples'' of things done. An
          instance denotes the single case then ``standing''
          before us; if there be others like it, the word does
          not express this fact. On the contrary, an example is
          one of an entire class of like things, and should be a
          true representative or sample of that class. Hence, an
          example proves a rule or regular course of things; an
          instance simply points out what may be true only in
          the case presented. A man's life may be filled up with
          examples of the self-command and kindness which marked
          his character, and may present only a solitary
          instance of haste or severity. Hence, the word
          ``example'' should never be used to describe what
          stands singly and alone. We do, however, sometimes
          apply the word instance to what is really an example,
          because we are not thinking of the latter under this
          aspect, but solely as a case which ``stands before
          us.'' See {Precedent}.

Example \Ex*am"ple\, v. t. [imp. & p. p. {Exampled}; p. pr. &
   vb. n. {Exampling}.]

   to give an instance of; to instance. [Obs.] ``I may example
   my digression by some mighty precedent.'' --Shak.

   Syn: {Except}, {Excepting}, {But}, {Save}, {Besides}.

   Usage: Excepting, except, but, and save are exclusive. Except
          marks exclusion more pointedly. ``I have finished all
          the letters except one,'' is more marked than ``I have
          finished all the letters but one.'' Excepting is the
          same as except, but less used. Save is chiefly found
          in poetry. Besides (lit., by the side of) is in the
          nature of addition. ``There is no one here except or
          but him,'' means, take him away and there is nobody
          present. ``There is nobody here besides him,'' means,
          hi is present and by the side of, or in addition to,
          him is nobody. ``Few ladies, except her Majesty, could
          have made themselves heard.'' In this example, besides
          should be used, not except.

Except \Ex*cept"\, conj.

      called foreign bills; or they may be drawn and made
      payable in the same country, in which case they are called
      inland bills. The term bill of exchange is often

   Note: A in London is creditor to B in New York, and C in
         London owes D in New York a like sum. A in London draws

      for the rise and fall of exchange that is affected by the
      demand and supply. Exchange is at par when, for example, a
      bill in New York, for the payment of one hundred pounds
      sterling in London, can be purchased for the sum. Exchange
      is in favor of a place when it can be purchased there at
      or above par.

   1. One of the superior courts of law; -- so called from a
      checkered cloth, which covers, or formerly covered, the

   Note: The exchequer was a court of law and equity. In the
         revenue department, it had jurisdiction over the
         proprietary rights of the crown against subjects; in
         the common law department, it administered justice in
         personal actions between subject and subject. A person
         proceeding against another in the revenue department
         was said to exchequer him. The judges of this court
         were one chief and four puisne barons, so styled. The
         Court of Exchequer Chamber sat as court of error in
         which the judgments of each of the superior courts of
         common law, in England, were subject to revision by the
         judges of the other two sitting collectively. Causes
         involving difficult questions of law were sometimes
         after argument, adjourned into this court from the
         other courts, for debate before judgment in the court
         below. Recent legislation in England (1880) has
         abolished the Court of Exchequer and the Court of
         Exchequer Chamber, as distinct tribunals, a single
         board of judiciary, the High Court of Justice, being
         established for the trial of all classes of civil
         cases. --Wharton.

   2. The department of state having charge of the collection

         it are attached, and which in front changes into the
         transparent cornea. A little way back of cornea, the
         crystalline lens is suspended, dividing the eye into
         two unequal cavities, a smaller one in front filled
         with a watery fluid, the aqueous humor, and larger one
         behind filled with a clear jelly, the vitreous humor.
         The sclerotic is lined with a highly pigmented
         membrane, the choroid, and this is turn is lined in the
         back half of the eyeball with the nearly transparent
         retina, in which the fibers of the optic nerve ramify.
         The choroid in front is continuous with the iris, which
         has a contractile opening in the center, the pupil,
         admitting light to the lens which brings the rays to a
         focus and forms an image upon the retina, where the
         light, falling upon delicate structures called rods and
         cones, causes them to stimulate the fibres of the optic
         nerve to transmit visual impressions to the brain.
