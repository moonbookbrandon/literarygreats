M \M\ ([e^]m).
   1. M, the thirteenth letter of the English alphabet, is a
      vocal consonant, and from the manner of its formation, is
      called the labio-nasal consonant. See Guide to
      Pronunciation, [sect][sect] 178-180, 242.

   Note: The letter M came into English from the Greek, through
         the Latin, the form of the Greek letter being further
         derived from the Ph[oe]nician, and ultimately, it is
         believed, from the Egyptian. Etymologically M is
         related to n, in lime, linden; emmet, ant; also to b. M
         is readily followed by b and p. the position of the
         lips in the formation of both letters being the same.
         The relation of b and m is the same as that of d and t
         to n. and that of g and k to ng.

      and Latin.

   ill, evil, prob. orig., dirty, black; cf. Gr. ? black, Skr.
   mala dirt. Cf. {Mauger}.]
   1. Enmity of heart; malevolence; ill will; a spirit
      delighting in harm or misfortune to another; a disposition
      to injure another; a malignant design of evil. ``Nor set
      down aught in malice.'' --Shak.

            Envy, hatred, and malice are three distinct passions
            of the mind.                          --Ld. Holt.

   2. (Law) Any wicked or mischievous intention of the mind; a

      deliberately entertained.

   Syn: Spite; ill will; malevolence; grudge; pique; bitterness;
        animosity; malignity; maliciousness; rancor; virulence.

   Usage: See {Spite}. -- {Malevolence}, {Malignity},
          {Malignancy}. Malice is a stronger word than
          malevolence, which may imply only a desire that evil
          may befall another, while malice desires, and perhaps
          intends, to bring it about. Malignity is intense and
          deepseated malice. It implies a natural delight in
          hating and wronging others. One who is malignant must
          be both malevolent and malicious; but a man may be
          malicious without being malignant.

                Proud tyrants who maliciously destroy And ride
                o'er ruins with malignant joy.    --Somerville.

                in some connections, malignity seems rather more
                pertinently applied to a radical depravity of
                nature, and malignancy to indications of this
                depravity, in temper and conduct in particular
                instances.                        --Cogan.

   6. (Physics) The quantity of matter which a body contains,
      irrespective of its bulk or volume.

   Note: Mass and weight are often used, in a general way, as
         interchangeable terms, since the weight of a body is
         proportional to its mass (under the same or equal
         gravitative forces), and the mass is usually
         ascertained from the weight. Yet the two ideas, mass
         and weight, are quite distinct. Mass is the quantity of
         matter in a body; weight is the comparative force with
         which it tends towards the center of the earth. A mass
         of sugar and a mass of lead are assumed to be equal
         when they show an equal weight by balancing each other
         in the scales.

         called also {hydrostatics}, or {hydrodynamics},
         according as the laws of rest or of motion are
         considered. The mechanics of gaseous bodies is called
         also {pneumatics}. The mechanics of fluids in motion,
         with special reference to the methods of obtaining from
         them useful results, constitutes {hydraulics}.

   {Animal mechanics} (Physiol.), that portion of physiology
      which has for its object the investigation of the laws of
      equilibrium and motion in the animal body. The most
      important mechanical principle is that of the lever, the

      muscles the power, the joints the fulcra or points of
      support, while the weight of the body or of the individual
      limbs constitutes the weight or resistance.

   {Applied mechanics}, the principles of abstract mechanics
      applied to human art; also, the practical application of
      the laws of matter and motion to the construction of
      machines and structures of all kinds.

   Syn: {Memory}, {Remembrance}, {Recollection}, {Reminiscence}.

   Usage: Memory is the generic term, denoting the power by
          which we reproduce past impressions. Remembrance is an
          exercise of that power when things occur spontaneously
          to our thoughts. In recollection we make a distinct
          effort to collect again, or call back, what we know
          has been formerly in the mind. Reminiscence is
          intermediate between remembrance and recollection,
          being a conscious process of recalling past
          occurrences, but without that full and varied
          reference to particular things which characterizes
          recollection. ``When an idea again recurs without the
          operation of the like object on the external sensory,
          it is remembrance; if it be sought after by the mind,
          and with pain and endeavor found, and brought again
          into view, it is recollection.'' --Locke.

   first used by the followers of Aristotle as a name for that
   part of his writings which came after, or followed, the part
   which treated of physics.]
   1. The science of real as distinguished from phenomenal
      being; ontology; also, the science of being, with
      reference to its abstract and universal conditions, as
      distinguished from the science of determined or concrete
      being; the science of the conceptions and relations which
      are necessarily implied as true of every kind of being;
      phylosophy in general; first principles, or the science of
      first principles.

   Note: Metaphysics is distinguished as general and special.
         {General metaphysics} is the science of all being as
         being. {Special metaphysics} is the science of one kind
         of being; as, the metaphysics of chemistry, of morals,
         or of politics. According to Kant, a systematic
         exposition of those notions and truths, the knowledge
         of which is altogether independent of experience, would
         constitute the science of metaphysics.

               Commonly, in the schools, called metaphysics, as
               being part of the philosophy of Aristotle, which
               hath that for title; but it is in another sense:
               for there it signifieth as much as ``books
               written or placed after his natural philosophy.''
               But the schools take them for ``books of
               supernatural philosophy;'' for the word
               metaphysic will bear both these senses. --Hobbes.

               Now the science conversant about all such
               inferences of unknown being from its known
               manifestations, is called ontology, or
               metaphysics proper.                --Sir W.
                                                  Hamilton.

               Metaphysics are [is] the science which determines
               what can and what can not be known of being, and
               the laws of being, a priori.       --Coleridge.

   2. Hence: The scientific knowledge of mental phenomena;
      mental philosophy; psychology.

            Metaphysics, in whatever latitude the term be taken,
            is a science or complement of sciences exclusively
            occupied with mind.                   --Sir W.
                                                  Hamilton.

            help Our physics.                     --Mrs.

   Syn: Maternal; paternal.

   Usage: {Motherly}, {Maternal}. Motherly, being Anglo-Saxon,
          is the most familiar word of the two when both have

          whereas motherly has a secondary sense, denoting a
          care like that of a mother for her offspring. There
          is, perhaps, a growing tendency thus to separate the
          two, confining motherly to the latter signification.

          care in cherishing her brethren whilst young.'' --Sir

      multiple of 3 and 4. The

   {least common multiple} is the least number that will do
      this; thus, 12 is the least common multiple of 3 and 4.

   2. (Math.) The process of repeating, or adding to itself, any
      given number or quantity a certain number of times;
      commonly, the process of ascertaining by a briefer
      computation the result of such repeated additions; also,
      the rule by which the operation is performed; -- the
      reverse of division.

   Note: The word multiplication is sometimes used in
         mathematics, particularly in multiple algebra, to
         denote any distributive operation expressed by one
         symbol upon any quantity or any thing expressed by
         another symbol. Corresponding extensions of meaning are
         given to the words multiply, multiplier, multiplicand,
         and product. Thus, since [phi](x + y) = [phi]x + [phi]y
         (see under {Distributive}), where [phi](x + y), [phi]x,
         and [phi]y indicate the results of any distributive
         operation represented by the symbol [phi] upon x + y,
         x, and y, severally, then because of many very useful
         analogies [phi](x + y) is called the product of [phi]
         and x + y, and the operation indicated by [phi] is
         called multiplication. Cf. {Facient}, n., 2.

   3. (Bot.) An increase above the normal number of parts,
      especially of petals; augmentation.

   4. The art of increasing gold or silver by magic, --

         striated muscles, which, in most of the higher animals,
         constitute the principal part of the flesh, exclusive
         of the fat, are mostly under the control of the will,
         or voluntary, and are made up of great numbers of
         elongated fibres bound together into bundles and
         inclosed in a sheath of connective tissue, the
         perimysium. Each fiber is inclosed in a delicate
         membrane (the sarcolemma), is made up of alternate
         segments of lighter and darker material which give it a
         transversely striated appearance, and contains,
         scattered through its substance, protoplasmic nuclei,
         the so-called muscle corpuscles. The nonstriated
         muscles are involuntary. They constitute a large part
         of the walls of the alimentary canal, blood vessels,
         uterus, and bladder, and are found also in the iris,

   Syn: Silent; dumb; speechless.

          with most of those who never speak from childhood;
          they are not ordinarily dumb, but mute because they
          are deaf, and therefore never learn to talk; and hence
          their more appropriate name is deaf-mutes.

                or breathing stones, Gazed each on other.
