B \B\ (b[=e])
   is the second letter of the English alphabet. (See Guide to
   Pronunciation, [sect][sect] 196, 220.) It is etymologically
   related to p, v, f, w and m, letters representing sounds
   having a close organic affinity to its own sound; as in Eng.
   bursar and purser; Eng. bear and Lat. ferre; Eng. silver and
   Ger. silber; Lat. cubitum and It. gomito; Eng. seven,
   Anglo-Saxon seofon, Ger. sieben, Lat. septem, Gr."epta`,
   Sanskrit saptan. The form of letter B is Roman, from Greek B
   (Beta), of Semitic origin. The small b was formed by gradual
   change from the capital B.

   Note: In Music, B is the nominal of the seventh tone in the
         model major scale (the scale of C major ), or of the
         second tone in it's relative minor scale (that of A
         minor ) . B[flat] stands for B flat, the tone a half
         step, or semitone, lower than B. In German, B stands
         for our B[flat], while our B natural is called H
         (pronounced h["a]).

         balanced by the weight of the atmosphere, and its rise
         or fall under varying conditions is a measure of the
         change in the atmospheric pressure. At the sea level

   Note: In the trough battery, copper and zinc plates,
         connected in pairs, divide the trough into cells, which
         are filled with an acid or oxidizing liquid; the effect
         is exhibited when wires connected with the two
         end-plates are brought together. In Daniell's battery,
         the metals are zinc and copper, the former in dilute
         sulphuric acid, or a solution of sulphate of zinc, the
         latter in a saturated solution of sulphate of copper. A
         modification of this is the common gravity battery, so
         called from the automatic action of the two fluids,
         which are separated by their specific gravities. In
         Grove's battery, platinum is the metal used with zinc;
         two fluids are used, one of them in a porous cell
         surrounded by the other. In Bunsen's or the carbon
         battery, the carbon of gas coke is substituted for the
         platinum of Grove's. In Leclanch['e]'s battery, the
         elements are zinc in a solution of ammonium chloride,
         and gas carbon surrounded with manganese dioxide in a
         porous cell. A secondary battery is a battery which
         usually has the two plates of the same kind, generally
         of lead, in dilute sulphuric acid, and which, when
         traversed by an electric current, becomes charged, and
         is then capable of giving a current of itself for a
         time, owing to chemical changes produced by the
         charging current. A storage battery is a kind of
         secondary battery used for accumulating and storing the
         energy of electrical charges or currents, usually by
         means of chemical work done by them; an accumulator.

   Syn: Conflict; encounter; contest; action.

   Usage: {Battle}, {Combat}, {Fight}, {Engagement}. These words
          agree in denoting a close encounter between contending
          parties. Fight is a word of less dignity than the
          others. Except in poetry, it is more naturally applied
          to the encounter of a few individuals, and more
          commonly an accidental one; as, a street fight. A
          combat is a close encounter, whether between few or
          many, and is usually premeditated. A battle is
          commonly more general and prolonged. An engagement
          supposes large numbers on each side, engaged or
          intermingled in the conflict.

Be \Be\, v. i. [imp. {Was}; p. p. {Been}; p. pr. & vb. n.
   {Being}.] [OE. been, beon, AS. be['o]n to be, be['o]m I am;
   akin to OHG. bim, pim, G. bin, I am, Gael. & Ir. bu was, W.
   bod to be, Lith. bu-ti, O. Slav. by-ti, to be, L. fu-i I have
   been, fu-turus about to be, fo-re to be about to be, and perh
   to fieri to become, Gr. ? to be born, to be, Skr. bh? to be.
   This verb is defective, and the parts lacking are supplied by
   verbs from other roots, is, was, which have no radical
   connection with be. The various forms, am, are, is, was,
   were, etc., are considered grammatically as parts of the verb
   ``to be'', which, with its conjugational forms, is often
   called the substantive verb. ?97. Cf. {Future}, {Physic}.]
   1. To exist actually, or in the world of fact; to have
      ex?stence.

            To be contents his natural desire.    --Pope.

            To be, or not to be: that is the question. --Shak.

   2. To exist in a certain manner or relation, -- whether as a
      reality or as a product of thought; to exist as the
      subject of a certain predicate, that is, as having a
      certain attribute, or as belonging to a certain sort, or
      as identical with what is specified, -- a word or words
      for the predicate being annexed; as, to be happy; to be
      here; to be large, or strong; to be an animal; to be a
      hero; to be a nonentity; three and two are five;
      annihilation is the cessation of existence; that is the
      man.

   3. To take place; to happen; as, the meeting was on Thursday.

   4. To signify; to represent or symbolize; to answer to.

            The field is the world.               --Matt. xiii.
                                                  38.

            The seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the
            seven churches.                       --Rev. i. 20.

   Note: The verb to be (including the forms is, was, etc.) is
         used in forming the passive voice of other verbs; as,
         John has been struck by James. It is also used with the
         past participle of many intransitive verbs to express a
         state of the subject. But have is now more commonly
         used as the auxiliary, though expressing a different
         sense; as, ``Ye have come too late -- but ye are come.
         '' ``The minstrel boy to the war is gone.'' The present
         and imperfect tenses form, with the infinitive, a
         particular future tense, which expresses necessity,
         duty, or purpose; as, government is to be supported; we
         are to pay our just debts; the deed is to be signed
         to-morrow.

   Note: Have or had been, followed by to, implies movement. ``I
         have been to Paris.'' --Sydney Smith. ``Have you been
         to Franchard ?'' --R. L. Stevenson.

   Note: Been, or ben, was anciently the plural of the
         indicative present. ``Ye ben light of the world.''
         --Wyclif, Matt. v. 14. Afterwards be was used, as in
         our Bible: ``They that be with us are more than they
         that be with them.'' --2 Kings vi. 16. Ben was also the
         old infinitive: ``To ben of such power.'' --R. of
         Gloucester. Be is used as a form of the present
         subjunctive: ``But if it be a question of words and
         names.'' --Acts xviii. 15. But the indicative forms, is
         and are, with if, are more commonly used.

   {Be it so}, a phrase of supposition, equivalent to suppose it
      to be so; or of permission, signifying let it be so.
      --Shak.

   {If so be}, in case.

   {To be from}, to have come from; as, from what place are you
      ? I am from Chicago.

   {To let be}, to omit, or leave untouched; to let alone. ``Let
      be, therefore, my vengeance to dissuade.'' --Spenser.

   Syn: {To be}, {Exist}.

   Usage: The verb to be, except in a few rare case, like that
          of Shakespeare's ``To be, or not to be'', is used
          simply as a copula, to connect a subject with its
          predicate; as, man is mortal; the soul is immortal.
          The verb to exist is never properly used as a mere
          copula, but points to things that stand forth, or have
          a substantive being; as, when the soul is freed from
          all corporeal alliance, then it truly exists. It is
          not, therefore, properly synonymous with to be when
          used as a copula, though occasionally made so by some
          writers for the sake of variety; as in the phrase
          ``there exists [is] no reason for laying new taxes.''
          We may, indeed, say, ``a friendship has long existed
          between them,'' instead of saying, ``there has long
          been a friendship between them;'' but in this case,
          exist is not a mere copula. It is used in its
          appropriate sense to mark the friendship as having
          been long in existence.

Be- \Be-\ [AS. be, and in accented form b[=i], akin to OS. be
   and b[=i], OHG. bi, pi, and p[=i], MHG. be and b[=i], G. be
   and bei, Goth. bi, and perh. Gr. ? about (cf. AS. bese['o]n
   to look about). [root]203. Cf. {By}, {Amb-}.]
   A prefix, originally the same word as by; joined with verbs,
   it serves:
   (a) To intensify the meaning; as, bespatter, bestir.
   (b) To render an intransitive verb transitive; as, befall (to
       fall upon); bespeak (to speak for).
   (c) To make the action of a verb particular or definite; as,
       beget (to get as offspring); beset (to set around).

   Note: It is joined with certain substantives, and a few
         adjectives, to form verbs; as, bedew, befriend,
         benight, besot; belate (to make late); belittle (to
         make little). It also occurs in certain nouns, adverbs,
         and prepositions, often with something of the force of
         the preposition by, or about; as, belief (believe),
         behalf, bequest (bequeath); because, before, beneath,
         beside, between. In some words the original force of be
         is obscured or lost; as, in become, begin, behave,
         behoove, belong.

   Syn: {Because}, {For}, {Since}, {As}, {Inasmuch As}.

   Usage: These particles are used, in certain connections, to
          assign the reason of a thing, or that ``on account
          of'' which it is or takes place. Because (by cause) is
          the strongest and most emphatic; as, I hid myself

          in Shakespeare, ``I hate him, for he is a Christian.''
          Since is less formal and more incidental than because;
          as, I will do it since you request me. It more
          commonly begins a sentence; as, Since your decision is
          made, I will say no more. As is still more incidental
          than since, and points to some existing fact by way of
          assigning a reason. Thus we say, as I knew him to be
          out of town, I did not call. Inasmuch as seems to
          carry with it a kind of qualification which does not
          belong to the rest. Thus, if we say, I am ready to
          accept your proposal, inasmuch as I believe it is the
          best you can offer, we mean, it is only with this
          understanding that we can accept it.

   Syn: To {Beg}, {Ask}, {Request}.

   Usage: To ask (not in the sense of inquiring) is the generic
          term which embraces all these words. To request is
          only a polite mode of asking. To beg, in its original
          sense, was to ask with earnestness, and implied
          submission, or at least deference. At present,
          however, in polite life, beg has dropped its original
          meaning, and has taken the place of both ask and
          request, on the ground of its expressing more of
          deference and respect. Thus, we beg a person's
          acceptance of a present; we beg him to favor us with
          his company; a tradesman begs to announce the arrival
          of new goods, etc. Crabb remarks that, according to
          present usage, ``we can never talk of asking a
          person's acceptance of a thing, or of asking him to do
          us a favor.'' This can be more truly said of usage in
          England than in America.

   Note: Being was formerly used where we now use having.
         ``Being to go to a ball in a few days.'' --Miss
         Edgeworth.

   Note: In modern usage, is, are, was or were being, with a
         past participle following (as built, made, etc.)
         indicates the process toward the completed result
         expressed by the participle. The form is or was
         building, in this passive signification, is idiomatic,
         and, if free from ambiguity, is commonly preferable to
         the modern is or was being built. The last form of
         speech is, however, sufficiently authorized by approved
         writers. The older expression was is, or was,
         a-building or in building.

   Syn: {Benevolence}, {Beneficence}, {Munificence}.

   Usage: Benevolence marks a disposition made up of a choice
          and desire for the happiness of others. Beneficence
          marks the working of this disposition in dispensing
          good on a somewhat broad scale. Munificence shows the
          same disposition, but acting on a still broader scale,
          in conferring gifts and favors. These are not
          necessarily confined to objects of immediate utility.
          One may show his munificence in presents of pictures
          or jewelry, but this would not be beneficence.
          Benevolence of heart; beneficence of life; munificence
          in the encouragement of letters.

Benevolent \Be*nev"o*lent\, a. [L. benevolens, -entis; bene well
   (adv. of bonus good) + volens, p. pr. of volo I will, I wish.
   See {Bounty}, and {Voluntary}.]
   Having a disposition to do good; possessing or manifesting
   love to mankind, and a desire to promote their prosperity and
   happiness; disposed to give to good objects; kind;
   charitable. -- {Be*nev"o*lent*ly}, adv.

   Syn: {Benevolent}, {Beneficent}.

   Usage: Etymologically considered, benevolent implies wishing
          well to others, and beneficent, doing well. But by
          degrees the word benevolent has been widened to
          include not only feelings, but actions; thus, we speak
          of benevolent operations, benevolent labors for the
          public good, benevolent societies. In like manner,
          beneficent is now often applied to feelings; thus, we
          speak of the beneficent intentions of a donor. This
          extension of the terms enables us to mark nicer shades
          of meaning. Thus, the phrase ``benevolent labors''
          turns attention to the source of these labors, viz.,
          benevolent feeling; while beneficent would simply mark
          them as productive of good. So, ``beneficent
          intentions'' point to the feelings of the donor as
          bent upon some specific good act; while ``benevolent
          intentions'' would only denote a general wish and
          design to do good.

   Usage: {Bent}, {Bias}, {Inclination}, {Prepossession}. These
          words agree in describing a permanent influence upon
          the mind which tends to decide its actions. Bent
          denotes a fixed tendency of the mind in a given
          direction. It is the widest of these terms, and
          applies to the will, the intellect, and the
          affections, taken conjointly; as, the whole bent of
          his character was toward evil practices. Bias is
          literally a weight fixed on one side of a ball used in
          bowling, and causing it to swerve from a straight
          course. Used figuratively, bias applies particularly
          to the judgment, and denotes something which acts with
          a permanent force on the character through that
          faculty; as, the bias of early education, early
          habits, etc. Inclination is an excited state of desire
          or appetency; as, a strong inclination to the study of
          the law. Prepossession is a mingled state of feeling
          and opinion in respect to some person or subject,
          which has laid hold of and occupied the mind previous
          to inquiry. The word is commonly used in a good sense,
          an unfavorable impression of this kind being
          denominated a prejudice. ``Strong minds will be
          strongly bent, and usually labor under a strong bias;
          but there is no mind so weak and powerless as not to
          have its inclinations, and none so guarded as to be
          without its prepossessions.'' --Crabb.

   Syn: To {Bequeath}, {Devise}.

   Usage: Both these words denote the giving or disposing of

          used to denote a gift by will of real property, and he
          to whom it is given is called the devisee. Bequeath is
          properly applied to a gift by will or legacy; i. e.,
          of personal property; the gift is called a legacy, and
          he who receives it is called a legatee. In popular
          usage the word bequeath is sometimes enlarged so as to
          embrace devise; and it is sometimes so construed by
          courts.

            But Eve . . . besought his peace.     --Milton.

   Syn: To beg; to crave.

   Usage: {To Beseech}, {Entreat}, {Solicit}, {Implore},
          {Supplicate}. These words agree in marking that sense
          of want which leads men to beg some favor. To solicit
          is to make a request, with some degree of earnestness
          and repetition, of one whom we address as a superior.
          To entreat implies greater urgency, usually enforced
          by adducing reasons or arguments. To beseech is still
          stronger, and belongs rather to the language of poetry
          and imagination. To implore denotes increased fervor
          of entreaty, as addressed either to equals or
          superiors. To supplicate expresses the extreme of
          entreaty, and usually implies a state of deep
          humiliation. Thus, a captive supplicates a conqueror
          to spare his life. Men solicit by virtue of their
          interest with another; they entreat in the use of
          reasoning and strong representations; they beseech
          with importunate earnestness; they implore from a
          sense of overwhelming distress; they supplicate with a
          feeling of the most absolute inferiority and
          dependence.

   n. {Beseeming}.] [Pref. be- + seem.]

   (one) to do or to have. Hence: To be fit, suitable, or proper
   for, or worthy of; to become; to befit.

         A duty well beseeming the preachers.     --Clarendon.

   Usage: These words, whether used as prepositions or adverbs,
          have been considered strictly synonymous, from an
          early period of our literature, and have been freely
          interchanged by our best writers. There is, however, a
          tendency, in present usage, to make the following
          distinction between them: 1. That beside be used only
          and always as a preposition, with the original meaning
          ``by the side of; '' as, to sit beside a fountain; or
          with the closely allied meaning ``aside from'',
          ``apart from'', or ``out of''; as, this is beside our
          present purpose; to be beside one's self with joy. The
          adverbial sense to be wholly transferred to the
          cognate word. 2. That besides, as a preposition, take
          the remaining sense ``in addition to'', as, besides
          all this; besides the considerations here offered.
          ``There was a famine in the land besides the first
          famine.'' --Gen. xxvi. 1. And that it also take the
          adverbial sense of ``moreover'', ``beyond'', etc.,
          which had been divided between the words; as, besides,
          there are other considerations which belong to this
          case. The following passages may serve to illustrate
          this use of the words:

                Lovely Thais sits beside thee.    --Dryden.

                Only be patient till we have appeased The

         irregular ridges, or convolutions, separated by grooves
         (the so-called fissures and sulci), and the two
         hemispheres are connected at the bottom of the

   Syn: {Burden}, {Load}.

   Usage: A burden is, in the literal sense, a weight to be
          borne; a load is something laid upon us to be carried.
          Hence, when used figuratively, there is usually a
          difference between the two words. Our burdens may be
          of such a nature that we feel bound to bear them
          cheerfully or without complaint. They may arise from
          the nature of our situation; they may be allotments of
          Providence; they may be the consequences of our
          errors. What is upon us, as a load, we commonly carry
          with greater reluctance or sense of oppression. Men
          often find the charge of their own families to be a
          burden; but if to this be added a load of care for
          others, the pressure is usually serve and irksome.

   n. {Burdening}.]

   2. To oppress with anything grievous or trying; to overload;

   3. To impose, as a load or burden; to lay or place as a
      burden (something heavy or objectionable). [R.]

            It is absurd to burden this act on Cromwell.
                                                  --Coleridge.

   Syn: To load; encumber; overload; oppress.

          However is weaker, and throws the opposition (as it

          is, however, almost as cold; he required my
          assistance; at present, however, I shall not afford
          him aid. The plan, however, is still under
          consideration, and may yet be adopted. Still is
          stronger than but, and marks the opposition more
          emphatically; as, your arguments are weighty; still
          they do not convince me. See {Except}, {However}.

      aid of; through; through the act or agency of; as, a city
      is destroyed by fire; profit is made by commerce; to take

   Note: To the meaning of by, as denoting means or agency,
         belong, more or less closely, most of the following
         uses of the word:
      (a) It points out the author and producer; as,
          ``Waverley'', a novel by Sir W.Scott; a statue by
          Canova; a sonata by Beethoven.
      (b) In an oath or adjuration, it indicates the being or
          thing appealed to as sanction; as, I affirm to you by
          all that is sacred; he swears by his faith as a
          Christian; no, by Heaven.
      (c) According to; by direction, authority, or example of;
          after; -- in such phrases as, it appears by his

      (e) In comparison, it denotes the measure of excess or

      (f) It expresses continuance or duration; during the
          course of; within the period of; as, by day, by night.

   Note: In boxing the compass, by indicates a pint nearer to,
         or towards, the next cardinal point; as, north by east,
         i.e., a point towards the east from the north;
         northeast by east, i.e., on point nearer the east than
         northeast is.

   Note: With is used instead of by before the instrument with
         which anything is done; as, to beat one with a stick;
         the board was fastened by the carpenter with nails. But
         there are many words which may be regarded as means or
         processes, or, figuratively, as instruments; and
         whether with or by shall be used with them is a matter
         of arbitrary, and often, of unsettled usage; as, to a
         reduce a town by famine; to consume stubble with fire;
         he gained his purpose by flattery; he entertained them
         with a story; he distressed us with or by a recital of
         his sufferings. see {With}.

   {By all means}, most assuredly; without fail; certainly.

          ariseth because of the word, by and by he is
          offended.'' --Matt. xiii. 21.
      (c) Presently; pretty soon; before long.

   Note: In this phrase, by seems to be used in the sense of
         nearness in time, and to be repeated for the sake of
         emphasis, and thus to be equivalent to ``soon, and
         soon,'' that is instantly; hence, -- less emphatically,
         -- pretty soon, presently.

   {By one's self}, with only one's self near; alone; solitary.

   {By the bye}. See under {Bye}.

   {By the head} (Naut.), having the bows lower than the stern;

         corruption of God be with you (b'w'ye).
