G \G\ (j[=e])
   1. G is the seventh letter of the English alphabet, and a
      vocal consonant. It has two sounds; one simple, as in

      231-6, 155, 176, 178, 179, 196, 211, 246.

   Note: The form of G is from the Latin, in the alphabet which
         it first appeared as a modified form of C. The name is
         also from the Latin, and probably comes to us through
         the French. Etymologically it is most closely related
         to a c hard, k y, and w; as in corn, grain, kernel; kin
         L. genus, Gr. ?; E. garden, yard; drag, draw; also to
         ch and h; as in get, prehensile; guest, host (an army);

   2. (Mus.) G is the name of the fifth tone of the natural or

      in the margin. See {Clef}. G[sharp] (G sharp) is a tone
      intermediate between G and A.

      produces offspiring unlike itself, agamogenetically.

      from their impregnated germs the original parent form is
      reproduced. In more complicated cases, the first series of
      organisms produced agamogenetically may give rise to

      which develops sexual organs, and the original form is
      reproduced.

      species; a precisely defined and exactly divided class;

   2. (Biol.) An assemblage of species, having so many
      fundamental points of structure in common, that in the
      judgment of competent scientists, they may receive a
      common substantive name. A genus is not necessarily the
      lowest definable group of species, for it may often be
      divided into several subgenera. In proportion as its
      definition is exact, it is natural genus; if its
      definition can not be made clear, it is more or less an
      artificial genus.

   Note: Thus in the animal kingdom the lion, leopard, tiger,
         cat, and panther are species of the Cat kind or genus,
         while in the vegetable kingdom all the species of oak
         form a single genus. Some genera are represented by a
         multitude of species, as Solanum (Nightshade) and Carex
         (Sedge), others by few, and some by only one known
         species.

   {Subaltern genus} (Logic), a genus which may be a species of
      a higher genus, as the genus denoted by quadruped, which
      is also a species of mammal.

   {Summum genus} [L.] (Logic), the highest genus; a genus which
      can not be classed as a species, as being.

Geometric \Ge`o*met"ric\, Geometrical \Ge`o*met"ric*al\, a. [L.
   geometricus; Gr. ?: cf. F. g['e]om['e]trique.]
   Pertaining to, or according to the rules or principles of,
   geometry; determined by geometry; as, a geometrical solution
   of a problem.

   Note: Geometric is often used, as opposed to algebraic, to
         include processes or solutions in which the
         propositions or principles of geometry are made use of
         rather than those of algebra.

   Note: Geometrical is often used in a limited or strictly
         technical sense, as opposed to mechanical; thus, a
         construction or solution is geometrical which can be
         made by ruler and compasses, i. e., by means of right
         lines and circles. Every construction or solution which
         requires any other curve, or such motion of a line or
         circle as would generate any other curve, is not
         geometrical, but mechanical. By another distinction, a
         geometrical solution is one obtained by the rules of
         geometry, or processes of analysis, and hence is exact;
         while a mechanical solution is one obtained by trial,
         by actual measurements, with instruments, etc., and is
         only approximate and empirical.

      the zymotic diseases are due to the rapid development and

      which are either contained in the organism itself, or
      transferred through the air or water. See {Fermentation

   Note: Get, as a transitive verb, is combined with adverbs
         implying motion, to express the causing to, or the

   Note: It [get] gives to the English language a middle voice,

          gratified at the attention shown by his visits.

Gold \Gold\ (g[=o]ld), Golde \Golde\, Goolde \Goolde\
   (g[=oo]ld), n. (Bot.)
   An old English name of some yellow flower, -- the marigold
   ({Calendula}), according to Dr. Prior, but in Chaucer perhaps
   the turnsole.

Gold \Gold\ (g[=o]ld), n. [AS. gold; akin to D. goud, OS. & G.
   gold, Icel. gull, Sw. & Dan. guld, Goth. gul[thorn], Russ. &
   OSlav. zlato; prob. akin to E. yellow. [root]49, 234. See
   {Yellow}, and cf. {Gild}, v. t.]
   1. (Chem.) A metallic element, constituting the most precious
      metal used as a common commercial medium of exchange. It
      has a characteristic yellow color, is one of the heaviest
      substances known (specific gravity 19.32), is soft, and
      very malleable and ductile. It is quite unalterable by
      heat, moisture, and most corrosive agents, and therefore
      well suited for its use in coin and jewelry. Symbol Au
      (Aurum). Atomic weight 196.7.

   Note: Native gold contains usually eight to ten per cent of
         silver, but often much more. As the amount of silver
         increases, the color becomes whiter and the specific
         gravity lower. Gold is very widely disseminated, as in
         the sands of many rivers, but in very small quantity.
         It usually occurs in quartz veins (gold quartz), in
         slate and metamorphic rocks, or in sand and alluvial
         soil, resulting from the disintegration of such rocks.
         It also occurs associated with other metallic
         substances, as in auriferous pyrites, and is combined
         with tellurium in the minerals petzite, calaverite,
         sylvanite, etc. Pure gold is too soft for ordinary use,
         and is hardened by alloying with silver and copper, the
         latter giving a characteristic reddish tinge. [See
         {Carat}.] Gold also finds use in gold foil, in the
         pigment purple of Cassius, and in the chloride, which
         is used as a toning agent in photography.

   2. Money; riches; wealth.

            For me, the gold of France did not seduce. --Shak.

   3. A yellow color, like that of the metal; as, a flower
      tipped with gold.

   4. Figuratively, something precious or pure; as, hearts of
      gold. --Shak.

         most cases in the Revised Version.

               ``narrative of God,'' i. e., the life of Christ.

            taking the traditional witticisms about Lee for
            gospel.                               --Saintsbury.

          applied to a permanent mood of the mind. Sorrow is

          the loss of a favorite child too often turns into
          habitual sadness. ``Grief is sometimes considered as
          synonymous with sorrow; and in this case we speak of
          the transports of grief. At other times it expresses
          more silent, deep, and painful affections, such as are
          inspired by domestic calamities, particularly by the
          loss of friends and relatives, or by the distress,
          either of body or mind, experienced by those whom we
          love and value.'' --Cogan. See {Affliction}.
