AN ENCYCLOPEDIA OF OCCULTISM

A

Ab : (Semitic magical month). Crossing a river on the 20th of that month was 
supposed to bring sickness. In ancient texts it states that if a man should 
eat the flesh of swine on the 30th of Ab, he will be plagued with boils.


Abaddon : (The Destroyer). Chief of the demons of the seventh hierarchy. 
Abaddon is the name given by St John in the Apocalypse to the king of the 
grasshoppers. He is sometimes regarded as the destroying angel.


Abadie (Jeannette) : A young sorceress of the village of Sibourre, in 
Gascony. She was sleeping One day in her father's house while high mass was 
being said. A demon, profiting by the opportunity, carried her off to the 
Devil's Sabbath, where she soon awoke to find herself in the midst of a 
large company. She observed that the principal demon had on his head two 
faces, like  Janus. She did not participate in the revelry, and was 
transported to her home by the same means as she had been conveyed thence.  
On the threshold she found her amulet, which the demon had taken the 
precaution to remove from her bosom before carrying her off. She made a 
confession of all that had happened, renounced her sorcery, and thus saved 
herself from the common fate of witches and sorcerer - the stake.


Abaris : A Scythian, high priest of Apollo, and renowned magician. In so 
flattering a manner did he chant the praises of Apollo, his master, that the 
god gave him a golden arrow, on which he could ride through the air like a 
bird, so that the Greeks called him the Aerobate. Pytha-goras, his pupil, 
stole this arrow from him, and accom-plished many wonderful feats by its 
aid. Abaris foretold the future, pacified storms, banished disease, and 
lived without eating or drinking. He made with the bones of Pelops, a statue 
of Minerva, which he sold to the Trojans as a talisman descended from 
heaven. This was the famous Palladium, which protected and rendered im-
pregnable the town wherein it was lodged.


Abdelazys : An Arabian astrologer of the tenth century, generally known in 
Europe by his Latin name of Alchabi-tius. His treatise on astrology was so 
much prized that it was translated into Latin and printed in 1473. Other 
editions have since appeared, the best being that of Venice (1503) entitled 
Alchabitius cum commento.  Translated by John of Seville. (Hispalensis.)


Aben-Ragel : An Arabian astrologer, born at Cordova, at the beginning of the 
fifth century. He was the author of a book of horoscopes according to the 
inspection of the stars, a Latin translation of which was published at 
Venice, 1485, under the title of De Judiciis seu fatis stellarum. It was 
said that his predictions were fulfilled in a remarkable manner.


Abigor : According to Wierius (q.v.), Grand Duke of Hades. He is shown in 
the form of a handsome knight, bearing lance, standard, or sceptre. He is a 
demon of the superior order, and responds readily to questions concerning 
war. He can foretell the future, and instructs the leaders how to make 
themselves respected by the soldiers. Sixty of the infernal regions are at 
his command.


Abishai : (See Devil.) Abou-Ryhan : An Arabian astrologer whose real name 
was Mohammed-ben-Ahmed, to whom is ascribed the intro-duction of Judicial 
Astrology (q.v.) Many stories were told of him in the East, to show that he 
possessed in an extraordinary degree the power to read the future.


Abra Melin: (See Abraham the Jew.)


Abracadabra : A magical word said to be formed from the letters of the 
abraxas, and written thus:

                                          A
                                         AB
                                        ABR
                                       ABRA
                                      ABRAC
                                     ABRACA
                                    ABRACAD
                                   ABRACADA
                                  ABRACADAB
                                 ABRACADABR
                                ABRACADABRA

or the reverse way. The pronunciation of this word, according to Julius 
Africanus, was equally efficacious either way. By Serenus Sammonicus it was 
used as a spell to cure asthma. Abracalan or aracalan is another form of the 
word, and is said to have been regarded as the name of a god in Syria and as 
a magical symbol by the Jews. But it seems doubtful whether the abracadabra, 
or its synonyms, was really the name of a deity or not. (See Abraxas.)

Abraham, The Jew : (Alchemist and magician, circa, 1400). Comparatively few 
biographical facts are forthcoming concerning this German Jew, who was at 
once alchemist, magician and philosopher; and these few facts are mostly 
derived from a very curious manuscript, now domiciled in the Archives of the 
Bibliotheque de l'Arsenal, Paris, an institution rich in occult documents. 
This manuscript is couched throughout in French, but purports to be 
literally translated from Hebrew, and the style of the handwriting indicates 
that the scribe lived at the beginning of the eighteenth century, or 
possibly somewhat earlier. A distinct illiteracy characterises the French 
script, the punctuation being inaccurate, indeed frequently conspicuous by 
its absence, but an actual description of the document must be waived till 
later. Abraham was probably a native of Mayence, and appears to have been 
born in 1362. We find that his father, Simon by name, was something of a 
seer and magician, and that the boy accordingly commenced his occult studies 
under the parental guidance, while at a later date he studied under one, 
Moses, whom he him-self describes as, "indeed a good man, but entirely 
ignorant of The True Mystery, and of The Veritable Magic." Leav-ing this 
preceptor, Abraham decided to glean knowledge by travelling, and along with 
a friend called Samuel, a Bohemian by birth, he wandered through Austria and 
Hungary into Greece, and thence penetrated to Con-stantinople, where he 
remained fully two years. He is found next in Arabia, in those days a 
veritable centre of mystic learning; and from Arabia he went to Palestine, 
whence betimes he proceeded to Egypt. Here he had the good fortune to make 
the acquaintance of Abra--Melin, the famous Egyptian philosopher, who, 
besides entrusting to him certain documents, confided in him by word of 
mouth a number of invaluable secrets; and armed thus, Abraham left Egypt for 
Europe, where eventu-ally he settled at Wurzburg in Germany. Soon he was 
deep in alchemistic researches, but these did not prevent him from espousing 
a wife, who appears to have been his cousin; and by her he had three 
daughters and also two sons, the elder named Joseph and the younger Lamech. 
He took great pains to instruct both of them in occult affairs, while, on 
each of his three daughters, he settled a dowry of a hundred thousand golden 
florins. This con-siderable sum, together with other vast wealth, he claims 
to have gained by travelling as an alchemist; and whatever the truth of this 
statement, he certainly won great fame, being summoned to perform acts of 
magic before many rich and influential people, notably the Emperor Sigismund 
of Germany, the Bishop of Wurzburg, King Henry VI. of England, the Duke of 
Bavaria, and Pope John XXIII. The remainder of Abraham's career is shrouded 
in mystery, while even the date of his death is uncertain, but it is 
commonly supposed to have occurred about 1460.
     The curious manuscript cited above, and from which the foregoing facts 
have been culled, is entitled The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abra-Melin, as 
delivered by Abraham the Jew unto his son Lamech. This title, however, is 
rather misleading, and not strictly accurate, for Abra-Melin had absolutely 
no hand in the opening part of the work, this consisting of some account of  
Abraham's own youth and early travels in search of wisdom, along with advice 
to the young man aspiring to become skilled in occult arts. The second part, 
on the other hand, is based on the documents which the Egyptian sage handed 
to the Jew, or at least on the confidences wherewith the former favoured the 
latter; and it may be fairly accurately defined as dealing with the first 
principles of magic in general, the titles of some of the more important 
chapters being as follows: "How Many, and what are the Classes of Veritable 
Magic?" "What we Ought to Take into Consideration before the Undertaking of 
the Operation," Concerning the Convocation of the Spirits," and "In what 
Manner we ought to Carry out the Operations." Passing to the third and last 
part, this likewise is mostly derived straight from Abra-Melin; and here the 
author, eschewing theoretical matter as far as possible, gives information 
about the actual practice of magic. In the first place he tells how "To  
procure divers Visions," How one may retain the Familiar Spirits, bound or 
free, in whatsoever form," and how "To excite Tempests," while in one 
chapter he treats of raising the dead, another he devotes to the topic of 
transforming oneself into" divers shapes and forms," and in further pages he 
descants on flying in the air, on demolishing buildings, on discovering 
thefts, and on walking under the water. Then he dilates on the Thaumaturgic 
healing of leprosy, dropsy, paralysis, and various more common ailments such 
as fever and sea-sickness, while he offers intelligence on " How to be be-
loved by a Woman," and this he supplements by directions for commanding the 
favour of popes, emperors, and other influential people. Finally, he reverts 
to the question of summoning visions, and his penultimate chapter is en-
titled, "How to cause Armed Men to Appear," while his concluding pages treat 
of evoking "Comedies, Operas, and all kinds of Music and Dances."
     It is by employing Kabalistic squares of letters that all these things 
are to be achieved, or at least, almost all of them, and lack of space makes 
it impossible to deal with the many different signs of this sort, whose use 
the seer counsels. But it behoves to ask what manner of personal-ity exhales 
from these curious pages? What kind of temperament? And the answer is that 
Abraham is shown as a man of singularly narrow mind, heaping scorn on most 
other magicians, and speaking with great derision of nearly all mystical 
writings save his own and those of his hero, Abra-Melin. Moreover, he 
inveighs fiercely against all those who recant the religion in which they 
were bred, and contends that no one guilty of this will ever attain skill in 
magic; yet it should be said, in justice to the seer, that he manifests 
little selfishness, and seems to have striven after success in his craft 
with a view to using it for the benefit of mankind in general. His writings 
reflect besides, a firm belief in that higher self existing in every man, 
and a keen desire to develop it.  
(See Flamel.)

Abraxas :  (or Abracax). The Basilidian (q.v.) sect of Gnostics, of the 
second century, claimed Abraxas as their supreme god, and said that Jesus 
Christ was only a phantom sent to earth by him. They believed that his name 
con-tained great mysteries, as it was composed of the seven Greek letters 
which form the number 365, which is also the number of days in a year. 
Abraxas, they thought, had under his command 365 gods, to whom they 
attributed 365 virtues, one for each day. The older Mythologists placed him 
among the number of Egyptian gods, and demonologists have described him as a 
demon, with the head of a king and with serpents forming his feet. He is 
represented on ancient amulets, with a whip in his hand. It is from his name 
that the mystic word, Abracadabra (q.v.) is taken. Many stones and gems cut 
in various symbolic forms, such as the head of a fowl, a serpent, and so 
forth, were worn by the Basilidians as amulets.

Abred : The innermost of three concentric circles represent-ing the totality 
of being in the British Celtic cosmogony. (See Celts.) The stage of struggle 
and evolution against Cythrawl, the power of evil.  
(See also Barddas.)

Absolute (Theosophist) : Of the Absolute, the Logos, the Word of God, 
Theosophists profess to know nothing further than that it exists. The 
universes with their solar systems are but the manifestations of this Being, 
which man is capable of perceiving, and all of them are instinct with him, 
but what man can perceive is not the loftier manifestations but the lower. 
Man himself is an emanation from the Absolute with which he will ultimately 
be re-united.

Abyssum : A herb used in the ceremony of exorcising a haunted house. It is 
signed with the sign of the cross, and hung up at the four corners of the 
house.

Acherat : (See Cagliostro.)

Achmet : An Arabian soothsayer of the ninth century. He wrote a book on The 
Interpretation of Dreams, following the doctrines of the East. The original 
is lost. but the Greek and Latin translations were printed at Paris, in 
1603.

Aconce (Jacques) : Curate of the diocese of Trent, who became a Calvinist in 
1557, and came to England, While there he dedicated to Queen Elizabeth his 
famous work, on The Stratagems of Satan. This book, however, is not, as its 
title might indicate, a dissertation on demonology, but a spirited attack on 
intolerance.

Adalbert : A French pseudo-mystic of the eighth century. He boasted that an 
angel had brought him relics of extra-ordinary sanctity from all parts of 
the earth. He claimed to be able to foretell the future, and to read 
thoughts. " I know what you have done," he would say to the people, "there 
is no need for confession. Go in peace, your sins are forgiven." His so-
called "miracles" gained for him the awe of the multitude, and he was in the 
habit of giving away parings of his nails and locks of his hair as powerful 
amulets. He is even said to have set up an altar in his own name. In his 
history of his life, of which only a fragment remains, he tells us of 
miraculous powers bestowed by an angel at his birth. He showed to his 
disciples a letter which he declared had been brought to him from Jesus 
Christ by the hand of St. Michael. These, and similar blasphemies were put 
an end to by his being cast into prison, where he died.

Adam, Book of the Penitence of : A manuscript in the Library of the Arsenal 
at Paris, which deals with Kabalistic tradition. It recounts how the sons of 
Adam, Cain and Abel, typifying brute force and intelligence, slew each 
other, and that A dam's inheritance passed to his third son. Seth. Seth, it 
is stated, was permitted to advance as far as the gate of the Earthly 
Paradise without being threat-ened by the guardian angel with his flaming 
sword, which is to say that he was an initiate of occult science. He beheld 
the Tree of Life and the Tree of Knowledge, which had become grafted upon 
each other so that they formed one tree. This is supposed by some to have 
symbolised the harmony of science and religion in the Kabala. The guardian 
angel presented Seth with three seeds from this tree, directing him to place 
them within the mouth of his father, Adam, when he expired. From this 
planting arose the burning bush out of which God communicated to Moses his 
holy name, and from a part of which Moses made his magic wand. This was 
placed in the Ark of the Coven-ant, and was planted by King David on Mount 
Zion, grew into a triple tree and was cut down by Solomon to form the 
pillars, Jachin and Boaz, which were placed at the entrance to the Temple. A 
third portion was inserted in the threshold of the great gate, and acted as 
a talisman, permitting no unclean thing to enter the sanctuary. Cer-tain 
wicked priests removed it however for purposes of their own, weighted it 
with stones, and cast it into the Temple reservoir, where it was guarded by 
an angel, who kept it from the sight of men. During the lifetime of Christ 
the reservoir was drained and the beam of wood discovered and thrown across 
the brook Kedron, over which our Saviour passed after his apprehension in 
the Garden of Olives. It was taken by his executioners and made into the 
cross. In this legend we can see a marked similarity to those from which the 
conception of the Holy Grail arose. Man is restored by the wood through the 
instrumentality of which Adam, the first man, fell. The idea that the Cross 
was a cutting of the Tree of Knowledge was widespread in the middle ages, 
and may be found in the twelfth century Quete del St. Graal, ascribed to 
Walter Map, but probably only redacted by him.  All the Kabalistic 
traditions are embodied in the allegory contained in the Book of the 
Penitence of Adam, and it undoubtedly supplements and throws considerable 
light on the entire Kabalistic literature.

Adam, (L'Abbe) : About the time that the Templars were being driven from 
France, the Devil appeared, under various guises, to the Abbe Adam, who was 
journeying, attended by one of the servants from his convent, to a certain 
part of his abbacy of the Vaux de Cernay. The evil spirit first opposed the 
progress of the worthy Abbe under the form of a tree white with frost, which 
rushed towards him with inconceivable swiftness. The Abbe's horse trembled 
with fear, as did the servant, but the Abbe himself made the sign of the 
Cross, and the tree disappeared. The good man concluded that he had seen the 
Devil, and called upon the Virgin to protect him. Nevertheless, the fiend 
shortly reappeared in the shape of a furious black knight. "Be-gone," said 
the Abbe. "Why do you attack me far from my brothers? " The Devil once more 
left him, only to return in the shape of a tall man, with a long, thin neck. 
Adam, to get rid of him, struck him a blow with his fist. The evil spirit 
shrank and took the stature and counten-ance of a little cloaked monk, with 
a glittering weapon under his dress. His little eyes could be seen darting 
and glancing under his cowl. He tried hard to strike the Abbe with the sword 
he held, but the latter repulsed the strokes with the sign of the Cross. The 
demon became in turn a pig and a long-eared ass. The Abbe, impatient to be 
gone, made a circle on the ground with a cross in the centre. The fiend was 
then obliged to withdraw to a little distance. He changed his long ears into 
horns, which did not hinder the Abbe from boldly addressing him. Offended by 
his plain-speaking, the Devil changed himself into a barrel and rolled into 
an adjoining field. In a short time he returned in the form of a cart-wheel, 
and, without giving the brother time to put himself on the defensive, rolled 
heavily over his body, without, however, doing him any injury. After that he 
left him to pursue his journey in peace.  (See Gaguin, Regne de Philippe le 
Bel, and Gerinet, Hist. de la Magie en France, p.82.)

Adamantius : A Jewish doctor, who became a Catholic at Constantinople in the 
time of Constantine, to whom he dedicated his two books on Physiognomy, or, 
the art of judging people by their faces. This book, full of con-tradictions 
and fantasies, was printed in the Scrip-tores Physiognomoniae veteres, of 
Franzius, at Attembourg, in 1780.

Adamnan : (See Scotland.)

Addane of the lake : A monster that figures in the Mabinogi legend of 
Peredur. Peredur obtains a magic stone which renders him invisible, and he 
thus succeeds in slaying this monster, which had daily killed the 
inhabitants of the palace of the King of Tortures.

Adelung, (Jean Christophe) : A German author, born in 1732, who has left a 
work entitled, Histoire des folies humains, on Biographie des plus celebres 
necromanciens, alchimistes, devins, etc. 
(Leipsic, 1785-1789.) Adelung died at Dresden in 1806.

Adepts : are men who after stern self-denial and by means of consistent 
self-development, have fitted themselves to assist in the ruling of the 
world. The means by which this position is attained is said to be long and 
arduous, but in the end the successful one has fulfilled the purpose for 
which he was created and transcends his fellows. The activities of Adepts 
are multifarious, being concerned with the direction and guidance of the 
activities of the rest of mankind. Their knowledge, like their powers, say 
Theoso-phists, far exceeds that of man, and they can control forces both in 
the spiritual and the physical realm, and are said to be able to prolong 
their lives for centuries. They are also known as the Great White 
Brotherhood, Rishis, Rahats, or Mahatmas. Those who earnestly desire to work 
for the betterment of the world may become appren-tices or chelas to Adepts, 
in which case the latter are known as "masters," but the apprentice must 
first have practised self-denial and self-development in order to become 
suffi-ciently worthy. The master imparts teaching and wisdom otherwise 
unattainable, and helps the apprentice by com-munion and inspiration. Madame 
Blavatsky (q.v.) al-leged that she was the apprentice of these masters, and 
claimed that they dwelt in the Tibetan Mountains. The term Adept was also 
employed by mediaeval magicians and alchemists to denote a master of their 
sciences.

Adhab-Algal : The Mohammedan purgatory, where the wicked are tormented by 
the dark angels Munkir and Nekir.
 
Adjuration : A formula of exorcism by which the evil spirit is commanded, in 
the name of God, to do or say what the exorcist requires of him.

Adonai : A Hebrew word signifying "the Lord," and used by the Hebrews when 
speaking or writing of Jehovah, the awful and ineffable name of the God of 
Israel.  The Jews entertained the deepest awe for this incommuni-cable and 
mysterious name, and this feeling led them to avoid pronouncing it and to 
the substitution of the word Adonai for " Jehovah" in their sacred text. 
This custom still prevails among the Jews, who attribute to the  
pronouncement of the Holy Name the power of working miracles. The Jehovah of 
the Israelites was their invisible protector and king, and no image of him 
was made. He was worshipped according to his commandments, with an 
observance of the ritual instituted through Moses. The
term "Jehovah" means the revealed Absolute Deity, the Manifest, Only, 
Personal, Holy Creator and Redeemer. (See Magic, God, Egypt, Kabala.)

Adoptive Masonry : Masonic societies which adopt women as members.  Early in 
the eighteenth century such societies were established in France, and 
speedily spread to other countries. One of the first to "adopt" women were 
the Mopses. The Felicitaries existed in 1742.  The Fendeurs or Woodcutters 
were instituted in 1763 by Bauchaine, Master of a Parisian Lodge. It was 
modelled on the Carbonari, and its popu-larity led to the establishment of 
other lodges, notably the Fidelity, the Hatchet, etc. In 1774 the Grand 
Orient Lodge of France established a system of three degrees called the Rite 
of Adoption, and elected the Duchess of Bourbon as Grand Mistress of France. 
The rite has been generally adopted into Freemasonry, and various degrees 
added from time to time, to the number of about twelve in all. Latin and 
Greek mysteries were added to the rite by the Ladies' Hospitallers of Mount 
Tabor. The greatest ladies in France joined the French lodges of adoption. 
The Rite of Mizraim created lodges for both sexes in 1819, 1821, 1838 and 
1853, and the Rite of Memphis in 1839. America founded the Rite of the 
Eastern Star in five points. In these systems admission is generally 
confined to the female relations of Masons. The Order of the Eastern Star 
and that of Adoptive Masonry were attempted in Scotland, but without 
success.

Adramelech : According to Wierius (q.v.,) Chancellor of the infernal 
regions, Keeper of the Wardrobe of the Demon King, and President of the High 
Council of the Devils. He was worshipped at Sepharvaim, an Assyrian town, 
where children were burned on his altar. The rabbis say that he shows 
himself in the form of a mule, or sometimes, of a peacock.

Adventists : (See America, U.S. of.)

Aeromancy : The art of foretelling future events by the observation of 
atmospheric phenomena, as, for example, when the death of a great man is 
presaged by the ap-pearance of a comet. Francois de la Tour Blanche says 
that aeromancy is the art of fortune-telling by means of spectres which are 
made to appear in the air, or the re-presentation by the aid of demons, of 
future events, which are projected on the clouds as if by a magic lantern. 
"As for thunder and lightning," he adds, "these are concerned with auguries, 
and the aspect of the sky and of the planets belong to the science of 
astrology."

Aetites or Aquilaeus : A precious stone of magical properties, composed of 
oxide of iron with a little silex and alumina, and said to be found in the 
stomach or neck of the eagle. It is supposed to heal falling sickness, and 
prevent untimely birth. It should be worn bound on the arm to prevent 
abortion, and on the thigh to aid parturition.

Africa : (See Arabs, Egypt, Semites.) The north of Africa is Mohammedan. 
This applies also to the Sudan and the Sahara.  For Moorish Magic and 
Alchemy see Arabs, Instances of Arabic sorcery will also be found in the 
article "Semites." In West Africa Obeah is practised, for which see West 
Indies.) 
     Magic in savage Africa is of the lower cultus, and chiefly of the kind 
known as "sympathetic."  
(See Magic.) But spiritualistic influence shows itself in fetishism, the 
cult of the dead,  ju-ju or witchcraft, and the cult of the witch-doctor. 
     Bantu Tribes. Among the Zulu and other Bantu tribes the cult of 
witchcraft was practised, but in secret. for the results of detection were 
terrible. For the tracking of the witch, a caste of witch-finders was 
instituted, called "witch-doctors," whose duty it was to " smell out" the 
offenders. These were nearly all women.
     “It is not difficult to understand," says Lady Barker, “bearing in mind 
the superstition and cruelty which existed in remote parts of England not so 
very long ago; how powerful such women become among a savage people, or how 
tempting an opportunity they could furnish of getting rid of an enemy. Of 
course they are exceptional individuals; more observant, more shrewd, and 
more dauntless than the average fat, hard-working Kaffir women, besides 
possessing the contradictory mixture of great physical powers and strong 
hysterical tendencies. They work themselves up to a pitch of frenzy, and get 
to believe as firmly in their own supernatural discernment as any individual 
among the trembling circle of Zulus to whom a touch from the whisk they 
carry is a sentence of instant death."
     The Zulu witch-finders are attended by a circle of black girls and 
women, who, like a Greek chorus, clap their hands together, and drone 
through a low monotonous chant, the measure and rhythm of which change at 
times with a stamp and a swing. Not less necessary is a ceremonial dress for 
such things appeal directly to the imagination of the crowd, and prepare 
them to be readily influenced by the necromancers devices. The " Isinyanga," 
"Abangoma" or "witch-finders," whom Lady Barker describes for us, were 
attired with an eye for effect which would have done credit to a London 
theatre. It will suffice to depict one of them, by name Nozinyanga. Her 
fierce face, spotted with gouts of red paint on cheek and brow, was partly 
overshadowed by a helmet-like plume of the tall feathers of the sakabula 
bird. In her right hand she carried a light sheaf of assegais or lances, and 
on her left arm was slung a small and pretty shield of dappled 
ox-hide. Her petticoat, made of a couple of large gay handkerchiefs, was 
worn kilt-wise. But if there were little decoration in her skirts, the 
deficiency was more than compensated by the bravery of the 
bead-necklaces, the goat's-hair fringes, and the scarlet tassels which 
covered her from coat to waist. Her ample chest rose and fell beneath the 
baldric of leopard skin, fastened across it with huge brazen knobs, while 
down her back hung a beautifully dried and flattened skin of an enormous 
boa-constrictor.
     When the community had resolved that a certain mis-fortune was due to 
the witches, the next step obviously would be to detect and punish them. For 
this purpose the king would summon a great meeting, and cause his subjects 
to sit on the ground in a ring or circle for four or five days. The witch-
finders took their places in the centre, and as they gradually worked 
themselves up to a frantic state of frenzy, resembling demoniacal 
possession, they lightly switched with their quagga-tail one or other of the 
trembling spectators, who was immediately dragged away and butchered on the 
spot. And not only he, but all the living things in his hut-wives and 
children, dogs and cats-not one was left alive, nor was a stick left stand-
ing. Sometimes a whole kraal would be exterminated in this way, and the 
reader will perceive how terrible the cruel custom could be made to gratify 
private revenge or to work the king's tyrannical inclinations.
     A terrible little sorceress is described by Lady Barker under the name 
of Nozilwane, whose weird wistful glance had in it something uncanny and 
uncomfortable. She was dressed beautifully for her part, in lynx skins 
folded over and over from waist to knee, the upper part of her body being 
covered by strings of wild beasts' teeth and fangs, beads, skeins of gaily-
coloured yarn, strips of snake's skin, and fringes of Angora goat fleece. 
This, as a decora-tion, was both graceful and effective; it was worn round 
the body and above each elbow, and fell in soft white flakes among the 
brilliant colouring and against the dusky skin. Lynx-tails depended like 
lappets on each side of her face, which was over-shadowed and almost hidden 
by a profusion of sakabula feathers. "This bird," says Lady Barker, "has a 
very beautiful plumage, and is sufficiently rare for the natives to attach a 
peculiar value and charm to the tail-feathers; they are like those of a 
young cock, curved and slender, and of a dark chesnut colour, with a white 
eye at the extreme tip of each feather." Among all this thick, floating 
plumage were interspersed small bladders, and skewers or pins wrought out of 
tusks. Each witch-finder wore her own hair, or rather wool, highly greased 
and twisted up with twine until it ceases to wear the appearance of hair, 
and hangs around the face like a thick fringe, dyed deep red.
     Bent double, and with a creeping, cat-like gait, as if seeking a trail, 
out stepped Nozilwane. Every movement of her undulating body kept time to 
the beat of the girls' hands and their low crooning chant. Presently she 
pre-tended to find the thing she sought, and with a series of wild 
pirouettes, leaped into the air, shaking her spears and brandishing her 
little shield like a Bacchante. Nowamso, another of the party, was 
determined that her companion should not carry off all the applause, and she 
too, with a yell and a leap, sprang into the dance to the sound of louder 
grunts and harder hand-claps. Nowamso showed much anxiety to display her 
back, where a magni-ficent snake skin, studded in a regular pattern with 
brass-headed nails, floated like a stream. She was attired also in a 
splendid kilt of leopard skins, decorated with red rosettes, and her toilet 
was considered more careful and artistic than any of the others. Brighter 
her bangles, whiter her goat-fringes, and more elaborately painted her face. 
Nozilwane, however, had youth and a wonderful self-reliance on her side. The 
others, though they all joined in and hunted out an imaginary enemy, and in 
turn exulted over his discovery, soon became breathless and spent, and were 
glad when their attendants led them away to be anointed and to drink water.
     Central Africa. The magical beliefs of Central and Eastern Africa are 
but little known. They are for the most part connected with the cult of the 
dead and that of the fetish. As regards the first
     When the dead are weary of staying in the bush, they come for one of 
their people whom they most affect. And the spirit will say to the man  "I 
am tired of dwelling in the bush, please to build for me in the town a 
little house as close as possible to your own." And he tells him to dance 
and sing too, and accordingly the man assembles the women at night to join 
in dance and song.
     Then, next day, the people repair to the grave of the Obambo, or ghost, 
and make a rude idol, after which the bamboo bier, on which the body is 
conveyed to the grave, and some of the dust of the ground. are carried into 
a little hut erected near the house of the visited, and a white cloth is 
draped over the door.
     It is a curious fact, which 'seems to show that these 
people have a legend something like the old Greek myth of Charon and the 
Styx, that in one of the songs chanted during this ceremony occurs the 
following line "You are well dressed, but you have no canoe to carry you 
across to the other side."
     Possession. Epileptic diseases, in almost all uncivilised countries, 
are assumed to be the result of demoniac pos-session. In Central Africa the 
sufferer is supposed to be possessed by Mbwiri, and he can be relieved only 
by the intervention of the medicine-man or fetish. In the middle of the 
street a hut is built for his accommodation, and there he resides until 
cured, or maddened, along with the priest and his disciples. There for ten 
days or a fortnight a continuous revel is held; much eating and drinking at 
the expense of the patient's relatives, and unending dances to the sound of 
flute and drum. For obvious reasons the fetish gives out that Mbwiri regards 
good living with aversion. The patient dances, usually shamming madness, 
until the epileptic attack comes on, with all its dreadful concomitants-the 
frenzied stare, the convulsed limbs, the gnashing teeth, and the foam-
flecked lips. The man's actions at this period are not ascribed to himself, 
but to the demon which has control of him. When a cure has been effected, 
real or pretended, the patient builds a little fetish-house, avoids certain 
kinds of food, and performs certain duties. Sometimes the process terminates 
in the patient's insanity; he has been known to run away to the bush, hide 
from all human beings, and live on the roots and berries of the forest. 
     “These fetish-men," says Read, "are priest doctors, like those of the 
ancient Germans. They have a profound knowledge of herbs, and also of human 
nature, for they always monopolise the real power in the state. But it is 
very doubtful whether they possess any secrets save that of extracting 
virtue and poison from plants. During the first trip which I made into the 
bush I sent for one of these doctors. At that time I was staying among the 
Shekani, who are celebrated for their fetish, He came attended by half-a-
dozen disciples. He was a tall man dressed in white, with a girdle of 
leopard's skin, from which hung an iron bell, of the same shape as our sheep 
bells. He had two chalk marks over his eyes. I took some of my own hair, 
frizzled it with a burning glass, and gave it to him. He popped it with 
alacrity into his little grass bag; for white man's hair is fetish of the 
first order. Then I poured out some raspberry vinegar into a glass, drank a 
little of it first, country fashion, and offered it to him. telling him that 
it was blood from the brains of great doctors. Upon this he received it with 
great reverence, and dipping his fingers into it as if it was snap-dragon, 
sprinkled with it his forehead, both feet between the two first toes, and 
the ground behind his back. He then handed his glass to a disciple, who 
emptied it, and smacked his lips afterwards in a very secular manner. I then 
desired to see a little of his fetish. He drew on the ground with red chalk 
some hieroglyphics, among which I distinguished the circle, the cross, and 
the crescent. He said that if I would give him a fine' dush,' he would tell 
me all about it. But as he would not take anything in reason, and as I knew 
that he would tell me nothing of very great impor-tance in public, 
negotiations were suspended."
     The fetish-man seldom finds a native disposed to question his claim of 
supernatural powers. He is not only a doctor and a priest-two capacities in 
which his influence is necessarily very powerful-he is also a witch-finder, 
and this is an office which invests him with a truly formidable authority. 
When a man of worth dies, his death is in-variably ascribed to witchcraft, 
and the aid of the fetish-man is invoked to discover the witch.
     When a man is sick a long time, they call Ngembi, and if she cannot 
make him well, the fetish-man. He comes at night, in a white dress, with 
cock's feathers on his head, and having his bell and little glass. He calls 
two or three relations together into a room. He does not speak, but always 
looks in his glass. Then he tells them that the sickness is not of Mbwiri, 
nor of Obambo, nor of God, but that it comes from a witch. They say to him, 
"What shall we do?" He goes out and says," I have told you. I have no more 
to say." They give him a dollar's worth of cloth, and every night they 
gather together in the street, and they cry," I know that man who bewitched 
my brother-. It is good for you to make him well." Then the witch makes him 
well. But if the man do not recover they call the bush doctor from the 
Shekani country. He sings in the language of the bush. At night he goes into 
the street; all the people flock about him. With a tiger-cat skin in his 
hand, he walks to and fro, until, singing all the while, he lays the tiger-
skin at the feet of the witch. At the con-clusion of his song the people 
seize the witch, and put him or her in chains, saying, "If you don't restore 
our brother to health, we will kill you."

African Builders' Architects : A mystical association founded by one, C. F. 
Koffen, a German official (1734-1797). Its ostensible object was that of 
literary culture and intellect-ual study, but masonic qualifications were 
required of its members, and it attracted to itself some of the most 
distinguished Continental literati of the period. it had branches at Worms, 
Cologne and Paris. It is asserted that it was affiliated with the Society of 
Alethophilas or Lovers of Truth, which, indeed, is the name of one of its 
grades, the designations of which were as follow: Inferior Grades : (I) 
Apprentice of Egyptian Secrets; (2) Initiate into Egyptian Secrets; (3) 
Cosmopolitan; (4) Christian Philosopher;  (5) Alethophilos. Higher Grades:  
(r) Esquire; (2) Soldier; (3) Knight-thus supplying Egypt-ian, Christian and 
Templar mysteries to the initiate. In 1806 there was published at Berlin a 
pamphlet entitled A Discovery Concerning the System of the Order of African 
Architects.

Ag : A red flower used by the natives of Hindustan to propitiate their god, 
Sanee. It is made into a wreath with jasoon, also a red-coloured flower, 
which is hung round the neck of the god, who is of a congenial nature. This 
cere-mony is performed by night.

Agaberte : Daughter of a certain giant called Vagnoste, dwelling in 
Scandinavia. She was a powerful enchantress, and was rarely seen in her true 
shape. Sometimes she would take the form of an old woman, wrinkled and bent, 
and hardly able to move about. At one time she would appear weak and ill, 
and at another tall and strong. so that her head seemed to touch the clouds. 
These transforma-tions she effected without the smallest effort or trouble. 
People were so struck with her marvels that they believed her capable of 
overthrowing the mountains, tearing up the trees, drying up the rivers with 
the greatest of ease. They held that nothing less than a legion of demons 
must be at her command for the accomplishment of her magic feats. She seems 
to be like the Scottish Cailleach Bheur, a nature hag.

Agapis : This is a yellow stone, so called because it promotes love or 
charity. It cures stings and venomous bites, by being dipped in water and 
rubbed over the wound.

Agares : According to Wierius (q.v.) Grand Duke of the eastern region of 
Hades. He is shown under the form of a benevolent lord mounted on a 
crocodile, and carrying a hawk on his fist. The army he protects in battle 
is indeed fortunate, for he disperses their enemies, and puts new courage 
into the hearts of the cowards who fly before superior numbers. He 
distributes place and power, titles and prelacies, teaches all languages, 
and has other equally remarkable powers. Thirty-one legions are under his 
command.

Agate, or Achates : Good against the biting of scorpions or serpents, 
soothes the mind, drives away contagious air, and puts a stop to thunder and 
lightning. It is said also to dispose to solitude, promote eloquence, and 
secure the favour of princes. It gives victory over their enemies to those 
who wear it.

Agathion : A familiar spirit which appears only at mid-day. It takes the 
shape of a man or a beast, or even encloses itself in a talisman, bottle, or 
magic ring.

Agathodemon : A good demon, worshipped by the Egyptians under the shape of a 
serpent with a human head. The dragons or flying serpents venerated by the 
ancients were also called Agathodemons, or good genies.

Agla : A kabalistic word used by the rabbis for the exorcisms of the evil 
spirit. It is made up of the initial letters of the Hebrew words, Athah 
gabor leolam, Adonai, meaning, Thou art powerful and eternal, Lord." Not 
only among the Jews was this word employed. but among the more superstitious 
Christians it was a favourite weapon with which to combat the evil one, even 
so late as the sixteenth century. It is also to be found in many books on, 
magic, notably in the Enchiridion of Pope Leo III.

Aglaophotis : A kind of herb which grows in the deserts of Arabia, and which 
was much used by sorcerers for the evocation of demons. Other plants were 
then employed to retain the evil spirits so long as the sorcerer required 
them.

Agreda (Marie of) : A Spanish nun, who published about the middle of the 
seventeenth century a work entitled, The Mystic City of God, a Miracle of 
the All-powerful, the Abyss of Grace  Divine History of the Life of the Most 
Holy Virgin Mary, Mother of God, our Queen and Mistress, manifested in these 
last times by the Holy Virgin to the Sister Marie of Jesus, Abbess of the 
Convent of the Immaculate Conception of the town of Agreda, and written by 
that same Sister by order of her Superiors and Confessors.
     This work, which was condemned by the Sorbonne, is a pretended account 
of many strange and miraculous hap-penings which befell the Virgin from her 
birth onwards, including a visit to Heaven in her early years, when she was 
given a guard of nine hundred angels.

Agrippa von Nettesheim, Henry Cornelius (1486-1535) : A German soldier and 
physician, and an adept in alchemy, astrology and magic. He was born at 
Cologne on the 14th of September, 1486, and educated at the University of 
Cologne. While still a youth he served under Maximilian I. of Germany. In 
1509 he lectured at the University of Dole, but a charge of heresy brought 
against him by a monk named Catilinet compelled him to leave Dole, and he 
re-sumed his former occupation of soldier. In the following year he was sent 
on a diplomatic mission to England, and on his return followed Maximilian to 
Italy, where he passed seven years, now serving one noble patron, now 
another. Thereafter he held a post at Metz, returned to Cologne, practised 
medicine at Geneva, and was appointed physician to Louise of Savoy, mother 
of Francis I.; but, on being given some task which he found irksome, he left 
the service of his patroness and denounced her bitterly. He then accepted a 
post offered him by Margaret, Duchess of Savoy, Regent of the Netherlands. 
On her death in 1830, he repaired to Cologne and Bonn, and thence to France, 
where he was arrested for some slighting mention of the Queen. Mother, 
Louise of Savoy. He was soon released, however, and died at Grenoble in 
1535. Agrippa was a man of great talent and varied attainments. He was 
acquainted with eight languages, and was evidently a physician of no mean 
ability, as well as a soldier and a theologian. He had, moreover, many noble 
patrons. Yet, notwithstanding these advantages, he never 'seemed to be free 
from misfortune; persecution and financial difficulties dogged his 
footsteps, and in Brussels he suffered imprisonment for debt  He himself was 
in a measure responsible for his troubles. He was, in fact, an adept in the 
gentle art of making enemies, and the persecution of the monks with whom he 
frequently came into conflict was bitter and increasing. His principal works 
were a defence of magic, entitled De occulta philosophia, which was not 
published until 1531, though it was written some twenty years earlier, and a 
satirical attack on the scientific pretensions of his day, De incertitudine 
et Vanitate Scientiarum et Artium atque Excellentia Verbi Dei Declamatio, 
also published at Antwerp in 1531. His other works included a treatise Dei 
Nobilitate et Praecellentia Feminu Sexus, dedicated to Margaret of Burgundy 
out of gratitude for her patronage. 
     His interest in alchemy and magic dated from an early period of his 
life, and gave rise to many tales of his occult powers. It was said that he 
was always accompanied by a familiar in the shape of a large black dog. On 
his death he renounced his magical works and addressed his familiar thus:  
Begone, wretched animal, the entire cause of my destruction!" The animal 
fled from the room and straightway plunged into the Saom, where it perished. 
At the inns where he stayed, Agrippa paid his bills with money that appeared 
genuine enough at the time, but which after-wards turned to worthless horn 
or shell, like the fairy money which turned to earth after sunset. He is 
said to have summoned Tully to pronounce his oration for Roscius, in the 
presence of John George, elector of Saxony, the Earl of Surrey, Erasmus, and 
other eminent people. Tully duly appeared, delivered his famous oration, and 
left his audience deeply moved. Agrippa had a magic glass, wherein it was 
possible to see objects distant in time or place. On one occasion Surrey saw 
therein his mistress, the beautiful Geraldine, lamenting the absence of her 
noble lover.
     One other story concerning the magician is worthy of record. Once when 
about to leave home for a short time, he entrusted to his wife the key of 
his museum, warning her on no account to permit anyone to enter. But the 
curiosity of a boarder in their house prompted him to beg for the key, till 
at length the harrassed hostess gave it to him. The first thing that caught 
the student's attention was a book of spells, from which he began to read. A 
knock sounded on the door. The student took no notice, but went on reading, 
and the knock was repeated. A moment later a demon entered, demanding to 
know why he had been summoned. The student was too terrified to make reply, 
and the angry demon seized him by the threat and strangled him. At the same 
moment Agrippa entered, having returned unexpectedly from his journey. 
Fearing that he would be charged with the murder of the youth, he persuaded 
the demon to restore him to life for a little while, and walk him up and 
down the market place. The demon consented: the people saw the student 
apparently alive and in good health, and when the demon allowed the 
semblance of life to leave the body, they thought the young man had died a 
natural death. However, an examination dearly showed that he had been 
strangled. The true state of affairs leaked out, and Agrippa was forced to 
flee for his life.
     These fabrications of the popular imagination were probably encouraged 
rather than suppressed by Agrippa, who loved to surround his comparatively 
harmless pursuits of alchemy and astrology with an air of mystery calculated 
to inspire awe and terror in the minds of the ignorant. It is known that he 
had correspondents in all parts of the world, and that from their letters, 
which he received in his retirement, he gleaned the knowledge which he was 
popularly believed to obtain from his familiars.

Ahazu-Demon  (The Seizer). Practically nothing is known of this Semitic 
demon unless it is the same ahazie told of in medical texts, where a man can 
be stricken by a disease bear-ing this name.

Ahi : (See Devil.)

Ahrimanes : The name given to the Chief of the Cacodaemons, or fallen 
angels, by the Persians and Chaldeans. These Cacodaemons were believed to 
have been expelled from Heaven for their sins; they endeavoured to settle 
down in various parts of the earth, but were always rejected, and out of 
revenge they find their pleasure in injuring the inhabitants. Xenocritus 
thought that penance and self--mortification, though not agreeable to the 
gods, pacified the malice of the Cacodaemons. Ahrimanes and his
followers finally took up their abode in all the space between the earth and 
the fixed stars, and there established their domain, which is called 
Arhiman-abad. As Ahrimanes was the spirit of evil his counterpart in Persian 
dualism was Ormuzd, tile creative and benevolent being.  (See Persia.)

Ainsarii : An Ishmaelite sect of the Assassins (q.v.) who continued to exist 
after the stronghold of that society was destroyed. They held secret 
meetings for receptions, and possessed signs, words, and a catechism.  (See 
The Asian Mystery, Rev. C. L. Lyde.)

Air Assisting Ghosts to become Visible : It was formerly believed by some 
authorities that a ghost was wrapped in air, by which means it became 
visible. Thus a spectre might appear wherever there was air.

Akasa, or Soniferous Ether : One of the five elementary principles of 
nature, mentioned in The Science of Breath, a Hindu Yoga. It is the first of 
these principles; is given by" The Great Power," and out of it the others 
are created. These ethers may be likened to the five senses of man. In order 
to hear distinct sounds, the Hindu theosophist "concentrates" himself upon 
Akasa.

Akathaso : Evil spirits inhabiting trees.  (See Burma.)

Akhnim : A town of Middle Thebais, which at one time possessed the 
reputation of being the habitation of the greatest magicians. Paul Lucas, in 
his Second Voyage, speaks of the wonderful Serpent of Akhnim, which was 
worshipped by the Mussuimans as an angel, and by the Christians believed to 
be the demon Asmodeus.

Akiba :  A Jewish rabbi of the first century, who, from being a simple 
shepherd, became a learned scholar, spurred by the hope of winning the hand 
of a young lady he greatly admired. The Jews say that he was taught by the 
elemen-tal spirits, that he was a conjurer, and that, in his best days, he 
had as many as 24,000 disciples. He is said to be the author of a famous 
work, entitled, Yetzirah (q.v., On the Creation), which is by some ascribed 
to Abraham, and even to Adam. It was first printed at Paris in 1552.

Aksakof, (Alexandre) : A Russian statesman, whose name stands high in the 
spiritualistic annals of his country. Born in 1832, he was educated at the 
Imperial Lyceum of St. Petersburg, and afterwards became Councillor of State 
to the Emperor of Russia. He made his first acquaintance with spiritualism 
through the writings of Swedenborg, some of which he afterwards translated. 
Later, he studied the works of other spiritualistic writers. He was instru-
ments in bringing many mediums to Russia, and identified himself with Home, 
Slade, and other well-known mediums, and later with Eusapia Palladino. 
Mainly at the instance of M. Aksakof, a Russian Scientific Committee was ap-
pointed in 1877 to inquire into spiritualism, but its enquiry was conducted 
in a very half-hearted manner. M. Aksakof was for many years compelled to 
publish his psychic works and journals in Germany and other countries, on 
account of the prohibition of the Russian Government. (See Russia.)

Al : Part of inscription on a pantacle which forms a frontis piece to the 
grimoire doctrine. Along with other 
inscriptions, it denotes the name of God.

Alain of Lisle :  It has been Said by some writers that there were two men 
to whom was given the name of Alanus Insulensis, one of whom was Bernardine, 
Bishop of Auxerre, and author of a Commentary on the Prophecies of Merlin; 
the other, that "Universal Doctor:' whose brilliant career at the Paris 
University was followed by his withdrawal to a cloister, where he devoted 
himself entirely to the study of philosophy.  Others again maintain that the 
Bishop of Auxerre and the "Universal Doctor" were one and the same. Even the 
date when they lived is very uncertain, being variously placed in the 
twelfth and thirteenth cen-turies. In the year 1600 a treatise on alchemy, 
entitled Dicta de Lapide Phitosophico was published at Leyden, bearing on 
its title-page the name of Alanus Insulensis. It was thus ascribed to 
Bernardine, to the
"Universal Doctor," and, by still others, to a German named Alanus. Suppos-
ing the two first-mentioned to be separate and distinct persons. we have 
nevertheless no proof that either was interested in alchemy  and as for the 
third, there is no proof that he existed at all. On the other hand, we know 
that it was customary at that time to ascribe works of a very inferior 
nature to illustrious persons who had died, and were thus unable to deny 
them. The Dicta de Lapide Philosophico, a work of no great alchemistical 
value, on account of its vague and indefinite nature, may be, and probably 
is, a spurious work, wrongly ascribed to Alain.

Alamut : A mountain in Persia.  (See Assassins.)

Alary (Francois) : A visionary, who had printed at Rouen in 1701, The 
Prophecy of Count Bombaste, (Chevalier de la Rose-Croix), nephew of 
Paracelsus, (published in 1609 on the birth of Louis the Great.)

Alastor : A cruel demon, who, according to Wierius, filled the post of chief 
executioner to the monarch of Hades. The conception of him somewhat 
resembles that of Nemesis. Zoroaster is said to have called him " The 
Executioner." Others confound him with the destroying angel. Evil genies 
were formerly called Alastors. Plutarch says that Cicero, who bore a grudge 
against Augustus, conceived the plan of committing suicide on the emperor's 
hearth, and thus becoming his Alastor.

Albertus Magnus : No fewer than twenty-one folio volumes are attributed to 
this alchemist, and though it is highly improbable that all of them are 
really his, the ascription in several cases resting on but slender evidence, 
those others which are incontestably from his pen, are sufficiently numerous 
to constitute him a surprisingly voluminous writer. It is noteworthy, 
moreover, that according to tradition, he was the inventor of the pistol and 
the cannon; but, while it is unlikely that the credit is due to him for 
this, the mere fact that he was thus acknowledged indi-cates that his 
scientific skill was recognised by a few, if only a few, of the men of his 
own time.
     Albertus was born at Larvingen, on the Danube, in the year 1205, and 
the term Magnus, which is usually applied to him, is not the result of his 
reputation, but is the Latin equivalent of his family name, de Groot. Like 
many another man destined to become famous, he was distinctly stupid as a 
boy, but from the outset be showed a predilection for religion, and so it 
came about that one night the blessed Virgin appeared to him, whereupon his 
intellect suddenly became metamorphosed, acquiring extraordinary vitality. 
Albertus therefore decided that he must show his gratitude to the Madonna by 
espousing holy orders, and eventually he won eminence in the clerical 
profession, and was made Bishop of Ratisbon; but he held this office for 
only a little while, resigning it that he might give his entire time to 
scientific researches. Thenceforth, until his death, the exact date whereof 
is uncertain, he lived chiefly at a pleasant retreat in Cologne; and it is 
reported that here his mental vigour gradually forsook him, being replaced 
by the dullness which characterised him as a youth.
     Albertus was repeatedly charged by some of his un-friendly 
contemporaries with holding communications with the devil, and practising 
the craft of magic; while apropos of his reputed leanings in this 
particular, a curious story is recounted in an early history of the 
University of Paris. The alchemist, it seems, had invited some friends to 
his house at Cologne, among them being William, Count of Holland, and when 
the guests arrived they were amazed to find that, though the season was mid-
winter and the ground was covered with snow, they were expected to partake 
of a repast outside in the garden. Great chagrin was manifested by 
everybody, while some even declared themselves insulted; but their host bade 
them be seated, assuring them that all would be well. They continued to be 
dubious withal, yet they took their places, and hardly had they began to eat 
and drink ere their annoyance vanished, for lo! the snow around them melted 
away, the sun shone brightly, the birds sang, and summer ap-peared to be 
reigning indeed.
     Michael Maier, the author of Museum Chimicum and numerous other 
alchemistic works, declares that Albertus succeeded in evolving the 
philosopher's stone, and that ere his death he handed it over to his 
distinguished pupil, St. Thomas Aquinas, who subsequently destroyed the 
precious article, suspecting it to be a contrivance of the devil. The 
alleged discoverer himself says nothing on this subject, but, in his De 
Rebus Metallisis et Mineralibus, he tells how he had personally tested some 
gold which had been manufactured by an alchemist, and which resisted many 
searching fusions. And, be this story true or not, Albertus was certainly an 
able scientist, while it is clear that his learning ultimately gained wide 
recognition, for a collected edition of his vast writings was issued at 
Leyden so late as 1653.

Albigenses : A sect which originated in the south of France in the twelfth 
century. They were so called from one of their territorial centres, that of 
Albi. It is probable that their heresy came originally from Eastern Europe, 
and they were often designated Bulgarians, and undoubt-edly kept up 
intercourse with certain secretaries of Thrace, the Bogomils; and they are 
sometimes connected with the Paulicians. It is difficult to form any exact 
idea of their doctrines, as Albigensian texts are rare, and contain little 
concerning their ethics, but we know that they were strongly opposed to the 
Roman Catholic Church, and protested against the corruption of its clergy. 
But it is not as a religious body that we have to deal with the Albigenses 
here, but to consider whether or not their cult possessed any occult 
significance. It has been claimed by their opponents that they admitted two 
fundamental principles, good and bad, saying that God had produced Lucifer 
from Himself; that indeed Lucifer was the son of God who revolted against 
Him; that he had carried with him a rebellious party of angels, who were 
driven from Heaven along with him; that Lucifer in. his exile had created 
this world with its inhabitants, where he reigned, and where all was evil. 
It is alleged that they further believed that God for the re-establishment 
of order had produced a second son, who was Jesus Christ. Further-more the 
Catholic writers on the Albigenses charged them with believing that the 
souls of men were demons lodged in mortal bodies in punishment of their 
crimes.
All this is, of course, mere tradition, and we may be sure that tile dislike 
of the Albigenses for the irregularities then current in the Roman Church, 
brought such charges on their heads. They were indeed the lineal ancestors 
of Protestantism. A crusade was brought against them by Pope Innocent III., 
and wholesale massacres took place. The Inquisition was also let loose upon 
them, and they were driven to hide in the forests and among the mountains, 
where, like the Covenanters of Scotland, they held sur-reptitious meetings. 
The Inquisition terrorised the district in which they had dwelt so 
thoroughly that the very name of Albigenses was practically blotted out, and 
by the year 1330, the records of the Holy Office show no further writs 
issued against the heretics,

Albigerius : A Carthaginian soothsayer mentioned by St. Augustine. He would 
fall into strange ecstacies in which his soul, separated from his body, 
would travel abroad and find out what was taking place in distant parts. He 
could read people's inmost thoughts, and discover anything he wished to 
learn. These wonders were ascribed to the agency of the Devil. St. Augustine 
also speaks of another case, in which the possessed man was ill of a fever. 
Though not in a trance, but wide awake, he saw the priest who was coming to 
visit him while he was yet six leagues away, and told the company assembled 
round his couch the exact moment when the good man would arrive.

Albumazar : An astrologer of the ninth century, born in Korassan, known 
principally by his astrological treatise, entitled, Thousands of Years, in 
which he declares that the world could only have been created when the seven 
planets were in conjunction in the first degree of the ram, and that the end 
of the world would take place when these seven planets (the {number has now 
risen to twelve) will be together in the last degree of the fish. Several of 
Albuma-zar's treatises on astrology have been printed in Germany, of which 
one was his Tractus Florum Astrologiae, 
Augsburg, 1488.  (See Astrology.)

Alchemist, A Modern Egyptian : A correspondent writing to the Liverpool Post 
of Saturday, November 28th, 1907, gives an interesting description of a 
veritable Egyptian alchemist whom he had encountered in Cairo not long 
before, as follows: ' I was not slow in seizing an opportun-ity of making 
the acquaintance of the real alchemist living in Cairo, which the winds of 
chance had blown in my dir-ection. He received me in his private house in 
the native quarter, and I was delighted to observe that the appearance of 
the man was in every way in keeping with my notions of what an alchemist 
should be. Clad in the flowing robes of a graduate of Al Azhar, his long 
grey beard giving him a truly venerable aspect, the sage by the eager, far-
away expression of his eyes, betrayed the mind of the dreamer, of the man 
lost to the meaner comforts of the world in his devotion to the secret 
mysteries of the universe. After the customary salaams, the learned man 
informed me that he was seeking three things-the philosopher's stone, at 
whose touch all metal should become gold-the elixir of life, and the 
universal solvent which would dissolve all substances as water dissolves 
sugar; the last, he assured me, he had indeed discovered a short time since. 
I was well aware of the reluctance of the mediaeval alchemists to divulge 
their secrets, believing as they did that the possession of them by the 
vulgar would bring about ruin of states and the fall of divinely constituted 
princes; and I feared that the reluctance of the modern alchemist to divulge 
any secrets to a stranger and a foreigner would be no less. However, I drew 
from my pocket Sir William Crookes's spinthariscope -a small box containing 
a particle of radium highly magnified-and showed it to the sheikh. When he 
applied it to his eye and beheld the wonderful phenomenon of this dark speck 
flashing out its fiery needles on all sides, he was lost in wonder, and when 
I assured him that it would retain this property for a thousand years, he 
hailed me 55 a fellow-worker, and as one who had indeed penetrated into the 
secrets of the world. His reticence disappeared at once, and he began to 
tell me the aims and methods of alchemical research, which were indeed the 
same as those of the ancient alchemists of yore. His universal solvent he 
would not show me, but assured me of its efficacy. I asked him in what he 
kept it if it dissolved all things. He replied ' In wax,' this being the one 
ex-ception. I suspected that he had found some hydro-fluoric acid, which 
dissolves glass, and so has to be kept in wax bottles, but said nothing to 
dispel his illusion.
     “The next day I was granted the unusual privilege of inspecting the 
sheikh's laboratory, and duly presented myself at the appointed time. My 
highest expectations were fulfilled; everything was exactly what an 
alchemist's laboratory should be. Yes, there was the sage, surrounded by his 
retorts, alembics, crucibles, furnace, and bellows, and, best of all, 
supported by familiars of gnome-like appearance, squatting on the ground, 
one blowing the fire (a task to be performed daily for six hours 
continuously), one pounding substances in a mortar, and another seem-ingly 
engaged in doing odd jobs. Involuntarily my eyes sought the pentacle 
inscribed with the mystic word ' Abra-cadabra,' but here I was disappointed, 
for the black arts had no place in this laboratory. One of the familiars had 
been on a voyage of discovery to London, where he bought a few alchemical 
materials; another had explored Spain and Morocco, without finding any 
alchemists, and the third had indeed found alchemists in Algeria, though 
they had steadily guarded their secrets. After satisfying my curiosity in a 
general way, I asked the sage to explain the principles of his researches 
and to tell me on what his theories were based. I was delighted to find that 
his ideas were precisely those of the medieval alchemists namely, that all 
metals are debased forms of the original gold, which is the only pure, non-
composite metal; all nature strives to return to its original purity, and 
all metals would return to gold if they could ; nature is simple and not 
complex, and works upon one principle, namely, that of sexual reproduction. 
It was not easy, as will readily be believed, to follow the mystical 
explanations of the sheikh. Air was referred to by him as the 'vulture,' 
fire as the 'scorpion,' water as the ' serpent,' and earth as 'calacant'; 
and only after considerable cross-questioning and confusion of mind was I 
able to disentangle his argu-ments. Finding his notions so entirely 
medieval, I was anxious to discover whether he was familiar with the 
phlogistic theory of the seventeenth century. The alchem-ists of old had 
noticed that the earthy matter which remains when a metal is calcined is 
heavier than the metal itself, and they explained this by the hypothesis, 
that the metal contained a spirit known as 'phlogiston,' which becomes 
visible when it escapes from the metal or com-bustible substance in the form 
of flame; thus the presence of the phlogiston lightened the body just as gas 
does, and on its being expelled, the body gained weight. I accord-ingly 
asked the chemist whether he had found that iron gains weight when it rusts, 
an experiment lie had ample means of making. But no, he had not yet reached 
the seventeenth century; he had not observed the fact, but was none the less 
ready with his answer; the rust of iron was an impurity proceeding from 
within, and which did not effect the weight of the body in that way. He 
declared that a few days would bring the realisation of his hopes, and that 
he would shortly send me a sample of the philo-sopher's stone and of the 
divine elixir; but although his promise was made some weeks since, I have 
not yet scene the fateful discoveries."

Alchemy : The science by aid of which the chemical philo-sophers of medieval 
times attempted to transmute the baser metals into gold and silver. There is 
considerable divergence of opinion as to the etymology of the word, but it 
would seem to be derived from the Arabic al=the, and kimya=chemistry, which 
in turn derives from late Greek chemeia=chemistry, from chumeia a mingling, 
or cheein "to pour out," or "mix," Aryan root ghu, to pour, whence the word 
"gush."  Mr. A. Wallis Budge in his Egyptian Magic, however, states that it 
is possible that it may be derived from the Egyptian word khemeia, that is 
to say " the preparation of the black ore," or "powder," which was regarded 
as the active principle in the transmutation of metals. To this name the 
Arabs affixed the article al, thus giving al-khemeia, or alchemy. 
     History of Alchemy.-From an early period the Egypt-ians possessed the 
reputation of being skilful workers in metals, and, according to Greek 
writers, they were con-versant with their transmutation, employing 
quicksilver in the process of separating gold and silver from the native 
matrix. The resulting oxide was supposed to possess marvellous powers, and 
it was thought that there resided within it the individualities of the 
various metals-that in it their various substances were incorporated. This 
black powder was mystically identified with the under-world form of the god 
Osiris, and consequently was credited with magical properties. Thus there 
grew up in Egypt the belief that magical powers existed in fluxes and 
alloys. Probably such a belief existed throughout Europe in con-nection with 
the bronze-working castes of its several races. (See Shelta Thari.) It was 
probably in the Byzantium of the fourth century, however, that alchemical 
science received embryonic form. There is little doubt that Egyptian 
tradition, filtering through Alexandrian Hellenic sources was the foundation 
upon which the infant science was built, and this is borne out by the 
circumstance that the art was attributed to Hermes Trismegistus (q.v.) and 
supposed to be contained in its entirety in his works. The Arabs, after 
their conquest of Egypt in the seventh century, carried on the researches of 
the Alexandrian school, and through their instrumentality the art was 
brought to Morocco and thus in the eighth century to Spain, where it 
flourished exceedingly.  Indeed, Spain from the ninth to the eleventh 
century became the repository of alchemical science, and the colleges of 
Seville, Cordova, and Granada were the centres from which this science 
radiated throughout Europe. The first practical alchemist may be said to 
have been the Arabian Geber (q.v.), who flourished 720-750. From his Summa 
Perfectionis, we may be justified in assuming that alchemical science was 
already matured in his day, and that he drew his inspiration from a still 
older unbroken line of adepts. He was followed by Avicenna, Mesna and Rhasis 
(q.v.), and in France by Alain of Lisle, Arnold de Villanova and Jean de 
Meung (q.v.) the troubadour; in England by Roger Bacon and in Spain itself 
by Raymond Lully. Later, in French alchemy the most illustrious names are 
those of Flamel (b. ca. 1330), and Bernard Trevisan (li. Ca. 1406) after 
which the centre of interest changes to Germany and in some measure to 
England, ii, which countries Paracelsus, Khunrath (ca. 1560), Maier (ca. 
1568), Bohme, Van Helmont, the Brabanter (1553), Ripley, Norton, Dalton, 
Charnock, and Fludd kept the alchemical flame burning brightly. It is 
surprising how little altera-tion we find throughout the period between the 
seventh and the seventeenth centuries, the heyday of alchemy, in the theory 
and practice of the art. The same sentiments and processes are found 
expressed in the later alchemical authorities as in the earliest, and a 
wonderful unanimity as regards the basic canons of the great art is evinced 
by the hermetic students of all time. On the introduction of chemistry as a 
practical art, alchemical science fell into desuetude and disrepute, owing 
chiefly to the number of charlatans practising it, and by the beginning of 
the eighteenth century, as a school, it may be said to have become defunct. 
Here and there, however, a solitary student of the art lingered,. and the 
department of this article on " Modern Alchemy" will demonstrate that the 
science has to a great extent revived during modern times, although it has 
never been quite extinct.
     The Quests of Alchemy. The grand objects of alchemy were (i) the 
discovery of a process by which the baser metals might be transmuted into 
gold and silver;  (2), the discovery of an elixir by which life might be 
prolonged indefinitely; and there may perhaps be added (3), the manufacture 
of an artificial process of human life.  (For the latter see "Homunculus.")
     The Theory and Philosophy of Alchemy. The first ob-jects were to be 
achieved as follows: The transmutation of metals was to be accomplished by a 
powder, stone, or elixir often called the Philosopher's Stone, the 
application of which would effect the transmutation of the baser metals into 
gold or silver, depending upon the length of time of its application. Basing 
their conclusions on a profound examination of natural processes and 
research into the secrets of nature, the alchemists arrived at the axiom 
that nature was divided philosophically into four principal regions, the 
dry, the moist, the warm, the cold, whence all that exists must be derived. 
Nature is also divisible into the male and the female. She is the divine 
breath, the central fire, invisible yet ever active, and is typified by 
sulphur. which is the mercury of the sages, which slowly fructifies under 
the genial warmth of nature. The alchemist must be ingenuous, of a truthful 
disposition, and gifted with patience and prudence, following nature in 
every alchemical performance. He must recollect that like draws to like, and 
must know how to obtain the seed of metals, which is produced by the four 
elements through the will of the Supreme Being and the Imagination of 
Nature. We are told that the original matter of metals is double in its 
essence, being a dry heat combined with a warm moisture, and that air is 
water coagulated by fire, capable of producing a universal dissolvent. These 
terms the neophyte must be cautious of interpreting in their literal sense. 
Great confusion exists iii alchemical nomen-clature, and the gibberish 
employed by the scores of charlatans who in later times pretended to a 
knowledge of alchemical matters did not tend to make things any more clear. 
The beginner must also acquire a thorough knowledge of the manner in which 
metals grow in the bowels of the earth. These are engendered by sulphur, 
which is male, and mercury, which is female, and the crux of alchemy is to 
obtain their seed-a process which the alchemistical philosophers have nut 
described with any degree of clarity. The physical theory of transmutation 
is based on the composite character of metals, and on the presumed existence 
of a substance which, applied to matter, exalts and perfects it. This, 
Eugenius Philale-thes and others call " The Light." The elements of all 
metals are similar, differing only in purity and pro-portion. The entire 
trend of the metallic kingdom is towards the natural manufacture of gold, 
and the pro-duction of the baser metals is only accidental as the result of 
an unfavourable environment. The Philosopher's Stone is the combination of 
the male and female seeds which beget gold. The composition of these is so 
veiled by symbolism as to make their identification a matter of 
impossibility. Waite, summarizing the alchemical process once the secret of 
the stone is unveiled, says
     Given the matter of the stone and also the necessary. vessel, the 
processes which must be then undertaken to accomplish the magnum opus are 
described with moderate perspicuity. There is the calcination or purgation 
of the stone, in which kind is worked with kind for the space of a 
philosophical year. There is dissolution which prepares the way for 
congelation, and which is performed during the black state of the mysterious 
matter. it is accom-plished by water which does not wet the hand. There is 
the separation of the subtle and the gross. which is to be performed by 
means of heat. In the conjunction which follows, the elements are duly and 
scrupulously combined. Putrefaction afterwards takes place,
'Without which pole no seed may multiply.'
"Then, in the subsequent congelation the white colour appears, which is one 
of the signs of success.  It becomes more pronounced in cibation. In 
sublimation the body is spiritualised, the spirit made corporeal. and again 
a more glittering whiteness is apparent. Fermentation afterwards fixes 
together the alchemical earth and water, and causes the mystic medicine to 
flow like wax. The matter is then augmented with the alchemical spirit of 
life, and the exaltation of the philosophic earth is accomplished by the 
natural rectification of its elements. When these pro-cesses have been 
successfully completed, the mystic stone will have passed through three 
chief stages characterised by different colours, black, white, and red, 
after which it is capable of infinite multication, and when projected on 
mercury, it will absolutely transmute it, the resulting gold bearing every 
test. The base metals made use of must be purified to insure the success of 
the operation. The process for the manufacture of silver is essentially 
similar, but the resources of the matter are not carried to so high a 
degree.
     "According to the Commentary on the Ancient War of the Knights the 
transmutations performed by the perfect stone are so absolute that no trace 
remains of the original metal. It cannot, however, destroy gold, nor exalt 
it into a more perfect metallic substance; it, therefore, transmutes it into 
a medicine a thousand times superior to any virtues which can be extracted 
from it in its vulgar state. This medicine becomes a most potent agent in 
the exaltation of base metals."
     There are not wanting authorities who deny that the transmutation of 
metals was the grand object of alchemy, and who infer from the alchemistical 
writings that the end of the art was the spiritual regeneration of man. Mrs. 
Atwood, author of A Suggestive Inquiry into the Hermetic Mystery, and an 
American writer named Hitchcock are perhaps the chief protagonists of the 
belief that by spiritual processes akin to those' of the chemical processes 
of alchemy, the soul of man may be purified and exalted. But both commit the 
radical error of stating that the alchemical writers did not aver that the 
transmutation of base metal into gold was their grand end. None of the 
passages they quote, is inconsistent with the physical object of alchemy, 
and in a work, The Marrow of Alchemy, stated to be by Eugenius Philalethes, 
it is laid down that the real quest is for gold. It is constantly impressed 
upon the reader, however, in the perusal of esteemed alchemical works, that 
only those who are instructed by God can achieve the grand secret. Others, 
again, state that a tyro may possibly stumble upon it, but that unless he is 
guided by an adept he has small chance of achieving the grand arcanum. It 
will be obvious to the tyro, however, that nothing can ever be achieved by 
trusting to the alle-gories of the adepts or the many charlatans who crowded 
the ranks of the art. Gold may have been made, or it may not, but the truth 
or fallacy of the alchemical method lies with modern chemistry. The 
transcendental view of alchemy, however, is rapidly gaining ground, and pro-
bably originated in the comprehensive nature of the Hermetic theory and the 
consciousness in the alchemical mind that what might with success be applied 
to nature could also be applied to man with similar results. Says Mr. Waite: 
"The gold of the philosopher is not a metal, on the other hand, man is a 
being who possesses within himself the seeds of a perfection which he has 
never realised, and that he therefore corresponds to those metals which the 
Hermetic theory supposes to be capable of develop-ment. It has been 
constantly advanced that the con-version of lead into gold was only the 
assumed object of alchemy, and that it was in reality in search of a process 
for developing the latent possibilities in the subject man." At the same 
time, it must be admitted that tile cryptic character of alchemical language 
was probably occasioned by a fear on the part of the alchemical mystic that 
he might lay himself open through his magical opinions to the rigours of the 
law.
     The Elixir of Life has been specially treated elsewhere. 
     Records of Alleged Actual  Transmutation. Several records of alleged 
transmutations of base metals into gold are in existence. These were 
achieved by Nicholas Flamel, Van Helmont, Martini, Richthausen, and Sethon. 
For a detailed account of the methods employed the reader is referred to the 
several articles on these hermetists. In nearly every case the transmuting 
element was a mysterious powder or the "Philosophers' Stone."
     Modern Alchemy. That alchemy has been studied in modern times there can 
be no doubt. M. Figuier in his L'Alchimie et les Alchimistes, dealing with 
the subject of modern alchemy, as expressed by the initiates of the first 
half of the nineteenth century, states that many French alchemists of his 
time regarded the discoveries of modern science as merely so many evidences 
of the truth of the doctrines they embraced. Throughout Europe, he says, the 
positive alchemical doctrine had many adherents at the end of the eighteenth 
century and the beginning of the nineteenth. Thus a "vast. association of 
alchemists," founded in Westphalia in 1790, continued to flourish in thc 
year 1819, under the name of the " Hermetic Society." In 1837, an alchemist 
of Thuringia presented to the Societe Industrielle of Weimar a tincture 
which he averred would effect metallic transmutation. About the same time 
several French journals announced a public course of lectures on hermetic 
philosophy by a professor of the University of Munich. He further states 
that Hanoverian and Bavarian families pursued in common the search for the 
grand arcanum. Paris, however, was regarded as the alchemistical Mecca. 
There dwelt many theoretical alchemists and " empirical adepts." The first 
pursued the arcanum through the medium of books, the others engaged in 
practical efforts to effect transmutation. M. Figuier states that in the 
forties of last century he frequented the laboratory of a certain Monsieur 
L., which was the rendezvous of the alchemists of Paris. When Monsieur L's 
pupils left the laboratory for the day the modern adepts dropped in one by 
one, and Figuier relates how deeply impressed he was by the appearance and 
costumes of these strange men. In the daytime he fre-quently encountered 
them in the public libraries, buried in gigantic folios, and in the evening 
they might be seen pacing the solitary bridges with eyes fixed in vague con-
templation upon the first pale stars of night. A long cloak usually covered 
their meagre limbs, and their untrimmed beards and matted locks lent them a 
wild appearance. They walked with a solemn and measured gait, and used the 
figures of speech employed by the medical illumines. Their expression was 
generally a mixture of the most ardent hope and a - fixed despair.
     Among the adepts who sought the laboratory of Monsieur L., Figuier 
remarked especially a young man, in whose habits and language he could see 
nothing in common with those of his strange companions. He confounded the 
wisdom of the alchemical adept with the tenets of the modern scientist in 
the most singular fashion, and meeting him one day at the gate of the 
Observatory, M. Figuier renewed the subject of their last discussion, 
deploring that "a man of his gifts could pursue the sem-blance of a 
chimera." 'Without replying, the young adept led him into the Observatory 
garden, and proceeded to reveal to him the mysteries of modern alchemical 
science.
     The young man proceeded to fix a limit to the researches of the modern 
alchemists. Gold, he said, according to the ancient authors, has three 
distinct properties: (t) that of resolving the baser metals into itself, and 
interchanging and metamorphosing all metals into one another; (2) the curing 
of afflictions and the prolongation of life; (3), as a spiritus mundi to 
bring mankind into rapport with the supermundane spheres. Modern alchemists, 
he continued, reject the greater part of these ideas, especially those con-
nected with spiritual contact. The object of modern alchemy might be reduced 
to the search for a substance having the power to transform and transmute 
all other substances one into another-in short, to discover that medium so 
well known to the alchemists of old and lost to us. This was a perfectly 
feasible proposition. In the four principal substances of oxygen, hydrogen, 
carbon, and azote, we have the tetractus of Pythagoras and the tetragram of 
the Chaldeans and Egyptians. All the sixty elements are referable to these 
original four. The ancient alchemical theory established the fact that all 
the metals are the same in their composition, that all are formed from 
sulphur and mercury, and that the difference between them is according to 
the proportion of these substances in their composition. Further, all the 
products of minerals present in their composition complete identity with 
those substances most opposed to them. Thus fulminating acid contains 
precisely the same 'quantity of carbon, oxygen, and azote as cyanic acid, 
and  cyanhydric" acid does not differ from formate ammoniac. This new 
property of matter is known as " isomerism." M. Figuier's friend then 
proceeds to quote in support of his thesis and operations and experiments of 
M. Dumas, a celebrated French savant, as well as those of Prout, and other 
English chemists of standing.
     Passing to consider the possibility of isomerism in elementary as well 
as in compound substances, he points out to M. Figuier that if the theory of 
isomerism can apply to such bodies, the transmutation of metals ceases to be 
a wild, unpractical dream, and becomes a scientific possibil-ity, the 
transformation being brought about by a mole-cular rearrangement. Isomerism 
can be established in the case of compound substances by chemical analysis, 
showing the identity of their constituent parts. In the case of metals it 
can be proved by the comparison of the properties of isomeric bodies with 
the properties of metals, in order to discover whether they have any common 
char-acteristics. Such experiments, he continued, had been conducted by M. 
Dumas, with the result that isomeric sub-stances were found to have equal 
equivalents, or equival-ents which were exact multiples one of another. This 
characteristic is also a feature of metals. Gold and osmium have identical 
equivalents, as have platinum and iridium. The equivalent of cobalt is 
almost the same as that of nickel, and the semi-equivalent of tin is equal 
to the equivalent of the two preceding metals.
     M. Dumas, speaking before the British Association, had shown that when 
three simple bodies displayed great analogies in their properties, such as 
chlorine, bromide, and iodine, barium, strontium, and calcium, the chemical 
equivalent of the intermediate body is represented by the arithmetical mean 
between the equivalents of the other two. Such a statement well showed the 
isomerism of ele-mentary substances, and proved that metals. however 
dissimilar in outward appearance, were composed of the same matter 
differently arranged and proportioned. This theory successfully demolishes 
the difficulties in the way of transmutation. Again, Dr. Prout says that the 
chemical equivalents of nearly all elementary substances are the multiples 
of one among them. Thus, if the equivalent of hydrogen be taken for the 
unit, the equivalent of every other substance will be an exact multiple of 
it-carbon will be represented by six, azote by fourteen, oxygen by sixteen, 
zinc by thirty-two. But, pointed out M. Figuier’s friend, if the molecular 
masses in compound substances have so simple a connection, does it not go to 
prove that all natural bodies are formed of one principle, differently 
arranged and condensed to produce all known compounds?
If transmutation is thus theoretically possible, it only remains to show by 
practical experiment that it is strictly in accordance with chemical laws, 
and by no means in-clines to the supernatural. At this juncture the young 
alchemist proceeded to liken the action of the Philosophers' Stone on metals 
to that of a ferment on organic matter. When metals are melted and brought 
to red heat, a mole-cular change may be produced analogous to fermentation. 
Just as sugar, under the influence of a ferment, may be changed into lactic 
acid without altering its constituents, so metals can alter their character 
under the influence of the Philosophers' Stone. The explanation of the 
latter case is no more difficult than that of the former. The ferment does 
not take any part in the chemical changes it brings about, and no 
satisfactory explanation of its effects can be found either in the laws of 
affinity or in the forces of electricity, light, or heat. As with the 
ferment, the required quantity of the Philosophers' Stone is infinitesimal. 
Medicine, philosophy, every modern science was at one time a source of such 
errors and extravagances as are associated with medieval alchemy, but they 
are not therefore neglected and despised. Wherefore, then, should we be 
blind to the scientific nature of transmutation ?
     One of the foundations of alchemical theories was that minerals grew 
and developed in the earth, like organic things. It was always the aim of 
nature to produce gold, the most precious metal, but when circumstances were 
not favourable the baser metals resulted. The desire of the old alchemists 
was to surprise nature's secrets, and thus attain the ability to do in a 
short period what nature takes years to accomplish. Nevertheless, the 
medieval alchem-ists appreciated the value of time in their experiments as 
modern alchemists never do. M. Figuier's friend urged him not to condemn 
these exponents of the hermetic philosophy for their metaphysical 
tendencies, for, he said, there are facts in our sciences which can only be 
explained in that light. If, for instance, copper be placed in air or water, 
there will be no result, but if a touch of some acid be added, it will 
oxidise. The explanation is that "the acid provokes oxidation of the metal, 
because it has an affinity for' the oxide which tends to form "-a material 
fact almost metaphysical in its production, and only explicable thereby.
     He concluded his argument ','with an appeal for tolerance towards the 
medieval alchemists, whose work is under-rated because it is not properly 
understood.  (See also Elixir of Life, Homunculus, and the many lives of the 
alchemists throughout this book.)

Alchindi : (See Arabs.)

Alchindus : An Arabian doctor of the eleventh century, placed by some 
authorities among the number of magicians, but regarded by others as merely 
a superstitious writer. He used charmed words and combinations of figures in 
order to cure his patients. Demonologists maintained that the devil was 
responsible for his power, and based their statements on the fact that he 
had written a work entitled The Theory of the Magic Arts. He was probably, 
however, nothing more formidable than a natural philosopher at a time when 
all matter of science and philosophy were held in suspicion. Some of his 
theories were of a magical nature, it is true, as when he essayed to explain 
the phenomena of dreams by saying that they were the work of the elementals, 
who acted their strange fantasies before the mind of the sleeper as actors 
play in a theatre. But on the whole there is little to connect him with the 
practice of magic.

Aldinach : An Egyptian demon, whom the demonologists picture as presiding 
over the tempests, earthquakes, rain-storms, hail-storms, etc. It is he, 
also, who sinks ships. When he appears in visible form he takes the shape of 
a woman.

Alectorius : This stone is about the size of a bean, clear as crystal, 
sometimes with veins the colour of flesh. It is said to be taken from the 
cock's stomach. It renders its owner courageous and invincible, brings him 
wealth, assuages thirst, and makes the husband love his wife, or, as another 
author has it, "makes the woman agreeable to her hus-band." But its most 
wonderful property is, that it helps to regain a lost kingdom and acquire a 
foreign one.

Alectryomancy, or Alectormancy : An ancient method of divination with a 
cock. In practising it, a circle must be made in a good close place, and 
this must be divided equally into as many parts as there are letters in the 
alphabet. Then a wheat-corn must be placed on every letter, beginning with 
A, during which the depositor must repeat a certain verse. This must be done 
when the sun or moon is in Aries or Leo. A young cock, all white, should 
then be taken, his claws should be cut off, and these he should be forced to 
swallow with a little scroll of parchment made of lamb-skin upon which has 
been previously written certain words. Then the diviner holding the cock 
should repeat a form of incantation. Next, on placing the cock within the 
circle, he must repeat two verses of the Psalms, which are exactly the 
midmost of the seventy-two verses mentioned under the head of "Onimancy," 
and it is to be noted on the authority of an ancient Rabbi, that there is 
nothing in these seventy-two which is not of some use in the kaba-listical 
secret. The cock being within the circle, it must be observed from which 
letters he pecks the grains, and upon these others must be placed, because 
some names and words contain the same letters twice or thrice. These letters 
should be written down and put together, and they will infallibly reveal the 
name of the person concerning whom inquiry has been made; it is said, though 
the story is doubted, that the magician lamblicus used this art to discover 
the person who should succeed Valens Caesar in the empire, but the bird 
picking up but four of the grains, those which lay on the letters T h e o, 
left it uncertain whether Theodosius, Theodotus, Theodorus, or Theodectes, 
was the person designed.  Valens, however, learning what had' been done, put 
to death several individuals whose names unhappily began with those letters, 
and the magician, to avoid the effects of his resentment, took a draught of 
poison.  A kind of Alectromancy was also some-times practised upon the 
crowing of the cock, and' the periods at which it was heard.
     Ammianus Marcellinus describes the ritual which ac-companied this act 
rather differently. The sorcerers commenced by placing  a basin made of 
different metals on the ground and drawing around it at equal distances the 
letters of the alphabet.  Then he who possessed the deepest occult 
knowledge, advanced, en-veloped in a long veil, holding in his hand branches 
of vervain, and emitting dreadful cries, accompanied by hideous convulsions. 
He stopped all at once before the magic basin, and became rigid and 
motionless. He struck on a letter several times with the branch in his hand, 
and then upon another, until he had selected sufficient letters to form a 
heroic verse, which was then given out to
the assembly. The Emperor Valens, informed of this circumstance, was ill-
pleased that the infernal powers should have been consulted regarding his 
destiny. Indeed, he went further, for with unexampled severity, he pro-
scribed not only all the sorcerers, but all the philosophers in Rome, and 
punished them so severely that many per-ished.
     In the fourth song of the Caquet Bonbec, of Jonquieres, a poet of the 
fourteenth century, the details of an operation in Alectryomancy are exactly 
and curiously set forth.

Aleuromancy : A species of divination practised with flour. Sentences were 
written on slips of paper, each of which was rolled up in a little ball of 
flour. These were thoroughly mixed up nine times, and divided amongst the 
curious, who were waiting to learn their fate. Apollo, who was supposed to 
preside over this form of divination, was surnamed Aleuromantis. So late as 
the nineteenth century the custom lingered in remoter districts.

Alexander  ab  Alexandro :  (Alessandro Alessandri.) A Neapolitan lawyer, 
who died in 1523. He published a dissertation on the marvellous, entitled De 
Rebus Admira-bilibus, in which he recounts prodigies which happened in 
Italy, dreams which were verified, the circumstances connected with many 
apparitions and phantoms, which he says that he beheld himself. He followed 
this dissertation with his celebrated work Genialium Dierum, in which he 
recounts with much credulity many prodigious happenings. He tells how one 
evening he set out to join a party of several friends at a house in Rome 
which had been haunted for a long time by spectres and demons. In the middle 
of the night, when all of them were assembled in one chamber with many 
lights, there appeared to them a dreadful spectre, who called to them in a 
loud voice, and threw about the ornaments in the room. One of the most 
intrepid of the company advanced in front of the spectre bearing a light, on 
which it disappeared. Several times afterwards the same apparition re-
entered through the door. Alexander, who had been lying on a couch, found 
that the demon had slid underneath it, and on rising from it, he beheld a 
great black arm appear on a table in front of him. By this time several of 
the company had retired to rest, and the lights were out, but torches were 
brought in answer to their cries of alarm, on which the spectre opened the 
door, slid past the advancing domestics, and disappeared. Alexander visited 
many other haunted houses, but he appears to have been easily duped, and by 
no means the sort of person to undertake psychical research.  (See 
Avicenna.)

Alexander of Tralles : A physician born at Tralles in Asia Minor, in the 
sixth century, very learned, and with a leaning towards medico-magical 
practice. He prescribed for his patients amulets and charmed words, as, for 
instance, when he says in his Practice of Medicine that the figure of 
Hercules strangling the Nemean lion, graven on a stone and set in a ring, 
was an excellent cure for colic. He also claimed that charms and 
philacteries were efficacious remedies for gout, fevers, etc.

Alexander the Paphlagonian : The oracle of Abonotica, an obscure 
Paphlagonian town, who for nearly twenty years held absolute supremacy in 
the empirical art. Born about the end of the Second .century, a native of 
Abonotica, he possessed but little in the way of worldly wealth. His sole 
capital consisted in his good looks, fine presence, exquisite voice, and a 
certain talent for fraud, which he was soon to turn to account in an 
extraordinary manner. His idea was to institute a new oracle, and he fixed 
upon Chalcedon as a suitable place to commence operations. Finding no great 
encouragement there he made a fresh start by setting afoot a rumour to the 
effect that Apollo and his son AEscula-pius intended shortly to take up 
residence at Abonotica. Naturally, the rumour at length reached the ears of 
his fellow-townsmen, who promptly set to work on a temple meet for the 
reception of the gods. The way was thus prepared for Alexander, who 
proceeded to Abonotica, diligently advertising his skill as a prophet, so 
that on his arrival people from many neighbouring towns applied to him, and 
ere long his fame had spread as far as Rome. We are told that the Emperor 
Aurelius himself consulted Alexander before undertaking an important 
military enterprise.
     Lucian gives a suppositions explanation of the Paphla-gonian prophet's 
remarkable popularity. Alexander, he says, came in the course of his early 
travels to Pella, in Macedon, where he found a unique breed of serpents, 
large, beautiful, and so tame and harmless that they were allowed by the 
inhabitants to enter their houses and play with children. A plan took shape 
in his brain which was to help him to attain the fame lie craved.  Selecting 
the largest and finest specimen of the Macedonian snakes that he could find, 
he carried it secretly to his destination. The temple which the credulous 
natives of Abonotica had raised to Apollo was surrounded by a moat, and 
Alex-ander, ever ready to seize an opportunity wherever it presented itself, 
emptied a goose-egg of its contents, placed within the. shell a newly-
hatched serpent, and sunk it in the moat. He then impressively informed the 
people that Apollo had arrived. Making for the moat with all speed. followed 
by a curious multitude, lie scooped up the egg, and in full vie' V of the 
people, broke the shell and exposed to their admiring eyes a little, 
wriggling serpent. When a few days had elapsed he judged the time ripe for a 
second demonstration. Gathering together a huge crowd from every part of 
Paphlagonia, he emerged from the temple with the large Macedonian snake 
coiled about his neck. By an ingenious arrangement the head of the serpent 
was concealed under the prophet's arm, and an artificial head, somewhat 
resembling that of a human being, allowed to protrude. The assembly was much 
astonished to find that the tiny serpent of a few days ago had already 
attained such remarkable proportions and possessed the face of a human 
being, and they appeared to have little doubt that it was indeed Apollo come 
to Abonotica.
     By means of ingenious mechanical contrivances the serpent was 
apparently made to reply to questions put to it. In other cases scaled rolls 
containing the questions were handed to the oracle and returned with the 
seals intact and an appropriate answer written inside.
     His audacity and ready invention enabled Alexander to impose at will 
upon the credulous people of his time, and these, combined with a strong and 
attractive personality, won, and preserved for him his remarkable 
popularity, as they have done for other "prophets" before and since.

Alfarabi : (d. 954.) An adept of remarkable gifts and an extensive knowledge 
of all the sciences; born at Othrar (or, as it was then called, Faral), in 
Asia Minor. His name was 
Abou-Nasr-Mohammed-Ibn-Tarkaw, but he received, from the town of his birth, 
his better-known appellation of Farabi, or Alfarabi.  Though he was of 
Turkish extrac-tion, a desire to perfect himself in Arabic, led him to 
Bagdad, where he assiduously studied the Greek philoso-phers under Abou 
Bachar Maltey. He next stayed for a time in Hanan, where he learned logic 
from a Christian physician. Having far surpassed his fellow-scholars, he 
left Hanan and drifted at last to Egypt. During his wanderings lie came in 
contact with all the most learned philosophers of his time, and himself 
wrote books on philosophy, mathematics, astronomy and other sciences, 
besides acquiring proficiency in seventy languages. His treatise on music, 
proving the connection of sound with atmospheric vibrations, and mocking the 
Pythagorean theory of the music of the spheres, attained some celebrity.
     He gained the good-will and patronage of the Sultan of Syria in a 
somewhat curious fashion. While passing through Syria lie visited the court 
of the Sultan, who was at that moment surrounded by grave doctors and 
astrologers, who were discussing abstruse scientific points with the 
potentate. Alfarabi entered the presence of the Sultan in his stained and 
dusty travelling attire (he had been on a pilgrimage to Mecca), and when the 
prince bade him be seated, he, either unaware of, or indifferent to the 
etiquette of court life, sat down boldly on a corner of the royal sofa. The 
monarch, unused to such an informal proceeding, spoke in a little-known 
tongue to a courtier, and bade him remove the presumptuous philosopher. The 
latter, how-ever, astonished him by replying in the same language: Sire, he 
who acts hastily, in haste repents." The Sultan, becoming interested in his 
unconventional guest, questioned him curiously, and learned of the seventy 
languages and other accomplishments of Alfarabi. The sages who were present 
were also astounded at his wide learning. When the prince called at length 
for some music, Alfarabi accompanied the musicians on a lute with such 
marvellous skill and grace that the entire. company was charmed, When he 
struck up a lively measure, the gravest sages could not but dance to it. 
When he changed the melody to a softer lilt, tears sparkled in every eye, 
and at last, with a gentle lullaby, he put the court to sleep. The Sultan 
wished to keep such a valuable philosopher about his court, and some say 
that Alfarabi accepted his patronage and died peacefully in Syria. Others, 
again, maintain that he informed the Sultan that he would never rest till he 
had discovered the secret of the Philosophers' stone, which he believed 
himself on the point of finding. These say that he set out, but was attacked 
and killed by robbers in the woods of Syria.

Alfridarya : A science resembling astrology, which lays down that all the 
planets, in turn influence the life of man. each one governing a certain 
number of years.

Alis de Telleux : In 1528, there was published in Paris a curious book, 
entitled, La merveilleuse histoire de l'esprit qui, depuis naguere, s'est 
apparu au monastere des religieuses de Saint Pierre de Lyon, laquelle est 
pleine de grande ad-miration, comme on pourra vois par la lecture de ce 
present livre, par Adrien de Montalemberi, aumonier du roi Fran-cois Ier. 
This work dealt with the appearance in the monastery of the spirit of Alis 
de Telieux, a nun who had lived there before the reformation of the 
monastery in 1513. Alis, it seems, had led rather a worldly life, following 
pleasure and enjoyment in a manner unbecoming to a nun, finally stealing the 
ornaments from the altar and selling them. After this last enormity, she, of 
course, left the monastery, and for a time continued her disgraceful career 
outside, but before she died she repented of her sins, and through the 
intercession of the Virgin, received pardon. This, however, did not gain for 
her Christian burial, and she was interred without the usual prayers and 
funeral rites. A number of years afterwards, when the monastery was occupied 
by other and better nuns, one of their number, a girl of about eighteen 
years, was aroused from her sleep by the apparition of Sister Alis. For some 
time afterwards the spirit haunted her wherever she went, continually rap-
ping on the ground near where she stood, and even com-municating with the 
interested nuns. From all indications, it was a good. and devout spirit who 
thus entered the monastery, but the good sisters, well versed in the wiles 
of the devil, had their doubts on the subject. The services of the Bishop of 
Lyons and of the narrator, Adrien de Montalembert, were called in to adjure 
the evil spirit. After many prayers and formalities, the spirit of Alis was 
found to be an innocent one, attended by a guardian angel. She answered a 
number of questions regarding her present state and her desire for Christian 
burial, and confirmed the doctrines of the Catholic Church, notably that of 
purgatory, which latter spirit-revelation the author advances triumph-antly 
for the confusion of the Lutherans. The remains of Sister Alis were conveyed 
to consecrated ground, and prayers made for the release of her soul from 
purgatory, but for some reason or other she continued to follow the young 
nun for a time, teaching her, on her last visit, five secret prayers 
composed by St. John the Evangelist.

All Hallow's Eve : One of the former four great Fire festivals in Britain, 
is supposed to have taken place on the 1st of November, when all fires, save 
those of the Druids, were extinguished, from whose altars only the holy fire 
must be purchased by the householders for a certain price. The festival is 
still known in Ireland as Samhein, or La Samon, i.e., the Feast of the Sun, 
while in Scotland, it has assumed the name of Hallowe’en. All Hallow's Eve, 
as observed in the Church of Rome, corresponds with the Feralia of the 
ancient Romans. when they sacrificed in honour of the dead, offered up 
prayers for them. and made oblations to them. In ancient times, this 
festival was celebrated on the twenty-first of February. but the Roman 
Church transferred it in her calendar to the first of November.  It was 
originally designed to give rest and peace to the souls of the departed. In 
some parts of Scotland, it is still customary for young people to kindle 
fires on the tops of hills and rising grounds, and fire of this description 
goes by the name of a" Hallowe’en bleeze." Formerly it was customary to 
surround these bonfires with a circular trench symbolical of the sun. 
Sheriff Barclay tells us that about seventy years ago, while travelling from 
Dunkeld to Aberfeldy on Hallowe’en, he counted thirty fires blazing on the 
hilltops, with the phantom figures of persons dancing round the flames.
     In Perthshire, the " Hallowe'en bleeze  is made in the following 
picturesque fashion. Heath, broom, and dres-sings of flax are tied upon a 
pole. The faggot is then kindled; a youth takes it upon his shoulders and 
carries it about. When the faggot is burned out a second is tied to the pole 
and kindled in the same manner as the former one. Several of these blazing 
faggots are often carried through the villages at the same time.
     Hallowe'en is believed by. the superstitious in Scotland to be a night 
on which the invisible world has peculiar power. His Satanic Majesty is 
supposed to have great latitude allowed him on this anniversary, in common 
with that malignant class of beings known as witches, some of whom, it is 
said, may be seen cleaving the air on broom-sticks, in a manner wondrous to 
behold. Others again, less aerially disposed, jog comfortably along over by-
road and heath, seated on the back of such sleek tabby cats as have kindly 
allowed themselves to be transformed into coal-black steeds for their 
accommodation. The green--robed fays are also said to hold special festive 
meetings at their favourite haunts. The ignorant believe that there is no 
such night in all the year for obtaining an insight into futurity. The 
following are the customs pertaining to this eve of mystic ceremonies: The 
youths and maidens, who engage in the ceremony of Pulling the Green Kail, go 
hand--in-hand, with shut eyes, into a bachelor's or spinster's garden, and 
pull up the first "kail stalks" which come in their way. Should the stalks 
thus secured prove to be of stately growth, straight in stem, and with a 
goodly supply of earth at their roots, the future husbands (or wives) will 
be young, good-looking and rich in proportion. But if the stalks be stunted, 
crooked, and have little or no earth at their roots, the future spouses will 
be found lacking in good looks and fortune. According as the heart or stem 
proves sweet or sour to the taste, so will be the temper of the
future partner. the stalks thus tasted are afterwards placed above the doors 
of the respective houses, and the Christian names of those persons who first 
pass under-neath will correspond with those of the future husbands or wives.
     There is also the custom of Eating the Apple at the Glass. Provide 
yourself with an apple, and, as the clock strikes twelve, go alone into a 
room where there is a looking glass. Cut the apple into small pieces, throw 
one of them over your left shoulder, and advancing to the mirror without 
looking back, proceed to eat the remainder, combing your hair carefully the 
while before the glass. while thus en-gaged, it is said that the face of the 
person you are to marry will be seen peeping over your left shoulder. This  
Hal-lowe'en" game is supposed to be a relic of that form of divination with 
mirrors which was condemned as sorcery by the former Popes.
     The Burning Nuts. Take two nuts and place them in the fire, bestowing 
on one of them your own name; on the other that of the object of your 
affections. Should they burn quietly away, side by side, then the issue of 
your love affair will be prosperous; but if one starts away from the other, 
the result will be unfavourable.
     And for the Sowing Hemp Seed, steal forth alone towards midnight and 
sow a handful of hemp seed, repeating the following rhyme:
“Hemp seed, I sow thee, hemp seed, I sow thee:
And he that is my true love, come behind and harrow me." Then look over your 
left shoulder and you will see the person thus adjured in the act of 
harrowing.
The ceremony of Winnowing Corn must also be gone through in solitude. Go to 
the barn and open both doors, taking them off the hinges if possible, lest 
the being you expect to appear, may close them and do you some injury. Then 
take the instrument used in winnowing corn, and go through all the attitudes 
of letting it down against the wind. Re-peat the operation three times, and 
the figure of your future partner will appear passing in at one door and out 
at the other. Should those engaging in this ceremony be fated to die young, 
it is believed that a coffin, followed by mourners, will enter and pursue 
the too adventurous youth or maiden, who thus wishes to pry into the hidden 
things of the future, round the barn.
     Another is Measuring the Bean Stack. Go three times round a bean stack 
with outstretched arms, as if measuring it, and the third time you will 
clasp in your arms the shade of your future partner.
     Eating the Herring.  Just before retiring to rest eat a raw or roasted 
salt herring, and in your dreams your hus-band (or wife) that is to be, will 
come and offer you a drink of water to quench your thirst.
     Dipping the Shirt Sleeve. Go alone, or in company with others, to a 
stream where "three lairds' lands meet," and dip in the left sleeve of a 
shirt; after this is done not one word must be spoken, otherwise the spell 
is broken. Then put your sleeve to dry before your bedroom fire. Go to bed, 
but be careful to remain awake, and you will see the form of your future 
helpmate enter and turn the sleeve in order that the other side may get 
dried.
     The Three Plates. Place three plates in a row on a table. In one of 
these put clean water, in another foul, and leave the third empty. Blindfold 
the person wishing to try his or her fortune, and lead them up to the table. 
The left hand must be put forward. Should it come in contact with the clean 
water, then the future spouse will be young, handsome, and a bachelor or 
maid. The foul signifies a widower or a widow: and the empty dish, single 
blessed-ness. This ceremony is repeated three times, and the plates must be 
differently arranged after each attempt.
     Throwing the Clue. Steal forth alone and at night, to
the nearest lime-kiln, and throw in a clue of blue yarn, winding it off on 
to a fresh clue, As you come near the end, someone will grasp hold of the 
thread lying in the kiln. You then ask, ' Who holds?" when the name of your 
future partner will be uttered from beneath.

Allantara : (See Spain.)

Allat : Wife of Allah, and joint ruler with him over the Chaldean Hell. M. 
Maspero describes her as "the lady of the great country where all go after 
death who have breathed here below," and as their terrible judge.

Alli Allahis  A continuation of the old sect of the Persian Magi, (q.v.).

Alimuseri : An African secret society with secret rites akin to those of the 
Cabiric and Orphic Mysteries. Their reception takes place once a year in a 
wood, and the candi-date is supposed to die. The Initiates surround the 
Neophyte and chant funereal songs. He is then brought to the temple erected 
for the purpose, and anointed with palm oil. After forty days of probation, 
he is said to have obtained a new soul, is greeted with hymns of joy, and 
conducted home.  (See Heckethorn, Secret Societies.)

Almanach du Diable : An almanac containing some very curious predictions for 
the years '737 and 1738, which purported to be published in the infernal 
regions. It is a satire against the Jansenists, which was suppressed on 
account of some over-bold predictions, and which has become very rare. The 
authorship was ascribed to Quesnel, an ironmonger at Dijon. The Jansenists 
replied with a pamphlet directed against the Jesuits, which was also 
suppressed. It was entitled Almanac de Dieu, dedicated to M. Carre de 
Montgeron, for the year 1738, and, in contra-distinction to the other, 
claimed satirically to be printed in heaven.

Almoganenses: The name given by the Spaniards to certain people who, by the 
flight and song of birds, meetings with wild animals, and various other 
means, foretold coming events, whether good or evil. " They carefully 
preserve among themselves," says Laurent Valla, "books which treat of this 
science, where they find rules of all sorts of prognostications and 
predictions. The soothsayers are divided into two classes, one, the masters 
or principals, the other the disciples and aspirants."
     Another kind of knowledge is also attributed to them, that of being 
able to indicate not only the way taken by horses and other beasts of burden 
which are lost, but even the road followed by one or more persons. They can 
specify the kind and shape of the ground, whether the earth is hard or soft, 
covered with sand or grass, whether it is a broad road, paved or sanded, or 
narrow, twisting paths, and tell also how many passengers are on the road. 
They can thus follow the track of anyone, and cause thieves to be pursued 
and apprehended. Those writers who mention the Almoganenses, however, do not 
specify either the period when they flourished, or the country or province 
they occupied, but it seems possible from their name and other 
considerations that they were Moorish.

Alocer : A powerful demon, according to Wierius, Grand Duke of Hades. He 
appears in the shape of a knight mounted on an enormous horse. His face has 
leonine characteristics; he has a ruddy complexion and burning eyes; and he 
speaks with much gravity. He is said to give family happiness to those whom 
he takes under his protection, and to teach astronomy and liberal arts. 
Thirty-six legions are controlled by him.

Alomancy : Divination by means of salt, of which process little is known. It 
is this science which justifies people in saying that misfortune is about to 
fall on the household when the salt cellar is overturned.

Alopecy : A species of charm by the aid of which one can fascinate an enemy 
against whom he has a grudge, and whom he wishes to harm.

Alphitomancy : A method of divination carried out with the help of a loaf of 
barley, which has been practised since the earliest days. It was used to 
prove the guilt or innocence of a suspected person. When many persons were 
accused of a crime, and it was desired to find the true culprit, a loaf of 
barley was made and a portion given to each of the sus-pected ones. The 
innocent people suffered no ill-effects, while the criminal betrayed himself 
by an attack of indiges-tion. This practice gave rise to a popular 
imprecation:
     If I am deceiving you, may this piece of bread choke me." By means of 
it a lover might know if his mistress was faithful to him, or a wife, her 
husband. The procedure was as follows : A quantity of pure barley flour was 
kneaded with milk and a little salt, and without any leaven. It was then 
rolled up in greased paper, and cooked among the cinders. It was afterwards 
taken out and rubbed with verbena leaves, and given to the person Suspected 
of deceit, who, if the suspicion was justified, would be unable to digest 
it.
     There was said to be near Lavinium a sacred wood, where A lphitomancy 
was practised in order to test the purity of the women. The priests kept a 
serpent, or, as some say, a dragon, in a cavern in the wood. On certain days 
of the year the young women were sent thither, blind-folded, and carrying a 
cake made of barley flour and honey. The devil, we are told, led them by the 
right road. Those who were innocent had their cakes eaten by the serpent, 
while the cakes of the others were refused.

Alpiel : An angel or demon, who, according to the Talmud, presides over 
fruit-trees.

Alraun : Images made of the roots of the ash tree, which are sometimes 
mistakenly called mandrakes, (q.v.)

Alrunes : Female demons or sorceresses, the mothers of the Huns. They took 
all sorts of shapes, but without changing their sex. The name was given by 
the Germans to little statues 6f old sorceresses, about a foot high. To 
these they attributed great virtues, honouring them as the negroes honour 
their fetishes; clothing-them richly, housing them comfortably, and serving 
them with food and drink at every meal. They believed that if these little 
images were neglected they would cry out, a catastrophe which was to be 
avoided at all costs, as it brought dire misfortunes upon the household. 
They may have been mandrakes, and it was claimed for them that they could 
foretell the future, ans-wering by means of motions of the head, or 
unintelligible words. They are still consulted in Norway.

Alruy, David : A Jewish magician, mentioned in his Voyages by Benjamin the 
Jew. Alruy boasted himself a descendant of King David. He was educated in 
Bagdad, receiving instruction in the magic arts to such good purpose that he 
came to be more proficient than his masters. His false miracles gained so 
much popularity for him that some of the Jews believed him to be that 
prophet who was to restore their nation to Jerusalem. The King of Persia 
caused him to be cast into prison, but no bolts and bars could hold for long 
so redoubtable a magician. He escaped from his prison and appeared before 
the eyes of the aston-ished king, though the courtiers standing round saw 
noth-ing, and only heard his voice. In vain the king called angrily for 
someone to arrest the imposter. No one could see him, and while they groped 
in search of him, like men blind-folded, he slipped from the palace, with 
the king in pursuit, all the amazed assembly running after their prince. At 
length they reached the sea shore, and Alruy turned and showed himself to 
all the people. Then, spreading a scarf on the surface of the water, he 
walked over it lightly, before the boats which were to pursue him were 
ready. This adventure confirmed his reputation as the greatest magician who 
had lived within the memory of man. But at last a Turkish prince, a subject 
of the Persian king, bribed the father-in-law of the sorcerer to kill him, 
and one night. when Alruy was sleeping peacefully in his bed, a dagger 
thrust put an end to his existence.

Althotas : The presumed "master" and companion of Cagliostro. Considerable 
doubt has been expressed 
regarding his existence. Figuier states that he was no imaginary character; 
that the Roman Inquisition collected many proofs of his existence, but none 
as regards his origin or end, as he vanished like a meteor. "But," states 
the French author, "he was a magician and doctor as well, possessed 
divinatory abilities of a high order, was in possession of several Arabic 
manuscripts, and had great skill in chemistry." His connection with 
Cagliostro will be found detailed in the article on that adept.  Eliphas 
Levi states that the name Althotas is composed of the word "thot" with the 
syllables "al" and "as," which if read cabalistically are sala, meaning 
messenger or envoy; the name as a whole therefore signifies "Thot, the 
Messenger of the Egyptians," and such, says Levi, in effect he was.  
Althotas has been sometimes identified with Kolmer, the instructor of 
Weishaupt in magic, and at other times with the Comte de Sainte-Germain 
(both of whom see). It would indeed be difficult to say with any 
definiteness whether or not Althotas was merely a figment of Cagliostro's 
brain. The accounts concerning him are certainly con-flicting, for whereas 
Cagliostro stated at his trial in Paris that Althotas had been his lifelong 
preceptor, another account says that he met him first on the quay at 
Messina, and the likelihood is that his character is purely fictitious, as 
there does not appear to be any exact evidence that he was ever encountered 
in the flesh by anyone.

Alu-Demon : This Semitic demon owes his parentage to a human being; he hides 
himself in caverns and corners, and slinks through the streets at night. He 
also lies in wait for the unwary, and at night enters bed-chambers and 
terrorises folks, threatening to pounce upon them if they shut their eyes.

Amadeus : A visionary who experienced an apocalypse and revelations, in one 
of which he learned the two psalms composed by Adam, one a mark of joy at 
the creation of Eve, and the other the dialogue he held with her after they 
had sinned. Both psalms are printed in Fabricius' Codex Pseudepigraphus 
Veteris Testamenti.

Amaimon : One of the four spirits who preside over the four parts of the 
universe. A maimon, according to the magic-ians, was the governor of the 
eastern part.

Amandinus : A variously coloured stone, which enables the wearer of it to 
solve any question concerning dreams or enigmas.

Amaranth : A flower which is one of the symbols of immortal-ity. It has been 
said by magicians that a crown made with this flower has supernatural 
properties, and will bring fame and favour to those who wear it.

Ambassadors, Demon : (See Demonology.)

Amduscias : Grand Duke of Hades. He has, according to Wierius (q.v.), the 
form of a unicorn, but when evoked, appears in human shape. He gives 
concerts, at the com-mand of men, where one hears the sound of all the 
musical instruments but can see nothing. It is said that the trees 
themselves incline to his voice. He commands twenty-nine legions.

America, United States of : Occultism amongst the aborig-inal tribes of 
America will be found dealt with under the article "North-American Indians." 
The occult history of the European races which occupy the territory now 
known as the United States of America does not commence until some little 
time after their entrance into the North Ameri-can continent. It is probable 
that the early English and Dutch settlers carried with them the germs of the 
practice of witchcraft, but it is certain that they brought with them an 
active belief in witchcraft and sorcery. It is significant, however, that no 
outbreak of fanaticism occurred in connection with this belief until nearly 
the end of the seventeenth century, in 1692, when an alarm of witchcraft was 
raised in the family of the Minister of Salem, and several black servants 
were charged with the supposed crime. It is quite likely that these negroes 
practised voodoo or obeah (q.v.), but, however this may be, the charges did 
not stop at them. The alarm spread rapidly, and in a brief space numerous 
persons fell under suspicion on the most frivolous pretexts. The new 
Governor of the Colony. Sir William Phipps, appears to have been carried 
away with the excitement, and authorised judicial prose-cutions. The first 
person tried, a woman named Bridget Bishop, was hanged, and the Governor 
feeling himself embarrassed among the extraordinary number of charges made 
after this, called in the assistance of the clergy of Boston. As events 
proved, this was a fatal thing to do. Boston, at this time, possessed a 
distinguished family of puritanical ministers of the name of Mather. The 
original Mather had settled in Dorchester in 1636, and three years later had 
a son born to him, whom he called Increase Mather. He became a clergyman, as 
did his son, Cotton Mather, born in 1663. Increase was President of Harvard 
College, and his son occupied a distinguished position therein, and also 
preached at Boston. The fanaticism and diabolical cruelty of these two men 
has probably never been equaled in the history of human persecution. Relying 
implicitly upon the scriptural injunction: "Thou shalt not suffer a witch to 
live," and blinded by their fanatic zeal, they cost the colony many precious 
lives. Indeed, beside their regime, the rigours of Sprenger (q.v.) and Bodin 
(q.v.), pale into insignificance. That ministers professing to preach a 
gospel of charity and love could have so far descended as to torture and 
condemn thousands of human beings to the gallows and the stake, can only be 
regarded as astounding. In 1688 an Irish washer woman, named Glover, was  
em-ployed by a mason of Boston, one Goodwin, to look after his children, and 
these shortly afterwards displayed symptoms which Cotton Mather, on 
examination, stated were those of diabolical possession. The wretched 
washer-woman was brought to trial, found guilty, and hanged; and Cotton 
Mather launched into print upon the case under the title of Late Memorable 
Providences Relating to Witchcraft and Possession which displayed an 
extraordinary amount of ingenuity and an equally great lack of anything like 
sound judgment. As was the case with the works of the European writers on 
witchcraft and sorcery, this book fanned the flame of credulity, and 
thousands of the ignor-ant throughout the colony began to cast about for 
similar examples of witchcraft. Five other persons were brought to trial and 
executed, and a similar number shortly met the same fate, among them a 
minister of the Gospel, by name George Borroughs, who disbelieved in 
witchcraft. This was sufficient, and he was executed forthwith. Popular 
sentiment was on his side, but the fiendish Cotton Mather appeared at the 
place of execution on horseback, denounced Borroughs as an impostor, and 
upheld the action of his judges. Another man, called Willard, who had been 
employed to arrest suspected witches, refused to continue in his office, and 
was himself arrested. He attempted to save himself by flight, but was 
pursued and overtaken, and duly executed. Even dogs accused of witchcraft 
were put to death. but the magistrates who had undertaken the proceedings, 
ignorant as they were, began to have some suspicion that the course they had 
adopted was a violent and dangerous one. and popular sentiment rose so high 
that the Governor requested Cotton Mather to write a treatise in defence of 
what had been done. The result was the famous volume, Wonders of the 
Invisible World, in which the author gives an account of several of the 
trials at Salem, compares the doings of witches in New England with those in 
other parts of the world, and discourses elaborately on witchcraft 
generally.  The witch mania now spread throughout the whole colony. One of 
the first checks it received was the accusation of the wife of Mr. Hale, a 
minister. Her husband had been a zealous promotor of the prosecutions, but 
this accusation altered his views, and he became convinced of the injustice 
of the whole movement. But certain persons raised the question as to whether 
the Devil could not assume the shape of an inno-cent and pious person as 
well as a wicked one for his own purposes, and the assistance of Increase 
Mather, President of Harvard College, was called in to decide this. He wrote 
a book, A Further Account of the Trials of the New England Witches, and 
added many cases concerning witchcraft and evil spirits personating men, in 
the course of which he un-hesitatingly affirmed that it was possible for the 
enemy of mankind to assume the guise of a person in whom there was no guile. 
A new scene of agitation was the town of Andover, where a great many persons 
were accused of witchcraft and thrown into prison, until a certain justice 
of the peace. named Bradstreet, who deserves special mention for his 
enlightened policy, refused to grant any more warrants for arrest. The 
accusers immediately fastened upon him, and declared that he had killed 
several people by means of sorcery, and so alarmed was he that he fled from 
the town. But the fanatics who made it their business to accuse, became 
bolder, and aimed at persons of rank, until at last they had the audacity to 
impeach the wife of Governor Phipps himself. This withdrew from them the 
countenance of the Governor, and a certain Bostonian who was accused, 
brought an action of damages against his accusers for 'defamation of 
character. After this, the whole agitation died down, and scores of persons 
who had made confessions retracted; but the Mathers obstinately persisted in 
the opinions they had published, and regarded the reactionary feeling as a 
triumph of Satan. A Boston girl, named Margaret Rule, was seized with con-
vulsions, and when visited by Cotton Mather, was found by him to be 
suffering from a diabolical attack of obsession. He did his best to renew 
the agitation, but to no purpose, for a certain Robert Calif, an influential 
merchant of the town, also examined the girl, and satisfied himself that the 
whole thing was a delusion. He penned an account of his examination exposing 
the theories of the Mathers, which is published under the title of More 
Wonders of the Invisible World. This book was publicly burned by the 
partisans of the fanatical clergy, but the eyes of the public were now 
opened, and opinion generally was steadfastly against the accusation and 
prosecutions of reputed witches. The people of Salem drove from their midst 
the minister, Paris, with whom the prosecution had begun, and a deep remorse 
settled down upon the community. Indeed, most of the persons concerned in 
the judicial proceedings pro-claimed their regret ; the jurors signed a 
paper stating their repentance and pleading delusion. But even all this 
failed to convince the Mathers, and Cotton wrote his Magnolia, an 
ecclesiastical history of New England, pub-lished 1700, which repeats his 
original view of the power of Satan at Salem, and evinces no regret for the 
part he had taken in the matter. In 1723, he edited The Remarkables of his 
father, in which he took occasion to repeat his theories. Increase Mather 
died in 1723, at the age of eighty-five, and Cotton lived on to 1728. It has 
been claimed that they acted according to their lights and conscience, but 
there is no doubt that their vanity would not permit them to retract what 
they had once set down regarding witchcraft, and their names will go down to 
posterity with those of the inquisitors and torturers of the middle ages, as 
men, who with less excuse than these, tormented and bereft of life hundreds 
of totally innocent people.

full summary of the subject will be found.
     Apart from the doings at Salem, colonial America has little to offer in 
the way of occult history; but the modern United States of America is 
extremely rich in occult history. This, however, is a history of outstanding 
individuals-Thomas Lake Harris, Brigham Young, the Foxes, Andrew Jackson 
Davis, and so on, biographies of whom will be found scattered throughout 
this work. But that is not to say that various occult movements have not 
from time to time either originated in, or found a home in the United 
States. Indeed, the number of occult or semi-occult sects which have 
originated there, is exceedingly great, and the foundation of occult 
communities has been frequent. Such were the Mountain Cove community of 
Harris; the Society of Hopedale, founded by Ballou; and so on. The notorious 
community, or rather nation of Mormons had undoubtedly a semi-occult origin. 
Its founder, Joseph Smith, and its first great prophet, Brigham Young, both 
had occult ideas, which rather remind us of those of Blake (q.v.), and were 
decidedly of biblical origin. Smith pur-ported to discover tablets of brass 
upon which was en-graved the new law. This was the germ of the Book of 
Mormon the Prophet, and a certain pseudo-mysticism was associated with the 
Mormon movement. This, however, wore off after a while. More fresh' in the 
recollection are the blasphemous absurdities of the prophet Dowie, who 
purported to be a prophet of the new Christianity, and succeeded in amassing 
very considerable wealth. Later, however, he became discredited, and many of 
his disciples seceded from him. Sects of Adventists have also been fairly 
numerous. These persons at the call of their leaders have met in cemeteries 
and elsewhere arrayed in white robes, in the belief that the Last Day had 
arrived; but finding themselves duped, they invariably turned upon the 
charlatans who had aroused these false hopes. There is an instance on 
record, however, where one such person succeeded in bringing about the 
repetition of such a scene.
     Theosophy, as will be seen in the central article on that subject, owes 
much to America, for it may be said that in the United States it received an 
almost novel interpreta-tion at the hands of William Q. Judge, and Katherine 
B. Tingley, the founder of the theosophic colony at Point Loma, California.
     The United States is frequently alluded to as the home and birth-place 
of " queer" religions par excellence. If Paris be excepted this charge holds 
good, for nowhere is pseudo-occultism so rife. It would indeed be difficult 
to account for this state of things.  Shrewd as the average American is, 
there is no question that he is prone to extremes, and the temper of the 
nation as a whole is not a little hysterical. Such sects are often founded 
by unscrupulous foreign adventurers, and worshippers of Isis, diabolic 
societies and such-like abound in the larger cities, and even in some of the 
lesser communities. But on the other hand many such cults, take names of 
which for obvious reasons we cannot mention here, are of native American 
origin. In course of time these duly invade Europe,  with varying fortunes.  
There exist, how-ever, in America, numbers of cultured persons who make a 
serious study of the higher branches of mysticism and occultism, and who 
compare favourably in erudition and character with advanced European 
mystics. It might indeed with truth be said that America has produced the 
greatest occult leaders of the last quarter of a century.
     American Indians. Among the various native races of the American 
continent, the supernatural has ever flourished as universally as among 
peoples in an analo-gous condition of civilisation in other parts of the 
world. They will be treated in the present article accord-ing to their 
geographical situation. Mexico, Central America and Peru have been noticed 
in separate articles.
     North American Indians. The oldest writers on the North American 
Indians agree that they practised sorcery and the magic arts, and often 
attributed this power of the Indians to Satan. The Rev. Peter Jones, writing 
as late as the first decade of the nineteenth century. says: " I have 
sometimes been inclined to think that if witchcraft still exists in the 
world, it is to be found among the abori-gines of America." The early French 
settlers called the Nipissing Jongleurs because of the surprising expertness 
in magic of their medicine men. Carver and Fletcher observed the use of 
hypnotic suggestion among the Menomi-nee and Sioux about the middle of last 
century, and it is generally admitted that this art, which is known to 
modern Americanists as orenda, is known among most Indian tribes as Mooney 
has proved in his Ghost Dance Religion. Brinton, alluding to Indian 
medicine-men and their connection with the occult arts, says: "They were 
also adepts in tricks of sleight of hand, and had no mean acquaintance with 
what is called natural magic. They would allow themselves to be tied hand 
and foot with knots innumer-able, and at a sign would shake them loose as so 
many wisps of straw; they would spit fire and swallow hot coals, pick 
glowing stones from the flames, walk with naked feet over live ashes, and 
plunge their arms to the shoulder in kettles of boiling water with apparent 
impunity.
     "Nor was this all. With a skill not inferior to that of the jugglers of 
India; they could plunge knives into vital parts, vomit blood, or kill one 
another out and out to all appearances, and yet in a few minutes be as well 
as ever; they could set fire' to articles of clothing and even houses, and 
by a touch of their magic restore them instantly as perfect as before. Says 
Father Bautista: 'They can make a stick look like a serpent, a mat like a 
centipede, and a piece of stone like a scorpion.' If it were not within our 
power to see most of these miracles performed any night in our great cities 
by a well-dressed professional, we should at once deny their possibility. As 
it is they astonish us but little.
     "One of the most peculiar and characteristic exhibitions of their 
power, was to summon a spirit to answer inquiries concerning the future and 
the absent. A great similarity marked this proceeding in all northern 
tribes, from the Eskimos to the Mexicans. A circular or conical lodge of 
stout poles, four or eight in number, planted firmly in the ground was 
covered with skins or mats, a small aperture only being left for the seer to 
enter. Once in, he carefully closed the hole and commenced his incantations. 
Soon the lodge trembles, the strong poles shake and bend as with the united 
strength of a dozen men, and strange, un-earthly sounds, now far aloft in 
the air, now deep in the ground. anon approaching near and nearer, reach the 
ears of the spectators.
     At length the priest announces that the spirit is present, and is 
prepared to answer questions. An indispensable preliminary to any inquiry is 
to insert a handful of tobacco, or a string of beads, or some such douceur 
under the skins, ostensibly for the behoof of the celestial visitor, who 
would seem not to be above earthly wants and vanities. The replies received, 
though occasionally singularly clear and correct, are usually of that 
profoundly ambiguous purport which leaves the anxious inquirer little wiser 
than he was before.
     "For all this, ventriloquism, trickery, and shrewd knavery are 
sufficient explanations. Nor does it mater-ially interfere with this view, 
that converted Indians, on whose veracity we can implicitly rely, have 
repeatedly averred that in performing this rite they themselves did not move 
the medicine lodge; for nothing is easier than in the state of nervous 
excitement they were then in to be self-deceived, as the now familiar 
phenomenon of table-turning illustrates.
     "But there is something more than these vulgar arts now and then to be 
perceived. There are statements sup-ported by unquestionable testimony. 
which ought not to be passed over in silence, and yet I cannot but approach 
them with hesitation. They are so revolting to the laws of exact science, so 
alien, I had almost said, to the experience of our lives. Yet is this true, 
or are such experiences only ignored and put aside without serious 
consideration? Are there not in the history of each of us passages which 
strike our retrospective thought with awe, almost with terror? Are there not 
in nearly every community in-dividuals who possess a mysterious power, 
concerning whose origin, mode of action, and limits, we and they are alike, 
in the dark?
     I refer to such organic forces as are popularly summed up under the 
words clairvoyance, mesmerism, 
rhabdom-ancy, animal magnetism, physical spiritualism. Civilised thousands 
stake their faith and hope here and hereafter, on the truth of these 
manifestations; rational medicine recognises their existence, and while she 
attributes them to morbid, and exceptional influences, confesses her want of 
more exact knowledge, and refrains from barren theoris-ing. Let us follow 
her example, and hold it enough to show that such powers, whatever they are, 
were known to the native priesthood as well as the modern spiritualists and 
the miracle mongers of the Middle Ages.
     "Their highest development is what our ancestors called 'second sight.' 
That under certain conditions knowledge can pass from one mind to another 
otherwise than through the ordinary channels of the senses, is shown by the 
examples of persons en rapport. The limit to this we do not know, but it is 
not unlikely that clairvoyance or second sight is based upon it."
     In his autobiography, the celebrated Sac chief, Black Hawk, relates 
that his great grandfather "was inspired by a belief that at the end of four 
years he should see a white man, who would be to him a father." Under the 
direction of this vision he travelled eastward to a certain spot, and there, 
as he was forewarned, met a Frenchman, through whom the nation was brought 
into alliance with France.
     No one at all versed in the Indian character will doubt the implicit 
faith with which ,this legend was told and heard. But we may be pardoned our 
scepticism, seeing there are so many chances of error. It is not so with an 
anecdote related by Captain Jonathan Carver, a cool-headed English trader, 
whose little book of travels is an unquestioned authority. In 1767 he was 
among the Killistenoes at a time when they were in great straits for food, 
and depending upon the arrival of the traders to rescue them from 
starvation. They persuaded the chief priest to consult the divinities as to 
when the relief would arrive. After the usual preliminaries, their magnate 
announced that the next day precisely, when the sun reached the zenith, a 
canoe would arrive with further tidings. At the appointed hour, the whole 
village, to-gether with the incredulous Englishman, was on the beach, and 
sure enough, at the minute specified, a canoe swung
round a distant point of land, and rapidly approaching the shore, brought 
the expected news. Charlevoix is nearly as trustworthy a writer as Carver. 
Yet he de-liberately relates an equally singular instance.
     But these examples are surpassed by one described in the Atlantic 
Monthly, of July. 1866, the author of which, the late Col. John Mason Brown, 
has testified to its accuracy in every particular. Some years since at the 
head of a party of voyageurs, he set forth in search of a band of Indians 
somewhere on the vast plains along the tributaries of the Copper-mine and 
Mackenzie rivers. Danger, disappointment, and the fatigues of the road, 
induced one after another to turn back, until of the original ten only three 
remained. They also were on the point of giving up the apparently hopeless 
quest, when they were met by some warriors of the very band they were 
seeking. These had been sent out by one of their medicine men to find three 
whites, whose horses, arms, attire, and personal appearance he minutely 
described, which description was repeated to Col. Brown by the warriors 
before they saw his two companions. When afterwards, the priest, a frank and 
simple-minded man, was asked to explain this extra-ordinary occurrence, he 
could offer no other explanation than that " he saw them coming, and heard 
them talk on their journey."
     Many tales such as these have been recorded by travellers, and however 
much they may shock our sense of probability, as well-authenticated 
exhibitions of a power which sways the Indian mind, and which has ever 
prejudiced it so un-changeably against Christianity and civilisation, they 
can-not be disregarded. Whether they too are but specimens of refined 
knavery, whether they are instigations of the devil, or whether they must be 
classed with other facts as illustrating certain obscure and curious mental 
faculties, each may decide as the bent of his mind inclines him, for science 
makes no decision.
     Those nervous conditions associated with the name of Mesmer were 
nothing new to the Indian magicians. Rub-bing and stroking the sick, and the 
laying on of hands, were very common parts of their clinical procedures, and 
at the initiations to their societies they were frequently exhibited. 
Observers have related that among the Nez Perces of Oregon, the novice was 
put to sleep by songs. incantations, and "certain passes of the hand," and 
that with the Dakotas he would be struck lightly on the breast at a pre--
concerted moment, and instantly "would drop prostrate on his face, his 
muscles rigid and quivering in every fibre."
     There is no occasion to suppose deceit in this. It finds its parallel 
in every race and every age, and rests on a characteristic trait of certain 
epochs and certain man, which leads them to seek the divine, not in 
thoughtful con-templation on the laws of the universe and the facts of self-
consciousness, but in an entire immolation of the latter, a sinking of their 
own individuality in that of the spirits whose alliance they seek.
     The late Washington Mathews, writing in Bulletin 30 of the Bureau of 
American Ethnology, says:
     "Sleight-of-hand was not only much employed in the treatment of 
disease, but was used on many other occasions. A very common trick among 
Indian charlatans was to pretend to suck foreign bodies, such as stones, out 
of the persons of their patients. Records of this are found among many 
tribes, from the lowest in culture to the highest, even among the Aztecs. Of 
course, such trickery was not with-out some therapeutic efficacy, for, like 
many other pro-ceedings of the shamans, it was designed to cure disease by 
influence on the imagination. A Hidatsa, residing in Dakota, in 1865, was 
known by the name of Cherry-in-the-mouth, because he had a trick of 
producing from his mouth, at any season, what seemed to be fresh wild 
cherries. He had found some way of preserving cherries, perhaps in whisky, 
and it was easy for him to hide them in his mouth before intending to play 
the trick; but many of the In-dians considered it wonderful magic.
     The most astonishing tricks of the Indians were dis-played in their 
fire ceremonies and in handling hot 
substances, accounts of which performances pertain to various tribes. It is 
said that Chippewa sorcerers could handle with impunity red-hot stones and 
burning brands, and could bathe the hands in boiling water or syrup; such 
magicians were called ' fire-dealers' and 'fire-handlers.' There are 
authentic accounts from various parts of the world of fire-dancers and fire-
walks among barbarous races, and extraordinary fire acts are performed also 
among widely separated Indian tribes. Among the Ankara of what is now North 
Dakota, in the autumn of 1865, when a large fire in the centre of the 
medicine lodge had died down until it became a bed of glowing embers, and 
the light in the lodge was dim, the performers ran with apparently bare feet 
among the hot coals and threw these around in the lodge with their bare 
hands, causing the spectators to flee. Among the Navaho, performers, naked 
except for breechcloth and moccasins, and having their bodies daubed with a 
white infusorial clay, run at high speed around a fire, hold-ing in their 
hands great faggots of flaming cedar bark, which they apply to the bare 
backs of those in front of them and to their own persons. Their wild race 
around the fire is continued until the faggots are nearly all consumed, but 
they are never injured by the flame. This immunity may be ac-counted for by 
supposing that the cedar bark does not make a very hot fire, and that the 
clay coating protects the body. Menominee shamans are said to handle fire, 
as also are the female sorcerers of Honduras.
     "Indians know well how to handle venomous serpents with impunity. If 
they can not avoid being bitten, as they usually can, they seem to be able 
to avert the fatal consequences of the bite. The wonderful acts performed in 
the Snake Dance of the Hopi have often been described.
     "A trick of Navaho dancers, in the ceremony of the mountain chant, is 
to pretend to thrust an arrow far down the throat. In this feat an arrow 
with a telescopic shaft is used ; the point is held between the teeth; the 
hollow part of the handle, covered with plumes, is forced down toward the 
lips, and thus the arrow appears to be swallowed. There is an account of an 
arrow of similar construction used early in the eighteenth century by 
Indians of Canada, who pretended a man was wounded by it and healed in-
stantly. The Navaho also pretend to swallow sticks, which their neighbours 
of the pueblo of Zuni actually do in sacred rites, occasionally rupturing 
the esophagus in the ordeal of forcing a stick into the stomach. Special 
societies which practise magic, having for their chief object rain-making 
and the cure of disease, exist among the south-western tribes. Swallowing 
sticks, arrows, etc., eating and walking on fire, and trampling on cactus, 
are per-formed by members of the same fraternity.
     "Magicians are usually men; but among the aborigines of the Mosquito 
Coast in Central America, they are often women who are called sukias, and 
are said to exercise great power. According to Hewitt, Iroquois women are 
reported traditionally to have been magicians.
     " A trick of the juggler among many tribes of the North was to cause 
himself to be bound hand and foot and then, without visible assistance or 
effort on his part to release himself from the bonds. Civilised conjurers 
who perform a similar trick are hidden in a cabinet, and claim super-natural 
aid; but some Indian jugglers performed this feat under observation. It was 
common for Indian magic-ians to pretend they could bring rain, but the trick 
con-sisted simply of keeping up ceremonies until rain fell, the
last ceremony being the one credited with success. Catlin describes this 
among the Mandan, in 1832, and the practice is still common among the Pueblo 
tribes of the arid region. The rain-maker was a special functionary among 
the Menominee.
     "To cause a large plant to grow to maturity in a few moments and out of 
season is another Indian trick. The Navaho plant the root stalk of a yucca 
in the ground in the middle of the winter, and apparently cause it to grow, 
blossom, and bear fruit in a few moments. This is done by the use of 
artificial flowers and fruit carried under the blankets of the performers; 
the dimness of the firelight and the motion of the surrounding dancers hide 
from the spectators the operations of the shaman when he exchanges one 
artificial object for another. In this way the Hopi grow beans, and the Zuni 
corn, the latter using a large cooking pot to cover the growing plant."
     South American Indians. Throughout South America the magician caste 
analogous to the medicine men or shamans of North America are known as 
piaies or piaes. Of those of British Guiana, Brett writes:
     "They are each furnished with a large gourd or calabash, which has been 
emptied of its seeds and spongy contents, and has a round stick run through 
the middle of it by means of two holes. The ends of this stick project-one 
forms the handle of the instrument, and the other has a long string to which 
beautiful feathers are attached, wound round it in spiral circles. Within 
the calabash are a few small white stones, which rattle when it is shaken or 
turned round. The calabash itself is usually painted red. It is regarded 
with great awe by the heathen Indians, who fear to touch it, or even to 
approach the place where it is kept.
     "When attacked by sickness, the Indians cause them-selves to be 
conveyed to some friendly sorcerer, to whom a present of more or less value 
must be made. Death is sometimes occasioned by those removals, cold being 
taken from wet or the damp of the river. If the patient cannot be removed, 
the sorcerer is sent for to visit him. The females are all sent, away from 
the 'place, and the men must keep at a respectful distance, as he does not 
like his pro-ceedings to be closely inspected. He then commences his 
exorcisms, turning, and shaking his marakka, or rattle and chanting an 
address to the yauhahu. This is con-tinued for hours, until about midnight 
the spirit is sup-posed to be present, and a conversation to take place, 
which is unintelligible to the Indians, who may overhear it. These 
ceremonies are kept up for successive nights.
    “If the patient be strong enough to endure the disease the excitement, 
the noise, and the fumes of tobacco in which he is at times enveloped, and 
the sorcerer observe signs of recovery he will pretend to extract the cause 
of the complaint by sucking the part affected. After many ceremonies he will 
produce from his mouth some strange substance, such as a thorn or gravel-
stone, a fish-bone or bird's claw, a snake's tooth, or a piece of wire, 
which some malicious yauhahu is supposed to have inserted in the affected 
part. As soon as the patient fancies himself rid of this cause of his 
illness his recovery is generally rapid, and the fame of the sorcerer 
greatly increased. Should death, however, ensue, the blame is laid upon the 
evil spirit, whose power and malignity have prevailed over the counteracting 
charms. Some rival sorcerer will at times come in for a share of the blame, 
whom the sufferer has unhappily made his enemy, and who is supposed to have 
employed the yauhahu in destroying him. The sorcerers being supposed to have 
the power of causing, as well as of curing diseases, are much dreaded by the 
common people, who never willfully offend them. So deeply rooted in the 
Indian's bosom is this belief concerning the origin of
diseases, that they have little idea of sickness arising from other causes. 
Death may arise from a wound or a con-tusion, or be brought on by want of 
food, but in other cases it is the work of the yauhahu.
     "I once came upon a Warau practising his art upon a woman inflicted 
with a severe internal complaint. He was, when I first saw him, blowing 
violently into his hands and rubbing them upon the affected part.  He very 
candidly acknowledged his imposture when I taxed him with it, put up his 
implements, and went away. The fate of the poor woman, as it was related to 
me some time after-wards, was very sad. Though a Venezuelan half-breed, and 
of the Church of Rome, she was wedded to the Indian superstitions, and after 
trying the most noted sorcerers without relief, she inflicted on herself a 
mortal wound with a razor in the vain attempt to cut out the imaginary cause 
of her internal pain.
     “Some have imagined that those men have faith in the power of their own 
incantations from their performing them over their own children, and even 
causing them to be acted over themselves when sick. This practice it is 
indeed difficult to account for. The juggling part of their busi-ness is 
such a gross imposture as could only succeed with a very ignorant and 
credulous people; but it is perhaps in their case, as in some others, 
difficult to tell the precise point where credulity ends and imposture 
begins. It is certain that they are excited during their incantations in a 
most extraordinary way, and positively affirm that they hold intercourse 
with spirits; nor will they allow them-selves to be laughed out of the 
assertion however ridiculous it may appear to us.
     “The Waraus, in many points the most degraded of the tribes, are the 
most renowned as sorcerers. The huts which they set apart for the 
performance of their super-stitious rites are regarded with great 
veneration.
     “Mr. Nowers, on visiting a Warau settlement, entered one of those huts, 
not being aware of the offence he was committing, and found it perfectly 
empty, with the excep-tion of the gourd, or mataro, as it is called by the 
tribe. There was, in the centre of the hut, a small raised place about 
eighteen inches high, on which the fire had been made for burning tobacco. 
The sorcerer being asked to give up the gourd, peremptorily refused, saying 
that if he did so his two children would die the same night.'
Keller, in his Amazon  and Madeira Rivers, says : " As with the shamans of 
the North Asiatic nations, the influence a Paje may secure over his tribe 
depends entirely on the success of his cures and his more or less imposing 
personal qualities. Woe to him if by some unlucky ministration or fatal 
advice he forfeits his prestige. The hate of the whole tribe turns against 
him, as if to indemnify them for the fear and awe felt by them until then; 
and often he pays for his envied position with his life.
     “And an influential and powerful position it is. His advice is first 
heard in war and peace. He has to mark the boundaries of the hunting-
grounds; and, when quarrels arise, he has to decide in concert with the 
chieftain, some-times even against the latter's wishes. By a majestically 
distant demeanour, and by the affectation of severe fasting and of nightly 
meetings with the spirits of another world, these augurs have succeeded in 
giving such an appearance of holiness to the whole caste, that their 
influence is a mighty one to the present day, even with the Indians of the 
Aldeamentos, where contact with the white race is sure by-and-by to produce 
a certain degree of scepticism.
     When I was at the Aldeamento of San Ignacio, on the Paranapanema, 
Cuyaba, chieftain and Paje' of an indepen-dent horde of Cayowa Indians made 
his appearance, and I had the honour of being introduced to this magnificent 
sample of a conjurer.  He was a man of about fifty, with large well-cut 
features, framed within a dense, streaming mane of long black hair. The long 
xerimbita on his under lip (a long, thin, cylinder qf a resin resembling 
amber), a great number of black and white beads covering his chest in 
regular rows like a cuirass, and a broad girdle holding his cherapi (sort of 
apron), which was fringed all round with rich, woven ornaments, gave him 
quite a stately, majestic appearance."
     Their magicians were called by the Chilians gligua or dugol, and were 
subdivided into guenguenu, genpugnu and genpiru, meaning respectively " 
masters of the heavens," of epidemics," and " of insects or worms." There 
was also a sect called calcu, or "sorcerers," who dwelt in caves, and who 
were served by ivunches, or " man-animals," to whom they taught their 
terrible arts. The Araucanians believed that these wizards had the power to 
transform themselves at night into nocturnal birds, to fly through the air, 
and to shoot invisible arrows at their enemies, besides indulging in the 
malicious mischief with which folklore credits the wizards of all countries. 
Their priests proper they believed to possess numerous familiars who were 
attached to them after death-the belief of the magicians" of the Middle 
Ages. These priests or diviners were celibate, and led an existence apart 
from the tribe, in some communities being garbed as women. Many tales are 
told of their magical prowess, which lead us to believe that they were 
either natural epileptics or ecstatics, or that disturbing mental influences 
were brought about in their case by the aid of drugs. The Araucanians also 
held that to mention their real personal names gave magic power over them, 
which might be turned to evil ends. Regarding the wizards of the inhabitants 
of the territory around the River Chaco, in Paraguay, Mr. Barbrooke -Grubb 
in his book, An Unknown People in an Unknown Land, says:
     "The training necessary to qualify an Indian to become a witch-doctor 
consists, in the first place, in severe fastings, and especially in 
abstention from fluid. They carry this fasting to such an excess as to 
affect the nervous system and brain. Certain herbs are eaten to hasten this 
stage. They pass days in solitude, and, when thoroughly worked up to an 
hysterical condition, they see spirits and ghosts, and have strange visions. 
It is necessary, furthermore, that they should eat a few live toads and some 
kinds of snakes. Certain little birds are plucked alive and then devoured, 
their power of whistling being supposed to be thus communicated to the 
witch-doctor. There are other features in the preliminary training which 
need not be mentioned, and when the initiatory stage has been satis-
factorily passed, they are instructed in the mysteries under pledge of 
secrecy. After that their future depends upon themselves.
     It is unquestionable that a few of these wizards under-stand to a 
slight degree the power of hypnotism. They appear at times to throw 
themselves into a hypnotic state by sitting in a strained position for 
hours, fixing their gaze upon some distant object. In this condition they 
are believed to be able to throw their souls out-that is, in order to make 
them wander. It seems that occasionally, when in this state, they see 
visions which are quite the opposite of those they had desired. At other 
times they content themselves with concentrating their attention for a while 
upon one of their charms, and I have no doubt that occasionally they are 
sincere in desiring to solve some perplexing problems.
     One of the chief duties of the wizard is to arrange the weather to suit 
his clansmen. If they want rain it is to him they apply. His sorceries are 
of such a kind that they may be extended over a long period. He is never 
lacking in excuses, and so, while apparently busy in combating the
opposing forces which are hindering the rain, he gains time to study weather 
signs. He will never or rarely venture an opinion as to the expected change 
until he is nearly certain of a satisfactory result. Any other Indian could 
foretell rain were he to observe signs as closely as does the wizard. The 
killing of a certain kind of duck, and the sprinkling of its blood upwards, 
is his chief charm. When he is able to procure this bird he is sure that 
rain cannot be far off, because these ducks do not migrate southwards until 
they know that there is going to be water in the swamps. These swamps are 
filled by the overflowing of the rivers as much as by the local rainfalls, 
and the presence of water in the rivers and swamps soon attracts rain-
clouds.
     "The wizards also observe plants and animals, study the sky and take 
note of other phenomena, and by these means can arrive at fairly safe 
conclusions. They are supposed to be able to foretell events, and to a 
certain extent they succeed so far as these events concern local interests. 
By judicious questioning and observation, the astute wizard is able to judge 
with some amount of exacti-tude how certain matters are likely to turn out.
     "After we had introduced bullock-carts into their country, the people 
were naturally interested in the return of the carts from their periodical 
journeys to the river. When the wizards had calculated carefully the 
watering-places, and had taken into consideration the state of the roads, 
the character of the drivers, and the condition and number of the bullocks, 
all that they then required to know was the weight of the loads and the day 
on which it was expected that the carts would leave the river on their 
return journey. The last two items they had to obtain from us. When they had 
these data, by a simple calcula-tion they could make a very shrewd guess, 
not only at the time when they might be expected to arrive at the village, 
but also at what particular part of the road they might happen to be on any 
given day. A great impression was made upon the simple people by this 
exhibition of power, but when we discovered what they were doing, we with-
held the information, or only gave them part, with the result that their 
prophecies either failed ignominiously or proved very erroneous. Their 
reputation accordingly began to wane.
     The wizards appear to be authorities on agricultural matters, and when 
application to the garden spirit has failed, the witch-doctor is called in. 
He examines the crop, and if he thinks it is likely to be a poor one, he 
says it is being blighted by an evil spirit, but that he will use what 
sorceries he can to preserve it. If, on the other hand, he has reason to 
believe that the crop will be a good one, he spits upon it here and there, 
and then assures the people that now they may expect a good harvest.
     Some of the chief duties of the witch-doctor consist in laying ghosts, 
driving off spirits. exorcising kilyikhama in cases of possession assisting 
wandering souls back to their bodies, and generally in the recognising of 
spirits. When a ghost is supposed to haunt a village, the wizard and his 
assistants have sometimes an hour's arduous chanting, in order to induce the 
restless one to leave. When he con-siders that he has accomplished this, he 
assures the people that it is done, and this quiets their fears. Evil 
spirits frequenting a neighbourhood have also to be driven off by somewhat 
similar chanting."

Amethyst : " This gem," says Camillus Leonardus,  is reckoned among the 
purple and transparent stones, mixed with a violet colour, emitting rosy 
sparkles." The Indian variety is the most precious. When made into drinking 
cups or bound on the navel, it prevented drunkenness. It is also held to 
sharpen the wit, turn away evil thoughts, and give a knowledge of the future 
in dreams. Drunk in a potion, it was thought to expel poison and render the 
barren fruitful. It was frequently engraved with the head of Bacchus, and 
was a favourite with the Roman ladies.

Amiante : A species of fire-proof stone, which Pliny and the demonologists 
recommended as an excellent specific against the charms of magic.

Amniomancy : Divination by means of the caul, or mem-brane which sometimes 
envelopes the head of a child at birth. From an inspection of this caul, the 
wise women predict the sort of future the baby will have. If it be red, 
happy days are in store for the child, or if lead-coloured, he will have 
misfortunes.

Amon : A great and powerful marquis of the infernal empire. He is 
represented as a wolf with a serpent's tail, vomiting flame. When he appears 
in human form, his head resembles that of a large owl with canine teeth. He 
is the strongest of the princes of the demons, knows the past and the 
future, and can reconcile, when he will, friends who have quarelled. He 
commands forty legions.

Amoymon : One of the four kings of Hades, of which the eastern part falls to 
his share. He may be invoked in the morning from nine o'clock till midday, 
and in the evening from three o'clock till six. He has been identified with 
Amaimon (q.v.) Asmodeus (q.v.) is his lieutenant, and the first prince of 
his dominions.

Amphiaraus : A famous soothsayer of ancient times, who hid himself so that 
he might not have to go to the war of Thebes, because he had foreseen that 
he should die there. This, indeed happened, but he came to life again. A 
temple was raised to him in Attica, near a sacred fountain by which he had 
left Hades. He healed the sick by showing them in a dream the remedies they 
must use. He also founded many oracles. After sacrifice, those who consulted 
the oracle slept under a sheep skin, and dreamed a dream which usually found 
plenty of interpreters after the event. Am-phiaraus himself was an adept in 
the art of explaining dreams. Some prophecies in verse, which are no longer 
extant, are attributed to him.

Amulets : The charm, amulet, or mascot, is, of course, directly derived from 
the conception of the fetish (q.v.), which was believed by savage and semi-
barbarous people to contain a spirit. Amulets may be said to be of two 
classes : those which are worn as (1) fetishes, that is the dwelling-place 
of spiritual entities, who are active on behalf of the wearer; or (2), 
mascots to ward off bad luck or such influences as the evil eye.
     That charms were worn by prehistoric man there is little room for 
doubt, as objects which in many cases partake of the appearance and general 
description of amulets are discovered in Neolithic tombs. The ancient 
Egyptians possessed a bewildering variety of amulets, which were worn both 
by the living and the dead. Indeed, among the latter, every part of the body 
had an amulet sacred to itself. These were, as a rule, evolved from various 
organs of the gods: as, for example, the eye of Isis, the backbone of 
Osiris, and so forth. Among the savage and semi-civilised peoples, the 
amulet usually takes the form of a necklace, bracelets, or anklets, and 
where belief in witchcraft and the evil eye is strong, the faith in these, 
and in charms, is always most intense. Among civilised races it has been 
observed that it is usually the ignorant classes who adopt the use of 
amulets: such as sailors, miners, beggars, Gypsies, and criminals. But 
amulets are also to be found in use among educated persons, although, of 
course, the superstitious part of the practice has in these cases often 
disappeared. Universally speaking, stones, teeth, claws, shells, coral and 
symbolic emblems, are favoured amulets. The reason for the wearing of these 
is exceedingly difficult to arrive at, but a kind of doctrine of 
correspondences may be at the root of the belief-the idea that like produces 
like, or that an effect resembles its cause, or that things which have once 
been in contact but have ceased to be so, continue to act on each other by 
magical means. For example, the desert goat is a sure-footed animal; 
accordingly, its tongue is carried as a powerful amulet against falling by 
certain Malay tribes. Beads resembling teeth are often hung round the necks 
of Kaffir children in Africa to assist them in teething, and the incisor 
teeth of the beaver are frequently placed round the necks of little 
American-Indian girls to render them in-dustrious, like that animal. Again, 
certain plants and minerals indicate by their external character the 
diseases for which nature intended them as remedies. Thus the euphrasia, or 
eyebright, was supposed to be good for the eyes because it contains a black 
pupil-like spot; and the blood-stone was employed for stopping the flow of 
blood from a wound.
     It is strange that wherever prehistoric implements, such as arrowheads 
and celts, are discovered, they are thought by the peasantry of the locality 
in which they are found to be of great virtue as amulets. Some light is cast 
on this custom by the  fact  that  stone  arrowheads were certainly in use 
among mediaeval British witches. But in most countries they are thought to 
descend from the sky, and are therefore kept to preserve people and cattle 
from lightning. This does not, how-ever, explain away the reason why water 
poured over a prehistoric arrowhead is given to cure cows in Ire-land. 
Certain roots, which have the shape of snakes, are kept by the Malays to 
ensure them against snake-bite; and instances of this description of 
correspondence, known as the doctrine of signatures, could be multiplied ad 
in-finitum. Among the Celts a great many kinds of amulets were used: such as 
the symbolic wheel of the sun god, found so numerously in France and Great 
Britain ; 'pebbles, amulets of the teeth of the wild boar, and pieces of 
amber. The well-known serpent's egg of the Druids was also in all 
probability an amulet of the priestly class. Indian amulets are numerous, 
and in Buddhist countries their use is uni-versal, especially where that 
religion has become degraded, or has in any way degenerated. In Northern 
Buddhist countries almost everyone constantly wears an amulet round the 
neck. These generally represent the leaf of the sacred fig-tree, and are 
made in the form of a box which contains a scrap of sacred writing, prayer, 
or a little picture. Women of position in Tibet wear a chatelaine containing 
a charm or charms, and the universal amulet of the Buddhist priests in that 
country is the thunderbolt, supposed to have fallen direct from Indra's 
heaven. This is usually imitated in bronze or other metal, and is used for 
exorcising evil spirits. Amulet types are for the most part very ancient, 
and present much the same characteristics in all parts of the world.

Amy : Grand President of Hades, and one if the princes of the infernal 
monarchy. He appears there enveloped with flame, but on earth, in human 
form. He teaches the secrets of astrology and of the liberal arts, and gives 
faith-ful servants. He reveals to those who possess his favour, the hiding-
place of treasures guarded by demons. Thirty--six of the infernal legions 
are under his command. The fallen angels acknowledge his orders, and he 
hopes that at the end of 200,000 years, he shall return to heaven to occupy 
the seventh throne.

Anachitis : Used in divination to call up spirits from water; another stone, 
called synochitis, obliged them to remain while they were interrogated.

Anamelech : An obscure demon, bearer of ill news. He was worshipped at 
Sepharvaun. a town of the Assyrians. He always reveals himself in the figure 
of a quail. His name, we are told, signifies a good king," and some 
authorities declare that this demon is the moon, as Andramelech is the sun.

Anancithidus : Leonardus describes this as "a necromantic stone, whose 
virtue is to call up evil spirits and ghosts."

Anania, or Agnany (Jean d') : A lawyer of the fifteenth cen-tury, who wrote 
four books, entitled, De Natura Daemo-num, (On the Nature of Demons), and a 
treatise on Magic and Witchcraft, neither of which works are well known. He 
died in Italy in 1458.

Ananisapta : A Kabbalistic word made up from the initial letters of the 
prayer: Antidotum Nazareni A uferat Necene Intoxicationis; Sanctificet 
Alimenta, Poculaque Trinitas Alma. When written on virgin parchment, it is a 
powerful talisman to protect against disease.

Anarazel : One of the demons charged with the guardianship of subterranean 
treasure, which he carries about from one place to another, to hide them 
from men. It is he who, with his companions Gaziel and Fecor, shakes the 
founda-tions of houses, raises the tempests, rings the bells at mid-night, 
causes spectres to appear, and inspires a thousand terrors.

Anathema : The name was given by the ancients to certain classes of votive 
offerings, to the nets that the fisherman lays on the altar of the sea-
nymphs, to the mirror that Lais consecrated to Venus; to offerings of 
vessels, gar-ments, instruments, and various other articles. The word was 
also applied to the victim devoted to the infernal gods, and it is in this 
sense that it is found among Jews and Christians, referring either to the 
curse or its object. The man who is anathematized is denied communication 
with the faithful, and delivered to the demon if he dies without absolution. 
The Church has often lavished anathemas upon its enemies, though St. John 
Chrysostom has said that it is well to anathematize false doctrine, but that 
men who have strayed should be pardoned and prayed for. Formerly, magicians 
and sorcerers employed a sort of anathema to discover thieves and witches. 
Some limpid water was brought, and in it were boiled as many pebbles as 
there were persons suspected. The pebbles were then buried under the door-
step over which the thief or the sorcerer was to pass, and a plate of tin 
attached to it, on which was written the words: "Christ is conqueror; Christ 
is king; Christ is master." Every pebble must bear the name of one of the 
suspected persons. The stones are removed at sunrise, and that representing 
the guilty person is hot and glowing. But, as the devil is malicious, that 
is not enough. The seven penitential psalms must then be recited, with the 
Litanies of the Saints, and the prayers of exorcism pronounced against the 
thief or the sorcerer. His name must be written in a circular figure, and a 
triangular brass nail driven in above it with a hammer, the handle of which 
is of cypress wood, the exorcist saying meanwhile: "Thou art just, Lord, and 
just are Thy judg-ments." At this, the thief would betray himself by a loud 
cry. If the anathema has been pronounced by a sorcerer, and one wishes 
merely to escape the effects of it and cause it to return to him who has 
cast it, one must take, on Saturday, before sunrise, the branch of a hazel 
tree of one year, and recite the following prayer: "I cut thee, branch of 
this year, in the name of him whom I wish to wound as I wound thee." The 
branch is then laid on the table and other prayers said, ending with "Holy 
Trinity, punish him who has done this evil, and take him from among us by 
Thy great justice, that the sorcerer or sorceress may be anathema, and we 
safe." Harrison Ainsworth's famous novel, The Lancashire Witches, deals with 
the subject and the Pendleton locality.

Androdamas : Androdamas  resembles the diamond, and is said to be found in 
the sands of the Red Sea, in squares or dies. Its name denotes the virtue 
belonging to it, namely, to restrain anger, mitigate lunacy, and lessen the 
gravity of the body.

Android : A man made by other means than the natural mode of reproduction. 
The automaton attributed to Albertus Magnus, which St. Thomas destroyed with 
his stick because its answers to his questions puzzled him, was such an 
android. Some have attempted to humanize a root called the mandrake, which 
bears a fantastic resem-blance to a human being.  (See Mandragora.)

Angekok, Eskimo Shamans : (See Eskimos.)

Angelic Brethren : (See Visions.)

Angels : The word angel, "angelos" in Greek, "malak" in Hebrew, literally 
signifies a "person sent" or a " mes-senger." It is a name, not of nature 
but of office, and is applied also to men in the world, as ambassadors or 
repre-sentatives. In a lower sense, angel denotes a spiritual being employed 
in occasional offices; and lastly, men in office as priests or bishops. .The 
"angel of the congrega-tion," among the Jews, was the chief of the 
synagogue. Such is the scriptural usage of a term, which, in common 
parlance, is now limited to its principal meaning, and denotes only the 
inhabitants of heaven.
     The apostle of the Gentiles speaks of the angels as
"minis-tering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of 
salvation," in strict keeping with the import of the term itself. In Mark 
i., 2, it is applied to John the Baptist: " Behold I send my messenger (' 
angel') before my face," and the word is the same ("malak") in the 
corresponding prophecy of Malachi. In Hebrews xii., 22, 24, we read: "Ye 
have come to an innumerable company of angels, to the spirits of the just," 
etc., and this idea of their great number is sustained by the words of our 
Lord himself, where, for example, he declares that" twelve legions" of them 
were ready upon His demand. In the Revelation of St. John, a vast idea of 
their number is given. They are called the "armies" of heaven. Their song of 
praise is described as "the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of 
many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings." In fine, the sense of 
number is over-whelmed in the effort to compute them.
     As to their nature, it is essentially the same as that of man, for not 
only are understanding and will attributed to them, but they have been 
mistaken for men when they appeared, and Paul represents them as capable of 
disobe-dience (Heb. ii., 7, i6.) The latter possibility is exhibited in its 
greatest extent by Jude, who speaks of the "angels which kept not their 
first estate, but left their own habita-tion," and upon this belief is 
founded the whole system of tradition concerning angels and demons. The 
former term was gradually limited to mean only the obedient ministers of the 
will of the Almighty, and the influence of evil angels was concentrated into 
the office of the great adversary of all good, the devil or Satan. These 
ideas were common to the whole Eastern world, and were probably derived by 
the Jewish people from the Assyrians. The Pharisees charged the Saviour with 
casting out devils "by Beelzebub the prince of the devils." But that evil 
spirits acted in multitudes under one person, appears from Mark v., 9, where 
the evil spirit being asked his name, answered:
"My name is ' Legion' for we are many."
     It is generally held that two orders are mentioned in scripture, 
"angels" and "archangels"; but the latter word only occurs twice, namely, in 
Jude, where Michael is called "an archangel," and in I. Thess. iv., 16, 
where it is written: "the Lord shall descend from heaven with a shout, with 
the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God." This is a slender 
foundation to build a theory upon. The prefix simply denotes rank, not 
another order
of intelligence. There is nothing in the whole of Scripture, therefore, to 
show that intelligent beings exist who have other than human attributes. 
Gabriel and Michael are certainly mentioned by name, but they appeared to 
Daniel, Zacharias, and the Virgin Mary, in fulfillment of a function, 
correspondent to the high purpose of which, may be the greater power, 
wisdom, and goodness, we should attribute to them; and hence the fuller 
representation of the angelic hosts, as chief angels.
     The mention of Michael by name occurs five times in Scripture, and 
always in the character of a chief militant
In Daniel, he is the champion of the Jewish church against Persia; in the 
Revelation, he overcomes the dragon; and in Jude he is mentioned in personal 
conflict with the devil about the body of Moses. He is. called by Gabriel, 
"Michael, your prince," meaning of the Jewish church. In the alleged 
prophecy of Enoch, he is styled: "Michael, one of the holy angels, who, 
presiding over human virtue, commands the nations "; while Raphael, it says, 
"pre-sides over the spirits of men"; Uriel, "over clamour and terror"; and 
Gabriel, "over Paradise, and over the cherubims." In the Catholic services, 
St. Michael is invoked as a "most glorious and warlike prince," ' the 
receiver of souls," and " the vanquisher of evil spirits." His design, 
according to Randle Holme, is a banner hang-ing on a cross; and he is armed 
as representing victory, with a dart in one hand and a cross on his 
forehead. Bishop Horsley and others considered Michael only another 
designation for the Son of God. We may add as a certain biblical truth, that 
the Lord Himself is always meant, in an eminent sense, by any angel named as 
His minister; and he is called the angel of the Covenant, because he em-
bodied in his own person the whole power and representa-tion of the angelic 
kingdom, as the messenger, not of separate and temporary commands, but of 
the whole Word in its fullness.
     Paul speaks of a "third heaven," which must be under-stood not as a 
distinct order of created intelligences, but in the same sense as the Lord's 
declaration: " In my Father's house are many mansions." For Jesus Christ 
always speaks of His kingdom as essentially one, even in both worlds, the 
spiritual and natural.
     Dionysius, or St. Denis, the supposed Areopagite, des-cribes three 
hierarchies of angels in nine choirs, thus:
Seraphim, Cherubim, Thrones, Dominions, Principalities, Powers, Virtues, 
Angels, Archangels. And Vartan, or Vertabied, the Armenian poet and 
historian, who flourished in the thirteenth century, describes them under 
the same terms, but expressly states : " these orders differ from one 
another in situation and degree of glory, just as there are different ranks 
among men, though they are all of one nature." He also remarks that the 
first order are attracted to the Deity by love, and hardly attributes place 
to them, but states of desire and love, while the heaven which con-tains the 
whole host is above the primum mobile, which, again is superior to the 
starry firmament. This description, and all others resembling it, the twelve 
heavenly worlds of Plato, and the heaven succeeding it, the heaven of the 
Chinese, for example, are but as landmarks serving to denote the heights 
which the restless waves of human in-telligence have reached at various 
times in the attempt to represent the eternal and infinite in precise terms. 
Boeheme recognises the " whole deep between the stars," as the heaven of one 
of. the three hierarchies, and places the other two above it; "in the midst 
of all which," he says, "is the Son of God; no part of either is farther or 
nearer to him, yet are the three kingdoms circular about him." The 
Revelations of Swedenborg date a century later, and begin all these subjects 
de novo, but his works are accessible to all, and therefore we do not 
further allude to them.
     The Jewish rabbi's hold the doctrine of another hier-archy superior to 
these three, and some of them, as Bechaliand Joshua, teach that on every day 
ministering angels are created out of the river Diner, or fiery stream, and 
they sing an anthem and cease to exist; as it is written, they are new every 
morning." This, however, is only a mis-understanding, for to be "renewed" or 
"created" in the scriptural sense, is to be regenerated; and to be renewed 
every morning is to be kept in a regenerate state; the fiery stream is the 
baptism by fire or divine love.
The following represent the angelic hierarchies answering to the ten divine 
names
   1. Jehovah, attributed to God the Father, being the pure and simple 
essence of the divinity, flowing through Hajoth Hakados to the angel 
Metratton and to the minister-ing spirit, Reschith Hajalalim, who guides the 
primum mobile, and bestows the gift of being on all. These names are to be 
understood as pure essences, or as spheres of angels and blessed spirits, 
.by whose agency the divine providence extends to all his words.
   2. Jah, attributed to the person of the Messiah or Logos, whose power and 
influence descends through the angel Masleh into the sphere of the Zodiac. 
This is the spirit or word that actuated the chaos, and ultimately produced 
the four elements, and all creatures that inherit them, by the agency of a 
spirit named Raziel, who was the ruler of Adam.
   3. Ehjeh, attributed to the Holy Spirit, whose divine light is received 
by the angel Sabbathi, and communicated from him through the sphere of 
Saturn. It denotes the beginning of the supernatural generation, and hence 
of all living souls.
     The ancient Jews considered the three superior names which are those 
above, to be attributed to the divine essence as personal or proper names, 
while the seven follow-ing denote the measures (middoth) or attributes which 
are visible in the works of God. But the modern Jews, in opposition to the 
tripersonalists, consider the whole as attributes. Maurice makes the higher 
three denote the heavens, and the succeeding the seven planets or worlds, to 
each of which a presiding angel was assigned.
   4. El, strength, power, light, through which flow grace, goodness, mercy, 
piety, and munificence to the angel Zadkiel, and passing through the sphere 
of Jupiter 
fashion-eth the images of all bodies, bestowing clemency, benevo-lence and 
justice on all.
   5. Elohi, the upholder of the sword and left hand of God. Its influence 
penetrates the angel Geburah (or Gamaliel) and descends through the sphere 
of Mars. It imparts fortitude in times of war and affliction.
   6. Tsebaoth, the title of God as Lord of hosts. The angel is Raphael, 
through whom its mighty power passes into the sphere of the sun, giving 
motion, heat and bright-ness to it.
   7. Elba, the title of God as the highest. The angel is Michael. The 
sphere to which he imparts its influence is Mercury, giving benignity, 
motion, and intelligence, with elegance and consonance of speech.
   8. Adonai, master or lord, governing the angel Haniel, and the sphere of 
Venus.
   9. Shaddai, the virtue of this name is conveyed by Cherubim to the angel 
Gabriel, and influences the sphere of the moon. It causes increase and 
decrease, and rules the jinn and protecting spirits.
   10.Elohim, the source of knowledge, understanding and wisdom, received by 
the angel Jesodoth, and imparted to the sphere of the earth,
     The division of angels into nine orders or three 
hier-archies, as derived from Dionysius Areopagus, was held in the Middle 
Ages, and gave the prevalent character to much of their symbolism. With it 
was held the doctrine of their separate creation, and the tradition of the 
rebel-lious hierarchy, headed by Lucifer, the whole of which was rendered 
familiar to the popular mind by the Epic of Milton. Another leading 
tradition, not so much interwoven with the popular theology, was that of 
their intercourse with women, producing the race of giants. It was supposed 
to be authorised by Gen. vi. 2 in the adoption of which the Christian 
fathers seem to have followed the opinion of Philo-Judaeus, and Josephus. A 
particular account of the circumstances is given in the book of Enoch, 
already men-tioned, which makes the angels, Uriel, Gabriel, and Michael, the 
chief instruments in the subjugation of the adulterers and their formidable 
off-spring. The classic writers have perpetuated similar traditions of the 
"hero" race, all of them born either from the love of the gods for women, or 
of the preference shown for a goddess by some mortal man.
     The Persian, Jewish, and Mohammedan accounts of angels all evince a 
common origin, and they alike admit a difference of sex. In the latter, the 
name of Azazil is given to the hierarchy nearest the throne of God, to which 
the Mohammedan Satan (Eblis or Hiris) is supposed to have belonged; also 
Azreal, the angel of death, and Asrafil (probably the same as Israfil), the 
angel of the resurrection. The examiners, Moukir and Nakir, are subordinate 
angels of terrible aspect, armed with whips of iron and fire, who 
interrogate recently deceased souls as to their lives. The parallel to this 
tradition in the Talmud is an account of seven angels who beset the paths of 
death. The Koran also assigns two angels to every man, one to record his 
good, and the other his evil actions; they are so merciful that if an evil 
action has been done, it is not recorded till the man has slept, and if in 
that interval he repents, they place on the record that God has pardoned 
him. The Siamese, beside holding the difference of sex, imagine that angels 
have offspring; but their traditions concerning the govern-ment of the world 
and the guardianship of man are similar to those of other nations.
     The Christian fathers, for the most part, believed that angels 
possessed bodies of heavenly substance (Tertullian calls it "angelified 
flesh"), and, if not, that they could assume a corporeal presence at their 
pleasure. In fact, all the actions recorded of them in Scripture, suppose 
human members and attributes. It is not only so in the historic portions, 
but in the prophetic, even in the Apocalypse, the most replete with symbolic 
figures. (See Magic.)

Anglieri : A Sicilian younger brother of the seventeenth century, who is 
known by a work of which he published two volumes and promised twenty-four, 
and which was entitled Magic Light, or, the origin, order, and government of 
all things celestial, terrestial, and infernal, etc. 
Mongi-tore mentions it in his Sicilian Library.

Anglo-Saxons : (See England.)

Angurvadel : The sword, possessing magical properties, which was inherited 
by Frithjof, the hero of an Icelandic saga. It had a golden hilt, and shone 
like the Northern Lights. In times of peace certain characters on its blade 
were dull and pale; but during a battle they became red, like fire.

Anima Mundi : The soul of the world; a pure ethereal spirit which was said 
by some ancient philosophers to be diffused throughout all nature. Plato is 
considered by some to be the originator of this idea; but it is of more 
ancient origin, and prevailed in the systems of certain eastern philo-
sophers. By the Stoics it was believed to be the only vital force in the 
universe; it has been entertained by many philosophical sects in a variety 
of forms, and in more modern times by Paracelsus and others.  It is also in-
corporated in the philosophy of Schelling. Rich says:
"The anima mundi, or heaven of this world, in which the
stars are fixed, is understood to be a receptivity of the empyrean or heaven 
in which God dwells, so that the forms or seminal conceptions of the one 
correspond to the divine ideas of the other."

Animal Magnetism : (See Hypnotism and Spiritualism.)

Animism : The doctrine of spiritual beings, or the concept that a great 
part, if not the whole, of inanimate nature, as well as of animate beings, 
are endowed with reason and volition identical with that of man. It is 
difficult to distinguish this conception from that of personalisation, but 
the difference exists. The savage hears the wind whistle past him, and 
thinks that in it he can distinguish voices. He sees movement in streams, 
trees, and other objects, which he believes to be inhabited by spirits. The 
idea of a soul probably arose through dreams, apparitions, or clairvoyance, 
hallucinations and shadows, and perhaps through the return to life after 
periods of unconsciousness. Movement, therefore, argued life. The cult of 
fetishism well instances the belief in animism, for it posits the en-trance 
into an inanimate body of a separate spiritual entity deliberately come to 
inhabit it. There is no necessity in this place to go into the question 
whether or not animism is at the basis of religious belief; but it is 
distinctly at the root of magical belief and practice.

Annali Dello Spiritismo : (See Italy.)

Anneberg : A demon of the mines, known principally in Germany. On one 
occasion he killed with his breath twelve miners who were working in a 
silver mine of which he had charge. He is a wicked and terrible demon, 
repre-sented under the figure of a horse, with an immense neck and frightful 
eyes.

Annie Eva Fay : Medium. (See Spiritualism.)

Annius de Viterbo : A learned ecclesiastic, born at Viterbo in 1432, who, 
either deceived himself, or deceiver of others, published a collection of 
manuscripts full of fables and absurdities, falsely attributed to Berosus, 
Fabius Victor, Cato, Manettio and others, and known under the name of The 
Antiquities of Annius. He was also responsible for a treatise on The Empire 
of the Turks, and a book on the Future Triumphs of the Christians over the 
Turks and the Saracens, etc. These two works are explanations of the 
Apocalypse. The author claims that Mahomet is the Antichrist, and that the 
end of the world will take place when the Christians will have overcome the 
Jews and the Mohammedans, which event did not appear to him to be far 
distant.

Annwyl : The Celtic Other-world.  (See Hell.)

Anonymous Adept (fl. 1750) : A noted German Jesuit of the eighteenth 
century, known to his clerical confreres and his flock as Athanasius the 
Churchman. He composed two folio volumes of semi-alchemistic writing, which 
were published at Amsterdam in 1768. In the course of these voluminous 
works, he alludes to an alchemist whose name he refrains from revealing, and 
who is usually hailed in consequence by the elusive title heading this 
article. Athanasius, we find, having long en-deavoured to discover the 
Philosopher's Stone, and having met with no success, chanced one day to 
encounter a venerable personage, who addressed him thus: "I see by these 
glasses and this furnace that you are engaged in search after something very 
great in chemistry, but, believe me, you will never attain your object by 
working as you are doing." Pondering on these words, the shrewd Jesuit 
suspected that his interlocutor was truly learned in alchemy, wherefore he 
besought him to display his erudition, and thereupon our Anonymous Adept 
took a quill, and wrote down a recipe for the making of transmutatory 
powder, together with specific directions for using the same. " Let us 
proceed together," said the great unknown; nor were the hopes of Athanasius 
frustrated. for in a little while a fragment of gold was duly made, the wise 
pedagogue dis-appearing immediately afterwards. The Jesuit now fancied 
himself on the verge of a dazzling fortune, and he proceeded straightway to 
try and manufacture nuggets; but, alas ! Try as he might, his attempts all 
proved futile. Much enraged, he went to the inn where the Anonymous A dept 
was staying, but it need scarcely be said, perhaps, that the bird was flown. 
"We see by this true history," remarks Athanasius, by way of pointing a 
moral, "how the devil seeks to deceive men who are led by a lust of riches"; 
while he relates further, that having been duped in this wise, he destroyed 
his scientific appliances, to renounce alchemy for ever.

Anpiel : One of the angels charged by the rabbis with the government of the 
birds, for every known species was put under the protection of one or more 
angels.

Anselm de Parma : An astrologer, born at Parma, where he died in 1440.  He 
wrote Astrological Institutions, a work which has never been printed. 
Wierius, and some other demonologists, classed him with the sorcerers, 
because certain charlatans, who healed sores by means of mysterious words, 
had taken the name of " Anselmites." But Naude observes that they boasted 
that they had obtained their gift of. healing, not from Anselm of Parma, but 
from St. Anselm of Canterbury, just as the Salutadores in Spain recognised 
in Catherine, their patron saint, and those who healed snake-bites in Italy. 
St. Paul.

Ansitif : A little known demon, who, during the possession of the nuns of 
Louviers, in 1643, occupied the body of Sister Barbara of St. Michael.

Answerer, or Fragarach : A magical sword belonging to the Irish Sea-God, 
Lir. It was brought from the Celtic Other-world by Lugh. the Irish Sun-God, 
and it was believed that it could pierce any armour.

Anthony St.: A great demon of enormous stature one day ap-proached St. 
Anthony to offer his services. By way of response the saint looked at him 
sideways and spat in his face. The demon took the repulse so much to heart 
that he vanished without a word, and did not dare to appear on earth for a 
long time afterwards. It is hardly conceivable that St. Anthony could have 
treated the devil so rudely, if one did not know how many temptations he had 
suffered from him, though it is difficult to admit that he was the object of 
so many attacks on the part of the devil, when he himself said: " I fear the 
demon no more than I fear a fly, and with the sign of the cross I can at 
once put him to flight." St. Athanasius, who wrote the life of St. Anthony, 
mingled with his hero's adventures with the devil, certain incidents which 
contrast strangely enough with these. Some philosophers, astonished at the 
great wisdom of Anthony, asked him in what book he had discovered so fine a 
doctrine. The saint pointed with one hand to the earth, with the other to 
the sky. "There are my books," said he, "I have no others. If men will 
design to study as I do the marvels of creation, they will find wisdom 
enough there. Their spirit will soon soar from the creation to the Creator." 
And certainly these were not the words of a man who trafficked with the 
devil.

Anthropomancy : Divination by the entrails of men or women. This horrible 
usage is very ancient. Herodotus said that Menelaus, detained in Egypt by 
contrary winds, sacrificed to his barbarous curiosity, two children of the 
country, and sought to discover his destiny by means of anthropomancy. 
Heliogabalus practised this means of divi-nation. Julian the Apostate, in 
his magical operations, during his nocturnal sacrifices, caused, it is said, 
a large number of children to be killed, so that he might consult their 
entrails. In his last expedition, being at Carra, in Mesopotamia, he shut 
himself in the Temple of the Moon, and having done all manner of evil there, 
he sealed the doors and posted a guard, whose duty it was to see that they 
were not opened until his return. However, he was killed in battle with the 
Persians, and those who entered the Temple of Carra, in the reign of 
Julian's successor, found there a woman hanging by her hair, with her liver 
torn out. It is probable that Gilles de Retz (q.v.) 'also practised this 
dreadful species of divination.

Antichrist : The universal enemy of mankind, who will in the latter days be 
sent to scourge the world for its wickedness. According to the Abbot 
Bergier. Antichrist is regarded as a tyrant, impious and excessively cruel, 
the arch enemy of Christ, and the last ruler of the earth. The persecutions 
he will inflict on the elect will be the last and most severe ordeal which 
they will have to undergo. Christ, himself, according to several 
commentators, foretold that they would have succumbed to it if its duration 
had not been shortened on their behalf. He will pose as the Messiah, and 
will perform things wonderful enough to mislead the elect themselves. The 
thunder will obey him, according to St. John, and Leloyer asserts that the 
demons below watch over hidden treasures by means of which he will be able 
to tempt many. It is on account of the miracles that he will perform, that 
Boguet calls him the "Ape of God," and it is through this scourge that God 
will proclaim the final judgment and the vengeance to be meted out to wrong-
doers.
     Antichrist will have a great number of forerunners, and will appear 
just before the end of the world. St. Jerome claims that he will be a man 
begotten by a demon; others, a demon in the flesh, visible and fantastical, 
or an incarnate demon. But, following St. Ireneus, St. Ambrose, St. 
Augustine, and almost all the fathers, Antichrist will be a man similar to. 
and conceived in the same way as all others, differing from them only in a 
malice and an impiety more worthy of a demon than of a man. Cardinal 
Bellarmin, at a later date, and contrary to their authority, asserts 
however, that Antichrist will be the son of a demon incubus and a sorceress.
     He will be a Jew of the tribe of Dan, according to Mal-venda, who 
supports his view by the words of the dying Jacob to his sons:" Dan shall be 
a serpent by the way an adder in the path; "-by those of Jeremiah :-" The 
armies of Dan will devour the earth"; and by the seventh chapter of the 
Apocalypse, where St. John has omitted the tribe of Dan in his enumeration 
of the other tribes.
     Antichrist will be always at war, and will astonish the earth with his 
miracles. He will persecute the upright, and will mark his own by a sign on 
the face or the hand.
Elijah and Enoch will come at length and convert the Jews and will meet 
death at last by order of Antichrist, Then will Christ descend from the 
heavens, kill Antichrist with the two-edged sword, which will issue from His 
mouth. and reign on the earth for a thousand years, according to some; an 
indefinite time, according to others.
     It is claimed by some that the reign of Antichrist will last fifty 
years.  The opinion of the majority is that his reign will last but three 
and a-half years, after which the angels will sound the trumpets of the day 
of judgment, and Christ will come and judge the world. The watchword of 
Antichrist, says Boguet, will be: " I abjure baptism." Many commentators 
have foreseen the return of Elijah in these words of Malachi: "I will send 
Elijah, the prophet, before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the 
Lord." But it is not certain that Malachi referred to this ancient prophet, 
since Christ applied this prediction to John the Baptist, when he said: 
"Elias is come already, and they knew him not; " and when the angel foretold 
to Zacharias the birth of his son, he said to him: "And he shall go forth 
before the Lord in the spirit and power of Elias."
     By Antichrist may probably be meant the persecutors of the Church. 
Again, the Protestants give the name to the Pope and the Catholics to all 
their enemies. Napoleon even has been called Antichrist.
     The third treatise in the Histoire Veritable et Memorable des Trois 
Possedees de Flandre, by Father Sebastien Mich-alies, dominican friar, 
throws much light in the words of exorcised demons, on Antichrist. 
"Conceived through the medium of a devil, he will be as malicious as a 
madman, with such wickedness as was never seen on earth. An inhuman martyr 
rather than a human one, he will treat Christians as souls are treated in 
hell. He will have a multitude of synagogue names, and he will be able to 
fly when he wishes. Beelzebub will be his father, Lucifer his grandfather."
     The revelations of exorcised demons show that 
Antichrist was alive in 1613. It appears that he has not yet attained his 
growth  "He was baptised on the Sabbath of the sorcerers, before his mother, 
a Jewess, called La Belle-Fleur. He was three years old in 1613. Louis 
Gaufridi is said to have baptised him, in a field near Paris. An exorcised 
sorceress claimed to have held the little Anti-christ on her knees. She said 
that his bearing was proud. and that even then he spoke many divers 
languages  But he had talons in the place of feet, and he wore no slippers. 
He will do much harm, but there will be comforters, for the Holy Ghost still 
lives." (See Merlin.)  His father is shown in the figure of a bird, with 
four feet, a tail, a bull's head much flattened, horns and black shaggy 
hair. He will mark his own with a seal representing this in miniature. 
Michaelis adds that things execrable will be around him. He will destroy 
Rome on account of the Pope, and the Jews will help him. He will resuscitate 
the dead, and, when thirty, will reign with Lucifer, the seven-headed 
dragon, and, after a reign of three years, Christ will slay him.
     Many such details might be quoted of Antichrist, whose appearance has 
long been threatened, but with as yet no fulfillment. (See End of the 
World.) We must mention, however, a volume published many years ago at 
Lyons, by Rusand, called, Les Precurseurs de 1' Antechrist.  This work shows 
that the reign of Antichrist, if it has not begun, is drawing near ; that 
the philosophers, encyclopedists and revolutionaries of the eighteenth 
century were naught but demons incarnated to precede and prepare the way for 
Antichrist. In our own time it has frequently been averred that Antichrist 
is none other than the ex-Kaiser of Germany.

Antipathy : The old astrologers, who wished to explain everything, claimed 
that the dislike which one feels for a person or thing is caused by the 
stars. Thus. two persons born under the same aspect. will be mutually 
attracted one to the other, and will love without knowing why. Others, 
again, born under opposite conjunctions, will feel an unreasoning hate for 
each other. But how can that antipathy be explained which great men 
sometimes have for the commonest things? There have been many such cases, 
and all are inexplicable. Lamothe-Levayer could not bear to hear the sound 
of any instrument, and dis-played the liveliest pleasure at the noise of 
thunder. Caesar could not hear the crowing of a cock without shuddering; 
Lord Bacon fell into despondency during the eclipse of the moon; Marie de 
Medicis could not bear to look on a rose. even in a painting, though she 
loved all other flowers. Cardinal Henry of Cardonne had the same antipathy, 
and fell into a swoon when he felt the odour of roses;  Marshal d'Albret 
became ill at dinner when a young wild boar or a sucking-pig was served; 
Henry III. of France could not remain in a chamber where there was a cat; 
Marshal de Schomberg had the same weakness; Ladislas, King of Poland, was 
much disturbed at the sight of apples; Scaliger trembled in every limb at 
the sight of cress; Erasmus could not taste fish without having the fever; 
Tycho-Brahe' felt his knees give way when he met a hare or a fox; the Duke 
of Epernon fainted at the sight of a leveret; Cardan could not suffer eggs; 
Ariosto, baths; the son of Croesus, bread; Caesar of Lescalle, the sound of 
the vielle or violin.
     The causes of these antipathies are sometimes to be found in childish 
impressions. A lady who was very fond of pictures and engravings, fainted 
away when she found them in a book. She explained her terror thus When she 
was a child her father had one day seen her turning over the leaves of the 
books in his library, in search of pictures. He had roughly taken the book 
from her hand, telling her in terrible tones that there were devils in these 
books, who would strangle her if she dared to touch them. These absurd 
threats occasionally have baneful effects that can-not be overcome. Pliny, 
who was fairly credulous, assures us that there is such an antipathy between 
the wolf and the horse, that if a horse pass by the way a wolf has gone, he 
feels his legs become so numbed that he cannot walk. But the instinct of 
animals does not err. A horse in America could detect the presence of a 
puma, and obsti-nately refused to go through a forest where his keen sense 
of smell announced to him that the enemy was at hand. Dogs also can tell 
when a wolf is near. Perhaps, on the whole, human beings would be wiser if 
they followed the dictates of these sympathetic or antipathetic impressions. 

Antiphates : A shining black stone, used as a defence against witchcraft.

Antracites, or Antrachas, or Anthrax : A stone, sparkling like fire, 
supposed by Albertus Magnus to be the carbuncle. It cures "imposthumes." It 
is girdled with a white vein. If smeared with oil it loses it's colour, but 
sparkles the more for being dipped in water.

Anupadaka Plane : (See Monadic World.)

Aonbarr : A horse belonging to Manaanan, son of the Irish Sea-God, Lir. It 
was believed to possess magical gifts, and could gallop on land or sea.

Apantomancy : Divination by means of any objects which happen to present 
themselves. To this class belong the omens drawn from chance meetings with a 
hare, an eagle, etc.

Apepi, Book of overthrowing of : An Egyptian work which formed a 
considerable portion of the funerary papyrus of  Nesi-Amsu. It deals with 
the diurnal combat between Ra, the Sun-God, and Apepi, the great serpent, 
the im-personation of spiritual evil, and several of the chapters, notably 
31, 33, and 35 to 39 are obviously borrowed from the Book of the Dead 
(q.v.). It contains fifteen chapters, in which there is a great deal of 
repetition, and details the various methods for the destruction of Apepi, 
including many magical directions. It is set forth that the name of Apepi 
must be written in green on a papyrus and then burnt. Wax figures of his 
attendant fiends were to be made, mutilated, and burnt, in the hope that 
through the agency of sympathetic magic their prototypes might be injured or 
destroyed. Another portion of the work details the creative process and 
describes how men and women were formed from the tears of the god Khepera. 
This portion is known as The Book of Knowing the Evolutions of Ra. The work 
is evidently of high antiquity, as is shown by the circumstance that many 
variant readings occur. Only one copy, however, is known. The funeral 
papyrus in which it is contained was discovered at Thebes in 1860, was 
purchased by Rhind, and sold to the trustees of the British Museum by Mr. 
David Bremner. The linen on which it is written is of very fine texture, 
measures 19 feet by 9 1/2 inches, and it has been translated by Mr. Wallis 
Budge in Archaeologia, Vol.52, Part II.

Apollonius of Tyana : A Neo-Pythagorean philosopher of Greece, who had a 
great reputation for magical powers. Born at Tyana, in Asia Minor, 
Apollonlus was contemporary with Christ. He was educated at Tarsus and at 
the Temple of AEsculapius, at AEgae, where he became an adherent of the sect 
of Pythagoras, to whose strict discipline he sub-mitted himself throughout 
his life. In his desire for know-ledge he travelled widely in Eastern 
countries, and is said to have performed miracles wherever he went. At 
Ephesus, for instance, he warned the people of the approach of a terrible 
plague, but they gave no heed to him until the pestilence was actually in 
their midst, when they bethought them of the warning, and summoned the 
potent magician who had uttered it. Apollonius pointed out to the people a 
poor, maimed beggar, whom he denounced as the cause of the pestilence and an 
enemy of the gods, bidding them stone the unfortunate wretch to death. The 
citizens were at first reluctant to comply with so cruel an injunction, but 
something in the expression of the beggar confirmed the prophet's 
accusation, and the wretch was soon covered with a mound of stones. When the 
stones were removed no man was visible, but a huge black dog, the cause of 
the plague, which had come upon the Ephesians. At Rome he raised from death 
- or apparent death-his biographer does not seem to know which - a young 
lady of consular family, who had been betrothed, and was lamented by the 
entire city. Yet another story relates how Apollonius saved a friend of his, 
Menippus of Corinth, from marrying a vampire. The youth neglected all the 
earlier warnings of his counsellor, and the preparations for the wedding 
proceeded till finally all was in readiness for the ceremony. At this 
juncture Apollonius appeared on the scene, caused the wedding feast, the 
guests, and all the evidences of wealth, which were but illusion to vanish, 
and wrung from the bride the confession that she was a vampire. Many other 
similar tales are told of the philosopher's clairvoyant and magical powers.
     The manner of his death is wrapped in mystery, though be is known to 
have lived to be nearly a hundred years of age. His disciples did not 
hesitate to say that he had not died at all, but had been caught up to 
heaven, and his biographer casts a doubt upon the matter. At all events, 
when he had vanished from the terrestial sphere, the in-habitants of his 
native Tyana built a temple in his honour, and statues were raised to him in 
various other tem-ples.
     A life of Apollonius, written by Philostratus at the instance of Julia, 
mother of the Emperor Severus, is the only extant source of information 
concerning the sage, though other lives, now lost, are known to have 
existed. The account given by Philostratus purports to have been compiled 
from the memoirs of "Damis the Assyrian," a disciple of Apollonius, but it 
has been suggested that Damis is but a literary fiction. the work is largely 
a romance; fictitious stories are often introduced, and the whole account is 
mystical and symbolical. Nevertheless it is possible to get a glimpse of the 
real character of Apol-lonius beyond the literary artifices 6f the writer. 
The purpose of the philosopher of Tyana seems to have been to infuse into 
paganism a morality more practical combined with a more transcendental 
doctrine. He himself practised a very severe asceticism, and supplemented 
his own know-ledge by revelations from the gods. Because of his claim to 
divine enlightenment, some would have refused him a place among the 
philosophers but Philostratus holds that this in no wise detracts from his 
philosophic reputation. Pythagoras and Plato and Democritus he points out, 
were wont to visit Eastern sages, even as Apollonius had done, and they were 
not charged with dabbling in magic. Divine revelations had been given to 
earlier philosophers; why not also to the Philosopher of Tyana? It is 
probable that Apollonius borrowed considerably from Oriental sources, and 
that his doctrines were more Brahminical than magical.

Apparel, Phantom : (See Phantom Dress.)

Apparitions : An apparition (from Latin apparere, to appear) is in its 
literal sense merely an appearance, that is. a sense-percept of any kind, 
but in every-day usage the word has a more restricted meaning and is used 
only to denote an abnormal or super-abnormal appearance or percept, which 
cannot be referred to any natural objective cause. Taken in this sense the 
word covers all visionary appearances, hallucinations, clairvoyance, and 
similar unusual perceptions. "Apparition " and ' ghost" are frequently used 
as synony-mous terms, though the former is, of course, of much wider 
significance. A ghost is a visual apparition of a deceased human being. and 
the term implies that it is the spirit of the person it represents  
Apparitions of animals and of inanimate objects are also sufficiently 
frequent. All apparitions do not take the form of visual images; auditory 
and tactile false perceptions, though less common, are not unknown, and 
there is record of a house that was "haunted" with the perpetual odour of 
violets.
     Evolution of the Belief in Apparitions -There is no doubt that the 
belief which identifies an apparition with the spirit of the creature it 
represents a belief widely current in all nations and all time - is directly 
traceable to the ancient doctrine of animism, which endowed everything in 
nature, from man himself to the smallest insect, from the heavenly bodies to 
an insignificant plant or stone, with a separable soul. It is not difficult 
to understand how the conception of souls may have arisen. Sir J. Frazer, in 
his Golden Bough, says: "As the savage commonly explains the processes of 
inanimate nature by supposing that they are produced by living beings 
working in or behind the phenomena, so he explains the phenomena of life 
itself. If an animal lives and moves, it can only be, he thinks, because 
there is a little animal inside which moves it. If a man lives and moves, it 
can only he because he has a little man or animal inside, who moves him. The 
animal inside the animal, the man inside the man, is the soul. And as the 
activity of an animal or man is explained by the presence of the soul, so 
the repose of sleep or death is explained by its absence; sleep or trance 
being the temporary, death being the per-manent absence of the soul." 
Sometimes the human soul was represented as a bird - an eagle, a dove, a 
raven-or as an animal of some sort, just as the soul of a river might be in 
the form of a horse or a serpent, or the soul of a tree in human shape; but 
among most peoples the belief was that the soul was an exact reproduction of 
the body resembling it in every feature, even to details of dress, etc. 
Thus, when a man saw another in dream, it was thought either that the soul 
of the dreamer had visited the person dreamed of, or that the soul of the 
latter had visited the dreamer. By an easy process of reasoning, the theory 
was extended to include dreams of animals and inanimate things, which also 
were endowed with souls. And thus it is quite probable that the 
hallucinations with which primitive peoples as well as those at a later 
stage of culture were at times visited, and which they doubtless knew well 
how to induce, should be regarded as the souls of the things they represent. 
If it be granted that telepathy and clairvoyance operate sometimes at the 
present day, and among civilised peoples, it may be conceded on still more 
abundant testimony that they were known to primitive races. And it is 
obvious that these faculties would have a powerful effect in the development 
of a belief in appari-tions. The apparition of a deceased person, again, 
would inevitably suggest the continuance of the soul's existence beyond the 
grave, and the apparition of a sick person, or one in some other grave 
crisis - such as might now-a-days be accounted for telepathically-would also 
be regarded as the soul, which at such times was absent from the body. There 
is a widely diffused opinion that ghosts are of a filmy, unsubstantial 
nature, and this also would seem to have taken its rise in the first 
animistic concepts of primitive man. At a very early stage of culture we 
find spirit and breath confused-they are identified in the Latin spiritus 
and the Greek pneuma. as well as in other languages. How natural it is, 
therefore, that the breath, condensed in the cold air to a white mist, 
should be regarded as the stuff that ghosts are made of. On another 
hypothesis, the shadowy nature of the ghost may have resulted from an early 
confusion of the soul with the shadow. Thus ani-mistic ideas of the soul 
have given rise to the belief in apparitions. But animism has a further 
contribution to make towards this belief in the host of spirits which have 
not, and never have had, bodies, true supernatural beings, as distinct from 
soul-gods, elementary spirits, and those evil spirits to which were 
attributed disease, disaster, possession, and bewitchment. This class of 
beings has evolved into the fairies, elves, brownies, bogies, and goblins of 
popular folklore, of which many apparitions are recorded.
     Savage Instances of Apparitions. In classic and medieval times the 
concept of the ghost was practically identical with that of savage peoples. 
It is only within the last two generations that scientific investigation was 
deemed necessary, as the result of the birth of a scepticism hitherto 
confined to the few, and in the general mind weak or non-existent.  (For 
details of such research see Spiritual-ism and Psychical Research.) One of 
the most noteworthy
features of ghosts in savage lands is the fear and antagonism with which 
they are regarded. Almost invariably the spirits of the deceased are thought 
to be unfriendly towards the living, desirous of drawing the souls of the 
latter, or their shadows, into the spirit-world. Sometimes, as with the 
Australian aborigines, they are represented as malignant demons. Naturally, 
everything possible is done to keep the ghost at a distance from the 
habitation of the living. With some peoples thorn bushes are planted round 
the beds of the surviving relatives. Persons returning from a funeral pass 
through a cleft tree, or other narrow aperture, to free themselves from the 
ghost of him whom they have buried. Others plunge into water to achieve the 
same purpose. The custom of closing the eyes of the dead is said to have 
arisen from the fear that the ghost would find its way back again, and the 
same reason is given for the practice, common among Hottentots, Hindus, 
North American Indians, and many other peoples, of carrying the dead out 
through a hole in the wall, the aperture being immediately afterwards 
closed. The Mayas of Yucatan, however, draw a line with chalk from the tomb 
to the hearth, so that the soul may return if it desires to do so. Among 
uncultured races, the names of the departed, in some mysterious manner bound 
up with the soul, if not identified with it, are not mentioned by the 
survivors, and any among them possessing the same name, changes it for 
another. The shape in which apparitions appear among savages may be the 
human form, or the form of a beast, bird, or fish. Animal ghosts are common 
among the Indians of North and South America. Certain African tribes believe 
that the souls of evil-doers become jackals on the death of the body. The 
Tapuya Indians of Brazil think that the souls of the good enter into birds, 
and this belief is of rather wide diffusion. When the apparition is in human 
shape it is generally an exact counterpart of the person it represents, and, 
like the apparitions of more civilised countries, its dress is that worn by 
the deceased in his lifetime. This last feature, of course, implies the 
doctrine of object-souls, which has its roots in animism. Though it is 
generally accepted by savage peoples that the shades of the departed mingle 
with the living, coming and going with no particular object in view, yet the 
revenant may on occasion have a special purpose in visiting the scene of his 
earthly life. It may be that the spirit desires that its body be buried with 
the proper ceremonial rites, if these have been omitted. In savage, as in 
civilised countries, it is believed that the spirits of those who have not 
been buried at all, cannot have any rest till the rite has been duly 
performed. In China, the commonest ghost is that of a person who has been 
murdered, and who seeks to be avenged on his murderer. The spirit of one who 
has been murdered, or has died a violent death, is considered in Australia 
also to be especially likely to walk abroad, while in many barbarous or, 
semi-barbarous lands the souls of women who have died in childbirth, are 
supposed to become spirits of a particularly malignant type, dwelling in 
trees, tormenting and molesting passers-by. There is another reason for 
which apparitions sometimes appear: to reveal the site of hidden treasure. 
The guardians of buried hoards are, however, supernatural beings rather than 
human souls, and the shapes they take are often grotesque or terrible. It is 
customary for ghosts to haunt certain localities. The favourite spot seems 
to be the burial-place, of which there is an almost universal superstitious 
dread; but the Indians of Guiana go a step farther in maintaining that every 
place where anyone has died is haunted. Among the Kaffirs and the Maoris of 
New Zealand a hut wherein a death has occurred is taboo, and is often burnt 
or deserted. Sometimes, even a whole village is abandoned on account of a 
death-a practice, this, which must be attended with some inconvenience. 
There is one point on which the apparitions of primitive peoples differ from 
those of more advanced races-the former seldom attain to the dignity of 
articulate human speech. They chirp like crickets, for instance, among the 
Algonquin Indians, and their', voices are only intelligible to the trained 
ear of the shaman. The ghosts of the Zulus and New Zealanders, again, speak 
to the magicians in thin, whistling tones. This idea of the semi-articulate 
nature of ghosts is not confined to savage concepts; Shakespeare speaks of 
"the sheeted dead," who, "did squeak and gibber in the streets of Rome," and 
the "gibbering" ghost appears in other connections. Naturally the articulate 
apparition is doubly convincing, since it appeals to two separate senses. 
Dr. Tylor says:
"Men who perceive evidently that souls do talk when they present themselves 
in dream or vision, naturally take for granted at once the objective reality 
of the ghostly voice, and of the ghostly form from which it proceeds." 
Spirits which are generally invisible may appear to certain persons and 
under certain circumstances. Thus in the Antilles, it is believed that one 
person travelling alone may see a ghost which would be invisible to a number 
of people. The shamans, or medicine-men, and magicians are able to perceive 
apparitions which none but they can see. The induction of hallucinations by 
means of fasts, rigid ascetic-ism, solitude, the use of narcotics and 
intoxicants, dances, and the performing of elaborate ceremonial rites is 
known all over the world, and among uncultured as well as cul-tured peoples. 
Coincidental apparitions, it may be re-marked en passant, are comparatively 
rare in savage countries. Naturally, a great many savage instances of 
apparitions are concerned with supernatural beings other than human souls. 
but such cases are dealt with elsewhere.
     Ancient and Modern Ideas Concerning Apparitions. The belief in 
apparitions was very vivid among ancient Oriental peoples. The early Hebrews 
attributed them to angels, demons, or the souls of the dead, as is shown in 
the numerous Scriptural instances of apparitions. Dreams were re-garded as 
apparitions if the predictions made in them were fulfilled, or if the dream-
figure revealed anything unknown to the dreamer which afterwards proved to 
be true. That the Hebrews believed in the possibility of the souls of the 
dead returning, is evident from the tale of the Witch of Endor. Calmet says, 
in this connection  "Whether Samuel was raised up or not, whether his soul, 
or only a shadow, or even nothing at all appeared to the woman, it is still 
certain that Saul and his attendants, with the generality of the Hebrews, 
believed the thing to be pos-sible." Similar beliefs were held by other 
Eastern nations. Among the Greeks and Romans of the classic period. 
apparitions of gods and men would seem to have been fairly common. Calmet, 
in his Dissertation on Apparitions, says:
     "The ancient Greeks, who had derived their religion and theology from 
the Egyptians and Eastern nations, and the Latins, who had borrowed theirs 
from the Greeks, were all firmly persuaded that the souls of the dead 
appeared some-times to the living - that they could be called up by 
necro-mancers, that they answered questions, and gave notice of future 
events; that Apollo gave oracles, and that the priestess, filled with his 
spirit, and transported with a holy enthusiasm, uttered infallible 
predictions of things to come. Homer, the most ancient of all the Greek 
writers, and their greatest divine, relates several apparitions, not only of 
gods, but of dead men and heroes. In the Odyssey, he introduces Ulysses 
consulting Teresias, who, having prepared a pit full of blood, in order to 
call up the Manes, Ulysses draws his sword to hinder them from drinking the 
blood for which they were very thirsty, till they had ans-wered the 
questions proposed to them. It was also a prevailing opinion, that the souls 
of men enjoyed no repose, but wandered about near their carcasses as long as 
they continued unburied. Even after they were buried, it was a custom to 
offer them something to eat, especially honey, upon the supposition that 
after having left their graves, they came to feed upon what was brought 
them. They believed also, that the demons were fond of the smoke of 
sacrifices, of music, of the blood of victims, and the com-merce of women; 
and that they were confined for a deter-minate time to certain houses or 
other places, which they haunted, and in which they appeared.
     "They held that souls, when separated from their gross and terrestial 
bodies, still retained a finer and more subtle body, of the same form with 
that which they had quitted that these bodies were luminous like the stars; 
that they retained an inclination for the things which they had loved in 
their life-time, and frequently appeared about their graves. When the soul 
of Patroclus appeared to. Achilles, it had his voice, his shape, his eyes, 
and his dress, but not the same tangible body. Ulysses relates, that when he 
went down into hell, he saw the divine Hercules, that is, adds he, his image 
j for he himself is admitted to the ban-quets of the immortal gods. Dido 
says, that after death she, that is, her image bigger than the life, shall 
go down to the infernal regions.
'Et mine magna mei sub terras ibit imago.’
"And AEneas knew his wife Creusa, who appeared to him in her usual shape, 
but of a taller and nobler stature than when she was alive.
“Infelix simulacrum, atque ipsius umbra Creusae, Visa miki ante oculos, et 
nota major imago.
     “In the speech which Titus made to his soldiers, to persuade them to 
mount to the assault of the Tower An-tonia at Jerusalem, he uses this 
argument: 'Who knows not that the souls of those who bravely expose 
themselves to danger, and die in war, are exalted to the stars, are there 
received into the highest region of heaven, and ap-pear as good genii to 
their relations; while they who die of sickness, though they have lived good 
lives, are plunged into oblivion and darkness under earth, and are no more 
remembered after death, than if they had never existed."
Again he says'
"We find that Origen, Tertullian, and St. Irenaus, were clearly of this 
opinion. Origen, in his second book against Celsus, relates and subscribes 
to the opinion of Plato, who says. that the shadows and images of the dead, 
which are seen near sepulchres, are nothing but the soul disengaged from its 
gross body., but not yet entirely freed from matter; that these souls become 
in time luminous, transparent, and subtle, or rather are carried in luminous 
and trans-parent bodies, as in a vehicle, in which they appeal to the 
living. . . . Tertullian, in his book concerning the soul, asserts that it 
is corporeal, and of a certain figure, and appeals to the experience of 
those who have seen apparitions of departed souls. and to whom they have 
appeared as corporeal and tangible, though of an aerial colour and 
consistence. He defines the soul to be,' breath from God, immortal, 
corporeal, and of a certain figure."
     It is interesting to note that some of these classic spectres are 
nearly akin to the melodramatic conceptions of more modern times. The 
younger Pliny tells of haunted houses whose main features correspond with 
those of later haunt-ing-houses haunted by dismal, chained spectres, the 
ghosts of murdered men who could not rest till their mortal remains had been 
properly buried.
     In the early centuries of the Christian era there was no diminution in 
the number of apparitions witnessed. Visions of saints were frequently seen. 
and were doubtless induced by the fasts, rigid asceticism, and severe 
penances practiced in the name of religion. The saints themselves saw 
visions, and were attended by guardian angels, and harassed by the unwelcome 
attentions of demons, or of their master, the devil. These beliefs continued 
into the Middle Ages, when, without undergoing any abatement in vigour, they 
began to take on a more romantic aspect. The witch and were-wolf 
superstitions were responsible for many tales of animal apparitions. The 
poltergeist flourished in a congenial atmosphere. Vampires were terribly 
familiar in Slavonic lands, and nowhere in Europe were they quite unknown. 
The malignant demons, known as incubi and succubi, were no less common. In 
the northern countries familiar spirits or goblins, approximating to the 
Roman lares, or the wicked and more mischievous lemures, haunted the 
domestic hearth, and bestowed well-meant, but not always desirable, 
attentions on the families to which they attached themselves. These beings 
were accountable for a vast number of apparitions, but the spirits of the 
dead also walked abroad in the Dark Ages. Generally they wished to unburden 
their minds of some weighty secret which hindered them from resting in their 
graves. The criminal came to confess his guilt, the miser to reveal the spot 
where he had hidden his gold. The cowled monk walked the dim aisles of a 
monastery, or haunted the passages of some Rhenish castle, till the prayers 
of the devout had won release for his tortured soul. Perchance, a maiden in 
white flitted through the corridor of some old mansion, moaning and wringing 
her hands,, enacting in pantomime some long-forgotten tragedy. At the cross-
roads lingered the ghost of the poor suicide, uncertain which way to take. 
The old belief in the dread potency of the unburied dead continued to 
exercise sway. There is, for example, the German  story  of  the  Bleeding 
Nun.  Many and ghastly had been her crimes during her lifetime, and finally 
she was murdered by one of her paramours, her body being left unburied. The 
castle wherein she was slain became the scene of her nocturnal wanderings. 
It is related that a young woman who wished to elope with her lover decided 
to disguise herself as this ghostly spectre in order to facilitate their 
escape. But the un-fortunate lover eloped with the veritable Bleeding Nun 
herself, mistaking her for his mistress. This, and other traditional 
apparitions, such as the Wild Huntsman, the Phantom Coach. the Flying 
Dutchman, which were not confined to any one locality, either originated in 
this period or acquired in it a wildly romantic character which lent itself 
to treatment by ballad-writers, and it is in ballad form that many of them 
have come down to us.
     This hey-day of the apparition passed however, at length, and in the 
eighteenth century we find among the cultured classes a scepticism as 
regards the objective nature of apparitions, which was destined two 
centuries later to become almost universal. Hallucination, though not yet 
very well understood, began to be called the" power of imagination."  Many 
apparitions, too, were attri-buted to illusion Nevertheless, the belief in 
apparitions was sustained and strengthened by the clairvoyant powers of 
magnetic subjects and somnambules  Swedenborg, who had, and still has many 
disciples, did much to encourage the idea that apparitions were objective 
and supernatural. To explain the fact that only the seer saw these beings 
and heard their voices, he says:
    "The speech of an angel or of a spirit with man is heard as sonorousiy 
as the speech of one man with another: yet it is not heard by others who 
stand near, but by the man himself alone. The reason is, the speech of an 
angel or of a spirit flows in first into the man's thought, and by an 
internal way into the organ of hearing. and thus actuates it from within, 
whereas the speech of man flows first into the air, and by an external way 
into the organ of hearing which it actuates from without. Hence, it is 
evident, that the speech of an angel and of a spirit with man is heard in 
man, and, since it equally affects the organ of hearing, that it is equally 
sonorous."
     Thus it will be seen that ancient and modern ideas on apparitions 
differ very little in essential particulars, though they take colour from 
the race and time to which they belong. Now they are thin, gibbering 
shadows; now they are solid, full-bodied creatures, hardly to be 
distinguished from real flesh and blood; again they are rich in romantic 
accessories; but the laws which govern their appearance are the same, and 
the beliefs concerning them are not greatly different, in whatever race or 
age they may be found.
     Present Day Theories Concerning Apparitions. - At the present time 
apparitions are generally, though by no means universally, referred to 
hallucination (q.v.) Even those who advance a spiritualistic theory of 
apparitions fre-quently incline to this view, for it is argued that the dis-
carnate intelligence may, by psychical energy alone, produce in the brain of 
a living person a definite hallu-cination, corresponding perhaps to the 
agent's appearance in life. Hallucinations may be either coincidental or 
non-coincidental. The former, also known as telepathic hallucinations, are 
those which coincide with a death, or with some other crisis in the life of 
the person represented by the hallucination. The Society for Psychical 
Research has been instrumental in collecting numerous instances of 
coincidental hallucinations, many of which are recorded in Phantasms of the 
Living, by Messrs. Myers, Podmore and Gurney. Mr. Podmore was indeed the 
chief exponent of the telepathic theory of ghosts for which see also 
Telepathy) which he had adopted after many years of research and experiment. 
He suggested that apparitions result from a telepathic impression conveyed 
from the mind of one living person to that of another, an impression which 
may be doubly intense in time of stress or exalted emotion, or at the moment 
of dissolution. Apparitions of the dead he would account for by a theory of 
latent impressions, conveyed to the mind of the percipient during the 
agent's lifetime, but remaining dormant until some particular train of 
thought rouses them to activity. This view is largely supported at the 
present day. Hallucinations, whether coincidental or otherwise, may, and do 
present themselves to persons who are perfectly sane and normal, but they 
are also a feature of insanity, hypnotism and hysteria, and of certain 
pathological conditions of brain, nerves, and sense organs. The late Mr. 
Myers was of opinion that an appari-tion represented an actual "psychic 
invasion," that it was a projection of some of the agent's psychic force, 
Such a doctrine is, as Mr. Myers himself admitted, a reversion to animism. 
There is another modern theory of apparitions, particularly applicable to 
haunted houses. This is the theory of psychometry (q.v.). Sir Oliver Lodge, 
in his Man and the Universe, says:
     "Occasionally a person appears able to respond to stimuli embedded, as 
it were among psycho-physical surroundings in a manner at present ill 
understood and almost incredible : - as if strong emotions could be un-
consciously recorded in matter, so that the deposit shall thereafter affect 
a sufficiently sensitive organism, and cause similar emotions to reproduce 
themselves in its sub-consciousness, in a manner analogous to the customary 
conscious interpretation of photographic or phonographic records. and indeed 
of pictures or music and artistic em-bodiment generally."
     Take, for example, a haunted house of the traditional Christmas-number 
type. wherein some one room is the scene of a ghostly representation of some 
long past tragedy. On a psychometric hypothesis the original tragedy has 
been literally photographed on its material surroundings, nay, even on the 
ether itself, by reason of the intensity of emotion felt by those who 
enacted it; and thenceforth in certain persons an hallucinatory effect is 
experienced cur-responding to such impression, It is this theory which is 
made to account for the feeling one has on entering certain rooms, that 
there is an alien presence therein, though it be in-visible and inaudible to 
mortal sense. The doctrine of psychometry in its connection with apparitions 
is of con-siderable interest because of its wide possibilities, but it 
belongs to the region of romance rather than to that of science, and is 
hardly to be considered as a serious theory of apparitions at least, until 
it is supported by better evidence than its protagonists can show at 
present.
Spiritualistic theories of apparitions also vary, though they agree in 
referring such appearances to discarnate intelligences, generally to the 
spirits of the dead. The opinion of some spiritualistic authorities is, as 
has been said, that the surviving spirit produces in the mind of the 
percipient, by purely psychic means, an hallucination representing his (the 
agent's) former bodily appearance. Others believe that the discarnate spirit 
can materialize by taking to itself ethereal particles from the external 
world, and thus build up a temporary physical organism through which it can 
communicate with the living. Still others consider that the materialised 
spirit borrows such temporary physical organism from that of the medium, and 
experi-ments have been made to prove that the medium loses weight during the 
materialisation.  (See Materialisation.) The animistic belief that the soul 
itself can become visible is not now generally credited, since it is thought 
that pure spirit cannot be perceptible to the physical senses. But a 
compromise has been made in the' psychic body,' (q.v.), midway between soul 
and body, which some spiritualists consider clothes the soul at the 
dissolution of the physical body. The psychic body is composed of material 
particles, very fine and subtle, and perceptible as a rule, only to the eye 
of the clairvoyant. It is this, and not the spirit which is seen as an 
apparition. We must not overlook the theory held by some Continental 
investigators, that
spirit “materialisations " so-called are manifestations of psychic force 
emanating from the medium.
     Different Classes of Apparitions.-Many of the various classes of 
apparitions having been considered above, and others being dealt with under 
their separate headings, it is hardly necessary to do more than enumerate 
them here. Apparitions may be divided broadly into two classes induced and 
spontaneous. To the former class belong hypnotic and post-hypnotic 
hallucinations (see Hypnotism) and visions (q.v.) induced by the use of 
narcotics and intoxicants, fasts, ascetic practices, incense, narcotic 
salves, and auto-hypnotisation. The hallucinatory ap-pearances seen in the 
mediumistic or somnambulistic trance are, of course, allied to those of 
hypnotism, but usually arise spontaneously, and are often associated with 
clair-voyance (q.v.). Crystallomancy (q.v.) or crystal vision is a form of 
apparition which is stated to be frequently clairvoyant, and in this case 
the theory of telepathy is especially applicable. Crystal visions fail under 
the heading of induced apparitions, since gazing in a crystal globe induces 
in some persons a species of hypnotism. a more or less slight dissociation 
of consciousness, without which hallucination is impossible. Another form of 
clair-voyance is sound sight (q.v.). a faculty common among the Scottish 
Highlanders. Persons gifted with the second sight often see symbolical 
apparitions, as, for instance, the vision of a funeral or a coffin when a 
death is about to occur in the community. Symbolical appearances are indeed 
a feature of clairvoyance and visions generally. Clair-voyance includes 
retrocognition and premonition-visions of the past and the future 
respectively-as well as appari-tions of contemporary events happening at a 
distance. Clairvoyant powers are often attributed to the dying. Dreams are, 
strictly speaking, apparitions. but in ordinary usage the term is applied 
only to coincidental or veridical dreams, or to those  visions of the 
night," which are of peculiar vividness.
     From these subjective apparitions let us turn to the ghost proper. The 
belief in ghosts has come to us, as has been indicated, from the remotest 
antiquity, and innumerable theories have been formulated to account for it, 
from the primitive animistic conception of the apparition as a" actual soul 
to the modern theories enumer-ated above, of which the chief are telepathy 
and spirit materialisation. Apparitions of the living also offer a wide 
field for research. perhaps the most favoured hypothesis at the present day 
being that of the telepathic hallucination. A peculiarly weird type of 
apparition is the wraith (q.v.) or double, of which the Irish fetch is a 
variant. The wraith is an exact facsimile of a living person, who may 
himself see it; Goethe, Shelley, and other famous men are said to have seen 
their own wraiths. The fetch makes its appearance shortly before the death 
of the person it represents. either to himself or his friends, or both. An-
other Irish spirit which foretells death is the banshee (q.v.), a being 
which attaches itself to certain ancient families, and is regularly seen or 
heard before the death of one of its members. To the same class belong the 
omens of death, in the form of certain animals or birds, which follow some 
families. Hauntings or localised apparitions are dealt with under the 
heading  Haunted Houses." The pol-tergeist (q.v.), whose playful 
manifestations must cer-tainly be included among apparitions, suggests 
another classification of these as visual, auditory, tactile, etc., since 
poltergeist hauntings - or indeed hauntings of any kind-are not confined to 
apparitions touching any one sense. For apparitions of fairies, brownies, 
and others of the creatures of folk-lore, see Fairies.
     In this article an attempt has been made to show as briefly as possible 
the universality of the belief in appari-tions, and the varied forms under 
which this belief ex-hibits itself in various times and countries among 
savage and civilised peoples; and-to indicate the basic principles on which 
it rest - namely, the existence of a spiritual world capable of manifesting 
itself in the sphere of matter, and the survival of the human soul after the 
dissolution of the body. While the beliefs in this connection of savage 
races and of Europeans in early and medieval times may arouse interest and 
curiosity for their own sakes, the scientific investigator of the present 
day values them chiefly as throwing light on modern beliefs. The belief in 
apparitions is a root principle of spiritualism. Many who are not 
spiritualists in the accepted sense have had experiences which render the 
belief in apparitions almost inevitable. A subject which touches so nearly a 
consider-able percentage of the community, including many people of culture 
and education, and concerning which there is a vast quantity of evidence 
extending back into antiquity, cannot be a matter of indifference to 
science, and the investigations made by scientific men within recent years 
arouse surprise that such investigation has been so long delayed. The 
Society for Psychical Research has gathered many well attested instances of 
coincidental apparitions, clairvoyance, and apparitions of the dead. As yet, 
however, the problem remains unsolved, and the various hypotheses advanced 
are conflicting and sometimes obscure. The theory of telepathic 
hallucination offered by Mr. Podmore seems on the whole to be the most con-
formable to known natural laws, while at the same time covering the ground 
with fair completeness. But perhaps the best course to take at the present 
stage of our know-ledge is to suspend judgment in the meanwhile, until 
further light has been cast on the subject.

Apports : The name given to various objects, such as flowers, jewellery, and 
even live animals, materialised in the presence of a medium. The production 
of these apports have always been, and still are, one of the most prominent 
and effective features of spiritualistic seances. Sometimes they fly through 
the air and strike the faces of the sitters; some-times they appear on the 
table, or in the laps of those present. A favourite form is the scattering 
of perfume on the company. Recent systematic experiments con-ducted in a 
purely scientific spirit have exposed fraud in numerous instances where 
ordinary precautions would not have sufficed for its detection. Frequently 
it has been found that the medium had skillfully concealed the apports in 
the room or about her person. Nevertheless, though the result is often 
produced by obviously unscrupulous means, it does not follow that all 
materialisations are per-formed with fraudulent intent. In cases where, so 
far as can be judged, the character of the medium is beyond reproach. as in 
the case of Helene Smith, the idea has been advanced that any preparations 
made beforehand, such as the secreting of flowers, etc., must result from a 
process of activity of the subliminal consciousness. Other ex-planations 
are, that the apports are actually conveyed to the seance by spirits, or 
that they are drawn thither by magnetic power. Branches of trees, armfuls of 
fruit and flowers, money, jewels, and live lobsters are among the more 
extraordinary op ports.

Apprentice : (See Adept.)

Apulelus : (See Greece.)

Aquin (Mardochee d') : A learned rabbi of Carpentras, who died in 1650. He 
became a Christian, and changed his name of Mardochee into Philip. He was 
the author of an Interpretation of the Tree of the Hebrew Kabala.

Aquinas (Thomas) who has been under the imputation of magic, was one of the 
profoundest scholars and subtlest logicians of his day. He was a youth of 
illustrious birth, and received the rudiments of his education under the 
monks of Monte Cassino, and in the University of Naples. But. not contented 
with these advantages, he secretly entered himself in the Society of 
Preaching Friars, or Dominicans, at seventeen years of age. His mother, 
being indignant that he should thus take the vow of poverty, and sequester 
himself from the world for life, employed every means in her power to induce 
him to alter his purpose, but all in vain. The friars, to deliver him from 
her impor-tunities, removed him from Naples to Terracina, from Terracina to 
Anagnia, and from Anagnia to Rome. His mother followed him in all these 
changes of residence, but was not permitted so much as to see him. At length 
she induced his two elder brothers to seize him by force. They waylaid him 
on his road to Paris, whether he was sent to complete his course of 
instruction, and carried him off to. the castle of Aquino, where he had been 
born. Here he was confined for two years, but he found a way to corres-pond 
with the superiors of his order, and finally escaped from a window in the 
castle. St. Thomas Aquinas (for he was canonised after his death) exceeded 
perhaps all men that ever existed in the severity and strictness of his 
meta-physical disquisitions, and thus acquired the name of the Seraphic 
Doctor.
     It was to be expected that a man, who thus immersed himself in the 
depths of thought, should be an enemy to noise and interruption. He dashed 
to pieces an artificial man of brass that Albertus Magnus, who was his 
tutor, had spent thirty years in bringing to perfection, being impelled to 
this violence by its perpetual and unceasing garrulity. It is further said, 
that his study being placed in a great thoroughfare, where the grooms were 
all day long exercising their horses, he found it necessary to apply a 
remedy to this nuisance. He made by the laws of magic a small horse of 
brass, which he buried two or three feet under ground in the midst of this 
highway, and, having done so, no horse would any longer pass along the road. 
It was in vain that the grooms with whip and spur sought to conquer the 
animals' repugnance. They were finally compelled to give up the attempt, and 
to choose another place for their daily exercises.
     It has further been sought to fix the imputation of magic upon Thomas 
Aquinas by referring to him certain book" written on that science; but these 
are now acknowledged to be spurious.

Arabs : The heyday of occultism among the Arab race was reached at the epoch 
when that division of them known as the Moors established their empire in 
the Spanish peninsula.
     We first emerge from cloud and shadow into a precise and definite 
region in the eighth century, when an Arabian mystic revived the dreams and 
speculations of the alche-mists, and discovered some important secrets. 
Geber (q.v.), who flourished about 720-750, is reputed to have written 
upwards of five hundred works upon the Philosophers' Stone and elixir vitae. 
His researches after these desider-ata proved fruitless, but if he did not 
bestow upon mankind immortal life and boundless wealth, he gave them nitrate 
of silver, corrosive sublimate, red oxide of mercury, and. nitric acid.
     Among his tenets were a belief that a preparation of gold would heal 
all diseases in animals and plants, as well as in human beings; that the 
metals were affected with maladies, except the pure, supreme, and precious 
one of gold: and that the Philosophers' Stone had often been discovered,. 
but that its fortunate discoverers would not reveal the secret to blind, 
incredulous, and unworthy man.
     His Summa Perfectionis-a manual for the alchemical student-has been 
frequently translated. A curious English version, of which there is a copy 
in the British Museum, was published by an English enthusiast, one Richard 
Russell, at "the Star, in New Market, in Wapping, near the Dock," in 1586. 
Geber's true name was Abon Moussah Djafar, to which was added Al Sofi, or 
"The Wise," and he was a native of Houran, in Mesopotamia.
     He was followed by Avicenna (q.v.), Averroes (q.v.} and others equally 
gifted and fortunate.
     According to Geber and his successors the metals were not only compound 
creatures, but they were also all com-posed of the same two substances. Both 
Prout and Davy lent their names to ideas not unlike this. "The improve-
ments," says the latter. "taking place in the methods of examining bodies, 
are constantly changing the opinions of chemists with respect to their 
nature, and there is no reason to suppose that any real indestructible 
principle has yet been discovered. Matter may ultimately be found to be the 
same in essence, differing only in the arrangement of its particles; or two 
or three simple substances may produce all the varieties of compound 
bodies." The ancient ideas, therefore, of Demetrius the Greek physicist, and 
of Geber, the Arabian polypharmist, are still hovering about the horizon of 
chemistry.
     The Arabians taught, in the third place, that the metals are composed 
of mercury and sulphur in different proportions. They toiled away at the art 
of making many medicines out of the various mixtures and reactions of the 
few chemicals at their command. They believed in transmutation, but they did 
not strive to effect it. It belonged to their creed rather than to their 
practice. They were a race of hard-working, scientific artisans, with their 
pestles and mortars, their crucibles and furnaces, their alembics and 
aludels, their vessels for infusion, for decoc-tion, for cohobation, 
sublimation, fixation, lixiviation, filtration and coagulation. They 
believed in transmuta-tion, in the first matter, and in the correspondence 
of the metals with the planets, to say nothing of potable gold.
     Whence the Arabians derived the sublimer articles of their scientific 
faith, is not known to any European histor-ian. Perhaps they were the 
conjectures of their ancestors according to the faith. Perhaps they had them 
from the Fatimites of Northern Africa, among whose local pre-decessors it 
has been seen that it is just possible the doctrine of the four elements and 
their mutual convertibility may have arisen. Perhaps they drew them from 
Greece, modifying and adapting them to their own specific forms of matter, 
mercury, sulphur and arsenic.
     Astrology.-Astrology was also employed by the oracles of Spain: 
Albatgni was celebrated for his astronomical science, as were many others; 
and in geometry, arithmetic, algebraical calculations and the theory of 
music, we have a long list, Asiatic and Spanish, but only known by their 
lives and principal writings. The works of Ptolemy also exercised the 
ingenuity of the Arabians;  while Alchindi, as far. as we may be allowed to 
judge from his multifarious, volumes, traversed the whole circle - of the 
sublimer sciences. But judicial astrology, or the art of foretelling future 
events from the position and influences of the stars, was with them a 
favourite pursuit; and many of their philosophers, incited by various 
motives, dedicated all their labours to this futile hut lucrative inquiry. 
They often speak with high commendation of the iatro-mathe-matical 
discipline, which - could control the disorders to which man was subject, 
and regulate the events of life.
     The tenets of Islamism, which inculcate an unreserved submission to the 
over-ruling destinies of heaven, are evidently adverse to the lessons of 
astrology ; but this by no means hindered the practitioners of old Spain and 
Arabia from attaining a high standard of perfection in the art, which they 
perhaps first learned from the peoples of Chaldaea, the past masters of the 
ancient world in astro-nomical science, in divination, and the secrets of 
prophecy. But in Arab Spain, where the tenets of Islam, were perhaps more 
lightly esteemed than in their original home, magic unquestionably reached a 
higher if not more thought-ful standard.
     From the Greeks. still in search of science, the Arabs turned their 
attention to the books of the sages who are esteemed the primitive 
instructors of mankind, among whom Hermes was deemed the first. They mention 
the works written by him, or rather by them, as they suppose, like other 
authors, that there were three of the name. To one the imposing appellation 
of Trismegistus has been given; and the Arabians, from some ancient records, 
we may presume, minutely describe his character and person. They also 
published, as illustrative of their astrological discipline, some writings 
ascribed to the Persian Zoroaster.

Aradla, or the Gospel of the Witches of Italy : (See Italy.)

Arael : One of the spirits which the rabbis of the Talmud made princes and 
governors over the people of the birds.

Arariel : An angel who, according to the rabbis of the Talmud, takes charge 
of the waters of the earth. Fishermen invoke him so that they may take large 
fish.

Ararita : The verbum inenarrabile of the sages of the Alex-andrian School, 
"which Hebrew Kabalists wrote Javeh, and interpreted by the sound Ararita, 
thus expressing the triplicity of the secondary kabalistic principle, the 
dualism of the means and the equal unity of the first and final principle, 
as 'e-ell as the alliance between the triad and the triad and the tetrad in 
a word composed of four letters, which form seven by means of a triple and 
double repeti-tion."

Arbatel : A magical ritual published at Basle in 1575. The text is in Latin, 
and it appears to have been influenced by Paracelsus. It is of Christian, 
not Jewish origin, and although the authorship is unknown it is probably the 
work of an Italian. Only one of its nine volumes has come down to us. It 
deals with the institutions of magic, and is entitled Isagoge, which means 
essential or necessary instruction. In it we are introduced to the ritual of 
the Olympic spirits dwelling in the air and among the stars, who govern the 
world. There are, we are told, one hundred and ninety-six Olympic provinces 
in the universe: thus Aratron has forty-nine, Bethor forty-two, Phaleg 
thirty-five, Och twenty-eight, Hagith twenty-one, Ophiel fourteen, and Phul 
seven. Each of the Olympic spirits rule alter-nately for four hundred and 
ninety years. They have natural sway over certain departments of the 
material world, but outside these departments they perform the same 
operations magically. Thus Och, the ruler of solar affairs, presides over 
the, preparation of gold naturally in the soil. At the same time, he 
presides magically over the preparation of that metal by means of alchemy. 
The Arbatel proceeds to say that the sources of occult wisdom are to be 
found in God, spiritual essences and corporeal creatures, as well as in 
nature, but also in the apostate spirits and in the ministers of punishment 
in Hell and the elementary spirits. The secrets of all magic reside in 
these, but magicians are born, not made, although they are assisted by 
contemplation and the love of God. It will be sufficient to describe the 
powers and offices of one of these spirits. Aratron governs those things 
which are ascribed astrologically to. Saturn. He can convert any living 
thing into stone, can change coals into treasure, gives familiar spirits to 
men, teaches alchemy, magic and medicine, the secret of invisibility, and 
long life. He should be invoked on a Saturday in the first hour of the day. 
The Arbatel is one of the best authorities extant on spiritual essences, 
their powers and degrees.

Areanum, Great : The great secret which was supposed to lie behind all 
alchemical and magical striving. "God and Nature," says Eliphas Levi (q.v.), 
"alike, have closed the Sanctuary of Transcendent Science. . . . so that the 
revelation of the great magical secret is happily impossible." Elsewhere he 
states that it makes the magician "master of gold and light."

Ardat-Lile : (Semitic Spirit). She is a female spirit or demon who weds 
human beings and works great harm in the dwellings of men.

Argentum, Potabile : A marvellous remedy for which the al-chemists had a 
recipe. It was composed of sulphur, spirits of wine, and other ingredients, 
prepared according to specified direction, and was (if we credit these 
authorities) a sovereign remedy for all manner of ailments.

Ariel : A spirit.  (See Beaumont, John.)

Arignote : Lucian relates that at Corinth, in the Cranaus quarter, there was 
a certain house which no one would inhabit, because it was haunted by a 
spectre. A man named Arignote, well versed in the lore of the Egyptian 
magical books. shut himself in the house to pass the night and began to read 
peacefully in the court. Soon the spectre made its appearance, and in order 
to frighten Arignote, it first of all took the form of a dog, then that of a 
bull, and finally that of a lion. But Arignote was not at all disturbed. He 
conjured the spectre in formulae which he found in his books, and obliged it 
to retire to a corner of the court, where it disappeared. On the following 
day the spot to which the spectre had retreated was dug up, and a skeleton 
was found. When it was properly buried, the ghost was not seen again. This 
anecdote is an adapta-tion of the adventure of Athenodorus, which Lucian had 
read in Pliny.

Arioch : Demon of vengeance, according to some demono-logists. He is 
different from Alastor, and occupies him-self only with vengeance in 
particular cases where he is employed for that purpose.

Ariolists : Ancient diviners, whose special occupation was called ariolatio, 
because they divined by means of the altars. They consulted demons on their 
altars, says Dangis; they observed whether the altar trembled or performed 
any marvel, and predicted what the Devil inspired them with. According to 
Francois de la Tour Blanche, these people ought to have been put to death as 
idolators. He based his opinion on Deuteronomy, chap. xviii., and on Revela-
tion, chap. xxi., where it is said that idolators and liars shall be cast 
into the lake of fire and sulphur, which will be their second death. 
Deuteronomy orders only the first.

Aristaeus : A charlatan who lived in the time of Croesus. He said that his 
soul would leave his body whenever he wished, and then return to it. Some 
maintain that it escaped in the sight of his wife and children in the figure 
of a stag. Wierius said that it took the shape of a crow. However that may 
be, Herodotus relates in his fourth book that Aristaeus entering one day 
into a fuller's shop, fell dead therein, that the fuller ran to break the 
news to his parents, who came to bury him. But no corpse was to be found. 
The whole town was astonished, when some men returning from a voyage assured 
them that they had met Aristaeus on the way to Crotona. It appeared that he 
was a species of vampire. Herodotus adds that he reappeared at the end of 
seven years, composed a poem and died anew. Leloyer, who regarded Aristaeus 
as a sorcerer or ecstatic, quoted a certain Apollonius, who said that at the 
same hour as the vampire disappeared. for the second time, he was 
transported to Sicily, where he became a schoolmaster. He is again heard of 
three hundred and forty years afterwards in the town of Metapontus, where he 
caused to be raised certain monuments which were to be seen in the time of 
Herodotus. So many wonderful hap-penings inspired the. Sicilians with awe, 
and they raised a temple to him and worshipped him as a demi-god.

Arithmancy : (Sometimes called wrongly Arithmomancy). Divination by means of 
numbers. The Greeks examined the number and value of the letters in the 
names of two combatants, and predicted that he whose name contained most 
letters. or letters of the greatest value. would be the victor. It was by 
means of this science that some diviners foretold that Hector would be 
overcome by Achilles. The Chaldeans, who also practised it, divided their 
alphabet into three parts. each composed of seven letters, which they 
attributed to the seven planets, in order to make predictions from them. The 
Platonists and the Pythagoreans were also strongly addicted to this method 
of divination, which comprehends also a part of the Jewish Kabala.

Armida : The episode of Armida, in Tasso, is founded on a popular tradition 
related by Pierre Delancre. This skil-ful enchantress was the daughter of 
Arbilan, King of Damascus. She was brought up by an uncle, a great magician, 
who taught his niece to become a powerful sorceress. Nature had so well 
endowed her that for per-sonal attractions she far surpassed the most 
beautiful women of the East. Her uncle sent her as a worthy foe against the 
powerful Christian army that Pope Urban XI. had collected under the 
leadership of Godfrey de Bouillon. And there, says Delancre, she made such 
havoc with her beautiful eyes, and so charmed the principal leaders of the 
crusaders, that she almost ruined the hopes of the Christians. She kept the 
valiant knight Renaud for a long time in an enchanted castle, and it was not 
without great difficulty that he was disenchanted.

Armomancy : A method of divination which is effected by the inspection of 
the shoulders. The ancients judged by this means whether a victim was 
suitable for sacrifice to the gods.

Arnaud, Guillaume : (See France.)

Arnoux : Author of a volume published at Rouen, in 1630, with the title of 
On the Wonders of the Other World, a work written in a bizarre style. and 
calculated to disturb feeble imaginations with its tales of visions and 
apparitions.

Arnuphis : An Egyptian sorcerer who, seeing Marcus Aurelius and his army 
engaged in a pass whose entrance had been closed by their enemies, and dying 
of thirst under a burning sky, caused a miraculous rain to fall, which 
allowed the Romans to quench their thirst, while the thunder and hail 
obliged the enemy to give up their arms.

Arphaxat : A Persian sorcerer, who was killed by a thunder. bolt, according 
to Abdias of Babylon, at the same hour as the martyrdom of St. Simon and St. 
Jude. In the account of the possession of the nuns of Loudun there is a 
demon Arphaxat, who took possession of the body of Louise de Pinterville.

Ars Aurifera : (See Avicenna.)

Ars Chimica : (See Avicenna.)

Ars Notoria : The science of the Tarot (q.v.) signs and their application to 
the divination of all secrets, whether of nature, of philosophy, or even of 
the future.

Art Transmutatoire : (See Pope John XXII.)

Artephius : A well-known exponent of the hermetic 
philosophy, who died in the twelfth century, and is said to have lived more 
than a thousand years by means of alchemical secrets. Francois Pic mentions 
the opinion of certain savants who affirm that Artephius is identical with 
Appolonius of Tyana, who was born in the first century under that name, and 
who died in the twelfth century under that of Artep-hius. Many extravagant 
and curious works are attributed to him  De Vita Propaganda (The Art of 
Prolonging Life) which he claims, in the preface, to have written at the age 
of a thousand and twenty-five years; The Key to Supreme Wisdom; and a work 
on the character of the planets, on the significance of the songs of birds, 
on things past and future, and on the Philosophers' Stone. Cardan spoke of 
these books, and believed that they were composed by some practical joker 
who wished to play on the credulity of the partisans of alchemy.

Arthur, King : The character of Arthur is strongly identified with the 
occult. Not only do we find his Court a veritable centre of happenings more 
or less supernatural, but his mysterious origin and the subsequent events of 
his career have in them matter of considerable interest from an occult 
standpoint. This is not the place to dispute re-garding his reality. but 
merely to deal with the romances which cluster around him, and their 
contents from the supernatural point of view. We find him first of all 
connected with one of the greatest magical names of early time - that of 
Merlin the Enchanter. The possibilities are that Merlin was originally a 
British deity. who in later times degenerated from his high position in the 
popular imagination. We possess many accounts concerning him, one of which 
states that he was the direct offspring of Satan himself, but that a zealous 
priest succeeded in baptising him before his infernal parent could carry him 
off. From Merlin. Arthur received much good advice both magical and 
rational. He was present when the King was gifted with his magic sword 
Excalibur, which endowed him with practical invulnerability, and all through 
his career was deep in his counsels. His tragic imprisonment by the Lady 
Viviana, who shut him up eternally in a rock through the agency of one of 
his own spells. removed him from his sphere of activity at the Arthurian 
Court, and from that time the shadows may be seen to gather swiftly around 
Arthur's head. Innumerable are the tales con-cerning the Knights of his 
Court who met with magical adventures, and as the stories grew older in the 
popular mind, additions to these naturally became the rule. Notably is this 
the case in that off-shoot of the Arthurian epic, which is known as the Holy 
Grail (q.v.), in which we find the knights who go in quest of it constantly 
encountered by every description of sorcery for the purpose of retarding 
their progress. Arthur's end is as strange as his origin, for we find him 
wafted away by faery hands, or at least by invisible agency, to the Isle of 
Avillion, which probably is one and the same place with the Celtic other-
world across the ocean. As a legend and a tradition, that of Arthur is 
undoubtedly the most powerful and persistent in the British imagination. It 
has employed the pens and enhanced the dreams of many of the giants in 
English lit-erature from the time of Geoffrey of Monmouth, to the present 
day; and with the echoes of the poetry of Tennyson and Swinburne still 
ringing in their ears, the present generation is quite as justified in 
regarding the history of Arthur as a living reality as were the Britons of 
the twelfth century.

Artois, Countess of : (See France.)

Asal : Known as the King of the Golden Pillars, in Irish Celtic Myth. He was 
the owner of seven Swine, which might be killed and eaten every night, yet 
were found alive every morning.

Asbestos : Asbestos is so called from being inextinguishable even by showers 
and storms, if once set on fire. The Pagans made use of it for lights in 
their temples. It is of woolly texture, and is sometimes called the 
Salamander's feather. Leonardus says: "Its fire is nourished by an 
inseparable unctuous humid flowing from its substance; therefore, being once 
kindled, it preserves a constant light without feeding it with any 
moisture."

Asclepius : A hermetic book. (See Hermes Trismegistus.)

Ash Tree: The Ash had a wonderful influence. The old Christmas log was of 
ash wood, and the use of it at this time was helpful to the future 
prosperity of the family. Venomous animals, it was said, would not take 
shelter under its branches. A carriage with its axles made of ash wood was 
believed to go faster than a carriage with its axles made of any other wood; 
and tools with handles made of this wood were supposed to enable a man to do 
more work than he could do with tools whose handles were not of ash. Hence 
the reason that ash wood is gener-ally used for tool handles. It was upon 
ash branches that witches were enabled to ride through the air; and those 
who ate on St. John's eve the red buds of the tree, were rendered 
invulnerable to witches' influence.

Ashipu : (See Babylonia.)

Ashtabula Poltergeist, The :  The supposed cause of the extraordinary 
disturbances which took place about the middle of the nineteenth century in 
the presence of a lady of Ashtabula County, Ohio. First of all she became a 
medium on the death of her husband, and produced spirit--rappings and other 
manifestations. Then for a time she studied anatomy in Marlborough, and 
afterwards returned to her home in Austinburg where an alarming outbreak of 
weird manifestations occurred. Stair-rods moved after her when she went to 
her room, light articles flew about the house, and uncanny sounds were 
heard. At Marlborough, when she resumed her anatomical studies, the 
disturbances increased in violence, and she and her room-mate had a ghastly 
vision of a corpse they had been dis-secting in the day-time. Dr. Richmond, 
a sceptic of the day, maintained that these phenomena were the result of 
magneto-odylic emanations from the medium.

Asiah : According to the Kabala, the first of the three classes or natural 
ranks among the spirits of men, who must ad-vance from the lower to the 
higher.

Asipu : Caste of priests.  (See Semites.)

Aspects, Planetary  (See Astrology.)

Aspidomancy : A little known form of divination practised in the Indies, as 
we are told by some travellers. Del-ancre says that the diviner or sorcerer 
traces a circle, takes up his position therein seated on a buckler, and 
mutters certain conjurations. He becomes entranced and falls into an 
ecstasy, from which he only emerges to tell things that his client wishes to 
know, and which the devil has revealed to him.

Aspilette (Marie d') : Witch of Andaye, in the country of Labour, who lived 
in the reign of Henry IV. She was arrested at the age of nineteen years, and 
confessed that she had been led to the "sabbath," and there made to perform 
divers horrible rites.

Ass : The Egyptians traced his image on the cakes they offered to Typhon, 
god of evil. The Romans regarded the meeting of an ass as an evil omen, but 
the animal was honoured in Arabia and Judea, and it was in Arabia that the 
ass of Silanus spoke to his master. Other talking asses were Balsam's ass, 
which Mahomet placed in his paradise with Alborack; the ass of Aasis, Queen 
of Sheba; and the ass on which Jesus Christ rode into Jerusalem.
     Some people have found something sacred and mysterious in the innocent 
beast, and there was practised formerly a species of divination in which the 
head of an ass was employed.
     At one time a special festival was held for the ass, during which he 
was led into the church while mass was sung. This reverence in which he was 
held by Christians was doubtless due to the black cross which he wears on 
his back, and which, it is said, was given him because of the ass of 
Bethphage, who carried Christ into Jerusalem. But Pliny. who was almost 
contemporary with that ass, and who has carefully gathered all that related 
to the animal, has made no mention concerning the colour of its coat So we 
can only believe that the ass of today is as he always was.
     It is not only the devout who respect the ass, for the wise Agrippa 
offered him an apology in his book, On the Vanity of the Sciences. Among the 
Indians of Madras, one of the principal castes, that of the Cavaravadonques, 
claim to be descended from an ass. These Indians treat the ass as a brother, 
take his part, and prosecute those who over-burden or ill-treat him in any 
way. In rainy weather they will often give him shelter when they deny it to 
his driver.
     An old fable gives us but a poor idea of the ass. Jupiter had just 
taken possession of Olympus. On his coming, men asked of him an eternal 
springtime. which he accord-ingly granted, charging the ass of Silenus to 
bear the precious treasure to earth. The ass became thirsty, and approached 
a fountain guarded by a snake, who refused to let the ass drink unless he 
parted with the treasure. The stupid animal thereupon bartered the gift of 
heaven for a skin of water, and since that time snakes, when they grow old, 
can change their skin and become young again, for they have the gift of 
perpetual spring-time.
     But all asses were not so stupid as that. In a village about half a 
league from Cairo, there dwelt a mountebank, who possessed a highly trained 
ass, so clever that the country people took it to be a demon in disguise. 
One day the mountebank mentioned in the ass's hearing that the Soldan wished 
to construct a beautiful building, and had resolved to employ all the asses 
in Cairo to carry the lime, mortar and stones. The ass immediately lay down 
and pretended to be dead. and his master begged for money to buy another. 
When he had collected some he returned to his old ass.  " He is not dead," 
he said, "he only pre-tended to die because he knew I had not the 
wherewithal to buy him food." Still the ass refused to rise, and the 
mountebank addressed the company, telling them that the Soldan had sent out 
the criers commanding the people to assemble on the morrow outside Cairo to 
see the most wonderful sights in the world. He further desired that the most 
gracious ladies and the most beautiful girls should be mounted on asses. The 
ass raised himself and pricked up his ears. " The governor of my quarter," 
added the mountebank, " has begged me to lend my ass for his wife, who is 
old and toothless, and very ugly." The ass began to limp as though he were 
old and lame. " Ah, you like beautiful ladies ? " said his master. The 
animal bowed his head, " Oh, well," said the man, "there are many present; 
show me the most beautiful." Which command the ass obeyed with judgment and 
discretion.
     These marvellous asses, said the demonologists, were, if not demons, at 
least men metamorphosed, like Apuleius, who was, it is said, transformed 
into an ass. Vincent de Beauvais speaks of two women who kept a little inn 
near Rome, and who sold their guests at the market, after having changed 
them into pigs, fowls, or sheep. One of them, he adds, changed a certain 
comedian into an ass, and as he retained his talents under his new skin. she 
led him to the fairs on the outskirts of the city. gaining much money 
thereby. A neighbour bought this wise ass at a good price, and in handing it 
over the sorcerers felt obliged to warn the purchaser not to let the ass 
enter water. Its new master attended to the warning for some time, but one 
day the poor ass managed to get free and cast itself into a lake, when it 
regained its natural shape, to the great surprise of its driver. The matter 
was brought to the ears of the Pope, who had the two witches punished. while 
the comed-ian returned to the exercise of his profession.
     Many stories are told of the ass which carried Jesus Christ into 
Jerusalem, and which is said to have died at Verona, where its remains are 
still honoured. The rabbis make quite as much ado over Balaam's ass, which 
has already been mentioned. It is, they say, a privileged animal whom God 
formed at the end of the sixth day. Abraham employed it to carry the wood 
for the sacrifice of Isaac; it also carried the wife and son of Moses in the 
desert. They also maintain that Balaam's ass is carefully nourished and kept 
in a secret place until the coming of the Jewish Messiah, who will mount it 
when He subdues. all the earth.

Assassins : (Hashishin, so-called from their use of the drug hashish, 
distilled from the hemp plant). A branch of that sect of Mahomedans known as 
Ismaelites, founded in the latter part of the eleventh century by Hassan 
Sabah, in Syria and Persia. Driven from Cairo, Hassan spread a modified form 
of the Ismaelite doctrine throughout Syria, and in 1090 he became master of 
the mountain stronghold, Alamut, in Persia, where he founded a society known 
as the Assassins, and from which he ostensibly promulgated the principles of 
the Ismaelite sect. The difference, how-ever, between the Assassins and 
other Ismaelites, was that they employed secret assassination against all 
the enemies of the sect. Their organisation was founded upon that of the 
Western Lodge at Cairo, and at the head of their sect was the Sheik-Al-
Gebel, or ' Old Man of the Mountain," as the name has been rather absurdly 
translated by Europ-eans authors, the more correct translation being " Chief 
of the mountain." The other officers of the society were the grand priors, 
lesser priors. initiates, associates, and the fedavi or "devoted ones," who 
were the assassins proper. These latter were young men from whose ranks 
those who were selected for the various deeds of blood for which the 
Assassins became notorious, were chosen. They were not initiated into the 
secret circle of the cult, and blind obedience was expected from them. When 
their services were required they were intoxicated with hashish, and in this 
condition were taken into the magnificent gardens of the Sheik, where they 
were surrounded by every pleasure. This they were told was a foretaste of 
what they might expect in Paradise, to which they would instantly proceed 
were they to lose their lives in the Sheik's service. Con-sequently these 
young men, for the most part ignorant peasants, displayed a degree of 
fanaticism which made them the fitting instruments of Hassan's policy. But 
the initiated amongst the Assassins were convinced of the worthlessness of 
religion and morality, held no belief, and sneered covertly at the Prophet 
and his religion.
     The early history of the society is one of romantic and absorbing 
interest. Hassan had been a member of a secret Ismaelite society at Cairo, 
the head of which was the Caliph, " and of which the object was the 
dissemination of the doctrines of the sect of the Ismaelites.
     This society, we are told, comprised both men and women, who met in 
separate assemblies, for the common supposition of the insignificance of the 
latter sex in the east. is erroneous.  It was presided over by the  Chief 
Missionary (Dai-al-Doat) who was always a person of importance in the state, 
and not infrequently Supreme Judge (Kadhi-al-Kodhat). Their assemblies 
called Societies of Wisdom (Mejalis-al-Hiemet), were held twice a week, on 
Mondays and Wednesdays. All the. members appeared clad in white. The 
president. having first waited on the Caliph, and read to him the intended 
lecture, or, if that could not be done, having got his signature on the back 
of it. proceeded to the assembly and delivered a written discourse. At the 
conclusion of it, those present kissed his hand and reverently touched with 
their forehead the handwriting of the Caliph.  In this state the society 
con-tinued till the reign of that extraordinary madman, the Caliph 
Haken-bi-emr-illah (Judge by the Command of God). who determined to place it 
on a splendid footing. He erected for it a stately edifice, styled the House 
of Wisdom (Dar-al-hicmet), abundantly furnished with books and mathematical 
instruments.  Its doors were open to all, and paper, pens. and ink were 
profusely supplied for the use of those who chose to frequent it. Professors 
of law, mathematics, logic, and medicine were appointed to give 
instructions; and at +he learned disputations which were frequently held in 
presence of the Caliph, these professors appeared in their state caftans 
(Khalaa) which it is said, exactly resembled the robes worn at the English 
universities. The income assigned to this establishment by the munificence 
of the Caliph, was 257,000 ducats an-nually, arising from the tenths paid to 
the crown.
     "The course of instruction in this university proceeded, according to 
Macrisi, by the following nine degrees.  (I) The object of the first, which 
was long and tedious, was to infuse doubts and difficulties into the mind of 
the aspirant, and to lead him to repose a blind confidence in the know-ledge 
and wisdom of his teacher. To this end he was perplexed with captious 
questions; the absurdities of the literal sense of the Koran and its 
repugnance to reason, were studiously pointed out, and dark hints were given 
that beneath this shell lay a kernel sweet to the taste and nutritive to the 
soul. But all further information was most rigorously withheld till he had 
consented to bind himself by a most solemn oath to absolute faith and blind 
obedience to his instructor.  (2) When he had taken the oath he was admitted 
to the second degree, which in-culcated the acknowledgement of the imams 
appointed by God as the sources of all knowledge.  (3) The third degree 
informed him what was the number of these blessed and holy imams; and this 
was the mystic seven; for, as God had made seven heavens., seven earths, 
seas, planets, metals, tones, and colours, so seven was the number of these 
noblest of God's creatures.  (4)  In the fourth de-gree the pupil learned 
that God had sent seven lawgivers into the world, each of whom was 
commissioned to alter and improve the system of his predecessor; that each 
of these had seven helpers, who appeared in the interval between him and his 
successor; these helpers, as they did not appear as public teachers, were 
called the mute (samit), in contradistinction to the speaking lawgivers. The 
seven lawgivers were Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, Mohammed, and 
Ismael, the son of Jaaffer; the seven principal helpers, called Seats (5005) 
were Seth. Shem. Ishmael (the son of Abraham), Aaron, Simon, Ah, and 
Mohammed, the son of Ismael. It is justly observed that, as this last 
personage was not more than a century dead, the teacher had it in his power 
to fix on whom lie would as the mute prophet of the present time, and 
inculcate the belief in, and obedience to, him of all who had not got beyond 
this degree.  (5) The fifth degree taught that each of the seven mute 
prophets had twelve apostles for the dissemination of his faith. The 
suitableness of this number was also proved by analogy. There are twelve 
signs of the Zodiac, twelve month", twelve tribes of Israel, twelve joints 
in the four fingers of each hand, and so forth.(6) The pupil being led thus 
far, and having shown no symptoms of restiveness, the precepts of the Koran 
were once more brought under consideration,, and he was told that all the 
positive portion" of religion must be subordinate to philosophy. He was 
consequently instructed in the systems of Plato and Aristotle during the 
long space of time; and (7) when esteemed fully qualified. he was ad-mitted 
to the seventh degree, when instruction was com-municated in that mystic 
Pantheism, which is held and taught by the sect of the Soofees.  (8) The 
positive precepts of religion were again considered, the veil was torn from 
the eyes of the aspirant, all that had preceded was now declared to have 
been merely scaffolding to raise the edifice of knowledge, and was to be 
flung down. Prophets and teachers, heaven and hell. all were nothing; future 
bliss and misery were idle dream',. ; all actions were permitted.  (9) The 
ninth degree had only to inculcate that nought was to be believed, 
everything might be done."
     It is worthy of mention that one of Hassan's early intimates was the 
famous Omar Khayyam, with whom he and another friend contracted a bargain 
that the most successful of the three would share his good fortune with the 
others. It is likely that the practical mystic and the astrologer would feel 
drawn to each other by many com-mon tastes. but we do not learn that Omar 
profited much from the bargain so far as Hassan was concerned. The third of 
the friends, Nizam-al-Melk, achieved an exalted position as vizier to the 
second of the Seljuk monarchs, and calling to mind his promise offered Omar 
a post under the government, but the author of the Rubaiyat was too addicted 
to pleasure to accept active employment, and in lieu of the dazzling 
position offered him, was content with a pension of 1,200 ducats, with which 
he went into retirement.
     Hassan clearly perceived that the plan of the society at Cairo was 
defective as a means of acquiring temporal power. The Dais might exert 
themselves and proselytes might be gained, but till possession was obtained 
of some strongholds, and a mode of striking terror into princes devised. 
nothing effectual could be achieved.
     With this object in view he instituted the Fedavi, who unhesitatingly 
obeyed their chief, and, without inquiry or hesitation, plunge their daggers 
into the bosom of whatever victim was pointed out to them, even though their 
own lives should be the immediate sacrifice. The ordinary dress of the 
Fedavi was (like that of all the sects opposed to the house of Abbas), 
white; their caps, girdles, or boots, were red. Hence they were named the 
White {Mubeiyazah), and the Red (Muhammere); but they could with ease assume 
any guise, even that of the Christian monk, to accomplish their murderous 
designs.
     Hassan was perfectly aware that without the compressing power of 
positive religion, no society can well be held to-gether. Whatever, 
therefore, his private opinions may have been, he resolved to impose on the 
bulk of his fol-lowers the most rigid obedience to the positive precepts of 
Islam, and, actually put his own son to death for a breach of one of them.
     Hassan is said to have rejected two of the degrees of the Ismaelite 
society at Cairo, and to have reduced them to seven, the original number in 
the plan of Abdallah Maimoon, the first projector of this secret society  
Besides these seven degrees, through which the aspirants gradually rose to 
knowledge,    Hassan, in what Hammer terms the breviary of the order, drew 
up seven regulations or rules for the conduct of the teachers in his 
society.  (1) The first of these, named Ashinai-Risk (Knowledge of Duty), 
inculcated the requisite knowledge of human nature for selecting fit persons 
for admission. To this belong the proverbial expressions said to have been 
current among the Dais, similar to those used by the ancient Pythagoreans, 
such as " Sow not on barren ground " (that is, "Waste not your labour on 
incapable persons), "Speak not in a house where there is a lamp" (that is, " 
Be silent in the presence of a lawyer").  (2) The second rule was called 
Teenis (Gaining of Confidence). and taught to win the candidates by 
flattering their passions and inclinations.
(3)	The third, of which the name is not given.. taught to involve them 
in doubts and difficulties by pointing out the absurdities of the Koran, and 
of positive religion.
(4)	When the aspirant had gone thus far, the 'solemn oath of silence and 
obedience, and of communicating his doubts to his teacher alone was to be 
imposed on the disciple; and then (5) he was to be informed that the 
doctrines and opinions of the society were those of the greatest men in 
church and state. (6) The Tessees (Confirmation) directed to put the pupil 
again through all he had learned, and to confirm him in it. And, (7) 
finally, the Teevil (Instruction in Allegory) gave the allegorical mode of 
interpreting the Koran, and drawing whatever sense might suit their purposes 
from its pages. Any one who had gone through this course of instruction, and 
was thus become perfectly imbued with the spirit of the society, was 
regarded as an accomplished Dai, and employed in the important office of 
making proselytes and extending its influence.
     Soofeism, a doctrine of this society, which is a kind of mystic 
Pantheism, viewing God in all and all in God, may produce, like fatalism, 
piety or its opposite. In the eyes of one who thus views God, all the 
distinctions between vice and virtue become fleeting and uncertain, and 
crime may gradually lose its atrocity, and be regarded as only a means for 
the production of a good end. That the Ismaelite Fedavi murdered innocent 
persons without compunction, when ordered so to do by his superiors, is an 
undoubted fact, and there is no absurdity in supposing that he and they may 
have thought that in so doing they were acting rightly and promoting the 
cause of truth.
     The followers of Hassan Sabah were called the Eastern Ismaelites, to 
distinguish them from those of Africa. They were also named the Batinjyek 
(Internal or Secret), from the secret meaning which they drew from the text 
of the Koran, and Moolhad, or Moolahid (Impious) on account of the imputed 
impiety of their doctrine names common to them with most of the preceding 
sects. It is under this last appellation that they were known to Marco Polo, 
the Venetian traveller. The name, however, by which they are best known in 
Europe, and which we employ. is that of Assassins. This name is ver,' 
generally derived from that of the founder of their society; but M. De Sacy 
has made it probable that the Oriental term Hashishin, of which the 
Crusaders made Assassins, comes (as already noted) from Hashish, a species 
of hemp, from which intoxicating opiates were made, which the Fedavi were in 
the habit of taking previously to engaging in their daring enterprises, or 
employed as a medium of procuring delicious visions of the paradise promised 
to them by the Sheikh-al-Gebel.
     It is a curious question how Hassan contrived to infuse into the Fedavi 
the recklessness of life, joined with the spirit of implicit obedience to 
the commands of their superiors, which they so invariably displayed. We are 
told that the system adopted for this purpose was to obtain, by purchasing 
or otherwise, from their parents, stout and healthy children. These were 
reared up in implicit obedience to the will of the Sheik, and, to fit them 
for their future office, carefully instructed in various languages.
     The Assassins soon began to make themselves felt as a power in Persia 
and Syria. Their first victim was that very Nizam with whom Hassan and Omar 
had completed their youthful bargain. His son speedily followed him, as did 
the Sultan of Persia. That monarch's successor made war with them, but was 
so terror-stricken by their murderous tactics, that he speedily cemented a 
peace. Hassan died at an advanced age in I 124, having assassin-ated both 
his sons, and left as his successor his chief prior, Hia-busurg-Omid, during 
the reign of whom the Assassins were far from fortunate. The list of their 
victims had by this time become a long and illustrious one. The fourth Sheik 
of the Mountain-another Hassan-made public the secret doctrines of the 
society, announcing that the religion of Islam was abolished and that the 
people might give themselves up to feasting and pleasure. He further stated 
that he was the promised Caliph of God upon earth; but some four years after 
this announcement he was assassinated and succeeded by his son, Mahomed II. 
whose rule of forty-six years was marked by deeds of revolting cruelty. But 
he had several implacable enemies, one of whom was the famous Saladin, and 
the Syrian branch of the society seceded from his sway, and became 
independent. This branch it was with whom the Crusaders came so much into 
contact, and whose emissaries slew Raymond of Tripoli, and Conrad of 
Montferrat. Mahomed’s son, Hassan III., restored the old form of doctrine - 
that is, the people were strictly confined to the practice of Islam, whilst 
the initiates were as before, superior and agnostic. His was the only reign 
in which no assassinations occurred and he was regarded with friendship by 
his neighbours. But after a reign of twelve years, he was poisoned, and 
during the minority of his son assassination was greatly in vogue. After a 
reign of thirty years, Mahomed III., the son in question, was slain by his 
successor, Rukneddin; but vengeance quickly followed, for only a year later 
the Tartars swept into Persia, took Alamut and other Assassin strongholds, 
and captured the reigning monarch, who was slain because of his treachery. 
Over 12,000 Assassins were massacred, and their power was completely broken. 
The like fate overtook the Syrian branch, which was nearly extirpated by the 
Egyptian Mamelukes. But in the more isolated valleys of Syria, many of them 
lingered on and are believed still to exist -there. At all events, doctrines 
similar in character to theirs are occasionally to be met with in Northern 
Syria. An account of the manner in which the Assassins aroused the lust of 
slaughter in the Fedavis is given in Siret-l-Haken, or Memoirs of Hakin - an 
Arabic historic romance, as follows: 
     “Our narrative now returns to Ismael the chief of the Ismaelites.  He 
took with him his people laden with gold, silver, pearls, and other effects, 
taken away from the in-habitants of the coasts, and which he had received in 
the island of Cyprus, and on the part of the King of Egypt, Dhaher, the son 
of Hakem-biemr-Illah: Having bidden farewell to the Sultan of Egypt at 
Tripolis, they proceeded to Massyat, when the inhabitants of the castles and 
fortresses assembled to enjoy themselves, along with the chief Ismael and 
his people. They put on the rich dresses with which the Sultan had supplied 
them, and adorned the castle of Massyat with everything that was good and 
fine. Ismael made his entry into Massyat with the Devoted (Fedavi), as no 
one has ever done at Massyat before him or after him. He stopped there some 
time to take into his service some more persons whom he might make devoted 
both in heart and body.
     "With this view he had caused to be made a vast garden, into which he 
had water conducted. In the middle of this garden he built a kiosk raised to 
the height of four stories. On each of the four sides were richly-ornamented 
windows joined by four arches, in which were painted stars of gold and 
silver. He put into it roses, porcelain. glasses., and drinking-vessels of 
gold and silver. He had with him Mamlooks (i.e., slaves), ten males and ten 
females, who were come with him from the region of the Nile, and who had 
scarcely attained the age of puberty. He clothed them in silks and in the 
finest stuffs, and be gave unto them bracelets of gold and of silver. The 
columns were over-laid with musk, and with amber, and in the four arches of 
the windows he set four caskets, in which was the purest musk. The columns 
were polished, and this place was the retreat of the slaves. He divided the 
garden into four parts. In the first of these were pear-trees, apple-trees, 
vines, cherries, mulberries, plums, and other kinds of fruit-trees. In the 
second were oranges. lemons, olives, pomegranates, and other fruits. In the 
third were cucum-bers, melons, leguminous plants, etc. In the fourth were 
roses, jessamine,  tamarinds, narcissi, violets, lilies, anemonies, etc., 
etc.
     "The garden was divided by canals of water, and the kiosk was 
surrounded with ponds and reservoirs. There were groves in which were seen 
antelopes, ostriches, asses, and wild cows. Issuing from the ponds, one met 
ducks, geese, partridges, quails, hares, foxes, and other animals. Around 
the kiosk the chief Ismael planted walks of tail trees, terminating in the 
different parts of the garden. He built there a great house, divided into 
two apartments, the upper and the lower. From the latter covered walks led 
out into the garden, which was all enclosed with walls, so that no one could 
see into it, for these walks and buildings were all void of inhabitants. He 
made a gallery of cool-ness, which ran from this apartment to the cellar, 
which was behind. This apartment served as a place of assembly for the men. 
Having placed himself on a sofa there opposite the door, the chief made his 
men sit down, and gave them to eat and drink during the whole length of the 
day until evening. At nightfall he looked around him, and, selecting those 
whose firmness pleased him, said to them, ' Ho I such-a-one, come and seat 
thyself near me.' It is thus that Ismael made those whom he bad chosen sit 
near him on the sofa and drink. He then spoke to them of the great and 
excellent qualities of the imam Ali, of his bravery, his nobleness, and his 
generosity, until they fell asleep, overcome by the power of the benjeh 
which he had given them, and which never failed to produce its effects in 
less than a quarter of an hour, so that they fell down as if they were 
inanimate. Ac soon as the man had fallen the chief Ismael arose, and, taking 
him up, brought him into a dormitory, and then, shutting the door, carried 
him on his shoulders into the gallery of coolness, which was in the garden, 
and thence into the kiosk, where he committed him to the care of the male 
and female slaves, directing them to comply with all the desires of the can-
didate, on whom they flung vinegar till be awoke. When he was come to 
himself the youths and maidens said to him. ' We are only waiting for thy 
death, for this place is destined for thee. This is one of the pavilions of 
Para-dise, and we are the houries and the children of Paradise. If thou wert 
dead thou wouldest be for ever with us, but thou art only dreaming, and wilt 
soon awake.' Mean-while, the chief Ismael had returned to the company as. 
soon as be had witnessed the awakening of the candidate, who now perceived 
nothing but youths and maidens of the greatest beauty. and adorned in the 
most magnificent manner.
     " He looked around the place, inhaled the fragrance of musk and 
frankincense, and drew near to the garden. where be saw the beasts and the 
birds, the running water, and the trees. He gazed on the beauty of the 
kiosk, and the vases of gold and silver, while the youths and maidens kept 
him in converse.  In this way be remained confounded, not knowing whether he 
was awake or only dreaming. When two hours of the night had gone by, the 
chief Ismael returned to the dormitory, closed to the door, and thence 
proceeded to the garden, where his slaves came around him and rose before. 
him. When the candidate perceived him, he said unto him, ' O, chief Ismael, 
do I dream, or am I awake ? ' The chief Ismael then made answer to him.
O, such-a-one beware of relating this vision to any ore who is a stranger to 
this place I Know that the Lord Ah has shown thee the place which is 
destined for thee in Paradise. Know that at this moment the Lord Ah and I 
have been sitting together in the regions of the empyrean. So do not 
hesitate a moment in the service of the imam who has given thee to know his 
felicity.' Then the chief Ismael ordered supper to be served. It was brought 
in vessels of gold and of silver, and consisted of boiled meats and roast 
meats, with other dishes. While the candidate ate, he was sprinkled with 
rose-water; when be called for drink there were brought to him vessels of 
gold and silver filled with delicious liquors, in which also bad been 
mingled some benjeh. When he bad fallen asleep, Ismael carried him through 
the gallery back to the dormitory, and, leaving him there, returned to his 
company. After a little time he went back, threw vinegar on his face, and 
then, bringing him out, ordered one of the Mamlooks to shake him. On 
awaking, and finding himself in the same place among the guests, he said. 
'There is no god but God, and Mohammed is the Prophet of God   The chief 
Ismael then drew near and caressed him. and he remained, as it were, 
immersed in intoxication, wholly devoted to the service of the chief, who 
then said unto him. 'O, such-a-one; know that what thou hast seen was not a 
dream, but one of the miracles of the imam Ah. Know that he has written thy 
name among those of his friends.  If thou keep the secret thou art certain 
of thy felicity, but if thou speak of it thou wilt incur the resentment of 
the imam.  If thou die thou art a martyr; but beware of relating this to any 
person what-ever. Thou hast entered by one of the gates to the friend-ship 
of the imam, and art become one of his family; but if thou betray the 
secret, thou wilt become one of his enemies, and be driven from his house.' 
Thus this man became one of the servants of the chief Ismael. who in this 
manner surrounded himself with trusty men, until his reputation was 
established.  This is what is related to the chief Ismael and his Devoted."
     To these romantic tales of the Paradise of the Old Man of the Mountain 
we must add to another of an even more mystical character, furnished by the 
learned and venerable Sheik Agd-ur-Rahman (Servant of the Compassionate, 
i.e., of God) Ben Ebubekr Al-Jeriri of Damascus, in the twenty-fourth 
chapter of his work entitled, A Choice Book for Discovering the Secrets of 
the Art of Imposture.

Asteroids : (See Astrology.)

Astolpho : A hero of Italian romance. He was the son of Otho, King of 
England.  He was transformed into a myrtle by Alcina, a sorceress, but later 
regained his human form through Melissa. He took part in many adventures, 
and cured Orlando of his madness. Astolpho is the alle-gorical 
representation of a true man lost through sensuality.

Astral Body is in Theosophy that body which functions in the Astral World.  
Like the rest of mans five bodies, it is composed of matter, relatively, 
however, much finer than that which composes the ordinary physical body.  It 
is the instrument of passions, emotions, and desires, and, since it 
interpenetrates and extends beyond the physical body, it is the medium 
through which these are conveyed to the latter. When it separates from the 
denser body-as it does during sleep, or by the influence of drugs, or as the 
result of accidents - it takes with it the capacity for feeling, and only 
with its return can pain or any other such phenomena be felt. During these 
periods of separa-tion the astral body is an exact replica of the physical, 
and as it is extremely sensitive to thought, the apparitions of dead and 
dying- of which so much is heard in the new science of the Borderland-
resemble even to the smallest details the physical bodies which they have 
lately left. The Astral World is, of course, easily attainable to clair-
voyants of even moderate powers, and the appropriate body is therefore 
clearly visible.  In accordance with theosophic teaching on the subject of 
thought, the latter is not the abstraction it is commonly considered to be, 
but built up of definite forms the shape of which depends on the quality of 
the thought, and it also causes definite vibrations, which are seen as 
colours.  Hence, clairvoyants are able to tell the state of a man’s 
development from the appearance of his astral body. A nebulous appearance 
betokens imperfect development, while an ovoid appearance betokens a more 
perfect development.  As the colours are indicative of the kind of thought, 
the variety of these in the astral body indicates the possessor's character. 
Inferior thoughts beget loud colours, so that rage, for instance, will be 
recognised by the red appearance of the astral body, and on the contrary, 
higher thoughts will be recognisable by the presence of delicate colours, 
religious thought for instance, causing a blue colour. This teaching holds 
true for the bodies higher than the astral, but, the coloration of the 
astral body is much more familiar to dwellers in the physical world than is 
the coloration of the higher bodies, with the feelings of which they are 
relatively unacquainted. There is a definite theory underlying the emotional 
and other functions of the astral body. The matter of which the latter is 
composed is not, of course, alive with an intelligent life, but it 
nevertheless possesses a kind of life sufficient to convey an understanding 
of its own existence and wants. The stage of evolution of this life is that 
of descent, the turning point not having yet, so far as it is concerned, 
been reached. He who possesses the body has, on the other hand, commenced to 
ascend, and there is, therefore, a continual opposition of forces between 
him and his astral. body. Hence, his astral body accentuates in him such of 
grosser, retrograde thoughts as he may nourish since the direction of these 
thoughts coincides with its own direction.  If, however, he resists the 
opposition of his astral body, the craving of the latter gradu-ally becomes 
weaker and weaker till at last it disappears al-together.  And the 
constitution of the astral body is thereby altered, gross thoughts demanding 
for their medium gross astral matter, pure thoughts demanding fine astral 
matter. During physical life the various kinds of matter in the astral body 
are intermingled, but at physical death the ele-mentary life in the matter 
of the astral body seeks in-stinctively after self-preservation, and it 
therefore causes the matter to rearrange itself in a series of seven concen-
tric sheaths, the densest being outside and the finest inside. Physical 
vision depends on the eyes, but astral vision depends on the various kinds 
of astral matter being in a condition of receptiveness to different 
undulations. To be aware of fine matter, fine matter in the astral body is 
necessary, and so with the other kinds.  Hence, when the rearrangement takes 
place, vision only of the grossest kinds of matter is possible since only 
that kind is repre-sented in the thick outer sheath of the astral body.  
Under these circumstances, the new denizen of the ,astral sphere sees only 
the worst of it, and also only the worst of his fellow denizens, even though 
they are not in so low a state as himself.  This state is not, of course 
eternal, and in accordance with the evolutionary process, the gross sheath 
of astral matter wears slowly away, and the man remains clothed with the six 
less gross sheaths. These also, with the passage of time, wear away, being 
resolved into their compound elements, and at last when the final 
disintegra-tion of the least gross sheath of all takes place, the in-
dividual leaves the Astral World  and passes into the Mental. This 
rearrangement of the astral body is not, however, in-evitable, and those who 
have learned and know, are able at physical death to prevent it.  In such 
cases the change appears a very small one, and the so-called dead continue 
to live their lives and do their work much as they did in the physical body.  
(See Astral World, Avichi Theosophy.)

Astral World. (Plane or Sphere) : Kama World is, in Theosophy, the second 
lowest of the seven worlds, the world of emotions, desires, and passions.  
Into it man passes at physical death, and there he functions for periods 
which vary with the state of his development, the primitive savage spending 
a relatively short time in the Astral World, the civilised man spending 
relatively longer.  The appropriate body is the astral (q.v.), which though 
com-posed of matter as is the physical body, is nevertheless of a texture 
vastly finer than the latter. Though it is in its aspect of the after-death 
abode that this world is of most importance and most interest, it may be mid 
in passing, that even during physical life, man-not only clairvoyants who 
attain it easily, but also ordinary men-may and do temporarily inhabit it. 
This happens during sleep, or by reason of the action of anaesthetics or 
drugs, or accidents, and the interpenetrating astral body then leaves its 
denser physical neighbour, and taking with it the sense of pleasure and 
pain, lives for a short time in its own world. Here again the state of the 
savage differs from that of his more advanced fellows, for the former does 
not travel far from his immediate surroundings, while the latter may perform
useful, helpful work for the benefit of humanity. Further, it may in passing 
be noted that disembodied mankind are not the only inhabitants of the Astral 
World, for very many of its inhabitants are of an altogether non-human 
nature-lower orders of the devas or angels, and nature-spirits or 
elementals, both good and bad, such including fairies which are just beyond 
the powers of human vision, and the demons present to the vision of delirium 
tremens. It will however be sufficient now to turn attention to the Astral 
World as the state immediately following physical death and containing both 
heaven and hell as these are popularly conceived.
     There are seven divisions which correspond to the seven divisions of 
matter, the solid, liquid, gaseous, etheric, super-etheric, subatomic and 
atomic, and, as mentioned in the article on the Astral Body, this plays a 
most im-portant part in the immediate destiny of man in it. If through 
ignorance, he has permitted the rearrangement of the matter of his astral 
body into sheaths, he is cognisant only of part of his surroundings at a 
time, and it is not till after experience, much of which may be extremely 
painful, that he is able to enjoy the bliss which the higher divisions of 
the Astral World contain. The lowest of these divisions, the seventh, is the 
environment of those of gross and unrestrained passions, since it and most 
of the matter of their astral bodies is of the same type, and it constitutes 
a very hell, and the only hell which exists. This is Avichi, the place of 
desires which cannot be satisfied because of the absence of the physical 
body, which was the means of their satisfaction. The tortures of these 
desires are the analogue of the torments of hell-fire in the older Christian 
orthodoxy. Unlike that orthodoxy, how-ever, theosophy teaches that the state 
of torment is not eternal, but passes away in time when the desires through 
long gnawing without fulfillment, have died at last, and it is therefore 
more correct to look on 
Avichi as a purgatorial state. The ordinary man, however, does not 
experience this seventh division of the Astral World, but according to his 
character finds himself in one or other of the three next higher divisions. 
The sixth division is very little different from his physical existence, and 
he continues in his old surroundings among his old friends, who are, of 
course, unaware of his presence, and indeed, often does not realise that he 
is dead so far as the physical world is concerned. The fifth and fourth 
divisions are in most respects quite similar to this, but their inhabitants 
become less and less immersed in the activities and interests which have 
hitherto engrossed them, and each sheath of their astral bodies decays in 
turn as did the gross outer sheath of the sensualist's body. The three 
higher divisions are still more removed from the ordinary material world, 
and their inhabitants enjoy a state of bliss of which we can have no 
conception ; worries and cares of earth are altogether absent, the 
insistence of lower desires has worn out in the lower divisions, and it is 
now possible to live continually in an environment of the loftiest thoughts 
and aspirations. The third division is said to correspond to the spiritual-
istic "summerland," where the inhabitants live in a world of their own 
creation-of the creation of their thoughts.
Its cities and all their contents, scenery of life, are all formed by the 
influence of thought. The second division is what is properly looked on as 
heaven, and the inhabi-tants of different races, creeds, and beliefs, find 
it each according to his belief. Hence, instead of its being the place 
taught of by any particular religion, it is the region where each and every 
religion finds its own ideal. Christ-ians, Mohammedans, Hindus, and so on, 
find it to be just as they conceived it would be. Here, and in the first and 
highest division, the inhabitants pursue noble aims freed from what of 
selfishness was mingled with these aims on earth. The literary man, his 
thoughts of fame; the artist, the scholar, the preacher, all work without 
incentive of personal interest, and where their work is pursued long enough, 
and they are fitted for the change, they leave the Astral World and enter 
one vastly higher-the Mental. It was, however, mentioned that the 
rearrangement of the matter of the astral body at physical death, was the 
result of ignorance, and those who are sufficiently instructed do not permit 
this rearrangement to take. They are not, therefore, confined to any one 
division, and have not to progress from division to division, but are able 
to move through any part of the Astral World, labouring always in their 
various lines of action to assist the great evolutionary
scheme.  (See Astral Body, Worlds, Planes or Spheres, Theosophy, Avichi, 
Summerland.)

Astrology : The art of divining the fate or future of persons from the 
juxtaposition of the sun, moon and planets, Judicial. astrology foretells 
the destinies of individuals and nations, while natural astrology predicts 
changes of weather and the operation of the stars upon natural things.
     History.-In Egyptian tradition, we find its invention attributed to 
Hermes Trismegistus, or Thoth, by whom, under different names, is 
represented the various revela-tions of truth, both theological and natural; 
for he is the Mercury of the Romans, the eloquent deliverer of the messages 
of the gods. The name of Ptolemy, the greatest of which astrology can boast, 
belongs also to Egypt, but. to the comparatively recent period when Imperial 
Rome flourished. In Imperial Rome astrology was held in great repute, 
especially under the reign of Tiberius, who himself obtained that knowledge 
of the science from Thrasyllus, which enabled him to foretell the destiny of 
Galba, then consul. When Claudius was dying from the effects of Locusta’s 
poison, Agrippina cautiously dissembled his progressive illness; nor would 
she announce his decease till the very moment arrived, which the astrologers 
had pronounced fortunate for the accession of Nero. Augustus had discouraged 
the practice of astrology by banishing its professors from Rome, but the 
favour of his successors recalled them, and though occasional edicts, in 
subsequent reigns, restrained, and even punished all who divined by the 
stars; and though Vitellius and Domitian revived the edict of Augustus, the 
practices of the astrologers were secretly encouraged, and their predictions 
extensively believed. Domitian himself, in spite of his hostility, was in 
fear of their denouncements. They prophesied the year, the hour, and the 
manner of his death, and agreed with his father in foretelling that he 
should perish not by poison, but by the dagger.
     After the age of the Antonines and the work of Censorinus, we hear 
little of astrology for some generations. In the eighth century the 
venerable Bede and his distinguished scholar, Alcuin, are said to have 
pursued this mystic study. In that immediately following, the Arabians 
revived and encouraged it. Under the patronage of Almaimon, the Mirammolin, 
in the year 827, the Megale Syntaxis of Ptolemy was translated under the 
title of " Almagest,” by Al. Hazen Ben Yusseph. Albumasar added to this 
work, and the astral science continued to receive new force from the labours 
of Alfraganus, Ebennozophim, Alfaragius, and Geber.
     The conquest of Spain by the Moors carried this know-ledge, with all 
their other treasures of learning into Spain, and before their cruel 
expulsion it was naturalized among the Christian savants. Among these the 
wise Alonzo (or Alphonso) of Castile, has immortalized himself by his 
scientific researches, and the Jewish and Christian doctors, who arranged 
the tables which pass under his name, were convened from all the accessible 
parts of civilized Europe. Five years were employed in their discussion, and 
it has been said that the enormous sum of 400,000 ducats was disbursed in 
the towers of the Alcazar of Galiana, in the adjustment and correction of 
Ptolemy's calculations. Nor was it only the physical motions of the stars 
which occupied this grave assembly. The two kabalistic volumes, yet existing 
in cipher, in the royal library of the kings of Spain, and which tradition 
assigns to the hand of Alonzo himself, betoken a more visionary study. and 
in spite of the denunciations against his orthodoxy, which were thundered in 
his ears on the authority of Tertullian, Basil and Bonaventure, the fearless 
monarch gave his sanction to such masters as practised truly the art of 
divination by the stars, and in one part of his code enrolled astrology 
among the seven liberal sciences.
     In Germany many eminent men have been addicted to this study; and a 
long catalogue might be made of those who have considered other sciences 
with reference to astrology, and written on them as such. Faust has, of 
course, the credit of being an astrologer as well as a wizard, and we find 
that singular but splendid genius, Cornelius Agrippa, writing with as much 
zeal against astrology as on behalf of other occult sciences.
     To the believers in astrology, who flourished in the sixteenth and 
seventeenth centuries, must be added the name of Albert von Wallenstein, 
Duke of Friedland. He was indeed an enthusiast in the cause, and many 
curious anecdotes are related of this devotion. That he had himself studied 
astrology, and under no mean instructors, is evidenced by his biography and 
correspondence.
     Of the early progress of astrology in England, little is known. Bede 
and Alcuin we have already mentioned as addicted to its study. Roger Bacon 
could scarcely escape the contagion of the art. But it was the period of the 
Stuarts which must be considered as the acme of astrology among us. Then 
Lilly employed the doctrine of the magical circle, and the evocation of 
spirits from the Ars Notoria of Cornelius Agrippa, and used the form of 
prayer prescribed therein to the angel Salmonoeus, and entertained among his 
familiar acquaintance the guardian spirits of England, Salmael and 
Malchidael. His ill success with the divining rod induced him to surrender 
the pursuit of rhabdomancy, in which he first engaged, though he still 
preserved in asserting that the operation demanded secrecy and intelligence 
in the agents, and, above all, a strong faith, and a competent knowledge of 
their work. The Dean of Westminster had given him permission to Search for 
treasure in the cloisters of the abbey in the dead of the night. On the 
western side, the rods turned over each other with inconceivable rapidity, 
yet, on digging, nothing but a coffin could be discovered. He retired to the 
abbey, and then a storm arose which nearly destroyed the west end of the 
church, extinguished all the candles but one, and made the rods immovable. 
Lilly succeeded at length in charming away the demon, but no persuasion 
could induce him to make another experiment in that species of divination.
     The successor of Lilly was Henry Coley, a tailor, who had been his 
amanuensis, and traded in prophecy with success almost equal to that of his 
master.
     While astrology flourished in England it was in high repute with its 
kindred pursuits of magic, necromancy, and al-chemy, at the court of France. 
Catherine de Medici her-self was an adept in the art. At the revolution, 
which commenced a new era in this country, astrology declined, and 
notwithstanding the labours of Partridge, and those of Ebenezer Sibley, it 
has only in recent years recovered its importance.
     Signs.-There are twelve signs of the Zodiac, divided in astrology into 
"Northern   and "Commanding" (the first six), and " Southern' and "Obeying" 
(last six). They are as follow
     Aries, the house of Mars, and exaltation of the sun, or the first sign 
of the zodiac, is a vernal. dry, fiery, masculine, cardinal, equinoctial, 
diurnal, movable, commanding. eastern, choleric, violent, and quadrupedian 
sign. These epithets will be presently explained. The native, that is, the 
person born under its influence, is tall of stature, of a strong but spare 
make, dry constitution, long face and neck, thick shoulders, piercing eyes, 
sandy or red hair, and brown complexion. In disposition he will be warm, 
hasty and passionate. The aspects of the planets may, however, materially 
alter these effects. This sign rules the head and face. Among diseases, it 
produces small-pox, and epilepsy, apoplexy, headache, hypochondriasis, 
baldness, ringworm, and all diseases of the head and face, paralysis, 
fevers, measles, and convulsions. It presides over the following countries: 
England, France, Germany, Syria, Switzerland, Poland and Denmark; and over 
the cities of Naples, Capua, Padua, Florence, Verona, Ferrara, Bruns-wick, 
Marseilles, Caesarea, and Utrecht, Its colours are red and white.
     Now to explain this terminology, before examining another sign, there 
are said to be four triplicities among the signs, viz.: the earthly 
triplicity, including Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn; the airy, which includes 
Gemini, Libra and Aquarius; the fiery, under which are reckoned Aries, Leo, 
and Sagittarius; and the watery, which claims Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces. 
The signs are further divided into diurnal and nocturnal: Aries diurnal, 
Taurus noctur-nal, and so on alternately, the diurnal signs being all 
masculine, and the nocturnals feminine. The terms tropi-cal, equinoctial, 
vernal, etc., need no comment. Fixed, common, movable, refer to the weather. 
Signs which are named after quadrupeds are, of course, quadrupedal. Such as 
are called after human states of occupations as humane. A person born under 
a fiery masculine diurnal sign is hot in temper, and bold in character. If 
it be a quadrupedal sign, he is somewhat like to the animal after which the 
'sign is called. Thus in Taurus, the native is bold and furious  in Leo, 
fierce and cruel. Cardinal signs are those occupying the four cardinal 
points. The first six from Aries are termed commanding, and the latter six, 
obeying signs. Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces are called fruitful or prolific; 
and Gemini, Lao, and Virgo, barren. Sagittarius, because usually represented 
as a centaur, is said to be humane, and productive of humane character in 
the former fifteen degrees, but of a savage, brutal and intractable 
disposition in the latter.
     We shall now proceed with the signs. Taurus is cold and dry, earthly, 
melancholy, feminine, fixed and noctur-nal, southern, the night-house of 
Venus. When influential in a nativity, it usually produces a person with a 
broad forehead, thick lips, dark curling hair, of quality rather brutal, 
melancholy, and slow in anger, but when once enraged, violent, furious, and 
difficult to be appeased. The diseases under this sign are all such as 
attack the throat, scrofula, quinsey, imposthumes and wens. The sign rules 
the neck and throat. Places subject to it are stables, cow-houses, cellars 
and low rooms, and all places used for or by cattle.  Of kingdoms, Russia, 
Ireland, Sweden, Persia and Parthia, and of cities, Leipsic, Parma, Mantua, 
Novogorod, and eleven others.
     Gemini is masculine and diurnal, aerial, hot and moist, The native is 
tall and straight of body, with long arms; the hands and feet well formed, 
the complexion rather dark, the hair brown, the eye hazel; strong and active 
in person, sound and acute in judgment; lively, playful, and generally 
skilful in business.  Diseases under this sign are those to which the arms, 
hands and shoulders are subject, with aneurisms, frenzy and insanity.  
Places hilly and high grounds, the tops of houses, wainscoted rooms, halls 
and theatres, barns, storehouses and stairs; kingdoms, Armenia, Brabant, 
Lombardy, Sardinia and Egypt; cities: London, Bruges, Cordova, Metz and 
seven others.  It is the day-house of Mercury, and rules the colours red and 
white.
     Cancer is the only house of the moon, and the first sign of the watery 
northern triplicity.  It is a watery, cold, moist, phlegmatic, feminine, 
movable nocturnal, sol-stitial, and exceedingly fruitful sign, more so than 
any other. The native is fair and pale, short and small; the upper part of 
the body larger in proportion to the lower; a round face, light hair. and 
blue or grey eyes; phlegmatic, and heavy in disposition; weak in 
constitution, and of a small voice.  Diseases : All disorders of the breast 
and stomach over which parts the sign rules; cancers, con-sumption,  asthma,  
dropsy and surfeits.  Kingdoms: Scotland, Holland, Zealand, Burgundy, 
Numidia and Carthage; places: the sea and all rivers, swamps, ponds, lakes, 
wells, ditches, and watery places. Cities: Constanti-nople, Tunis, York and 
New York, Genoa, Venice., Algiers, Amsterdam, Cadiz, and sixteen others, The 
colours ruled by this sign are green and russet,
     Leo is a sign of a very different nature,  It is the only house of the 
sun: fiery. hot, dry, masculine, choleric, com-manding, eastern, and a very 
barren sign.  When this sign ascends in a nativity, the individual will be 
of a tall and powerful frame, well-shaped, of an austere countenance, of 
light, yellowish hair, large piercing eyes, commanding aspect, and ruddy 
complexion.  The character will be fierce and cruel, but yet open, generous 
and Courteous, Such was Richard Coeur-de-Lion. But the latter part of the 
sign is weaker and more brutal. This sign is even more modified by planetary 
influences than any others,  Among diseases it causes all affections of the 
heart, over which together with the back and the vertebrae of the neck, it 
rules; fevers, plague, jaundice and pleurisy.  Of places, it governs woods, 
forests, deserts and hunting-grounds, fire-places and furnaces; of kingdoms: 
Italy, Chaldaea, Turkey and Bohemia; of cities: Bath, Bristol, Taunton, 
Rome, Damascus, Prague, Philadelphia, and nineteen others. Its colours are 
red and green.
     Virgo is an earthy, cold, dry, barren, feminine, southern, melancholy, 
commanding sign.  It is the house and exaltation of Mercury. The native is 
handsome and well--shaped.. slender. of middle stature, and of a clear, 
ruddy or brown complexion, dark hair and eyes, the face rather round, and 
the voice sweet and clear, but not strong; the character amiable and 
benevolent, witty and studious, but not persevering; and if not opposed by 
planetary aspects, apt to oratory. This sign rules the viscera, and is 
answerable for all diseases affecting them, Of places cornfields and 
granaries, studies and libraries; of kingdoms: Greece, Crete, Mesopotamia 
and Assyria ;  of cities Jerusalem, Paris, Corinth, and twelve others,  Its 
colours are blue and black,
     Libra is a sign aerial, sanguine, hot, moist, equinoctial cardinal, 
movable, masculine, western and diurnal, humane, and the day-house of Venus. 
The native is tall and well-
made, very handsome, of a fine ruddy complexion in youth, but which changes 
to a deep red with advancing years. The hair long and flaxen. the eye" grey. 
the disposition courteous, and the character just and upright. Of king-doms 
it governs Ethiopia, Austria, Portugal, and Savoy; and of cities, Antwerp, 
Frankfort, Vienna, Charlestown in America, and twenty-seven others.  The 
colours which it rules are crimson and tawny; and of places. mountains, saw-
pits and woods newly felled.
     Scorpio, the night-house of Mars, is a cold, phlegmatic, feminine, 
nocturnal, fixed, northern, and watery sign. The native is of a strong, 
robust, corpulent body, of a middle stature, broad visage, dark but not 
clear com-plexion, dark grey eyes or light brown, black hair or very dark 
brown, short, thick legs and thick neck.  Of places it governs swampy 
grounds and stagnant waters, places which abound in venomous creatures, 
orchards and ruinous houses, especially near water. Of kingdoms: Fez, 
Bavaria, Norway and Mauritania; of cities: Mes-sina, and others; of colours: 
brown.
     Sagittarius is a fiery, hot, dry, masculine, diurnal, eastern,  common, 
bicorporeal, obeying sign, the day-house and joy of Jupiter.  The native is 
well-formed and rather above the middle stature, with fine chestnut hair but 
inclined to baldness, a visage somewhat long but ruddy and handsome; the 
body strong, stout and hardy. He is inclined to horsemanship and field-
sports, careless of danger, generous and intrepid, but hasty and careless, 
This sign rules the hips, and is the cause of gout, rheu-matism and 
disorders which affect the muscles.  Accidents and disorders occasioned by 
intemperance come under the government of this sign.  Of kingdoms: Spain, 
Hun-gary, Sclavonia and Arabia; of places: stables and parks; and of 
colours, green. and red.
     Capricornus is an earthy, cold, dry, feminine, nocturnal, movable, 
cardinal, solstitian, domestic, southern, quad-rupedal sign; the house of 
Saturn, and the exaltation, The native is of slender stature, long trim 
countenance, small beard, dark hair and eyes, long neck, narrow chest and 
chin, tall usually, though not always; in disposition, cheerful and 
collected;  talented and upright.  Ruling the knees and hips, it governs all 
diseases which afflict them, and also all contagious diseases, such as 
leprosy, etc., and melancholy diseases such as hypochondriasis and hysteria.  
The kingdoms which it rules are India, Thrace, Mexico and Saxony;  and the 
cities, Oxford, Bradenburg and nineteen others. The places over which it has 
power are workshops and fallow grounds, and its colours, black and brown.
     Aquarius is an airy, hot, moist, rational, fixed, humane, diurnal, 
sanguine, masculine, western, obeying sign, the day-house of Saturn. The 
native is a well-made and robust person, rather above the middle stature, 
long face, but of a pleasing and delicate countenance, clear, bright 
complexion, with flaxen hair, often sandy; of a disposition fair open and 
honest. As this sign rules the legs and ankles.. it causes all diseases 
which affect them: lameness, white swelling, cramp, and gout. Of places it 
denotes mines and quarries, aeroplane machines, roofs of houses, wells, and 
conduits.  Of kingdoms:  Tartary, Denmark and Westphalia; and of cities: 
Hamburg, Bremen, and fifteen more.  Its colours are grey and sky-blue.
     Lastly, Pisces is a watery, cold, moist, feminine, phleg-matic, 
nocturnal, common, bicorporeal, northern, idle, effeminate, sickly, and 
extremely fruitful sign, only less so than Cancer; the house of Jupiter, and 
the exaltation of Venus. The native is short and ill-shaped, fleshy, if not 
corpulent, with thick, round shoulders, light hair and eyes, the complexion 
pale, and the head and face large; of a weak and vacillating disposition, 
well-meaning, but devoid of energy. This sign rules the feet, and causes 
lameness and every kind of disorder occasioned by watery humours.  Of 
places: all such as are under Cancer, save the sea and rivers; of kingdoms: 
Lydia, Calabria, Pamphy-hlia and Normandy; of cities: Compostella, 
Alexandria, Rheims. Ratisbon, and eleven others; and of colours, it rules 
white.
     Planets. The influence and effects of the planets are still more 
important than those of the signs, and they are as follow: We commence with 
the most remote of the planets, Uranus. The days and hours are, as we have 
seen divided among the planets, but as none were left vacant, the 
appropriation of any to Uranus would, of course, throw out almost all the 
ancient calculations.  If these then are to be preserved, the newly-
discovered planet has no in-fluence; but if this be the case, by what 
analogy can any be assigned to the others? However, when this question was 
likely to be debated, Uranus was rolling on in its far-off orbit, and 
occasioning no uneasiness whatever to astrologers or magicians.  Leaving out 
all mention of the astronomical elements, we proceed to notice that Uranus 
is by nature extremely cold and dry, melancholy, and one of the infortunes. 
The native is of small stature, dark or pale complexion, rather light hair, 
of a highly. nervous temperament., sedate aspect, but having something 
singular in his appearance; light grey eyes, and delicate constitu-tion.  If 
the planet be well dignified, he is a searcher into science, particularly 
chemistry, and remarkably attached to the wonderful  He possesses an 
extraordinary magnani-mity and loftiness of mind, with an uncontrollable and 
intense desire for pursuits and discoveries of an uncommon nature. If 
ill-dignified, then the native is weak, sickly, and short-lived, 
treacherous, and given to gross imposture, unfortunate in his undertakings. 
capricious in his taste, and very eccentric in his conduct. No planet, save 
Saturn, is so actively and powerfully malevolent as this.  His effects are 
truly malefic.  They are, however of a totally unexpected, strange and 
unaccountable character.  He rules over places dedicated to unlawful arts, 
laboratories, etc. The regions under his immediate governance are Lapland, 
Finland, and the Poles.  Professions: 
necro-mancers and Gee tic magicians; cities: Upsala and Mexico. The name of 
his angel has not been found out, but he is known to be very hostile to the 
female sex, and when his aspects interfere in the period of marriage, the 
result is anything but happiness.
     Saturn is by nature cold and dry; is a melancholy, earthy, masculine, 
solitary, diurnal, malevolent planet, and the great infortune. When he is 
lord of the ascendant, the native is of a middle stature the complexion dark 
and swarthy, or pale; small black eyes, broad shoulders, black hair, and 
ill-shaped about the lower extremities. When well dignified, the native is 
grave and wise, studious and severe, of an active and penetrating mind, 
reserved and patient, constant in attachment, but implacable in resentment, 
upright and inflexible; but if the planet be ill-dignified at the time of 
birth, then the native will be sluggish, covetous, and distrustful:  false, 
stubborn, malicious, and ever discontented. This planet is said to be well 
dignified in the horoscope of the Duke of Wellington, and to have been ill-
dignified, but singularly posited in that of Louis XI. of France. The 
diseases he signifies are quartan agues, and such as proceed from' cold and 
melan-choly; all impediments in the sight, ear, and teeth; rheumatism, 
consumption, disorders affecting the memory, the spleen, and the bones.  
Saturn, in general, signifies husbandmen, day-labourers, monks, Jesuits, 
sectarians, sextons, and such as have to do with the dead; gardeners, dyers 
of black, and thirty-three other professions, which Lilly enumerates.  He 
mentions also forty-eight plants, including all anodynes and narcotic 
poisons, which are under the rule of this planet. Among animals, the cat, 
the ass, hare, mole, mouse, wolf, bear, and crocodile; all venomous 
creatures.  Among fishes, the eel, tortoise and shell-fish; among the birds, 
the bat, and the owl; among metals and minerals, lead, the loadstone, and 
all dross of metals; over the sapphire, lapis lazuli, and all stones that 
are not polishable, and of a leaden or ashy colour. 
     “He causeth the air to be dark and cloudy, cold and hurtful, with thick 
and dense vapours. He delighteth in the eastern quarter, causing eastern 
winds; and in gather-ing any plant belonging to him the ancients did observe 
to turn their faces to the east in his hour. Those under him do rarely live 
beyond fifty-seven years; and if he be well placed, seldom less than thirty.  
But his nature is cold and dry, and these qualities are destructive to man. 
Black is the colour which he ruleth.  Of countries under his influence are 
Bavaria, Saxony, and Styria;  Ravenna, Constance and Ingoldstadt among 
cities.  His friends are Jupiter, Mars and Mercury; his enemies, the Sun and 
Venus. We call Saturday his day, for then he begins to rule at sunrise, and 
rules the first hour and the eighth of that day.  His angel is Cassel."
     The next planet is Jupiter. He is a diurnal, masculine planet, 
temperately hot and moist, airy, and sanguine; the greater fortune and lord 
of the airy triplicity. The native, if the. planet be well dignified, will 
be of an erect carriage and tall stature; a handsome ruddy complexion, high 
forehead, soft. thick brown hair; a handsome ah ape and commanding aspect; 
his voice will be strong, clear and manly, and his speech grave and sober.  
If the planet be ill dignified, still the native will be what is called a 
good-looking person, though of smaller stature, and less noble aspect.  In 
the former case, the understanding and char-acter will be of the highest 
possible description; and in the latter case, though careless and 
improvident, immoral and irreligious; he will never entirely lose the good 
opinion of his friends. Yet he will be, as Sancho Panza expresses it: 
"Haughty to the humble, and humble to the haughty." The diseases it rules 
are apoplexy and inflammation of the lungs; disorders affecting the left 
ear, cramps, and pal-pitations of the heart. Plants: the oak, spice, apples, 
and one hundred and seventy-two others; gems: topaz, amethyst, hyacinth and 
bezoar;  minerals: tin, pewter and firestone; animals: the ox, horse, 
elephant, stag, and all domestic animals; weather: pleasant, healthful, and 
serene west-north and north-west winds; birds: the eagle, peacock, pheasant, 
etc.  Of fishes, he rules the whale and the dolphin; of colours: blue, when 
well posited ; of professions: the clergy, the higher order of law students, 
and those who deal in woollen goods; when weak, the dependents on the above, 
with quacks, common cheats, and drunkards.  Places: all churches, palaces, 
courts, and places of pomp and solemnity.  He rules the lungs and blood, and 
is friendly with all the planets, save Mars. Countries:  Spain. Hungary and 
Babylon; his angel is Zadkiel.
     The next planet is Mars; a masculine, nocturnal, hot, and dry planet; 
of the fiery triplicity; the author of strife, and the lesser infortune. The 
native is short, but strongly made, having large bones, ruddy complexion, 
red or sandy hair and eyebrows, quick, sharp eyes, round, bold face, and 
fearless aspect.  If well dignified, courageous and invincible, 
unsusceptible of fear, careless of life, reso-lute and 
unsubmissive.  If ill dignified, a trumpeter of his own fame, without 
decency or honesty; fond of quarrels, prone to fightings, and given up to 
every species of fraud, violence and oppression. Nero was an example of this 
planet's influence, and the gallows is said to terminate most generally the 
career of those born in low life under its government. This planet rules the 
head, face, gall, left ear, and the smell. Disease: plague, fevers, and all 
complaints arising from excessive heat; all wounds by iron or steel,

His friends are all the planets, save the Moon and Jupiter. His colour is 
red, and his angel is Samael.
     We now come to the Sun, a masculine, hot, and dry planet. of favourable 
effects. The native is very like one born under Jupiter, but the hair is 
lighter, the complexion redder; the body fatter, and the eyes larger. When 
well dignified, the solar man is affable, courteous, splendid and sumptuous, 
proud, liberal, humane, and ambitious. When ill dignified, the native is 
arrogant, mean, loquacious, and sycophantic; much resembling the native 
under Jupiter, ill dignified, but still worse. Disease": all those of the 
heart, mouth and throat; epilepsy, scrofula, tym-panitis, and brain-fevers. 
Herbs and plants: laurel, vervain, St. John's wort, orange, hyacinth, and 
some hundreds beside; gems: carbuncle, the diamond, the aetites; minerals: 
gold ; animals: the lion, the boar, the horse; birds: the lark, the swan, 
the nightingale, and all singing birds; fish: the star-fish and all shell-

colour yellow; weather, that which is most seasonable; professions: king's, 
lords and all dignified persons, braziers, goldsmiths, and persons employed 
in mints; places: kings' courts, palaces, theatres, halls, and places of 
state. His friends are all the planets, save Saturn; and his angel is 
Michael. 
     The influence of the asteroids, Juno, Pallas, Ceres, and Vesta, have 
never been calculated, and they are said by modern astrologers to act 
beneficially, but feebly.
     The Moon is a far more important planet; feminine, nocturnal, cold, 
moist, and phlegmatic. Her influence in itself is neither fortunate nor 
unfortunate. She is benevolent or otherwise, according to the aspects of 
other planets towards her; and under these circumstances she becomes more 
powerful than any of them. The native is short and stout, with fair, pale 
complexion, round face, grey eyes, short arms, thick hands and feet, very 
hairy, but with light hair; phlegmatic. If the Moon be affected by the Sun 
at the time of birth, the native will have a blemish of or near the eye. 
When the Moon is well dignified the native is of soft, engaging manners, 
imagina-tive, and a lover of the arts, but wandering, careless, timorous, 
and unstable, loving peace, and averse from activity. When ill dignified, 
then the native will be of an ill shape, indolent, worthless and disorderly. 
Diseases: palsy, epilepsy, scrofula and lunacy, together with all diseases 
of the eyes; herbs : lily, poppies, mushrooms, willow, and about two hundred 
others; minerals and gems; pearls, selenite, silver and soft stones; colour, 
white; animals: the dog, the cat, the otter, the mouse, and all amphibious 
creatures; birds: the goose, duck, bat and waterfowl in general; fish: the 
eel, the crab, and the lobster; weather: she increases the effect of other 
planets; countries:  Denmark, Holland, Flanders, and North America; cities: 
Amsterdam, Venice, Bergen-op-Zoon, and Lubeck; places: fountains, baths, the 
sea, and in watery places; professions: queens and dignified women midwives, 
nurses, all who have to do with water, sailors. Her angel is Gabriel.
     Venus is a feminine planet, temperately cold and moist, the author of 
mirth and sport. The native is handsome. well-formed, but not tall; clear 
complexion, bright hazel or black eyes, dark brown or chestnut hair, thick, 
soft, and shining; the voice soft and sweet, and the aspect very 
prepossessing. If well dignified, the native will be cheerful, friendly, 
musical, and fond of elegant accomplishments, prone to love, but frequently 
jealous. If ill dignified, the native is less handsome in person and in 
mind, altogether vicious, given up to every licentiousness; dishonest and 
atheistical.  Herbs and plants :  the fig-tree, myrrh, myrtle, pomegranate, 
and about two hundred and twenty more; animals: the goat, panther, hart, 
etc.; birds: the sparrow, the dove, the thrush, and the wren; gems: the 
emerald, chrysolite, beryl, chrysoprasus; countries:
Spain, India and Persia; cities: Florence, Paris and Vienna; mineral: 
copper; colour: green; occupations: all such as minister to pomp and 
pleasure; weather: warm, and accompanied with showers. Her angel is Hanael.
     Mercury is the last of the planets which we nave to consider. He is 
masculine, melancholy, cold, and dry. The native is tall, straight, and 
thin, with a narrow face and high forehead, long straight nose, eyes black 
or grey, thin lips and chin, scanty beard, with brown hair; the arms, hands 
and fingers, long and slender; this last is said to be a peculiar mark of a 
nativity under Mercury. If the planet be oriental at the time of birth, the 
native will be very likely to be of a stronger constitution, and with sandy 
hair. If occidental, sallow, lank, slender, and of a dry habit. When well 
dignified. he will be of an acute and penetrating mind, of a powerful 
imagination, and a retentive memory; eloquent, fond of learning, and 
successful in scientific investigation.  If engaged in mercantile pursuits, 
enterprising and skilful. If ill dignified, then the native is a mean, 
unprincipled character, pretending to knowledge, but an imposter. and a 
slanderer, boastful. malicious, and addicted to theft.  Diseases: all that 
affect the brain. head, and intellectual faculties; herbs and plants:  the 
walnut, the valerian, the trefoil, and about one hundred more; animals: the 
dog, the ape, the weasel, and the fox; weather: rain, lime-stones, thunder 
and lightning, parti-cularly in the north; occupations: all literate and 
learned professions; when ill dignified, all pretenders, quacks, and 
mountebanks. Places: schools, colleges, markets, warehouses, exchanges, all 
places of commerce and learning; metal, quicksilver; gems: cornelian, 
sardonyx, opal, onyx, and chalcedony; his colour is purple. His friends are 
Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn; his enemies Mars, the Sun, and the Moon. His 
angel is Raphael.
     The Aspects of the Planets are five thus distinguished:
1. Conjunction, when two planets are in the same degree and minute of a 
sign, which may be of good or evil import, according to the nature of the 
planets, and their relation to each other as friendly or the contrary.
2. Sectile, when two planets are 60" distant from each other, it is called 
the aspect of imperfect love or friendship, and is generally a favourable 
omen. 3. Quartile, when two planets are 900-distant from each other, making 
the aspect of imperfect hatred, and inclining to enmity and misfortune. 4. 
Trine, when the distance is 120o, promis-ing the most perfect unanimity and 
peace. 5. Opposition, when two planets are 180o" apart, or exactly opposite 
each other, which is considered an aspect of perfect hatred, and implies 
every kind of misfortune.
     The Planets are said to be in their joys when situated in the houses 
where they are most strong and powerful, thus:
Saturn in Aquarius, Jupiter in Sagittarius, Mars in Scorpio. the Sun in Leo, 
Venus in Taurus, Mercury in Virgo, and the Moon in Cancer. Cogent reasons 
are given why the planets should joy in these houses rather than others.
     The Dragon's Head and Dragon's Tail are the points. called nodes, in 
which the ecliptic is intersected by the orbits of the planets, particularly 
by that of the moon. These points are, of course, shifting. The Dragon's 
Head is the point where the moon or other planet commences its northward 
latitude; it is considered masculine and bene-volent in its influence. The 
Dragon's Tail is the point where the planets' southward progress begins; it 
is femi-nine and malevolent.
     The Part of Fortune is the distance of the moon's place from the sun, 
added to the degrees of the ascendent.
     The Twelve Planetary Houses are determined by drawing certain great 
circles through the intersection of the horizon and meridian, by which the 
whole globe or sphere is ap-portioned into twelve equal parts. In practice 
these lines are projected by a very simple method on a plane. The space in 
the centre of the figure thus described may be supposed to represent the 
situation of the earth, and is generally used to write down the exact time 
when the figure was erected. and for whose nativity, or for what question. 
Each division or house rules certain events in this order, reckoned from the 
east  1, life or person; 2, riches; 3, brethren or kindred; 4, parents; 5, 
children; 6, servants and sickness; 7, marriage; 8, death; 9, religion;  10, 
magistracy;  11, friends;  12, enemies. These categories are made to 
comprehend all that can possibly befall any individual, and the 
prognostication is drawn from the configuration of the planets in one or 
more of these " houses."
The Horoscope denotes the configuration of the planets in the twelve houses 
ascertained for the moment of nativity, or the hour of the question. The 
Ascendent (a term sometimes used instead of horoscope) is the planet rising 
in the east or first house, which marks the general character of the child 
then born. Hyleg is another term for the lord of life; Anareta for the 
destroyer of life, which are considered the chief places in a horoscope.
     The Characters used in astrology, to denote the twelve signs, the 
planets, etc., are as follows:



     These characters represent natural object", but they have also a 
hieroglyphic or esoteric meaning that ha" been lost. The figure of Aries 
represents the head and horns of a ram; that of Taurus, the head and horns 
of a bull that of Leo, the head and mane of a lion; that of Gemini, two 
persons standing together, and so of the rest. The physical or astronomical 
reasons for the adoption of these figures have been explained with great 
learning by the Abbe Pluche, in his Histoire du Ciel. and Dupuis, in his 
Abrege de l'Origine de tous les Cultes, has endeavoured to establish the 
principles of an astro-mythology, by tracing the progress of the moon 
through the twelve sign's. in a series of adventures, which he compares with 
the wander-ings of Isis. This kind of reasoning is suggestive, cer-tainly, 
but it only establishes analogies. and proves nothing.
     Nativities.-The cases in which astrological predictions were chiefly 
sought, were in Nativities ; that is in ascer-taining the fate and fortunes 
of any individual from the positions of the stars at the time of his birth; 
and in questions called horary, which comprehended almost every matter which 
might be the subject of astrological inquiry. The event of sickness, the 
success of any undertaking, the reception of any suit, were all objects of 
horary questions. A person was said to be born under that planet which ruled 
the hour of his birth. Thus two hours every day are under the control of 
Saturn. The first hour after sunrise 'in Saturday is one of them. A person 
therefore born on Saturday in the first hour after sunrise, has Saturn for 
the lord of his ascendant; those born in the next hour, Jupiter; and so on 
in order. Venus rules the first hour on Friday; Mercury on Wednesday Jupiter 
on Thursday, the sun and moon on Sunday and Monday, and Mars on Tuesday. The 
next thing is to make a figure divided into twelve portions, which are 
called houses. as directed above. The twelve houses are equal to the twelve 
signs, and the planets, being always in the zodiac, will therefore all fall 
within these twelve divisions or houses. The line, which separates any house 
from the preceding, is called the cusp of the house. The first house is 
called the ascendant, and the east angle; the fourth the imum coeli, or the 
north angle; the seventh, the west angle; and the tenth, the medium coeli, 
or the south angle. Having drawn this figure, tables and directions are 
given for the placing of the signs, and as one house is equal to one sign 
when one is given, the rest are given also. When the signs and planets are 
all placed in the houses, the next thing is to augur, from their relative 
position, what influence they will have on the life and fortunes of the 
native.
     The House of Life implies all that affects, promotes, or endangers 
life.  Saturn or Mars in this house denotes a short or unfortunate life, 
while Jupiter and Venus have, when free from evil aspects, an exactly 
contrary effect. The sign ascending will considerably modify the person and 
character of the native, so that to form an astrological judgment of this it 
will be necessary to combine the indi-cations of the sign and the planet.  
In what are called horary questions, this house relates to all questions of 
life, health, and appearance, such as stature, complexion, shape, accidents 
and sickness.  It shows the events of journeys and voyages, with respect to 
the life and health of those engaged in them.  When the question is of a 
political nature it signifies the people in general, and being of the same 
nature as Aries, all that is said of that sign may be transferred to this 
house.  
     The second house, which is of the same nature as the sign Taurus, is 
called the house of riches.  It signifies the advancement in the world with 
respect to opulence of the querent; and here the operations of the planets 
are, as in other cases, accord-ing to their own nature, Jupiter, Venus, 
Mercury, and the Sun being fortunate, if well aspected, only denoting 
different cause" of wealth; Saturn, Mars, the Moon, and Uranus, unfortunate. 
In horary questions, it signifies the money of the querent, or the success 
in a pecuniary point of view of any expedition of undertaking. It concerns 
loans, law-suits, and everything by which riches may be gained or lost.  In 
political questions it signifies the treasury, public loans, taxes, and 
subsidies; the younger branches of the blood-royal, and the death of 
national enemies.       
     The third house is the house of kindred, particularly of brothers, and 
was probably so designated on account of the third sign Gemini, of which 
nature it is said to be.  It denotes kindred, and the planets in this house 
are full of signifi-cation.  Saturn signifies coldness and distrust;  Mars, 
sudden, violent and hasty quarrels; Herschel, all un-accountable  
estrangements;  Jupiter  denotes  steady friendships, Venus great love 
between brothers and sisters, and good fortune by means of the latter; the 
Sun, warm attachment: the Moon, indifference.  In horary questions. this 
house signifies the health, fortune and happiness of the querent's parents, 
his own patrimony and inheritance, and the ultimate consequences, either 
good or bad, of any undertaking in which he may be engaged.  In political 
cases it denotes the landed interest of a nation  the ancient and chartered 
rights of all classes, which have been handed down to them from their 
ancestors; and all public advo-cates and defenders of these interests and 
rights.
     The fifth house, which has the same government, and partakes of the 
same character as Leo, is called the House of Children.  In nativities, 
therefore, it denotes the children of the native, and their success and also 
his own success by means of them.  It also has some reference to women. The 
health and welfare of children, whether present or absent, are determinable 
by the planets in this house. It also denotes all questions relative to 
amusement, simply, as it would seem, on account of the fondness of youth for 
such pursuits.  In political questions consequently, we find this house 
taken to signify the rising generation, theatres, exhibitions, public 
festivals, and all national amusements; all increase in the population; 
music and musical taste, sculpture, painting, and the advancement of the 
fine arts in general.  
     The sixth house is that of servants, but it also denotes sickness and 
private enemies. It is usually considered an evil house and but few con-
figurations of the planets which can take place in it are fortunate.  It is 
of the nature, and shares the government of Virgo.  When the lord of the 
ascendant is placed in this house, it denotes a low station, and if in 
addition to this he be ill dignified. the native will not rise above menial 
employments.  In horary astrology it points out servants and cattle, 
dependents, and small shopkeepers; uncles and aunts by the fathers side ; 
tenants, stewards, shepherds and farmers.  If, however, the question be 
political, then this house indicates the under-servants of the government; 
the common seamen in the navy, private soldiers in the army, and the general 
health of the nation. This last refers chiefly to contagious and epidemic 
disorders.
     The seventh house, which is of the same nature as Libra, and has the 
same government. is the House of Marriage. If Saturn be found here, he 
denotes unhappiness from constitutional causes; Mars from difference of 
temper; Herschel, as usual. from some strange and unaccountable dislike. The 
other planets are mostly causers of good, unless exception be made in the 
case of the Moon.  In horary questions, this house denotes love, 
speculations in business, partners in trade, lawsuits, and litigation; it is 
the House of Thieves, and sets forth their conduct and character.  In 
queries of a political nature, it signifies the event of any war, and the 
consequences of a treaty; it personates the victorious nation, army, or 
navy, and in-dicates outlaws and fugitives, with the places in which they 
have taken their retreat.
     The eighth house is the House of Death.  It denotes wills, legacies, 
and all property depending upon the death of others; the power, means, and 
influence of adversaries; the opposing parties in lawsuits.  It is of the 
nature of Scorpio, and has the same government.  If Mars be un-fortunately 
placed in this house, it portends a violent death to the native.  Saturn is 
often productive of suicide, and Herschel of the mysterious disappearance of 
the un-happy individual, whose horoscope is so marked.  Jupiter, on the 
contrary, and Venus, point out a late and quiet departure.  In horary 
questions its significance has been already noticed, but it also denotes the 
portion or dowry of women, and seconds in duels. In political questions it 
has a signification of a very different character, viz., the privy council 
of a king or queen, their friends, and secrets of state.  It does, however, 
bear some mark of its appro-priation to death, by being made to denote the 
rate of mortality among the people.  
     The ninth house is that of religion, science, and learning.  It has the 
same govern-ment and nature as Sagittarius.  Jupiter is the most fortunate 
planet in it, and if joined with Mercury, then the native is promised a 
character at once learned, estimable, and truly religious. The Sun and Venus 
are likewise good significators here, but the Moon denotes a changeable 
mind, and frequent alterations in religious principles. Mars is the worst 
planet in this house, and portends an indifference, or even an active 
hostility to religion.  In horary questions the ninth house is appropriated 
to the church and the clergy ; all ecclesiastical matters, dissent, heresy, 
schism, dreams, visions, and religious delusions.  It also denotes voyages 
and travels to distant lands, and in questions of a political nature, the 
religion of the nation, and all the higher and more solemn courts of 
justice, such as Chancery, etc.
     The tenth house is one of the most important of all. It is the House of 
Honour, Rank, and Dignity; of the nature and rule of Capricorn.  In this 
house the planets are more powerful than in any other, save only the House 
of Life. They point out the employment, success, pre-ferment, and authority 
of the native.  Saturn is here the worst planet, but the Moon and Herschel 
are also mis-chievous, the latter by preventing tile native from attaining 
that rank to which his services, learning, or merit entitle him, and doing 
this by a series of inexplicable disappoint-ments.  Jupiter and the Sun 
signify advancement by the favour of distinguished men, and Venus, of 
distinguished women. In horary questions, the tenth house signifies the 
mother of the querist; and politically the sovereign. This is a house in 
which Mars is not unfortunate, if well placed denoting war-like achievements 
and consequent honours.
     The eleventh house is the House of Friends: it is of the nature of 
Aquarius, and has the same rule. It denotes, of course, friends, well-
wishers, favourites, and flatterers, but is said to be a house in which evil 
planets are increased in strength, and good planets diminished. The Sun is 
the best planet in it, and Mars the worst. In horary question" it has the 
same signification as in a nativity, and also denotes the expectations and 
wishes of the querist. It is said to be much influenced by the sign which is 
in it, and to signify legacies, if the sign be one of the earthy triplicity, 
and honour with princes, if it be one of the fiery triplicity. In political 
questions, the eleventh house signifies the allies of the public, with whom 
no particular treaty is at the same time binding; and also the general 
council of the nation, and newly acquired rights.
     Lastly, the twelfth house, which, of course, partakes the rule and 
character of Pisces, is the House of Enemies, and denotes sorrow, sickness, 
care, anxiety, and all kinds. of suffering. Yet evil planets are weaker, 
according to some writers, and good planets stronger than in certain other 
houses. Very few configurations in this house are esteemed for the native, 
but its evil effects are, of course, greatly modified by the planetary 
influences.  In horary questions it signifies imprisonment, treason, 
sedition, assassination, and suicide; and in questions which are of a 
political character, it points out deceitful treaties, un-successful 
negotiations, treachery in the offices of state, captivity to princes, and 
general ill fortune. The criminal code, and the punishment of culprits, 
dungeons, and cir-cumstances connected with prison discipline are also 
denoted by this house. Saturn is the worst, and Venus the best planet to be 
present in it.
     Having taken notice of the signs, the planets, and the houses, it is 
next necessary for the astrologer to note also the aspects of the planets 
one towards another, which aspects decide whether the planet is of good or 
evil signifi-cation. These aspects are as follows - omitting the less 
important:




These three last aspects are evil, and evil in the order in which they are 
here placed.
     Horary questions are subjects of astrological calculations. They are so 
called, because the scheme of the heavens is
erected for the hour in which the question is put. Thus, let a person be 
sick, and the question be of his recovery, the Houses will now signify as 
follows, says Blagrave
“
1.	The patient's person
2.	His estate
3.	His kindred
4.	His father or his grave
5.	His children
6.	His sickness and servants
7.	His wife and his physician
8.	His death
9.	His religion
10.       His mother and his physic
11.	His friends
12.	His enemies."
And according to the position of the planets the above particulars are to be 
judged of. If the question be of stolen goods, a distribution of the houses 
is again made according to similar rules. And here the colour denoted by the 
signs is pertinent; for let Mercury signify the thief, then the sign in 
which that planet is found will denote the personal appearance and 
complexion of the thief. If the question be one concerning marriage, then it 
points out that of the future bride or bridegroom; and so on.

Athanor  This occult hill is surrounded by mist excepting the southern side, 
which is clear. It has a well, which is four paces in breadth, from which an 
azure vapour ascends, which is drawn up by the warm sun. The bottom of the 
well is covered with red arsenic. Near it is a basin filled with fire from 
which rises a livid flame odourless and smoke-less, and never higher or 
lower than the edge of the basin. Also there are two black stone reservoirs, 
in one of which the wind is kept, and in the other the rain. In extreme 
drought the rain-cistern is opened and clouds escape, which water the whole 
country. The term is also employed to denote moral and philosophical 
alchemy.

Atlantis : a supposed sunken continent. which. according to some accounts, 
occupied most of the area of the present Atlantic Ocean. It is dealt with 
here because of late years several accounts purporting to come from certain 
spirit "controls" have been published which give a more or less detailed 
description of the history, life and manners of its inhabitants, and it is 
of interest to Theosophists. The ques-tion regarding the existence of such a 
continent is a very vexed one indeed. It appears to have originated at an 
early date, for Plato in his Timaeus states that the Atlantians overran 
Europe and were only repulsed by the Greeks. It is stated that the Hindu 
priesthood believed; and still be-lieve that it once existed; and there are 
shadowy legends among the American native races which would seem to assist 
these beliefs. At the same time definite proof is conspicuous by its 
absence. Brasseur de Bourbourg held that Atlantis was an extension of 
America which stretched from Central America and Mexico, far into the 
Atlantic, the Canaries, Madeiras and Azores being the only remnants which 
were not submerged; and many similar fantastic theories have been advanced. 
Donnelly undertook to
prove the existence of such a continent by modern scien-tific methods, and 
located the Atlantis of Plato as an island opposite the entrance to the 
Mediterranean-a remnant of the lost continent. He thought that Atlantis was 
the region where men first arose from barbarism to civilisation. and that 
all the civilised peoples of Europe and America derived their culture 
thence: that it was indeed the antediluvian world of the Garden of Eden; 
that the Atlantians founded a colony in Egypt; and that the Phoenician 
alphabet was the Atlantian alphabet : that not only the Aryan but the 
Semitic people, and perhaps the " Turanian" races, emerged therefrom: that 
it perished in a terrible revolution of nature in which the whole island 
sank into the ocean with nearly all its inhabitants; and that only a few 
persons escaped to tell the story of the catastrophe, which has survived to 
our time in the flood and deluge legend.' of the Old and New worlds.  Even 
some serious scientist's have not disdained to examine the question, and it 
is claimed that ocean de-posits show remains of what must have been at one 
time a land above the ocean. The theory that the Atlantians founded the 
civilisations of Central America and Mexico has been fully proven to be 
absurd, as that civilisation is distinctly of an aboriginal nature, and of 
comparatively late origin. (See Spence, Myths of Mexico and Peru.) The late 
Dr. Augustus le Plongeon and his wife spent many years in trying to prove 
that a certain Queen Moo of Yu-catan, founded a colony in Egypt; but as they 
professed to be able to read hieroglyphs that no one else could de-cipher, 
and many of which were not hieroglyphs at all but ornamental designs, and as 
they placed side by side and compared with the Egyptian alphabet a "Mayan 
"alpha-bet, which certainly never originated anywhere but in their own 
ingenuity, we cannot have much faith in their con-clusions. We do not learn 
from Dr. le Plongeons's works by what course of reasoning he came to 
discover that the name of his heroine was the rather uneuphonious one of 
Moo, but probably he arrived at it by the same process as that by which he 
discovered the "Mayan" alphabet. He further assumes that his story is taken 
up where he ends it by the Manuscript Troano, which is, however, chiefly 
calendric and not historical. Some years ago a French scientist left a large 
sum of money for research in con-nection with the sunken continent of 
Atlantis, and this has been fully taken advantage of by a certain author, 
who is pursuing his investigations in a practical manner.
     The claims of certain spiritualists and occultists to restore the 
history of Atlantis are about as successful as those of the pseudo-
scientists who have approached the question. They claim to have 
reconstructed almost the entire history, of the island-continent by means of 
messages from spirit controls, which acquaint us minutely with the polity, 
life, religion and magical system of the Atlantians; but in the face of 
scientific knowledge and probability these accounts fail to convince, and 
are obviously of the nature of im-aginative fiction. There is also a certain 
body of occult tradition concerning Atlantis which may either have 
originated from oriental sources, or else have come into being in the 
imagination's of later occultists; and this is to some extent crystallised 
in the works in question.  It would be rash to say that such a continent as 
Atlantis never existed; but it would be equally foolish to say so 
dogmatically without a backing of much greater proof than we at present 
possess on the subject.

Atmadhyana : In the Rajah Yoga philosophy of S'rimat Sankaracharya, 
Atmadhyana is one of the stages necessary to acquire the knowledge of the 
unity of the soul with Brahman. It is the fourteenth stage and is the 
condition of highest joy arising from the belief, "I am Brahman."

Atman : translated "Soul," but better rendered "Self," and meaning in the 
Hindu religion the union of the soul with God. It is believed that the soul 
is neither body nor mind, nor even thought, but that these are merely 
conditions by which the soul is clouded so that it loses its sense of 
oneness with God. In the Upanishads it is said  "The Self, smaller than 
small, greater than great, is hidden in the heart of the creature,"' and " 
In the beginning there was Self."

Attic Mysteries : (See Mysteries.)

Attwood, Mrs. : The author of a work entitled, A Sug-gestive Inquiry with 
the Hermetic Mystery, published anony-mously at London, in 1850. Owing to 
the circumstance that it was supposed to have revealed certain alchemical 
secrets, it was shortly afterwards withdrawn from circulation.

Atzliuth : One of the three worlds of the Kabala; the supreme circle; the 
perfect revelation. According to Eliphas Levi, it is represented in the 
Apocalypse by the head of the mighty angel with the face of a sun.

August Order of Light : An Oriental order introduced into this country in 
1882 by Mr. Maurice Vidal Portman, It’s object is the development of 
practical occultism, and it is continued at Bradford, Yorkshire, as “The 
Oriental Order of Light." It has a ritual of three degrees, Novice Aspirans, 
Viator. It adopted Kabalistic forms, and is governed by a Grand Master of 
the Sacred Crown or Kether of the Kabala.

August Spirits, the Shelf of the : In the country of Japan, every house has 
a room set apart, called the spirit chamber, in which there is a shelf or 
shrine, with tablets bearing the names of the deceased members of the 
family, with the sole addition of the word Mitama (spirit). This is a 
species of ancestor worship, and is known as "home" worship.

Ankh : The Egyptian symbol of life, perhaps the life which remains to one 
after death. It is conjectured that it symbolises the union of the male and 
female principles, the origins of life, and that like the American cross, it 
typifies the four winds, the rain-bringers and fertilizers. It has been 
found manufactured in every description of material, and is sometimes 
encountered in combination with the dad or tat symbol (q.v.)  It is usually 
carried in the right hand by divinitics.

Aura : An emanation said to surround human beings, chiefly encircling the 
head, and supposed to proceed from the nervous system.  It is described as a 
cloud of light suf-fused with various colours. This is seen clairvoyantly, 
being imperceptible to the physical sight. 
     Some authorities trace the existence of the aura in such scriptural 
instances as the bright light shining about Moses, which the children of 
Israel were unable to look upon, when he descended from the mountain bearing 
the stone tablets engraved with the Ten Commandments; in the exceed-ingly 
brilliant light which shone round about St. Paul's vision at the time of his 
conversion; and in the trans-figuration of Jesus Christ, when his raiment 
shone so brightly that no fuller on earth could whiten it. Many of the 
medieval saints were said to be surrounded with a cloud of light. Of St. 
John of the Cross it is told that when at the altar or kneeling in prayer, a 
certain brightness darted from his face.  St Philip Neri was constantly seen 
enveloped in light; St. Charles Borromeo was similarly illuminated. This is 
said to be due to the fact that when a person is engaged in lofty thought 
and spiritual aspiration, the auric colours become for the time being, more 
luminous and translucent, therefore more easily discernible. In Christian 
art, round the heads of saints and the sacred characters, is to be found 
portrayed the halo or nimbus which is supposed to represent the aura; 
sometimes the luminous cloud is shown around the whole of the body as well 
as the head, when it is called aureola.  It is also thought that the colours 
of the body and clothing in medieval paintings and stained glass are 
intended to represent the auric colours of the person portrayed. The crowns 
and distinctive head-dresses worn by the kings and priests of antiquity, are 
said to be symbolic of the aura. In many of the sacred books of the East, 
representations of the great teachers and holy men are given with the light 
extending round the whole of the body.  Instances of this may be found in 
the temple caves of India and Ceylon, in the Japanese Buddhistic book', also 
in Egypt, Greece, Mexico and Peru.  In occult literature the tradition of 
the aura is an old one, Paracelsus, in the 16th century, making mention of 
it in the following terms  "The vital force is not enclosed in man, hut 
radiates round him like a luminous sphere, and it may be made to act at a 
distance. In these semi-natural rays the imagination of man may produce 
healthy or morbid effects.  It may poison the essence of life and cause 
diseases, or it may purify it after it has been made impure, and restore the 
health." Again: Our thoughts are simply magnetic emanations, which, in 
escaping from our brains, penetrate into kindred heads and carry thither, 
with a reflection of our life, the mirage of our secrets." A modern 
theosophical description is as follows: "The aura is a highly complicated 
and entangled manifestation, consisting of many influences operating within 
the same area.  Some of the elements composing the aura are projected from 
the body, others from the astral principles, and others again from the more 
spiritual principles connected with the" Higher Self," or permanent Ego; and 
the various auras are not lying one around the other, but are all blended 
together and occupy the same place. Guided by occult training. the 
clairvoyant faculty may make a complete analysis of the various elements in 
the aura and can estimate the delicate tints of which it is composed-though 
all blended together-as if each were seen separately."
     Classified more exactly. the divisions of the aura are stated to be: I, 
the health aura; 2, the vital aura; 3, the " Karmic" aura, that of the 
animal soul in man; 4, the aura of character; 5, the aura of the spiritual 
nature.   
     The " health aura " is thus described : " It is almost colourless, but 
becomes perceptible by reason of possessing a curious system of radial 
striation, that is to say, it is composed of an enormous number of straight 
lines, radia-ting evenly in all directions from the body."  The second, or 
"vital" aura, is said to he to a certain extent under the control of the 
will, when it circulates within the " linga charira" or astral body, of a " 
delicate rosy tint, which it loses, becoming bluish as it radiates outward,"  
The third aura is "the field of manifestation, or the mirror in which every 
feeling, every desire is reflected."  Of this aura the colours constantly 
change, as seen by the clairvoyant vision.  "An outburst of anger will 
charge the whole aura with deep red flashes on a dark ground, while sudden 
terror will, in a moment, change everything to a ghastly grey.  The fourth 
aura is that of the permanent character, and is said to contain the record 
of the past earth life of the personality. The fifth aura is not often seen 
even by clairvoyants, but it is described by those who have seen it, only in 
the cases where the spiritual nature is the most powerful factor, as " 
outshining all the rest of the auras with startling brilliancy." The auric 
colour, it is declared, cannot be adequately described in terms of the 
ordinary colours discernible to the physical vision, being very much 
brighter, and of more varied hues and shades. The sym-bolic meaning of these 
is roughly of the following order:
Rose, pure affection; brilliant red, anger and force; dirty red, passion and 
sensuality; yellow, of the purest lemon colour, the highest type of 
intellectual activity; orange, intellect used for selfish ends, pride and 
ambition; brown, avarice.  Green is a colour of varied significance; its 
root meaning is the placing of one's self in the position of another.  In 
its lower aspects it represents deceit and jealousy; higher up in the 
emotional gamut, it signifies adaptability, and at its very highest, when it 
tells on the colour of foliage, sympathy, the very essence of thinking for 
other people.  In some shades green stands for the lower intellectual and 
critical faculties, merging into yellow. Blue indicates religious feeling 
and devotion, its various shades being said to correspond to different 
degrees of devotion, rising from fetishism to the loftiest religious 
idealism,  Purple represents psychic faculty, spirituality, regality. 
spiritual power arising from knowledge, and occult pre-eminence.

Australia :   Native Magic.-From birth to death, the native Australian or 
black-fellow is surrounded by magical influences, In many tribes the power 
to perform magic, "sympathetic" or otherwise, is possessed by only a few 
people; but among the central tribes it is practised by both men and women-
more often, however, by the former, who conserve the knowledge of certain 
forms of their own. There is also among them a distinct class of medicine-
men, whose duty it is to discover whose magic has caused the death of 
anyone. Among the central tribes, unlike many others, magic is not made a 
means of profit or emolument. A heavy taboo rests on a great many things 
that the boy or young man would like to do, and this is for the behoof of 
the older men of the tribe, who attach to themselves the choicest morsels of 
food and so forth. Among girls and women the same law applies; and the 
latter are sternly forbidden to go near the places where the men perform 
their magical ceremonies, To terrify them away from such spots, the natives 
have invented an instrument called a "bull-roarer "-a thin slip of wood 
swung round at the end of a string, which makes a screaming, whistling 
noise, which the women believe is the voice of the Great Spirit. The natives 
preserve long oval pieces of wood, which they call churingas. In these are 
supposed to remain the spirits of their ancestors, so that in reality they 
are of a fetish nature, These are kept concealed in the most secret manner.
     Sympathetic Magic is of course rife amongst such a primitive people. 
Certain ceremonies are employed to control nature so as to ensure a 
plentiful supply of food and water, or to injure an enemy. One of the 
commonest forms of these is the use of the pointed stick or bone, which is 
used in one form or another by all Australian tribes. The former is a small 
piece of wood, varying in length from three to eighteen inches, resembling a 
skewer, and tapering to a point. At the handle end it is topped with a knob 
of resin, to which is attached a strand of human hair. Magical songs are 
sung over it, to endow it with occult potency, The man who wishes to use it 
goes into the bush singly, or with a friend, where he will be free from 
observation, and planting the stick in the ground, mutters over it what he 
desires to happen to his enemy. It is then left in the ground for a few 
days. The evil magic is supposed to pro-ceed from the stick to the man, who 
often succumbs, unless a medicine-man, chances to discover the implement.
     The Australian savage has a special dread of magic con-nected with 
places at a distance, and any magical apparatus purchased or obtained from 
far-away tribes is supposed to possess potency of much greater kind than if 
it had been made among themselves. Thus certain little stones traded by 
Northern tribes are supposed to contain a very powerful form of evil magic 
called mauia. These are wrapped up in many folds of bark and string, 
According to their traditions this type of magic was first introduced by a 
Bat-man, who dropped it to earth where it made a great explosion at a 
certain spot, whence it can still be procured. Sticks procured from a 
distance, with which the natives chastise their wives, are sufficient by 
their very sight to make the women obey their husbands. Much mystery 
surrounds what are known as "debil-debil "'shoes, which consist of a pad of 
emu feathers, rounded at both ends, in order that no one should be able to 
trace in which direction the wearer is journeying. These are supposed to be 
worn by a being called kurdaitcha, to whom deaths are attributed. Like other 
savages, the Australian native believes that death is always due to evil 
magic. A man may become a kurdaitcha by submitting to a certain ceremony, in 
which the little toe of his foot is dislocated. Dressed up and painted 
grotesquely, he sets out accompanied by a medicine-man and wearing the 
kurdaitcha shoes, when he desires to slay an enemy. When he spears him, the 
medicine-man closes up the wound, and the victim returns to consciousness 
oblivious of the fact that he is full of evil magic; but in a while he 
sickens and dies; and then it is known that he has been attacked by a 
kurdaitcha. Many long and elab-orate ceremonies are connected with the 
churinga, and these have been well described by Messrs. Spencer and Gillen, 
Howitt, Fison, and others.
     Spiritualism in Australia has both a public and private representation. 
The latter is far more general than the former in every country ,except 
America, but although demonstrations of spirit power are more commonly known 
in Australia amongst individuals and families, than on the rostrum, or 
through the columns of the journals, they are less available for the 
purposes of historical record. It seems that many Australian colonists had 
heard of the Spiritualist movement before settling in the country, and on 
their arrival, pursuing the customary methods of unfold-ment through the 
spirit circle, a deep interest was awakened long before public attention was 
called to the subject. In Sydney, Melbourne, Ballarat, Geelong, Bris-bane, 
and numerous other towns and mining districts, communion with spirits was 
successfully practised in cir-cles and families, up to about 1867. After 
that epoch it seems to have become the subject of various journalistic 
reports of the usual adverse, eulogistic, or non-committal character. At or 
about that period, a large number of influential persons became interested 
in the matter, and not a few whose names were a sufficient guarantee of 
their good faith, began to detail wonderful experiences in the columns of 
the public journals. The debate and denial, rejoinder and defence, called 
forth by these narratives, served as propaganda of the movement, and 
rendered each freshly recorded manifestation, the centre of an ever--
widening circle of interest.
     In Victoria a gentleman of considerable wealth and learning, writing 
under the nom de plume of " Schamlyn," entered into a warm controversy with 
the editor of the Collingwood Advertiser, in defence of Spiritualism. An-
other influential supporter of the Spiritual cause who was an early convert, 
and for a time became a pillar of strength in its maintenance, was a 
gentleman connected with the editorial department of the Melbourne Argus, 
one of the leading journals of Victoria, and an organ well calculated to 
exert a powerful sway over the minds of its readers. 
     As the tides of public opinion moved on, doctors, lawyers, merchants, 
and men of eminence began to joins the ranks. Tidings of phenomena of the 
most astounding character poured in from distant towns and districts. 
Members of the press began to share the general infection, and though some 
would not, and others could not avow their convictions, their private 
prepossessions induced them to open their columns for debate and 
correspondence on the subject. To add to the stimulus thus imparted, many of 
the leading colonial journals indulged in tirades of abuse and misrep-
resentation, which only served to increase the contagion without in the 
least diminishing its force. At length the clergy began to arouse themselves 
and manifest their in-terest by furious abuse. Denunciation provoked retort; 
discussion compelled investigation. In Sydney, many converts of rank and 
influence suddenly appeared. The late Hon. John Bowie Wilson, Land Minister, 
and a champion of temperance, became an open convert to Spiritualism, and by 
his personal influence no less than his public de-fence of the cause made 
converts unnumbered. Amongst the many others whose names have also been 
recorded in the ranks of Spiritualism in Sydney may be mentioned Mr. Henry 
Gale, Mrs. Wilson and Mrs. Gale, Mrs. Woolley and Mrs, Greville, besides a 
number of other ladies ; Mr. Greville, M.P., and several other member's of 
the New South Wales Parliament and Cabinet; Hon. J. Windeyer, At-torney-
General of the Colony, subsequently one of the judges; Mr. Alfred De Lissa, 
an eminent barrister; Mr. Cyril Haviland, a literary man; Mr. Macdonald; 
Captain Barron; Mr.. Milner Stephen a barrister of eminence, his wife and 
family, and many others. Another who did more to advance the cause of 
Spiritualism, and crystallize its scattered fragments into concrete strength 
than any other individual in the ranks was Mr. Wm. Terry, the well-known and 
enterprising editor of the Melbourne Harbinger of Light Spiritual organ,
     “About 1869 ", says Mr. H. Tuttle, " the necessity for a Spiritualistic 
journal was impressed deeply on the mind of Mr. Terry. He could not cast it 
off, but pondered over the enterprise. At this time, an exceedingly 
sensitive patient described a spirit holding a scroll on which was written 
"Harbinger of Light" and the motto, "Dawn approaches, error is passing away; 
men arising shall hail the day." This influenced him, and in August 1870, he 
set to work to prepare the first number, which appeared on the 1st of 
September of that year.
     "There was no organisation in Australian Spiritualism, and Mr. Terry 
saw the advantage and necessity of associative movement. He consulted a few 
friends, and in November, 1870, he organised the first Victorian Association 
of Spiritualists. A hall was rented, and Sunday services, consisting of 
essays and reading by members, enlivened by appropriate hymns, were held. In 
October, 1872, impressed with the desirability of forming a Lyceum, he 
called together a few willing workers, and held the first session on October 
20th, 1872. It is, and has been from the first in a flourishing condition, 
numbering one hundred and fifty members, with a very handsome and complete 
outfit, and excellent library. He has remained an officer ever since, and 
conductor four sessions. He assisted in the establishment of the 
Spiritualist and Free-thought Association, which succeeded the original one, 
and was its first president. He has lectured occasionally to apprecia-tive 
audiences, and his lectures have been widely circulated. His mediumship, 
which gave such fair promise, both in regard to writing and speaking, became 
controlled, especially for the relief of the sick. Without the assistance of 
ad-vertising he has acquired a fine practice. With this he combines a trade 
in Reform and Spiritualistic publications, as extensive as the colony, and 
the publication of the Harbinger of Light, a Spiritual journal that is an 
honour to the cause, and well sustains the grand philosophy of im-mortality. 
No man is doing more for the cause or has done more efficient work,"
     A short but interesting summary of the rise and progress of 
Spiritualism in Australia is given in the American Banner of Light, 1880, in 
which Mr. Terry's good service is again alluded to, and placed in line with 
that of several other pioneers of the movement, of whom mention has not yet 
been made. It is as follows:
     "The Harbinger of Light, published at Melbourne, Australia, furnishes a 
review of the origin of its publication and the work it has accomplished 
during the ten years just closed. At its advent in 1870, considerable 
interest had been awakened in the subject of Spiritualism, by the lectures 
of Mr. Nayler, in Melbourne, and Mr. Leech, at Castlemaine. The leaders of 
the church became dis-turbed, and seeing their gods in danger, sought to 
stay the progress of what would eventually lessen their influence and 
possibly their income. But Mr. Nayler spoke and wrote with more vigour: the 
addresses of Mr. Leech were published from week to week in pamphlet form, 
and widely distributed. At the same time, Mr. Charles Bright, who had 
published letters on Spiritualism in the Argus, over an assumed name, openly 
identified himself with the move-ment, and spoke publicly on the subject. 
Shortly after, eleven persons met and formed an association, which soon 
increased to eighty members. A hymn-book was compiled, and Sunday services 
began. As elsewhere, the press ridiculed, arid the pulpit denounced 
Spiritualism as a delusion. A number of articles in the Argus brought some 
of the facts prominently before the public, and the growing interest was 
advanced by a public discussion between Messrs, Tyerman and Blair. In 1872, 
a Sunday school, on harmonial principles, was established, Mr. W. H. Terry, 
the proprietor of the Harbinger, being its first conductor. Almost 
simultaneously with this was the visit of Dr. J. M. Peebles, whose public 
lectures and work in the Lyceum served to consolidate the movement. A 
controversy in the Age, between Rev. Mr. Potter, Mr. Tyerman and Mr. Terry, 
brought the facts and teachings of Spiritualism into further notice.
     "Soon came Dr. Peebles, Thomas Walker, Mrs. Britten and others, who 
widened the influence of the spiritualistic philosophy, and aided the 
Harbinger in its efforts to estab-lish Spiritualism on a broad rational 
basis. Mr. W. H. Terry is deserving of all praise for his unselfish and 
faithful exertions in carrying the Harbinger through the years of as hard 
labour as ever befell any similar enterprise, and we bespeak for him, in his 
continued efforts to make known the evidences of a future existence, and the 
illuminating truths of Spiritualism, the hearty co-operation and sym-pathy 
of all friends of the cause."
     Writing to the Banner of Light on the subject of Mr. Tyerman's 
accession to the Spiritual ranks, an esteemed American correspondent says
     "The Rev. J. Tyerman, of the Church of England, resident in one of the 
country districts, boldly declared his full reception of Spiritualism as a 
great fact, and his change of religious faith consequent upon the teachings 
of spirits. Of course, he was welcomed with open arms by the whole body of 
Spiritualists in Melbourne, the only city where there was any considerable 
number enrolled in one association. He soon became the principal lecturer, 
though not the only one employed by the Association, and well bas he wielded 
the sword of the new faith. He is decidedly of the pioneer stamp, a skilful 
debater, a fluent speaker, ready at any moment to engage with any one, 
either by word of mouth or as a writer. So widely, indeed, did he make his 
influence felt, and so individual was it, that a new society grew up around 
him, called the Free-Thought and Spiritualist Propaganda Society, which 
remained in existence till Mr. Tyerman removed to Sydney, when it coalesced 
with the older association, under the combined name of Melbourne 
Spiritualist and Free-Thought Asso-ciation."
     Another valuable convert to the cause of Spiritualism, at a time when 
it most needed good service, was Mrs. Florence Williams, the daughter of the 
celebrated English novelist, G. P. R. James, and the inheritor of his 
talent, originality of thought, and high culture. This lady for a long time 
officiated at the first Spiritual meetings convened for Sabbath Day 
exercises, as an acceptable and eloquent lecturer, and her essays would have 
formed an admirable epitome of spiritual revelations at the time in which 
they were delivered.
     The visits of several zealous propagandists have been alluded to in 
previous quotations, Amongst the first to break ground as a public exponent 
of Spiritualism, was the Rev. J, M. Peebles, formerly a minister of Battle 
Creek, Michigan. Mr. Peebles was well known in America as a fine writer and 
lecturer, and as such was justified in expecting courteous, if not 
eulogistic mention from the press of a foreign country, with whom his own 
was on terms of amicable intercourse, How widely different was the 
journalistic treatment he experienced may be gathered from his own remarks 
addressed to the Banner of Light some five years after his first visit, and 
describing in graphic terms the changed spirit which marked alike the 
progress of the movement and the alteration in the tone of public opinion. 
Mr. Peebles says
     "Relative to Spiritualism and its divine principles, public sentiment 
has changed rapidly, and for the better, during the past five years. Upon my 
late public appear-ance in Melbourne, the Hon. John McIlwraith, ex-Mayor of 
the city, and Commissioner to our. Centennial Exhibition, took the chair, 
introducing me to the audience. On my previous visit some of the 
Spiritualists seemed a little timid. They preferred being called 
investigators, remain-ing a good distance from the front. Then my travelling 
companion, Dr. Dunn, was misrepresented, and meanly vilified in the city 
journal; while I was hissed in the market, caricatured in Punch, burlesqued 
in a theatre, and published in the daily press as an 'ignorant Yankee,' an 
'American trickster,' a 'long-haired apostate,' and 'a most unblushing 
blasphemer.' But how changed I Recently the secular press treated me fairly. 
Even the usually abusive Telegraph published Mr. Stevenson's article 
assuring the Rev. Mr. Green that I was willing to meet him at once in a 
public discussion. The Melbourne Argus, one of the best daily papers in the 
world, the Aus-tralasian, the Herald, and the Age, all dealt honourably by 
me, reporting my lectures, if briefly, with admirable impartiality. The 
press is a reflector; and those audiences of 2,000 and 2,500 in the great 
Opera House on each Sunday for several successive months, were not without a 
most striking moral significance. It seemed to be the general opinion that 
Spiritualism had never before occupied so prominent yet so favourable a 
position in the eyes of the public...."
     Efficient service was rendered to the cause of Spiritualism by Mr. 
Thomas Walker, a young Englishman, first intro-duced in the Colonies by the 
Rev. J. M. Peebles. Alleging himself to be a "trance speaker" under the 
control of certain spirits, whom he named, Mr. Walker lectured acceptably in 
Sydney, Melbourne, and other places in the Colonies on the Spiritual 
rostrum. In March, 1878, Mr. Walker maintained a public debate with a Mr. M. 
W. Green, a minister of a denomination termed "the Church of Christ." This 
gentleman had acquired some reputation in the Colonies as a preacher, and as 
one who had bitterly opposed, and taken every possible opportunity, to mis-
represent Spiritualism.  The debate, which was held in the Temperance Hall, 
Melbourne, attracted large audiences, and been extended for several nights 
beyond the period originally agreed upon.
    The following extracts are taken from the Melbourne Age, one of the 
leading daily journals of the city. They are dated August 20th, 1878, and 
read thus:
     “Spiritualism is just now very much to the front in Melbourne. The 
lectures of Mrs. Emma Hardinge-Britten, delivered to crowded audiences at 
the Opera House every Sunday evening, have naturally attracted a sort of 
wonder-ing curiosity to the subject, and the interest has probably been 
intensified by the strenuous efforts that are being made in some of the 
orthodox pulpits to prove that the whole thing is an emanation from the 
devil. The an-nouncement that the famous Dr. Slade had arrived to strengthen 
the ranks of the Spiritualists, has therefore been made at a very critical 
juncture, and I should not be surprised to find that the consequence will be 
to infuse a galvanic activity into the forces on both sides. Though I do not 
profess to be a Spiritualist, I own to having been infected with the 
fashionable itch for witnessing 'physical manifestations,' as they are 
called, and accordingly I have attended several circles with more or less 
gratification. But Dr. Slade is not an ordinary medium even among 
professionals. The literature of the Spiritualists is full of his 
extraordinary achievements, attested to all appear-ance by credible 
witnesses, who have not been ashamed to append their names to their 
statements. . .   I see that on one occasion, writing in six different 
languages was obtained on a single slate, and one day, accompanied by two 
learned professors, Dr. Slade had a sitting with the Grand Duke Constantine, 
who obtained writing on a new slate held by himself alone. From St. 
Petersburg, Dr. Slade went to Berlin, where he is said to have obtained some 
marvellous manifestations in the house of Professor Zollner, and where he 
was visited by the court conjurer to the Emperor, Samuel Bellachini…My 
object in visiting Dr. Slade can be understood when I was intro-duced to him 
with my friend, whom I shall call Omega, and who was bent on the same 
errand. Dr. Slade and Mr. Terry constituted the circle of four who sat 
around the table in the centre of the room almost as immediately as we 
entered it. There was nothing in the room to attract attention. No signs of 
confederacy, human or mechanical. The hour was eleven in the morning. The 
window was unshuttered, and the sun was shining brightly. The table at which 
we sat was a new one, made especially by Wallach Brothers, of Elizabeth 
Street, of polished cedar, having four slight legs, one flap, and no ledges 
of any kind under-neath. As soon as we examined it Dr. Slade took his seat 
on one side facing the window, and the rest of us occupied the other three 
seats. He was particularly anxious that we should see he had nothing about 
him. It has been said that he wrote on the slate by means of a crumb of 
pencil stuck in his finger-nail's, but his nails were cut to the quick, 
while his legs and feet were ostentatiously placed away from the table in a 
side position, exposed to view the whole time. He first produced a slate of 
the ordinary school size, with a wet sponge, which I used to it. A chip of 
pencil about the size of a grain of wheat was placed upon it on the table; 
we joined hands, and immediately taps were heard about the table, and in 
answer to a question-' Will you write ?’ - from Dr. Slade, three raps were 
given, and he forthwith took up the slate with the pencil lying on it, and 
held half of it under the table by his finger and thumb, which clasped the 
corner of the half that was outside the table, and was therefore easily seen 
by all present. His left hand re-mained near the centre of the table, 
resting on those of the two sitters on either side of him. Several 
convulsive jerks of his arm were now given, then a pause, and immediately 
the sound of writing was audible to every one, a scratching sound 
interrupted by the tap of the pencil. which indicated, as we afterwards 
found, that the t's were being crossed and the i’s dotted. The slate was 
then exposed, and the words written were in answer to the question which had 
been put by Omega as to whether he had psychic power or not. I pass over the 
conversation that ensued on the subject, and go on to the next phenomenon. 
To satisfy myself that the 'trick' was not done by means of sym-pathetic 
writing on the slate, I had ten minutes previously purchased a slate from a 
shop in Bourke Street, containing three leaves, and shutting up book 
fashion. This I pro-duced, and Dr. Slade readily repeated his performance 
with it. It was necessary to break the pencil down to a mere crumb, in order 
to insert it between the leaves of the slate. This done, the phenomenon at 
once recurred with this rather perplexing difference, that the slate. 
instead of being put half under the table, forced itself by a series of 
jerks on to my neck, and reposed quietly under my ear, in the eyes of 
everyone present. The scratching then commenced; I heard the t's crossed and 
the i's dotted by the moving pencil, and at the usual signal I opened the 
slate, and found an intelligible reply to the question put. . . . The next 
manifestation was the levitation of one of the sitters in his chair about a 
clear foot from the ground, and the levitation of the table about two feet. 
I ought to have mentioned that during the whole of the seance there was a 
good deal of by-play going on. Everyone felt the touch of hands more or 
less, and the sitters' chairs were twice wrenched from under them, or nearly 
so, but the psychic could not possibly have done it     
     Says Mrs. Emma Hardinge Britten, in her Nineteenth Century Miracles :-" 
As personal details are more graphic than the cold narrations of passing 
events, we deem it expedient in this place to give our readers an inside 
view of Spiritualism in Australia, by republishing one of the many articles 
sent by the author to the American Spiritual journals during her sojourn in 
the Colonies. The following excerpt' was written as the result of personal 
experience, and at a time when Spiritualism, in the usual inflated style of 
journalistic literature, was ' in the zenith of its triumphs.' It is 
addressed to the Editor of the Banner of Light, and reads as follows
     “’Spiritualism in these colonies finds little or no public 
representation outside of Melbourne or Sydney, nevertheless warm friends of 
the cause are scattered all over the land, and endeavours are being made to 
enlarge the numerous circles into public meetings, and the fugitive efforts 
of whole-hearted individuals into associations as powerful as that which 
exists in Melbourne. At present, the at-tempt to effect missionary work in 
any portions of Australia outside Sydney or Melbourne, becomes too great a 
burden to the luckless individual, who has not only to do the work, but to 
bear the entire cost of the undertaking, as I have had to do in my visits to 
various towns in Victoria. Ex-penses which are cheerfully divided amongst 
the many in the United States, become all too heavy for endurance when 
shouldered upon the isolated workers; hence the paucity of public 
representation, and the impossibility of those who visit the Colonies, as I 
have done, effecting any important pioneer work beyond the two great centres 
I have named. Mr. Walker at Sydney, and I at Melbourne, have been favoured 
with the largest gatherings ever assembled at Colonial Sunday meetings.
     "'Having, by desire of my spirit guides, exchanged rostrums, he filling 
my place at Melbourne, and I his at Sydney, we find simultaneously at the 
same time, and on the same Sundays, the lessees of the two theatres we oc-
cupied raising their rent upon us one hundred and fifty per cent, The 
freethinkers and Spiritualists had occupied the theatre in Sydney four years 
at the rate of four pounds per Sunday. For my benefit the landlord raised 
the rent to ten pounds, whilst the same wonderful spirit of accor-dance 
caused the Melbourne manager to increase upon Mr. Walker from eight pounds 
to a demand of twenty. With our heavy expenses and small admission fees this 
was tantamount to driving us out altogether. Both of us have succeeded after 
much difficulty, and fighting Christian warriors with the Christian arms of 
subtlety and vigilance, in securing other places to lecture in and despite 
the fact that the press insult us, the pulpit curse us, and Christians 
generally devote us to as complete a prophecy of what they would wish us to 
enjoy everlastingly as their piety can devise, we are each attracting our 
thousands every Sunday night, and making such unmistakable marks on public 
opinion as will not easily be effaced again.
     "'Dr. Slade's advent in Melbourne since last September has been 
productive of an immense amount of good. How far his labours here will prove 
remunerative I am not pre-pared to say. Frankly speaking, I do not advise 
Spirit Mediums or speakers to visit these colonies on financial advancement 
intent. There is an abundant crop of Me-dium power existing, interest enough 
in the cause, and many of the kindest hearts and clearest brains in the 
world to be found here; but the lack of organisation, to which I have before 
alluded, and the imperative necessity for the workers who come here to make 
their labours remu-nerative, paralyses all attempts at advancement, except 
in the sensation line. Still I feel confident that with united action 
throughout the scattered force of Spiritualistic thought in these Colonies, 
Spiritualism might and would supersede every other phase of religious 
thought in an incredibly short space of time. I must not omit to mention 
that the friends in every place I have visited have been more than kind, 
hospitable and appreciative. The public have defied both press and pulpit in 
their unstinted support of my lectures. The press have been equally servile, 
and the Christian world equally stirred, and equally active in desperate 
attempts to crush out the obvious proofs of immortality Spiritualism brings.
     "'In Melbourne, I had to fight my way to comply with an invitation to 
lecture for the benefit of the City Hospital. I fought and conquered; and 
the hospital committee revenged itself for a crowded attendance at the Town 
Hall by taking my money without the grace of thanks, either in public or 
private, and the simply formal acknowledg-ment of my services by an official 
receipt. In Sydney, where I now am, I was equally privileged in lecturing 
for the benefit of the Temperance Alliance, and equally honoured, after an 
enthusiastic and successful meeting, by the daily press of the city in their 
utter silence con-cerning such an important meeting, and their careful 
record of all sorts of such trash as they disgrace their columns with. So 
mote it be. The wheel will turn some day I
     During the years 1881 and '82 the Australian colonists were favoured 
with visits from three more well-known American Spiritualists. The first of 
these was Professor Denton, an able and eloquent lecturer on geology, and 
one who never failed to combine with his scientific addresses, one or more 
stirring lectures on Spiritualism. The second propagandist was Mrs. Ada 
Foye, one of the best test-writing, rapping, and seeing Mediums, who has 
ever appeared in the ranks of Spiritualism; whilst the third was Mrs. E. L. 
Watson, a trance-speaker.
     Professor Denton's lectures created a wide-spread in-terest amongst all 
classes of listeners.
     It now becomes necessary to speak of one of the most
arbitrary acts of tyranny on the part of the Victorian Government towards 
Spiritualism which the records of the movement can show. This was the 
interdict promul-gated by "the Chief Secretary', against the proprietor of 
the Melbourne Opera House, forbidding him to allow Spiritualists to take 
money at the door for admission to their services, and in effect, forbidding 
them to hold ser-vices there at all. A similar interdict was issued in the 
case of Mr. Proctor, the celebrated English lecturer on astronomy. The 
excuse for this tyrannical procedure in Mr. Proctor's case, might have been 
justified on the ground, that the Chief Secretary was entirely ignorant of 
the fact, that astronomy had anything to do with religion, or that it was 
not orthodox to talk about the celestial bodies on a Sunday, except in 
quotations from Genesis, or Revela-tions; but in the case of "the Victorian 
Association of Spiritualists" it was quite another point. Spiritualism was 
their religion, and Spiritual lectures their Sabbath Day exercises. Messrs. 
Walker, Peebles, and Mrs. Britten, had occupied the Opera House for months 
together, and admission fees had been charged at each of their Sunday 
services, without let or hindrance. The result of many gatherings for the 
purpose of denouncing their policy may be judged by a perusal of the 
following paragraph published in the Harbinger of Light of March, 1882
     "On Friday last a letter was received from the Govern-ment by the 
Executive of the Victorian Association of Spiritualists, intimating that the 
former had no desire to suppress the lectures, but endorsed the permit of 
May 1879. The directors of the Opera House Company were inter-viewed, and on 
the understanding that no money be taken at the doors, consented to the 
opening of the House. The fact being announced in Saturday's papers drew a 
large audience to hear Mr. Walker's lecture on Sunday, 'Lord Macaulay on 
Roman Catholicism.' The services will be continued as heretofore. Seats in 
dress circle or stalls may be hired by month or quarter, at W. H. Terry's 
84, Russel Street."
     During Dr. Slade's visit to Sydney, a very able and energetic worker in 
Spiritualism became convinced of its truth, in the person of Mr. E. Cyril 
Haviland, the author of two excellent pamphlets and many articles, tracts, 
and good literary contributions on this subject. Mr. Haviland, Mr. Harold 
Stephen, and several other gentlemen of literary repute in Sydney, combined 
during the author's last visit to form a "Psychological Society," the 
members of which like the persons above named. represented some of the most 
accomplished writers and advanced thinkers of the city.
     Mr. L. E. Harcus, an able and fluent writer, furnished a report of the 
origin and growth of this society for the Banner of Light of March 1880.

Austria: (For ancient magic among the Teutonic people of Austria, See 
Teutons. See also Hungary.)
     In Austria, Spiritualism was first promulgated by M. Constantine Delby 
of Vienna. He was a warm adherent of Allan Kardec, and founded a society 
under legal aus-pices, besides starting a Spiritual journal. The society 
numbered but few members, in fact Spiritualism never obtained much foothold 
in Vienna. At Buda-Pesth it was quite otherwise. In a short time a 
considerable amount of interest was awakened, and many persons of note began 
to take part in the circles that were being formed there, amongst these were 
Mr. Anton Prohasker and Dr. Adolf Grunhut. At length a society was formed, 
legalised by the State, of which Baron Edmund Vay, was elected presi-dent. 
Mr. Lishner, of Pesth. built a handsome seance room which the society 
rented. At that time there were one hundred and ten members, many of them 
being He-brews, though all Christians. Baron Vay was the honorary president, 
Dr. Grunhut, was the active president, and these and Mr. Prohasker were 
amongst the most devoted and faithful workers. The principles of the 
society, indeed the basis of it were taken from the Geist Krap Stoff of 
Baroness Adelma Von Vay and the works of Allan Kardec - purely Christian 
Spiritualism  It never encouraged paid Mediumship. All the officers were 
voluntary and honorary. It had no physical Medium, but good trance, writing 
and seeing mediums.

Autography : A term sometimes used to denote the spirit-ualistic phenomenon 
of " direct" writing (q.v.).

Auto-Hypnotisation : (See Hypnotism.)

Ansuperomin : A sorcerer of the time of St, Jean de Lus, who, according to 
information supplied by Pierre Delamere, a councillor of Henry IV, was seen 
several times at the sabbath," mounted on a demon in the shape of a goat, 
and playing on the flute for the witches' dance.

Automatic Writing and Speaking :  Writing  executed or speech uttered 
without the agent's volition, and some-times without his knowledge. The term 
is used by psychical researchers and applied particularly to the trance 
phenomena of the seance-room. By spiritualists, writing or speaking produced 
under these conditions, are said to be performed " under control "-that is, 
under the con-trolling agency of the spirits of the dead-and are therefore 
not judged to be truly "automatic." The general con-sensus of opinion, 
however, ascribes such performances to the subconscious activity of the 
agent. Automatic writing and speaking necessarily imply some deviation from 
the normal in the subject, though such abnormality need not be pronounced, 
but may vary from a slight disturbance of the nerve-centres occasioned by 
excitement or fatigue to hystero-epilepsy or actual insanity. When the 
phenomena are produced during a state of trance or somnambulism the agent 
may be entirely unconscious of his actions. On the other hand the automatic 
writing may be executed while the agent is in a condition scarcely varying 
from the normal and quite capable of observing the phenomena in a critical 
spirit, though perhaps ignorant of a word in advance of what he is actually 
writing. Between these states of full consciousness or complete 
unconsciousness there are many intermediate stages. The secondary  
personality, as displayed in the writings or utterances, may gain only a 
partial ascendancy over the primary, as may happen in dreams or in the 
hypnotic trance. As a rule automatic speech and writings display nothing 
more than a revivifying of faded mental imagery, thoughts and conjectures 
and impressions which never came to birth in the upper con-sciousness. But 
at times there appears an extraordinary exaltation of memory, or even of the 
intellectual faculties. Cases are on record where lost articles have been 
recovered by mean's of automatic writing. Foreign languages which have been 
forgotten, or with which the subject has small acquaintance, are Spoken or 
written fluently. Helene Smith, the 'subject of Professor Flournoy, even 
went so far as to invent a new language, purporting to be that of the 
Martians, but in reality showing a marked resemblance to French-the mother-
tongue of the medium. Auto-matic writing and speaking have been produced in 
considerable quantities, mainly in connection' with spirit-ualistic circles, 
though it existed long before the advent of spiritualism in the speaking 
with "tongues" of the early ecstatics. These unintelligible outpourings are 
still to be met with, but are no longer a marked feature of auto-matic 
utterance. But, though the matter and style may on occasion transcend the 
capabilities of the agent in his normal state, the great body of automatic 
productions does not show an erudition or literary excellence beyond the 
scope of the natural resources of the automist. The style is involved, 
obscure, inflated, yet possessing a superficial smoothness and a suggestion 
of flowing periods and musical cadence's. The ideas are often shallow and 
in-coherent, and all but lost in a multitude of words. The best known of 
automatic writings are the Spirit Teachings of the Rev. Stanton Moses, the 
works of A. J. Davis, J. Murray Spear, and Charles Linton, and, perhaps most 
important of all, the Trance Utterances of Mrs. Piper, these last offering 
no inconsiderable evidence for telepathy. A good deal of poetry has been 
produced automatically, notably by the Rev. T. L. Harris. Among those who 
are known to have produced automatic writings are Goethe, Victor Hugo, 
Victorien Sardou, and other eminent men of letters. (For the hypothesis of 
spirit control, see article Spiritualism.)

Avenar : An astrologer who promised to the Jews, on the testimony. of the 
planets, that their Messiah should arrive without fail in 1444. or at the 
latest. in 1464. He gave, for his guarantors, Saturn, Jupiter, "the crab, 
and the fish." All the Jews kept their windows open to receive the messenger 
of God, who did not arrive.

Avenir : (Journal) (See France.)

Avicenna : Named Aben Sina by Hebrew writers, but properly, Ebor Sina, or-to 
give his long array of names in full - A1-Sheihk Al-Rayis Abu Ali Al-Hossein 
ben Ab-dallah ben Sina, born at Kharmatain, near Bokhara, in the year of the 
Hegira 370. or A.D. 980. He was educated at Bokhara, and displayed such 
extraordinary precocity that when he had reached his tenth year, he had 
completely mastered the Koran, and acquired a knowledge of algebra, the 
Mussulman theology, and the His ab ul-Hind, or arith-metic of the Hindoos. 
Under Abdallah Al- Natheli he studied logic, Euclid, and the Almagest.. and 
then, as a diversion, devoted himself to the study of medicine. He was only 
twenty-one years old when he composed his Kitab al-Majmu or, The Book of the 
Sum Total, whose mysteries he afterwards endeavoured to elucidate in a 
commentary in twenty volumes. His reputation for wisdom and eru-dition was 
so great that on the death of his father he was promoted by Sultan Magdal 
Douleth to the high office of Grand Vizier, which he held with advantage to 
the State until a political revolution accomplished the downfall of the 
Samanide dynasty. He then quitted Bokhara. and wandered from place to place, 
increasing his store of know-ledge, but yielding himself to a life of the 
grossest sensu-ality. About 1012 he retired to Jorjan, where he began his 
great work on medicine, which is still held in some re-pute as one of the 
earliest systems of that art with any pretensions to philosophical 
completeness. It is arranged with singular clearness, and presents a very 
admirable resume' of the doctrines of the ancient Greek physicians, Avicenna 
subsequently lived at Rul, Kazwin, and Jspahan, where he became physician to 
the Persian sovereign, Ala-eddaulah. He is said to have been dismissed from 
this post on account of his debauched living. He then retired to Hamadan, 
where, worn out with years of sensual indul-gence.. he died, at the age of 
58, in 1038. His works on philosophy. mathematics. and medicine, are nearly 
one hundred in number, and include at least seven treatises on the 
Philosopher's Stone. His Book of the Canon of Medicine acquired an European 
celebrity, and has been several times translated into Latin. Contemporary 
with Avicenna were numerous votaries of the alchemistical science, and 
almost every professor of medicine was an astrologer The influence of the 
stars upon the conditions of the human body was generally accepted as a 
first principle in medicine; and the possible transmutation of metals 
engaged the attention of every inquiring intellect. At the same time, the 
Arabians were almost the sole depositaries of human knowledge; and. in the 
East glowed that steadily-shining light which, never utterly extinct, had 
withdrawn its splendour and its glory from the classic lands of the West. 
"They cultivated with success," says Gibbon, "the sub-lime science of 
astronomy, which elevates the mind of man to disdain his diminutive planet 
and momentary existence." The names of Mesua and Geber, of Rhazis and 
Avicenna, are ranked with the Grecian masters; in the city of Bagdad, eight 
hundred and sixty physicians were licensed to exercise their lucrative 
profession ; in Spain, the life of the Catholic princes was entrusted to the 
skill of the Saracens, and the school of Salerno, their legitimate 
offspring, revived in Italy and Europe the precepts of the healing art.

Avichi : is the Theosophic hell. Though it is a place of torment, it differs 
in great degree from the ordinary conception of hell. its torments are the 
torments of fleshly cravings, which for want of a physical body, cannot be 
satisfied. A man remains after death exactly the same entity as he was 
before it, and, if in life, he has been obsessed with strong desires or 
passions, such obsession still continues, though, in the astral plane in 
which he finds himself the satisfaction of these desires or passions is im-
possible.  Of course, the manner of these torments is infinite, whether it 
be the confirmed sensualist who suffers them, or more ordinary men who, 
without being bound to the. things of the flesh, have nevertheless allowed 
the affairs of the world to bulk too largely in their lives, and are now 
doomed to regret the small attention they have bestowed on higher matters. 
Avichi is a place of regrets for things done and things undone. Its torments 
are not, however, eternal, and with the passing of time of which there is no 
measure in the astral plane - they are gradually discontinued, though at the 
cost of terrible suffering.

Avidya : in Theosophy is the ignorance of mind which causes man before 
starting on the Path to expend vain effort and pursue vain courses. It is 
the antithesis of Vidya. (See Path. and Vidya, and Theosophy.)

Awyntyrs of Arthure at the Tern Wathelyn : an Ar-thurian poem of the 
fourteenth or fifteenth centuries. It is believed to be of Scottish origin, 
but its authorship is doubtful. Amongst other adventures, the poem relates 
one which King Arthur and his queen Guinevere, accom-panied by their 
favourite knight Sir Gawane, had whilst hunting in the wilds. of Cumberland. 
They were overtaken by darkness, while separated from the rest of the party, 
and the ghost of the queen's mother appears to them. The apparition tells of 
the torments to which it is being sub-jected, and entreats that prayers will 
he offered up for its release. This the queen and Sir Gawane promise, and on 
their return to Carlisle, millions of masses are ordered to be sung on its 
behalf.

Axinomancy : Divination by means of a hatchet or a woodcutter's axe. It is 
by this form of divination that the diviners predicted the ruin of 
Jerusalem, as is. seen from Psalm LXXIII. Francois de la Tour-Blanche, who 
remarked upon this, does not tell us how the diviners made use of the 
hatchet. We can only suppose that it was by one of the two methods employed 
in ancient times and still practised in certain northern countries. The 
first is as follows: When it is desired to find a treasure, a round agate 
must be procured, the head of the axe must be made red-hot in the fire. and 
so placed that its edge may stand perpendicularly in the air. The agate must 
be placed on the edge. If it remains there, there is no treasure, if it 
falls, it will roll quickly away. It must, however. be re-placed three 
times, and if it rolls three times towards the same place. there the 
treasure will be found. If it rolls a different way each time, one must seek 
about for the treasure.
     The second method of divination by the axe is for the purpose of 
detecting robbers. The hatchet is cast on the ground, head-downwards, with 
the handle rising perpen-dicularly in the air. Those present must dance 
round it in a ring, till the handle of the axe totters and it falls to the 
ground. The end of the handle indicates the direction in which the thieves 
must be sought. It is said by some that if this divination is to succeed, 
the head of the axe must be stuck in a round pot, but this, as Delancre 
says, is absurd. For how could an ax,' be fixed in a round pot. any more 
than the pot could be sewed or patched if the axe had broken it to pieces?

Ayperor : A count of the infernal empire.  (The same as Ipes.)

Azael : One of the angels who revolted against God. The rabbis say that he 
is chained on sharp stones, in an obscure part of the desert, awaiting the 
last judgment.

Azam, Dr.: (See Hypnotism).

Azazel : A demon of the second order, guardian of the goat. At the feast of 
expiation, which the Jews celebrate on the tenth day of the seventh month, 
two goats are led to the High Priest, who draws lots for them, the one for 
the Lord, the other for Azazel. The one on which the lot of the Lord fell 
was sacrificed, and his blood served for expiation. The High Priest then put 
his two hands on the head of the other, confessed his sins and those of the 
people, charged the animal with them, and allowed him to be led into the 
desert and set free. And the people, having left the care of their 
iniquities to the goat of Azazel - also known as the "cape-goat-return home 
with clean consciences. According to Milton, Azazel is the principal 
standard-bearer of the infernal armies. It is also the name of the demon 
used by Mark the heretic for his magic spells.

Azer : An angel of the elemental fire. Azer is also the name of the father 
of Zoroaster.

Azoth :  (See Philosopher's Stone.)

Aztec:	(See Mexico and Central America).



B


Ba : The Egyptian conception of the soul, which in the form of a man-headed 
bird left the body after death and winged its flight to the gods. It 
returned at intervals to the mummy for the. purpose of comforting it and 
reassuring it concerning immortality. Sometimes it grasps the ankh (q.v.) 
and the nif (q.v.) and is occasionally represented as flying down the tomb-
shaft to the deceased, or perched on the breast of the mummy. It was 
sometimes carved on the lid of mummy cases. In the Book of the Dead a 
chapter promises abundance of food to the Ba, so that the conception does 
not appear to have been entirely spiritual.

Baalberith : According to Wierius. a demon of the second order; master of 
the infernal Alliance. He is said to be secretary and keeper of the archives 
of Hell.

Baalzeohon : Captain of the guard and sentinels of Hell, according to 
Wierius.

Baaras : A marvellous plant known to the Arabs as the "Golden Plant," and 
which is supposed to grow on Mount Libanus, underneath the road which leads 
to Damascus. It is said to flower in the month of May, after the melting of 
the snow, At night it can be seen by torchlight, but through the dav it is 
invisible. It was held to be of great assistance to alchemists in the 
transmutation of metals. It is alluded to by Josephus. (Lib. VIIl., Chap. 
25.)

Babau : A species of ogre with which the nurses in the central parts of 
France used to frighten their charges.. He was supposed to devour naughty 
children in salad. The ending "au  suggests a Celtic origin. For example, " 
Y Mamau," the Welsh for " fairies,"

Bablagora : Certain lakes of a gloomy nature. which lie be-tween Hungary and 
Poland. which have figured in various stories of witchcraft, Pools, such as 
these, are often used for purposes of divination, as by gazing down into 
clear water the mind is disposed to contemplation. often of a melancholy 
character. This form of divination is termed Hydromancy" (q.v.) and is 
similar to crystal-gazing. 

Babylonia: The conservative element in the religion of Babylonia was one of 
its most marked and interesting features. All the deities retained, even 
after they reached their highest development. traces of their primitive 
demoniac characters. and magic was never divorced from religion. The most 
outstanding god. were Ea, Anu and Enlil, the eider Bel. These formed a triad 
at the dawn of history. and appear to have developed from an animistic group 
of world spirits. Although Ea became specialised as a god of the deep. Anu 
as a god of the sky, and Enlil as an earth god, each had also titles which 
emphasised that they had attributes overlapping those of the others. Thus Ea 
was Enki, earth lord, and as Aa was a lunar deity, a,'d he had also solar 
attributes. In the legend of Etana and the Eagle, his heaven is stated to be 
in the sky. Anu and Enlil as deities of thunder, rain and fertility. linked 
closely with Ea, as Dagan, of the flooding and fertilising Euphrates. Each 
of these deities were accompanied by demon groups. The spirits of disease 
were the " beloved sons of Bel"; the fates were the seven daughters of Anu 
the seven storm demons, including the dragon and serpent, were of En's 
brood. In one of the magical incantations translated by Mr. R. C. Thompson, 
occurs the following description of En's primitive monster form:

The head is the head of a serpent.
From his nostrils mucus trickles,
The mouth is beslavered with water:
The ears are those of a basilisk,
His horns are twisted into three curls,
He wears a veil in his head-band,
The body is a sun-fish full of stars,
The base of his feet are claws,
The so1e of his foot has no heel;
His name is Sassu-wunnu,
A sea monster, a form of Ea.

En was "the great magician of the gods"; his sway over the forces of nature 
was secured by the performance of magical rites, and his services were 
obtained by mankind, who performed requisite ceremonies and repeated appro-
priate spells. Although he might be worshipped and propitiated in his temple 
at Eridu, he could also be con-jured in reed huts. The latter indeed appear 
to have been the oldest holy places. In the Deluge myth, he makes a 
revelation in a dream to his human favourite, Pir-napishtim, the Babylonian 
Noah, of the approaching disaster planned by the gods. by addressing the 
reed hut in which he slept: “O, reed hut, hear; O, wall, understand." The 
sleeper received the divine message from the reeds. The reeds were to the 
Babylonian what rowan branches were to northern Europeans: they protected 
them against demons. The dead were buried wrapped in reed mats.
     When the official priesthood came into existence it in-cluded two 
classes of magicians, the ' Ashipu." who were exorcists, and the 
"Mashmashu," the "purifiers." The Ashipu priests played a prominent part in 
ceremonies, which had for their object the magical control of nature: in 
times of storm, disaster, and eclipse they were especially active. They also 
took the p art of "witch doctors." Victims of disease were supposed to be 
possessed of devour-ing demons:

Loudly roaring above, gibbering below,
They are the bitter venom of the gods.
Knowing no care, they grind the land like corn: Knowing no mercy, they rage 
against mankind, They spill their blood like rain,
Devouring their flesh and sucking their veins. (Thompson's translation.)

It was the business of the Ashipu priests to drive out the demon. Before he 
could do so he had to identify it. Having done so, he required next to bring 
it under his influence. This he accomplished by reciting its history and 
detailing its characteristics. The secret of the magic-ian's power was his 
knowledge. To cure toothache. for instance, it was necessary to know the 
"Legend of the Worm," which, vampire-like, absorbed the blood of victims, 
but specialised in gums. The legend relates that the worm came into 
existence as follows: Anu created the heaven, the heavens created the earth, 
the earth created the rivers, and the rivers created the canals, then the 
canals created marshes, and the marshes created the ".worm." In due time the 
worm appeared before Shamash, the sun god, and Ea, god of the deep, weeping 
and hungry. "What will you give me to eat and drink?" it cried. The gods 
promised that it would get dried bones and scented wood. Apparently the worm 
realised that this was the "food of death," for it made answer: "What are 
dry bones to me? Set me upon the gums that I may drink the blood of the 
teeth and take away the strength of the gums." When the worm heard this 
legend repeated, it came under the magician's power, and was dismissed to 
the marshes, while Ea was invoked to smite it, Different demons were 
exorcised by different processes. A fever patient might receive the 
following treatment:

Sprinkle this man with water, 
Bring unto him a censer and a torch, 
That the plague demon which resteth in the body of the man, 
Like water may trickle away.

Another method was to fashion a figure of dough, wax, clay or pitch. This 
figure might be placed on a fire or mutilated, or placed in running water to 
be washed away. As the figure suffered, so did the demon it represented.

     By the magic of the word of Ea. 
A third method was to release a raven at the bedside of the
sick man so that It would conjure the demon of fever to take
flight likewise, Sacrifices were also offered, as substitutes
for patients, to provide food for the spirit of the disease.

A kid was slain and the priest muttered: 

“The kid is the substitute for mankind; 
He hath given the kid for his life, 
He hath given the head of the kid for the head of the man.

A pig might be offered:

“Give the pig in his stead
And give the flesh of it for his flesh, The blood of it for his blood, etc.”

The cures were numerous and varied. After the patient recovered the house 
was purified by the "mashmashu" priests. The ceremony entailed the 
sprinkling of sacred water, the burning of incense, and the repetition of 
magical charms. Houses were also protected against attack, by placing 
certain plants over the doorways and windows. An ass's halter seems to have 
been used, as horse-shoes have been in Europe, to repel witches and evil 
spirits.
     The purification ceremonies suggest the existence of taboo. For a 
period a sick man was "unclean" and had to be isolated. To each temple was 
attached a "House of Light" in which fire ceremonies were performed, and a 
"House of Washing" where patients bathed in sacred water. Oil was also used 
as anointment to complete the release from uncleanness, floods were also 
tabooed at certain seasons, It was unlawful for a man to eat pork on the 
30th of Ab (July-August) or the 27th of Tisri, and other dates. Fish, ox 
flesh, bread, etc. were similarly tabooed on specific dates. A man's luck 
depended greatly on his observance of these rules, But although he might 
observe all ceremonies, he might still meet with ill-fortune on unlucky 
days. On the festival day of Marduk (Merodach) a man must not change his 
clothes nor put on white garments, nor offer up sacrifices. Sure disaster 
would overcome a king if he drove out in a chariot, or a physician if he 
laid hands on the sick, or a priest who sat in judgment, and so on. On lucky 
days good fortune was the heritage of everyone. Good fortune meant good 
health in many cases, and it was sometimes assured by worship-ping the 
dreaded spirit of disease called Ura. A legend related that this demon once 
made up his mind to destroy all mankind, His counsellor Ishun, however, 
prevailed upon him to change his mind, and he said, "Whoever will laud my 
name I will bless with plenty. No one will oppose the person who proclaims 
the glory of my valour. The worshipper who chants the hymn of praise to me 
will not be afflicted by disease and he will find favour in the eyes of the 
King and his nobles."
     Ghosts-Among the spirits who were the enemies of mankind the ghosts of 
the dead were not the least virulent, and especially the ghosts of those who 
had not been prop-erly buried. These homeless spirits (the grave was the 
home of the dead) wandered about the streets searching for food and drink, 
or haunted houses. Not infrequently they did real injury to mankind. Of 
horrible aspect, they appeared before children and frightened them to death. 
They waylaid travellers and mocked those who were in sorrow. The screech-owl 
was a mother who had died in childbed and walled her grief nightly in 
solitary places. Occasionally she appeared in monstrous form and slew 
wayfarers. Adam's "first wife Lilith" was a demon who had once been 
beautiful and was in the habit of deceiving lovers, and working ill against 
them.  A hag, Labartu, haunted mountains and marshes and children had to be 
charmed against her attacks. She also had a human his-tory. The belief that 
the spirits of the dead could be conjured from their graves to make 
revelations was also prevalent in Babylonia. In the Gilgamesh epic, the hero 
visits the tomb of his old friend and fellow-warrior Ea-Bani. The ghost 
rises like a "weird gust" and answers the various questions addressed to it 
with great sadness. Babylonian outlook on the future life was tinged by pro-
found gloom and pessimism. It was the fate of even the ghosts of the most 
fortunate and ceremonially buried dead to exist in darkness and amidst dust. 
The ghost of Ea-Bani said to Gilgamesh:

     “Were I to inform thee the law of the underworld which I have 
experienced,
Thou wouldest sit down and shed tears all day long."

Gilgamesh lamented:

"The sorrow of the underworld hath taken hold upon thee."

Priests who performed magical ceremonies had to be clothed in magical 
garments. They received inspiration from their clothing. Similarly the gods 
derived power from the skins of animals with which they were associated from 
the earliest time. Thus En was clad in the skin of the fish-probably the 
fish totem of the En tribe.
     The dead were not admitted to the heavens of the gods. When a favoured 
human being, like Utnapishtim, the Babylonian Noah, joined the company of 
the gods, he had assigned to him an island Paradise where Gilgamesh visited 
him. There he dwelt with his wife. Gilgamesh
was not permitted to land, and held converse with his immortal ancestor, 
sitting in his boat. The deities se-cured immortality by eating the "food of 
life" and drinking the "water of life." DONALD MACKENZIE.

Bacchic Mysteries : (See Greece).

Bachelor : The name given to his satanic majesty. when he appeared in the 
guise of a great he-goat, for the purpose of love intercourse with the 
witches.

Bacis : A famous augur of Beotia. Many persons who ventured to predict the 
future adopted the name of Bacis.

Bacon, Roger : was born near Ilchester in Somerset, in 1214. In his boyhood 
he displayed remarkable precocity, and in due time, having entered the order 
of St. Francis, he studied mathematics and medicine in Oxford and Paris. 
Returning to England, he devoted attention to philosophy and also wrote 
Latin, Greek, and Hebrew Grammars. He was a pioneer of astronomy and was 
acquainted with the properties of lenses, so that he may have foreshadowed 
the telescope. In the region of the mechanical sciences, his prophecies are 
noteworthy since he not only speaks of boats which may be propelled without 
oars, but of cars which may move without horses, and even of machines to fly 
in the air. To him we are indebted for important discoveries in the science 
of pure chemistry. His name is for ever associated with the making of 
gunpowder. and if the honour cannot be wholly afforded him, his experi-ments 
with nitre were at least a far step towards the dis-covery. His study of 
alchemical subjects led him, as was natural, to a belief in the 
philosopher's stone by which gold might be purified to a degree impossible 
by any other means, and also to a belief in the elixir of life whereby on 
similar principles of purification, the human body might be fortified 
against death itself. Not only might man become practically immortal by such 
means but, by know-ledge of the appropriate herbs, or by acquaintance with 
planetary influences, he might attain the same consum-mation. As was natural 
in an ignorant age, Bacon was looked on with considerable suspicion which 
ripened into persecution. The brethren of his order practically cast him 
out, and he was compelled to retire to Paris, and to submit himself to a 
regime of repression. A prolific pen-man, he was forbidden to write, and it 
was not till 1266 that Guy de Foulques, the papal legate in England-sub-
sequently Pope Clement IV.-hearing of Bacon's fame, invited him to break his 
enforced silence. Bacon hailed the opportunity and in spite of hardship and 
poverty, finished his Opus Majus, Opus Minus and Opus Tertium. These works 
seem to have found favour with Clement, for the writer was allowed to return 
to Oxford, there to continue his scientific studies and the composition of 
scientific works. He essayed a compendium of philosophy of which a part 
remains, but its subject-matter was displeasing to the ruling powers and 
Bacon's misfortunes began afresh. His books were burned and again be was 
thrown into prison, where he remained for fourteen years, and during that 
period it is probable that he continued to write, About 1202 he was again at 
liberty, and within the next few years - probably in 1294-he died. Bacon's 
works were numerous and, while many still remain in manuscript, about a 
dozen have been printed at various times. Many are obscure treatises on 
alchemy and deserve little attention, but the works he wrote by invitation 
of Clement are the most important.  The Opus Majus is divided into six parts 
treating of the causes of error, the relation between philosophy and 
theology, the utility of grammar, mathematics, perspective and experimental 
science. The Opus Minus, of which only part has been preserved, was intended 
to be a summary of the former work. The Opus Teretium though written after 
the other two, is an introduction to them, and also in part supplementary to 
them. These works, large though they be, seem to have been only the 
forerunners of a vast work treating of the principles of all the sciences, 
which, however, was probably little more than begun. Much of Bacon's work 
and many of his beliefs must, of course, be greatly discounted, but judging 
the man in relation to his time, the place he takes is a high one. His 
devotion to the experimental sciences was the point wherein he differed from 
most from his contemporaries, and to this devotion is to be accounted the 
fame which he then possessed and still possess.
     But no sketch of Bacon's life would be complete without some account of 
the legendary material which has gathered around his name, and by virtue of 
which he holds rank as a great magician in the popular imagination. When, in 
the sixteenth century, the study of magic was pursued with increased zeal, 
the name of Friar Bacon became more popular, and not only were the 
traditions worked up into a popular book, entitled The History of Friar 
Bacon, but one of the dramatists of the age, Robert Green, founded upon them 
a play, which was often acted, and of which there are several editions. The 
greater part of the history of Friar Bacon, as far as it related to that 
celebrated personage, is evidently the invention of the writer, who appears 
to have lived in the time of Queen Elizabeth; he adopted some of the older 
traditions, and filled up his narrative with fables taken from the common 
story books of the age.  We are here first made acquainted with two other 
legendary conjurers,  Friars Bungay and Vander-mast  and the recital is 
enlivened with the pranks of Bacon's servant Miles.
     According to this legendary history, Roger Bacon was the son of a 
wealthy farmer in the West of England, who had placed his son with the 
parish priest to gain a little scholarship. The boy soon showed an 
extraordinary ability for learning, which was encouraged by the priest, but 
which was extremely disagreeable to the father, who intended him for no 
other profession but that of the plough. Young Bacon fled from home, and 
took shelter in a monas-tery, where he followed his studies to his heart's 
content, and was eventually sent to complete them at Oxford. There he made 
himself a proficient in the occult sciences, and attained to the highest 
proficiency in magic.  At length he had an opportunity of exhibiting his 
skill before the court. and the account of his exploits on this occasion may 
be given as a sample of tile style of this quaint old history.
     The king being in Oxfordshire at a nobleman's house, was very desirous 
to see this famous friar, for he had heard many times of his wondrous things 
that he had done by his art, therefore he sent one for him to desire him to 
come to the court. Friar Bacon kindly thanked the king by the messenger, and 
said that he was at the king's service and would suddenly attend him, 'but, 
sir,' saith he to the gentleman, 'I pray you make haste or else I shall be 
two hours before you at the court.'   For all your learning", answered the 
gentleman, ' I can hardly believe this, for scholars, old men, and 
travellers, may lie by authority.' 'To strengthen your belief' said Friar 
Bacon,  I could presently show you the last wench that you kissed withal, 
but I will not at this time.'  ' One is as true as the other,' said the 
gentleman,  and I would laugh to see either.' You shall see them both within 
these four hours,' quoth the friar. 'and therefore make what haste you can.' 
' I will prevent that by my speed,' said the gentleman, and with that he rid 
his way; but he rode out of his way, as it should seem, for he had but five 
miles to ride, and yet was he better than three hours a-riding them, so that 
Friar Bacon by his art was with the king before he came.
     "The king kindly welcomed him, and said that he long time had desired 
to see him, for he had as yet not heard of his like. Friar Bacon answered 
him, that fame had belied him, and given him that report that his poor 
studies had never deserved, for h believed that art had many sons more 
excellent than himself was. The king com-mended him for his modesty, and 
told him that nothing could become a wise man less than boasting: but yet 
withal he requested him now to be no niggard of his know-ledge, but to show 
his queen and him some of his skill ‘I were worthy of neither art or 
knowledge,' quoth Friar Bacon, ' should I deny your majesty this small 
request ; I pray seat yourselves, and you shall see presently what my poor 
skill can perform.'  The king, queen, and nobles sat them all down. They 
having done so, the friar waved his wand, and presently was heard such 
excellent music, that they were all amazed, for they all said they had never 
heard the like.  ' This is,' said the friar, ' to delight the sense of 
hearing,-I will delight all your other senses ere you depart hence.'  So 
waving his wand again. there was louder music heard, and presently five 
dancers entered, the first like a court laundress, the second like a 
footman, the third like a usurer, the fourth like a prodigal, the fifth like 
a fool.  These did divers excellent changes, so that they gave content to 
all the beholders, and having done their dance they all vanished away in 
their order as they came in.  Thus feasted two of their senses.  Then waved 
he his wand again, and there was another kind of music heard, and whilst it 
was playing, there was suddenly before them a table, richly covered with all 
sorts of delicacies. Then desired he the king and queen to taste of some 
certain rare fruits that were on the table, which they and the nobles there 
present did, and were very highly pleased with the taste; they being 
satisfied, all vanished away on the sudden. when waved he his wand again, 
and suddenly there was such a smell, as if all the rich perfumes in the 
whole world had been then prepared in the best manner that art could set 
them out. Whilst he feasted thus their smelling, he waved his wand again, 
and there came divers nations in sundry habits, as Russians, Polanders, 
Indians, Armenians, all bringing sundry kinds of furs, such as their 
countries yielded, all which they presented to the king and queen. These 
furs were so soft to the touch that they highly pleased all those that 
handled them. Then, after some odd fantastic dances, after their country 
manner, they vanished away. Then asked Friar Bacon the king's majesty if 
that he desired any more of his skill. The king answered that he was fully 
satisfied for that time, and that he only now thought of something that he 
might bestow on him, that might partly satisfy the kindness he had re-
ceived. Friar Bacon said that he desired nothing so much as his majesty's 
love, and if that he might be assured of that, he would think himself happy 
in it. ' For that,' said the king. 'be thou ever sure, in token of which 
receive this jewel,' and withal gave him a costly jewel from his neck. The 
friar did with great reverence thank his majesty, and said, ' As your 
majesty's vassal you shall ever find me ready to do you service; your time 
of need shall find it both beneficial and delightful. But amongst all these 
gentlemen I see not the man that your grace did send for me by; sure he hath 
lost his way, or else met with some sport that detains him so long; I 
promised to be here before him, and all this noble assembly can witness I am 
as good as my word - I hear him coming. With that entered the gentleman, all 
bedirted, for he had rid through ditches, quagmires, plashes, and waters, 
that he was in a most pitiful case. He, seeing the friar there, looked full 
angrily, and bid a plague on all his devils for they had led him out of his 
way. and almost drowned him. 'Be not angry, sir,' said Friar Bacon, 'here is 
an old friend of yours that bath more cause, for she hath tarried these 
three hours for you,'-with that he pulled up the hangings, and behind him 
stood a kitchen-maid with a basting-ladle in her hand-' now am I as good as 
my word with you, for I promised to help you to your sweetheart,-how do you 
like this? ' 'So ill,' answered the gentleman, 'that I will be avenged of 
you.' 'Threaten not,' said Friar Bacon, 'lest I do you more shame, and do 
you take heed how you give scholars the lie again; but. because I know not 
how well you are stored with money at this time, I will bear your wench's 
charges home.' With that she vanished away."
     This may be taken as a sort of exemplification of the class of 
exhibitions which were probably the result of a superior knowledge of 
natural science, and which were exaggerated by popular imagination. They had 
been made, to a certain degree, familiar by the performances of the skilful 
jugglers who came from the east, and who were scattered throughout Europe; 
and we read not un-frequently of such magical feats in old writers. When the 
Emperor Charles IV. was married in the middle of the fourteenth century to 
the Bavarian Princess Sophia in the city of Prague, the father of the 
princess brought a waggon-load of magicians to assist in the festivities. 
Two of the chief proficients in the art, Zytho the great Bohemian sorcerer, 
and Gouin  the Bavarian, were pitted against each other, and we are told 
that after a desperate trial of skill, Zytho, opening his jaws from ear to 
ear, ate up his rival without stopping till he came to his shoes, which he 
spit out, because, as he said, they had not been cleaned, After having 
performed this strange feat, he restored the unhappy sorcerer to life again. 
The idea of contests like this seems to have been taken from the scriptural 
narrative of the contention of the Egyptian magicians against Moses.
     The greater number of Bacon's exploits are mere adapta-tions of 
medieval stories, but they show, nevertheless, what was the popular notion 
of the magician's character. Such is the story of the gentleman who, reduced 
to poverty and involved in debt, sold himself to the evil one, on condition 
that he was to deliver himself up as soon as his debts were paid. As may be 
imagined without much difficulty, he was not in haste to satisfy his 
creditors, but at length the time came when he could put them off no longer, 
and then, in his despair, he would have committed violence on himself had 
not his hand been arrested by Bacon. The latter, when he had heard the 
gentleman's story, directed him to repair to the place appointed for his 
meeting with the evil one, to deny the devil's claim, and to refer for 
judgment to the first person who should pass “In the morning, after that he 
had blessed himself, he went to the wood, where he found the devil ready for 
him. So soon as he came near, the devil said: 'Nov,, deceiver, are you come? 
Now shall thou see that I can and will prove that thou hast paid all thy 
debts, and therefore thy soul belongest to me.' 'Thou art a deceiver,' said 
the gentleman, 'and gavest me money to cheat me of my soul, for else why 
wilt thou be thine own judge ?-let me have some others to judge between us.' 
'Content,' said the devil, 'take whom thou wilt.' 'Then I will have,' said 
the gentleman, 'the next man that cometh this way.' Hereto the devil agreed. 
No sooner were these words ended, but Friar Bacon came by, to whom this 
gentleman spoke, and requested that he would. be judge in a weighty matter 
between them two. The friar said he was content, so b9th parties were 
agreed; the devil told Friar Bacon how the case stood between them in this 
manner. ' Know, friar, that I seeing this prodigal like to starve for want 
of food, lent him money, not only to buy him victuals, but also to redeem 
his lands and pay his debts, conditionally that so soon as his debts were 
paid, that he should give himself freely to me  to this, here is his hand '-
showing him the bond. 'Now, my time is expired, for all his debts are paid, 
which he cannot deny.' 'This case is plain, if it be so that his debts are 
paid.' His silence confirms it,' said the devil, 'therefore give him a just 
sentence.' ' I will,' said Friar Bacon, 'but first tell me, '-speaking to 
the gentleman-' didst thou never yet give the devil any of his money back, 
nor requite him in any ways?' 'Never had he anything of me as yet,' answered 
the gentleman. 'Then never let him have anything of thee. and thou art free. 
Deceiver of man-kind,' said he, speaking to the devil, 'it was thy bargain 
never to meddle with him so long as he was indebted to any; now how canst 
thou demand of him anything when he is indebted for all that he hath to 
thee? When he payeth thee thy money, then take him as thy due; till then 
thou hast nothing to do with him, and so I charge thee to be gone.' At this 
the devil vanished with great horror, but Friar Bacon comforted the 
gentleman, and sent him home with a quiet conscience, bidding him never to 
pay the devil's money back, as he valued his own safety."
     Bacon now met with a companion, Friar Bungay, whose tastes and pursuits 
were congenial to his own, and with his assistance he undertook the exploit 
for which he was most famous. He had a fancy that he would defend England. 
against its enemies, by walling it with brass, preparatory to which they 
made a head of that metal. Their intent was to make the head speak, for 
which purpose they raised a spirit in a wood, by whose direction" they made 
a fumi-gation, to which the head was to be exposed during a month, and to be 
carefully watched, because if the two friars did not hear it before it had 
ceased speaking, their labour would be lost. Accordingly, the care of 
watching over the head while they slept was entrusted to Bacon's man Miles, 
The period of utterance unfortunately came while Miles was watching. The 
head suddenly uttered the two words, "Time is." Miles thought it was 
unnecessary to disturb his master for such a brief speech, and sat still, In 
half an hour, the head again broke silence with the words, "Time was." Still 
Miles waited until, in another half hour, the head said, "Time is past," and 
fell to the ground with a terrible noise. Thus, through the negligence of 
Miles, the labour of the two friars was thrown away.
     The king soon required Friar Bacon's services, and the latter enabled 
him, by his perspective and burning-glasses, to take a town which he was 
besieging. In consequence of this success, the kings of England and France 
made peace, and a grand court was held, at which the German conjurer, 
Vandermast, was brought to try his skill against Bacon. Their performances 
were something in the style of Bacon's former exhibition before the king and 
queen. Vandermast, in revenge, sent a soldier to kill Bacon., but. in vain. 
Next follow a series of adventures which consist of a few medieval stories 
very clumsily put together among which are that known as the Friar and the 
Boy, that which appeared in Scottish verse, under the title of The Friars of 
Berwick, a tale taken from the Gesta Romanorum, and some others. A 
contention in magic between Vander-mast and Bungay, ended in the deaths of 
both. The servant Miles next turned conjurer, having got hold of one of 
Bacon's books, and escaped with a dreadful fright, and a broken leg. 
Everything now seemed to go wrong. Friar Bacon " had a glass which was of 
that excellent nature that any man might behold anything that he desired to 
see within the compass of fifty miles round about him."  In this glass he 
used to show people what their relations and friends were doing, or where 
they' were. One day two young gentlemen. of high birth came to look into the 
glass, and they beheld their fathers desperately fighting together, upon 
which they drew their swords and slew each other. Bacon was so shocked that 
he broke his glass, and hearing about the same time of the deaths of 
Vandermast and Bungay, he became melancholy, and at length he burnt his 
books of magic, distributed his wealth among poor scholars and others, and 
became an anchorite. Thus ended the life of Friar Bacon, according to "the 
famous history," which probably owed most of its incidents to the 
imagination of the writer.

Bacoti : A common name for the augurs and sorcerers of Tonquin. They are 
often consulted by the friends of deceased persons for the purpose of 
holding communication with them.

Baekstrom, Dr. Sigismund : (See Rosicrucians).

Bad : A Jinn of Persia who is supposed to have command over the wind". and 
tempests. He presides over the twenty-second day of the month.

Badger : To bury the foot of a -badger underneath one's sleeping-place is 
believed by the Voodoo worshippers and certain Gypsy tribes to excite or 
awaken love.

Bael : A demon cited in the Grand Grimoire (q.v.). and head of the infernal 
powers. It is with him that Wierius com-mences his inventory of the famous 
Pseudonomarchia Daemonum. He alludes to Bael as the first monarch of hell, 
and says that his estates are situated on the eastern regions thereof. He 
has three heads, one, that of a crab, another that of a cat. and the third 
that of a man. Sixty-six legions obey him.

Bagoe :  A pythoness, who is believed to have been the Erithryean sibyl. She 
is said to have been the first woman to have practiced the diviner's art. 
She practised in Tuscany. and judged all events by the sound of thunder.

Bagommedes : a knight mentioned by Gautier in the Conte du Graal.  It is 
said that he was fastened to a tree by Kay and left hanging head downwards, 
until released by Perceval. On Bagommede’s return to the court he challenged 
Kay, but was prevented by Arthur from slaying him.

Bahaman : A jinn who, according to - Persian tradition, appeased anger. and 
in consequence governed oxen, sheep. and all animals of a peaceful 
disposition.

Bahir : ("Brightness.") A mystical Hebrew treatise of the twelfth or 
thirteenth century. the work of a French rabbi, by name Isaac ben Abraham of 
Posquieres. commonly called " Isaac the Blind."  (See Kabala).

Balan : son of Simeon, King of the Bulgarians. and a mighty magician. who 
could transform himself into a wolf whenever he desired. He could also adopt 
other shapes and render himself invisible. He is alluded to by Ninauld in 
his Lycantropie (page 100).

Balan : A monarch great and terrible among the infernal powers. according to 
Wierius. He has three heads, those of a bull, a man, and a ram. Joined to 
these is the tail of a serpent, the eyes of which burn with fire. He be-
strides an enormous bear. He commands forty of the infernal legions. and 
rules over finesse, roses and middle courses.

Balaslus : To describe this stone in fewer words than I,eonardus has used 
would be impossible. It is "of a purple or rosy colour, and by some is 
called the placidus or pleasant. Some think it is the carbuncle diminished 
in its colour and virtue ; just as the virtue of the female differs from 
that of the male. It is often found that the external part of one and the 
same stone appears a balasius, and the internal a carbuncle, from whence 
comes the saying that the balasius is the carbuncle's house. The virtue of 
the balasius is to overcome and repress vain thoughts and luxury; to 
reconcile quarrels among friends; and it be-friends the human body with a 
good habit of health. Being bruised and drunk with water, it relieves 
infirmities in the eyes, and gives help in disorders of the liver; and what
is still more surprising, if you touch the four corners of a house, garden 
or vineyard, with the balasius, it will preserve them from lightning, 
tempest. and worms."

Balcoin, Marie : a sorceress of the country of Labour, who attended the 
infernal Sabbath in the reign of Henry IV of France. In the indictment 
against her it was brought forward that she had eaten at the Sabbatic 
meeting the ear of a little child. For her numerous sorceries she was 
condemned to be burnt.

Balkan Peninsula : (See Slavs; Greece, Modern; Vampire, etc.)

Ballou, Adin :  A Universalist  minister who in 1842 formed the Hopedale 
Community (q.v.). He was one of those whose doctrines prepared the way for 
spiritualism in America, and who, after that movement had been in-augurated, 
became one of its most enthusiastic protago-nists (See America, U.S. of).

Balor : a mighty King of the Formorians, usually styled “Balor of the Evil 
Eye." in Irish mythical tales. It was believed that he was able to destroy 
by means of an angry glance. When his eyelid became heavy with years, it is 
said that he had it raised by means of ropes and pulleys, so that he might 
continue to make use of his magical gift; but his grandson, Lugh, the Sun-
god, crept near him one day when his eyelid had drooped momentarily, and 
slew him with a great stone which sank through his eye and brain.

Balsamo, Peter : (See Cagliostro).

Baltazo : One of the demons who possessed a young woman of Laon, Nicole 
Aubry, in the year 1566. He went to sup with her husband, under the pretext 
of freeing her from demon-possession. which he did not accomplish. It was 
observed that at supper he did not drink, which shows that demons are averse 
to water.

Baltus, Jean Francois : A learned Jesuit who died in 1743. In his Reply go 
the History of the Oracles of Fontenelle, pub-lished in Strasbourg in 1709, 
he affirmed that the oracles of the ancients were the work of demons, and 
that they were reduced to silence during the mission of Christ upon the 
earth.

Banshee : An Irish supernatural being of the wraith type. The name implies 
"female fairy." She is usually the possession of a specific family. to a 
member or members of whom she appears before the death of one of them. Mr. 
Thistleton Dyer, writing on the Banshee says:
     “Unlike, also, many of the legendary beliefs of this kind, the popular 
accounts illustrative of it are related on the evidence of all sections of 
the community. many an en-lightened and well-informed advocate being 
enthusiastic in his vindication of its reality. It would seem, however, that 
no family which is not of an ancient and noble stock is honoured with this 
visit of the Banshee, and hence its non-appearance has been regarded as an 
indication of disqualification in this respect on the part of the person 
about to die. ' If I am rightly informed,' writes Sir Walter Scott, 'the 
distinction of a Banshee is only allowed to families of the pure Milesian 
stock, and is never ascribed to any descendant of the proudest Norman or the 
boldest Saxon who followed the banner of Strongbow, much less to adventurers 
of later dates who have obtained settlements in the Green Isle.' Thus, an 
amusing story is contained in an Irish elegy to the effect that on the death 
of one of the Knights of Kerry, when the Banshee was heard to lament his 
decease at Dingle-a seaport town, the property of those knights-all the 
merchants of this place were thrown into a state of alarm lest the mournful 
and ominous wailing should be a forewarning of the death of one of them, 
but, as the poet humorously points out, there was no necessity for them to 
be anxious on this point. Although, through misfortune, a family may be 
brought down from high estate to the rank of peasant tenants, the Banshee 
never leaves nor forgets it till the last member has been gathered to his 
fathers in the churchyard. The Mac-Carthys, O'Flahertys, Magraths, O'Neils, 
O'Rileys, O'Sulll-vans, O'Reardons, have their Banshees, though many 
representatives of these names are in abject poverty.
     “The Banshee,' says Mr. McAnally, 'is really a dis-embodied soul, that 
of one who in life was strongly at-tached to the family, or who had good 
reason to hate all its members. Thus, in different instances, the Banshee's 
song may be inspired by different motives. When the Banshee loves those she 
calls, the song is a low, soft chant, giving notice, indeed, of the close 
proximity of the angel of death, but with a tenderness of tone that 
reassures the one destined to die and comforts the survivors; rather a 
welcome than a warning, and having in its tones a thrill of exultation, as 
though the messenger spirit were bringing glad tidings to him summoned to 
join the waiting throng of his ancestors.' To a doomed member of the family 
of the O'Reardons the Banshee generally appears in the form of a beautiful 
woman, 'and sings a song so sweetly solemn as to reconcile him to his 
approaching fate.' But if, during his lifetime the Banshee was an enemy of 
the family, the cry is the scream of a fiend, howling with demoniac delight 
over the coming death agony of another of his foes.
     “Hence, in Ireland, the hateful 'Banshee ' is a source of dread to many 
a family against which she has an enmity. 'It appears,' adds McAnally, 'that 
a noble family, whose name is still familiar in Mayo, is attended by a 
Banshee of this description-the spirit of a young girl, deceived, and 
afterwards murdered by a former head of the family. With her dying breath 
she cursed her murderer, and promised she would attend him and his forever. 
After many years the chieftain reformed his ways, and his youthful crime was 
almost forgotten even by himself, when one night, as he and his family were 
seated by the fire, the most terrible shrieks were suddenly heard outside 
the castle walls. All ran out, but saw nothing. During the night the screams 
continued as though the castle were besieged by demons. and the unhappy man 
recognised in the cry of the Banshee the voice of the young girl he had 
murdered. The next night he was assassinated by one of his follower', when 
again the wild unearthly screams were heard exulting over his fate. Since 
that night the 'hateful Banshee' has, it is said, never failed to notify the 
family, with shrill cries of revengeful gladness, when the time of one of 
their number has arrived."
     "Among some of the recorded instances of the Banshee's appearance may 
be mentioned one related by Miss Lefrau, the niece of Sheridan, in the 
Memoirs of her grandmother, Mr. Frances Sheridan. From this account we 
gather that Miss Elizabeth Sheridan was a firm believer in the Banshee, and 
firmly maintained that the one attached to the Sheri-dan family was 
distinctly heard lamenting beneath the windows of the family residence 
before the news arrived from France of Mrs. Frances Sheridan's death at 
Blois. She added that a niece of Miss Sheridan made her very angry by 
observing that as Mrs. Frances Sheridan was by birth a Chamberlaine, a 
family of English extraction, she had no right to the guardianship of an 
Irish fairy, and that therefore the Banshee must have made a mistake. Then 
there is the well-known case related by Lady Fanshawe who tells us how, when 
on a visit in Ireland, she was a-wakened at midnight by a loud scream 
outside her window. On looking out she saw a young and rather handsome 
woman, with dishevelled hair, who vanished before her eyes with another 
shriek. On communicating the circum-stance in the morning, her host replied, 
'A near relation of mine died last night in the castle, and before such an 
event happens, the female spectre whom you have seen is always visible."
     "This weird apparition is generally supposed to assume the form of a 
woman, sometimes young, but more often old. She is usually attired in a 
loose white drapery, and her long ragged locks hang over her thin shoulders. 
As night time approaches she occasionally becomes visible, and pours forth 
her mournful wail-a sound said to re-semble the melancholy moaning of the 
wind. Oftentimes she is not seen. but only heard, yet she is supposed to be 
always clearly discernible to the person upon whom she specially waits. 
Respecting the history of the Banshee, popular tradition in many instances 
accounts for its pres-ence as the spirit of some mortal woman whose 
destinies have become linked by some accident with those of the family she 
follows. It is related how the Banshee of the family of the O'Briens of 
Thomond was originally a woman who had been seduced by one of the chiefs of 
that race-an act of indiscretion which ultimately brought about her death."

Baphomet : The goat-idol of the Templars (q.v.) and the deity of the 
sorcerers' Sabbath. The name is composed of three abbreviations: Tem. ohp. 
Ab, Templi omnium hominum pacis abhas, "the father of the temple of uni-
versal peace among men." Some authorities hold that the Baphomet was a 
monstrous head, others that it was a demon in the form of a goat. An account 
of a veritable Baphometic idol is as follows: "A pantheistic and magical 
figure of the Absolute. The torch placed between the two horns, represents 
the equilbrating intelligence of the triad. The goat's head, which is 
synthetic, and unites some 
char-acteristics of the dog, bull, and ass, represents the exclusive 
responsibility of matter and the expiation of bodily sins in the body. The 
hands are human, to exhibit the sanctity of labour; they make the sign of 
esotericism above and below, to impress mystery on initiates, and they point 
at two lunar crescents, the upper being white and the lower black, to 
explain the correspondences of good and evil, mercy and justice. The lower 
part of the body is veiled, portraying the mysteries of universal 
generation, which is expressed solely by the symbol of the caduceus. The 
belly of the goat is scaled and should be coloured green, the semicircle 
above should be blue; the plumage, reaching to the breast, should be of 
various hues. The goat has female breasts, and thus its only human 
characteristics are those of maternity and toil, otherwise the signs of 
redemption. On its forehead, between the horns and beneath the torch, is the 
sign of the microcosm, or the pentagram with one beam in the ascendant, 
symbol of human intelligence, which, placed thus below the torch, makes the 
flame of the latter an image of divine revelation. This Pantheos should be 
seated on a cube, and its foot-stool should be a single ball, or a ball and 
a triangular stool."
     Wright (Narratives of Sorcery and Magic), writing on the Baphomet says 
:-" Another charge in the accusation of the Templars seems to have been to a 
great degree proved by the depositions of witnesses; the idol or head which 
they are said to have worshipped, but the real character or meaning of which 
we are totally unable to explain. Many Templars confessed to having seen 
this idol, but as they described it differently, we must suppose that it was 
not in all cases represented under the same form. Some said it was a 
frightful head, with long beard and sparkling eyes; others said it was a 
man's skull; some described it as having three faces; some said it was of 
wood, and others of metal; one witness described it as a painting (tabula 
picta) representing the image a man (imago hominis) and said that when it 
was shown to him, he was ordered to 'adore Christ, his creator.' According 
to some it was a gilt figure, either of wood or metal; while others 
described it as painted black and white. According to another deposition, 
the idol had four feet, two before and two behind; the one belonging to the 
order at Paris, was said to be a silver head, with two faces and a beard. 
The novices of the order were told always to regard this idol as their 
saviour. Deodatus Jaffet, a knight from the south of France, who had been 
received at Pedenat, deposed that the person who in his case performed the 
ceremonies of reception, showed him a head or idol, which appeared to have 
three faces, and said, 'You must adore this as your saviour, and the saviour 
of the order of the Temple' and that he was made to worship the idol, 
saying, 'Blessed be he who shall save my soul.' Cettus Ragonis, a knight 
received at Rome in a chamber of the palace of the Lateran, gave a somewhat 
similar account. Many other witnesses spoke of having seen these heads, 
which, however, were, perhaps, not shown to everybody, for the greatest 
number of those who spoke on this subject, said that they had heard speak of 
the head, but that they had never seen it themselves; and many of them 
declared their disbelief in its existence. A friar minor deposed in England 
that an English Templar had assured him that in that country the order had 
four principal idols, one at London, in the Sacristy of the Temple, another 
at Bristelham, a third at Brueria (Bruern in Lincolnshire), and a fourth 
beyond the Humber.
     "Some of the knights from the south added another circumstance in their 
confessions relating to this head. A templar of Florence, declared that, in 
the secret meetings of the chapters, one brother said to the others, showing 
them the idol, 'Adore this head. This head is your God and your Mahomet.' 
Another, Gauserand de Montpesant, said that the idol was made in the. figure 
of Baffomet (in figuram Baffometi); and another, Raymond Rubei, de-scribed 
it as a wooden head, on which was painted the figure of Baphomet, and he 
adds, 'that he worshipped it by kissing its feet, and exclaiming Xalla,' 
which he describes as 'a word of the Saracens' (verbum Saracenorum). This 
has been seized upon by some as a proof that the Templars had secretly 
embraced Mahometanism, as Baffomet or Baphomet is evidently a corruption of 
Mahomet; but it must not be forgotten that the Christians of the West 
constantly used the word Mahomst in the mere signification of an idol, and 
that it was the desire of those who conducted the prosecution against the 
Templars to show their intimate intercourse with the Saracens. Others, 
especially Von Hammer, gave a Greek derivation of the word, and assumed it 
as a proof that gnosticism was the secret doctrine of the temple      

Baptism : It was said that at the witches' Sabbath children and toads were 
baptised with certain horrible rites. This was called the baptism of the 
devil.

Baptism of the line : A curious rite is performed on persons crossing the 
equator for the first time. The sailors who are to carry it out dress 
themselves in quaint costumes. The Father of the Line arrives in a cask, 
accompanied by a courier, a devil, a hair-dresser, and a miller. The un-
fortunate passenger has his hair curled, is liberally sprinkled with flour, 
and then has water showered upon him, if he is not ducked. The origin of 
this custom is not known, nor is it quite clear what part the devil plays in 
it. It is said, however, that it may be averted by tipping the sailors.

Baquet : A large circular tub which entered largely into the treatment which 
D'Eslon, the friend and follower of Mesmer, prescribed for his patients. 
Puysegur tells us in his book Du Maqnitisme Animal, that in the baquet were 
placed some bottles, arranged in a particular manner, and partly covered 
with water. It was fitted with a lid in which were several holes, through 
which parsed iron rods, connecting the patients, who sat round the contri-
vance, with the interior of the tub. The operator was armed with a shorter 
iron rod. While the patients waited for the symptoms of the magnetic 
treatment, someone played upon a pianoforte, a device which is frequently 
adopted at seances. The symptoms included violent con-vulsions, cries, 
laughter, and vomiting. This state they called the crisis, and it was 
supposed to hasten the healing process. A commission appointed in 1784 by 
the French government through the Faculte de Medecine and the Societe royale 
de Medecine, reported that such practices were exceedingly dangerous, and in 
nowise proved the existence of the magnetic fluid. Dr. Bell a " professor of 
animal magnetism" set up a similar institution in England in 1785, using a 
large oak baquet.

Bar-Lgura : (Semitic demon)  Sits on the roofs of houses and leaps on the 
inhabitants. People so afflicted are called d'baregara.

Barqu : A demon in whose keeping was the secret of the Philosophers' stone.

Barguest, the : A goblin or phantom of a mischievous character, so named 
from his habit of sitting on bars or gates. It is said that he can make 
himself visible in the day time. Rich in the Encyclopaedia Metropolitana 
relates a story of a lady, whom he knew, who had been brought up in the 
country. She had been passing through the fields one morning, when a girl, 
and saw, as she thought, someone sitting on a stile: however, as she drew 
near, it vanished.

Barnaud, Nicholas : A medical doctor of the sixteenth century who claimed to 
have discovered the Philosophers' Stone. He published a great number of 
short treatises on the subject of Alchemy, which are contained in the third 
volume of the Theatrum Chimicum of Zetzner, pub-lished at Strasburg, in 
1659.

Baron Chacs : (See Busardiar.)

Bartholomew : (See Dee.)

Barn : Caste of priests. (See Semites.)

Basil  : an astrologer. (See Italy.)

Basilideans : A gnostic sect founded by Basilides of Alexandria, who claimed 
to hove received his esoteric doctrines from Glaucus, a disciple of the 
Apostle Peter. The system had three grades - material, intellectual, and 
spiritual, and possessed two allegorical statues, male and female. The 
doctrine had many points of resemblance to that of the Ophites (q.v.), and 
ran on the lines of Jewish Kabalism.

Bassantin, James : a Scottish astrologer, the son of the Laird of Bassantin, 
in the Merse, was born in the reign of James IV. ; and, after studying 
mathematics at the University of Glasgow, he travelled for farther 
information on the Continent. He subsequently went to Paris, where for some 
years he taught mathematics in the University. He returned to Scotland in 
1562. The prevailing belief of that age, particularly in France, was a 
belief in judicial astrology. In his way home through England, as we learn 
from Sir James Melville's Memoirs, he met with his brother, Sir Robert 
Melville, who was at that time engaged, on the part of the unfortunate Mary, 
in endeavouring to effect a meeting between her and Elizabeth; when he 
predicted that all his efforts would be in vain; " for, first, they will 
never meit together, and next, there will neuer be bot discembling and 
secret hattrent (hatred) for a whyle, and at length captivity and utter wrak 
for our Quen by England." Melville's answer was, that he could not credit 
such news, which he looked upon as "false, ungodly, and unlawful;" on which 
Bassantin replied, "Sa far as Me-lanthon, wha was a godly thologue, has 
declared and written anent the naturall scyences, that are lawfull and daily 
red in dyvers Christian Universities; in the quhilkis, as in all other 
artis, God gives to some less, to some mair and clearer knawledge than till 
othirs; be the quhilk knawledge I have also that at length, that the kingdom 
of England sall of rycht fall to the crown of Scotland, and that ther are 
some born at this instant that sall bruik lands and heritages in England. 
Bot, alace, it will cost many their lyves, and many bluidy battailes will be 
fouchen first, and the Spaniatris will be helpers, and will take a part to 
themselves for their labours." The first part of Bassantin's prediction, 
which he might very well have hazarded from what he may have known of 
Elizabeth's character and disposition, and also from the fact that Mary was 
the next heir to the English throne, proved true. Bassantin was a zealous 
Protestant and a supporter of the Regent Moray.  He died in 1568.  His 
principal work is a Treatise or Discourse on Astronomy, written in French, 
which was translated into Latin by John Tornasesius (M. de Tournes), and 
published at Geneva in 1599. He wrote four other treatises. Although well 
versed for his time in what are called the exact sciences, Bassantin, or, as 
his name is sometimes spelt, Bassantoun, had received no part of a classical 
education. Vossius observes, that his Astro-nomical Discourse was written in 
very bad French, and that the author knew  neither Greek nor Latin, but only 
Scots." Bassantin's Planetary  System was that of Ptolemy.

Bat : There is an Oriental belief that the bat is specially adapted to 
occult uses. In the Tyrol it is believed that the man who wears the left eye 
of a bat may become in-visible, and in Hesse he who wears the heart of a bat 
bound to his arm with red thread will always be lucky at cards.
(See Chagrin).

Bataille, Dr.: Author of Le Diable au XIX. Siecle. Under the pseudonym of 
Dr. Hecks he purports to have wit-nessed the secret rites and orgies of many 
diabolic societies, but a merely perfunctory examination of his work is 
suffi-cient to brand it as wholly an effort of the imagination.

Bathym, also called Marthim : a duke of the Infernal Regions. He has the 
appearance of a robust man, says Wierius, but his body ends in a serpent's 
tail. He be-strides a steed of livid colour. He is well versed in the 
virtues of herbs and precious stones. He is able to trans-port men from one 
place to another with wondrous speed. Thirty legions obey his behests.

Baton, the Devil's : There is preserved in the marche d' Ancune, Tolentino, 
a baton which it is said that the devil used.

Battle of Loquifer, The : a tale incorporated in the Charlemagne saga, 
supposed to have been written about the twelfth century. Its hero is 
Renouart, the giant brother-in-law of William of Orange, and the events take 
place on the sea. Renouart and his barons are on the shore at Porpaillart, 
when a Saracen fleet is seen. He is persuaded to enter one of the ships, 
which immediately set sail; and he is told by Isembert, a hideous monster, 
that the Saracens mean to flay him alive. Renouart, armed only with a huge 
bar of wood, kills this creature, and makes the Saracens let him go, while 
they return to their own country. It is arranged that Renouart will fight 
one Loquifer, a fairy giant and leader of the Saracens; and on the issue of 
this combat the war will depend. They meet on an island near Porpaillart.  
Loquifer is-in pos-session of a magical balm, which heals all his wounds im-
mediately, and is concealed in his club; but Renouart, who is assisted by 
angels, at length succeeds in depriving Loquifer of his club, so that his 
strength departs. Renouart slays him, and the devil carries off his soul. 
The romance goes on to tell of a duel between William of Orange and Desrame, 
Renouart's father, in which the latter is slain. Renouart is comforted by 
fairies, who bear him to Avalon where he has many adventures. He is finally 
wrecked, but is rescued by mermaids, and awakes to find himself on the sands 
at Porpaillart, from which spot he had been taken to Avalon.

Bauer, George : who Latinized his name (a boor or hus-bandman) into 
"Agricola," was born in the province of Misnia, in 1494. An able and 
industrious man, he acquired a considerable knowledge of the principles of 
medicine, which led him, as it led his contemporaries, to search for the 
elixir vitae and the Philosopher's Stone. A treatise on these interesting 
subjects, which he published at Cologne in 1531, secured him the favour of 
Duke Maurice of Saxony, who appointed him the superintendent of his silver-
mines at Chemnitz. In this post he obtained a practical ac-quaintance with 
the properties of metals which dissipated his wild notions of their possible 
transmutation into gold; but if he abandoned one superstition he adopted 
another, and from the legends of the miners imbibed a belief in the 
existence of good and evil spirits in the bowels of the earth, and in the 
creation of explosive gases and fire-damp by the malicious agency of the 
latter. Bauer died in 1555.

Bave : Daughter of the wizard Calatin. She figures in the famous Irish 
legend The Cattle Raid of Quelgny. By taking the form of one of Niam's 
handmaids she succeeded in enticing her away from Cuchulin, and led her 
forth to wander in the woods.

Bayemon : The grimoire of Pope Honorius gives this name as that of a 
powerful demon whom it addresses as monarch of the western parts of the 
Infernal Regions. To him the following invocation is addressed: "O King 
Bayemon, most mighty, who reigneth towards the western parts, I call upon 
thee and invoke thy name in the name of the Divinity. I command thee in the 
name of the Most High to present thyself before this circle, thee and the 
other spirits who are thy subjects. in the name of Passiel and Rosus, for 
the purpose of replying to all that which I demand of thee. If thou dost not 
come I will torment thee with a sword of heavenly fire. I will augment thy 
pains and burn thee. Obey, O King Bayemon.

Bealings Bells : In February, 1834, a mysterious outbreak of bell-ringing 
was heard at the residence of Major Moor, F. R.S.,-Bealings, near 
Woodbridge, Suffolk. From the 2nd of February to the 27th of March the bells 
of the house rang at frequent intervals, and without any visible agency. The 
Major meanwhile took careful note of the condition of the atmosphere, state 
of the wires, and any physical cause which might affect the bells, but, as 
Mr. Podmore justly points out, he omitted to take precautions against 
trickery in his own household, and has not even left on record the names of 
its members, or any facts concerning them.

Beans : A forbidden article of diet. The consumption of beans was prohibited 
by Pythagoras and Plato to those who desire veracious dreams, as they tend 
to inflate; and for the purpose of truthful dreaming, the animal nature must 
be made to lie quiet. Cicero, however, laughs at this discipline, asking if 
it be the stomach and not the mind with which one dreams?

Bearded Demon : The demon who teaches the secret of the Philosophers' Stone. 
He is but little known. The demon barbu is not to be confused with Barbatos, 
a great and powerful demon who is a duke in Hades, though not a philosopher; 
nor with Barbas, who is interested in mechanics. It is said that the bearded 
demon is so called on account of his remarkable beard. 

Beaumont, John : Author of a Tretise on Spirits, Apparitions, etc., 
published in 1705. He is described as “a man of hyprochondriacal 
disposition, with a considerable degree of reading, but with a strong bias 
to credulity.” Labouring under the affection, he saw hundreds of imaginary 
men and women about him, though, as he adds. he never saw anything in the 
night-time, unless by fire or candlelight, or in the moonshine. "I had two 
spirits," he says, "who constantly attended me, night and day. for above 
three months together, who called each other by their names; and several 
spirits would call at my chamber door, and ask whether such spirits lived 
there, and they would answer they did. As for the other spirits that 
attended me, I heard none of their names mentioned only I asked one spirit, 
which came for some nights to-gether, and rung a little bell in my ear, what 
his name was, who answered Ariel. The two spirits that constantly attended 
myself appeared both in women's habit, they being of a brown complexion, 
about three feet in stature; they had both black loose net-work gowns, tied 
with a black sash about the middle, and within the net-work appeared a gown 
of a golden colour, with somewhat of a light striking through it. Their 
heads were not dressed in top-knots, but they had white linen caps on, with 
lace on them about three fingers' breadth, and over it they had a black 
loose net-work hood."
     "I would not," he says, "for the whole world, undergo what I have 
undergone, upon spirits coming twice to me; their first coming was most 
dreadful to me, the thing being then altogether new, and consequently most 
surprising, Bees though at the first coming they did not appear to me but 
only called to me at my chamber-windows, rung bells, sung to me, and played 
on music, etc.; but the last coming also carried terror enough; for when 
they came, being only five in number, the two women before mentioned, and 
three men (though afterwards there came hundreds), they told me they would 
hill me if I told any person in the house of their being there, which put me 
in some con-sternation; and I made a servant sit up with me four nights in 
my chamber, before a fire, it being in the Christ-mas holidays, telling no 
person of their being there. One of these spirits, in women's dress, lay 
down upon the bed by me every night; and told me, if I slept, the spirits 
would kill me, which kept me waking for three nights. In the meantime, a 
near relation of mine went (though unknown to me) to a physician of my 
acquaintance, de-siring him to prescribe me somewhat for sleeping, which he 
did, and a sleeping potion was brought me; but I set it by, being very 
desirous and inclined to sleep without it. The fourth night I could hardly 
forbear sleeping; but the spirit, lying on the bed by me, told me again, I 
should be killed if I slept; whereupon I rose and Sat by the fireside, and 
in a while returned to my bed; and so I did a third time, but was still 
threatened as before; whereupon I grew impatient, and asked the spirits what 
they would have? Told them I had done the part of a Christian, in humbling 
myself to God, and feared them not; and rose from my bed. took a cane, and 
knocked at the ceiling of my chamber, a near relation of mine then lying 
over me, who presently rose and came down to me about two o'clock in the 
morn-ing to whom I said, "You have seen me disturbed these four days past, 
and that I have not slept: the occasion of it was, that five spirits, which 
are now in the room with me, have threatened to kill me if I told any person 
of their being here, or if I slept; but I am not able to forbear sleep-ing 
longer, and acquaint you with it, and now stand in defiance of them; and 
thus I exerted myself about them and notwithstanding their continued threats 
I slept very well the next night, and continued to do so, though they 
continued with me above three months, day and night." 

Beausoleil, Jean du Chatelot, Baron de : German min-eralogist and alchemist, 
who lived during the first half of the seventeenth century. He travelled 
over most European countries looking for metals with the aid of a divining 
ring. In 1626 his instruments were seized under the pretext that
they were bewitched, and he himself imprisoned in the Bas-tille, where he 
died in 1645. In 1617 he published a work entitled Diorisinus, id est 
definitis verae philisophiae de materia prima lapidis philosophalis. 
Beausoleil was the greatest of French metallurgists of his time.

Bechard : A demon alluded to in the Key of Solomon as having power over the 
winds and the tempests. He makes hail, thunder and rain.

Bed : Graham's Magnetic  A magnetic contrivance made use of by one Graham, 
physician and magnetist of Edin-burgh. His whole house, which he termed the 
Temple of Hygeia, was of great magnificence, but particularly did splendour 
prevail in the room wherein was set the magnetic bed. The bed itself rested 
on six transparent pillars ; the mattresses were soaked with oriental 
perfumes; the bed-clothes were of satin, in tints of purple and sky-blue. A 
healing stream of magnetism, as well as fragrant and strengthening 
medicines, were introduced into the sleeping apartment through glass tubes 
and cylinders. To these attractions were added the soft strains of hidden 
flutes, harmonicons, and a large organ. Permission to use this celestial 
couch, so soothing to shattered nerves, was ac-corded only to those who sent 
a written application to its owner, inclosing £50 sterling.

Bees : It is maintained by certain demonologists that if a sorceress ate a 
queen-bee before being captured, she would be able to sustain her trial and 
tortures without making a confession. In some parts of Brittany it is 
claimed for these insects that they are very sensitive to the fortunes and 
misfortunes of their master, and will not thrive unless he is careful to tie 
a piece of black cloth to the hive when a death occurs in the family, and a 
piece of red cloth when there is any occasion of rejoicing. So Linus writes 
that there are no bees in Ireland, and even if a little Irish earth be taken 
to another country. and spread about the hives, the bees will be forced to 
abandon the place, so fatal to them is the earth of Ireland. The same story 
is found in the Origines of Isodore. "Must we seek," says Lebrun, "the 
source of this calumny of Irish earth? No; for it is sufficient to say that 
it is a fable, and that many bees are to be found in Ireland."

Belin, Albert : A Benedictine, born at Besancon in 1610. His principal works 
are a treaty on talismans and a dis-sertation upon astral figures, published 
at Paris in 1671, and again in 1709. He also wrote Sympathetic Powder 
Justified, an alchemical work, and Adventures of an Un-hnown Philosopher in 
the search for and the manufacture of the Philosopher's Stone. This latter 
work is divided into four books and speaks very clearly of the manner in 
which the stone is made.  (Paris, 1664 and 1674).
Bell, Dr.: (See Spiritualism.)

Belle-Fleur, La : (See Antichrist.)

Bellenden, Sir Lewis :  (See Scotland.)

Belli Paaro : A secret society of Liberia, Africa, the cult of which 
consists in a description of brotherhood with departed spirits. Dapper, an 
early author, says of this society: "They have also another custom which 
they call Belti Paaro, of which they say it is a death, a new birth and an 
incorporation in the community of spirits or soul with whom the common folk 
associate in the bush, and help to eat the offerings prepared for the 
spirits." This description is far from clear, but it is obvious enough that 
those who join the society desire to be regarded as spirit-ualised, or as 
having died and having been brought to life again; and that their society is 
nothing more than a con-fraternity of all those who have passed through this 
training in common.

Belloc, Jeanne : A sorceress of the district of Labour, in France, who in 
the reign of Henry IV. was indicted for sorcery at the age of 84 years. In 
answer to Pierre Delancre who interrogated her, she stated that she 
commenced to repair to the sabbatic meetings of Satan in the winter of the 
year 1609, that she was there presented to the Devil who kissed her, a mark 
of approbation which he bestowed upon the greatest sorcerers only. She 
related that the Sabbath was a species of bal masque, to which some came in 
their ordinary forms, whilst others joined the dance in the guise of dogs 
cats, donkeys, pigs and other animals.

Belocolus : A white stone with a black pupil, said to render its bearer 
invisible in a field of battle.

Belomancy : The method of divination by arrows, dates as far back as the age 
of the Chaldeans. It existed among the Greeks, and still later among the 
Arabians. The manner in which the latter practised it is described else-
where,. and they continued its use though forbidden by the Koran. Another 
method deserves mention. This was to throw a certain number of arrows into 
the air, and the direction in which the arrow inclined as it fell, pointed 
out the course to be taken by the inquirer. Divination by arrows is the same 
in principle as Rhabdomancy (q.v.).


Belphegor : The demon of discoveries and ingenious inventions. He appears 
always in the shape of a young woman. The Moabites, who called him 
Baalphegor, adored him on Mount Phegor. He it is who bestows riches.

Benedict IX.: At a time when the papacy was much abused - about the tenth 
and eleventh centuries, the papal crown was more than once offered for sale. 
Thus the office fell into the hands of a high and ambitious family who held 
it for a boy of twelve - Benedict IX. As he grew older the boy lost no 
opportunity of disgracing his position by his depraved mode of life. But, 
like his predecessors in the papal chair, he excelled in sorcery and various 
forms of magic. One of the most curious stories concerning him tells how he 
made the Roman matrons follow him over hill and dale, through forests and 
across rivers, by the charm of his magic, as though he were a sort of Pied 
Piper.

Benemmerinnen :  Hebrew witches who haunt women in childbirth for the 
purpose of stealing new-born infants.

Benjees, The : A people of the East Indies, given over to the worship of the 
Devil; and whose temples and pagodas are filled with horrible statues of 
him. The king of Calicut had a temple wholly filled with awful figures of 
the devil, and which was lighted only with the gleam of many lamps. In the 
centre was a copper throne, on which was seated a devil,. made of the same 
metal, with a large tiara on his head, three huge horns and four others 
which come out of his forehead. On his tongue and in his hand were two 
figures-souls, which the Indians say, he’s preparing to devour.

Bensozia : According to Don Martin in his Religion de Gaulois, " chief 
deviless" of a certain Sabbatic meeting held in France in the twelfth and 
thirteenth centuries. She was, he says, the Diana of the ancient Gauls, and 
was also called Nocticula, Herodias, and "The Moon." One finds in the 
manuscripts of the church at Couserans. that the ladies of the fourteenth 
century were said to go on horseback to the nocturnal revelries of Bensozia. 
All of them were forced to inscribe their names in a Sabbatic catalogue 
along with those of the sorcerers proper, and after this ceremony they 
believed themselves to be fairies. There was found at Montmorillon in 
Poitou, in the eighteenth century, a portion of an ancient temple, a bas--
relief with the figure of a naked woman carved upon it, and it is not 
unlikely, thinks Collin de Plancy, that this figure was the original deity 
of the Bensozia cult.

Beowulf : an Anglo-Saxon saga of great interest. The events in this poem 
probably took place about the fifth century. Beowulf, himself, was most 
likely one of the Sons of Light or Men of the Sun, whose business it was to 
light the powers of darkness until they themselves fell. It is related in 
this legend how Beowulf fought the monster, Grendel, and succeeded in 
defeating him-the giant es-caping only by leaving his arm in Beowulf’s grip. 
But Grendel's mother, a mer-woman, came to revenge him and slew many people. 
Beowulf, hearing of this, took up the quarrel, and diving to the bottom of 
the sea, where her palace lay, killed her after a fierce fight. Later on 
Beowulf was made regent of Gothland, and afterwards king, and he reigned for 
about forty years. He was poi-soned by the fangs of a dragon during a mighty 
struggle, and died from the effects.- He was. buried on a hill named 
Hronesnas, and was deeply mourned by his people.

Berande : A sorceress burnt at Maubec, in France, in 1577. She was 
confronted by a damsel whom she accused of sorcery, which the girl denied, 
whereat the beldame ex-claimed, " Dost thou not remember how at. the last 
dance at the Croix du Pate, thou didst carry a pot of poison? The damsel at 
this confessed, and was burnt along with her accuser.

Bereschith : Universal Genesis, one of the two parts into which the Kabala 
was divided by the rabbins.

Berigard of Pisa : Alchemist.  (1578 ? - 1664). Owing to his residing for 
many years at Pisa, this alchemist is commonly known by the appellation 
given above: but in reality he was not an Italian but a Frenchman, and his 
name was Claude Guillermet de Berigard, or, as it is some-times spelt, 
Beauregard. The date of his birth is uncertain, some authorities assigning 
it to 1578, and others placing it considerably later; but they are agreed in 
saying that Moulins was his native town, and that, while a young man, he 
evinced a -keen love for science in its various branches, and began to 
dabble in alchemy. He appears to have studied for a while at the Sorbonne, 
at Paris; and, having acquired some fame there on account of his erudition, 
he was appointed professor of natural philosophy at the Uni-versity of Pisa. 
This post he held until the year 1640, whereupon he was assigned an 
analogous position at Padua, and it was probably in the latter town that his 
death oc-curred in 1664. His. most important contribution to scientific 
literature is Dubitationes in Dialogum Ealilaei pro Terrae immobilitate, a 
quarto published at Florence in 1632; but he was likewise author of Circulus 
Pisanus, issued at Udine in 1643, wherein he concerns himself chiefly with 
commenting on Aristotle's ideas on physics. Beri-garde's writings are 
virtually forgotten nowadays, but they are interesting as documents 
illustrating the progress of scientific knowledge throughout the seventeenth 
century.

Berkeley, Old Woman of : (See England.)

Bermechobus : The supposed writings of St. Methodius of Olympus (martyred 
311 A.D.) or the saint of the same name who was Patriarch of Constantinople 
and who died in 846. The real name of the work is Bea-Methodius, a 
contraction for Beatus Methodivo, which was misprinted "Bermechobus." The 
work is of the nature of a pro-phetic Apocalypse, and foretells the history 
of the world. It was handed down by the Gnostics and was printed in the 
Liber Mirabilis (q.v.). There are no grounds, however. for the supposition 
that the work should be referred to either of the saints above mentioned. It 
recounts how Seth sought a new country in the east and came to the country 
of the initiates, and how the children of Cain in-stituted a system of black 
magic in India. The author identifies the Ishmaelites with those tribes who 
overthrew the Roman power, and tells of a powerful northern people whose 
reign will be over-turned by Anti-Christ. A uni-versal kingdom will 
thereafter be founded, governed by a prince of French blood, after which a 
prolonged period of justice will supervene. 

Bernhelm : (See Hypnotism.)

Berthome du Lignon : called Champagnat, a sorcerer brought to trial at 
Montmorillon, in Poitou, in 1599. He confessed that his father had taken him 
to the Sabbath of the sor-cerors in his youth, that he had promised the 
Devil his soul and his body, that His Satanic Majesty had shown him marks of 
his favour, and that he had even visited him in prison on the previous 
night. He further confessed having slain several persons and beasts with the 
magical powders given him by the Enemy of Mankind.

Bertrand, Alexandre : His Traite du Somnambulisme et du Magnetisme  Animal  
en  France :  See Hypnotism; Spiritualism.

Beryl : Beryl, said to preserve wedded love. and to be a good medium for 
magical vision.

Bezoar : (red). A precious stone supposed to be possessed of magical 
properties, and found in the bodies of certain animals. At one time these 
stones would fetch ten times their weight in gold, being used as a remedy 
against poison and contagion; and for this purpose they were both taken 
internally, and worn round the neck. It is said that there are nine 
varieties of bezoar differing greatly in composition; but they may be 
generally divided into those which consist mainly of mineral and those which 
consist of organic matter. A strange origin was assigned to this stone by 
some of the early naturalists. It is said that the oriental stags when 
oppressed with years fed upon serpents, which renewed their youth. In order 
to counteract the poison which was absorbed into their system, they plunged 
into a running stream keeping their heads only above water. This caused a 
viscous fluid to be distilled from their eyes, which was indurated by the 
heat of the sun, and formed the bezoar.

Bhikshu : (See India.)

Biarbi: (See Fascination.)

Bible des Bohemians   (See Tarot.)

Bible of the Devil : This was without doubt a grimoire (q.v.) or some such 
work. But Delancre says that the Devil informed sorcerers that he possessed 
a bible consisting of sacred books, having a theology of its own, which was 
dilated upon by various professors. One great magician, continues Delancre, 
who was brought before the Parlia-ment of Paris, avowed that there dwelt at 
Toledo sixty-three masters in the faculty of Magic who took for their text-
book the Devil's Bible.

Bibliomancy : A method of discovering whether or not a person was innocent 
of sorcery, by weighing him against the great Bible in the Church. If the 
person weighed less than the Bible, he was innocent.  
(See Witchcraft.)

Biffant : A little-known demon, chief of a legion who entered the body of 
one Denise de la Caille (q.v.) and who was obliged to sign with his claws 
the proces verbal of exorcisms.

Bifrons : A demon of monstrous guise who, according to Wierius, often took 
the form of a man well versed in As-trology and planetary influences. He 
excels in geometry, is acquainted with the virtues of herbs, precious stones 
and plants, and it is said that he is able to transport corpses from one 
place to another. He is also the one who lights the strange corpse-lights 
above the tombs of the dead. Twenty six of the infernal regions obey his 
behests.

Bigois or Bigotis : A sorcerer of Tuscany who, it is said, composed a 
learned work on the nature of prognostications, especially those connected 
with thunder and lightning. The book is said to be irretrievably lost. It is 
thought that Bigois is the same as Bagoe (q.v.), a sibly of Erithryea, but 
this is merely of the nature of surmise.

Binah: In the supreme triangle of the Kabala the three sides are reason, 
which they name Kether; necessity, Chochmah; and liberty, Binah.

Biragues, Flaminio de : Author of an  infernal-facetious work entitled 
l'Enfer de la mere Cardine, which treats of the dreadful battle in Hell on 
the occasion of the marriage of Cerberus with Cardine (Paris, 1585 and 
'597.) It is a satire on the demonography of the times. Didot reprinted the 
work in 1793. The author was a nephew of a Chan-cellor of France, Rene de 
Biragues.

Birds : It is a common belief among savage tribes that the souls of the dead 
are conveyed to the land of the hereafter by birds. Among some West African 
peoples, for instance, a bird is bound to the body of the deceased and then 
sacri-ficed, so that it may carry the man's soul to the after-world. The 
Bagos also offer up a bird on the corpse of a deceased person for the same 
reason. The South Sea Islanders, again, bury their dead in coffins shaped 
like the bird which is to bear away their spirits, while the natives of 
Borneo represent Tempon-Telon's Ship of the Dead (q.v.) as having the form 
of a bird. The Indian tribes of North-West America have rattles shaped like 
ravens, with a large face painted on the breast. The probable significance 
is that the raven is to carry the disembodied soul to the region of the sun.

Birog: A Druidess of Irish legendary origin. She it was who, by her magic, 
brought Klan and Ethlinn together.

Blrraark:  Australian necromancers.  (See Necromancy.) 

Biscar, Jeanette: A sorceress of the district of Labour in France, who was 
transported to the witches' Sabbath by the Devil in the form of a goat. As a 
reward she was suspended in mid-air head

Bisclaveret : The name of the were-wolf (q.v.) in Brittany. It is believed 
to be a human being, transformed by magic into a fearsome 
man-devouring beast, which roams about the woods, seeking whom it may slay.

Bitru: Otherwise called Sytry, a great Prince of Hell, accord-ing to the 
demonographer Wierius. He appeared in the form of a leopard with the wings 
of a griffin. But when he adopted a human appearance for the nonce it was 
in-variably one of great beauty. It is he who awakes lust in the human 
heart. Seventy legions obey his commands.

Bitumen, in Magic: Bitumen was greatly used in magical practices. Images for 
the purpose of sympathetic magic were often made of this substance; and it 
was used in the ceremonies for the cleansing of houses in which any un-
cleanness had appeared - being spread on the floor like clay.

Black Earth: (See Philosopher's Stone.)

Black Hen, Fast of The : In Hungary and the adjacent countries it is 
believed that whoever has been robbed and wishes to discover tile thief must 
take a black hen and along with it fast strictly for nine Fridays. The thief 
will then either return the plunder or die. This is called "taking up a 
black fast" against anyone. A great deal of lore concerning black hens may 
be found in the works of Guber-natis and Friedrich.

Black Magic: Middle Ages. Black Magic as practised in medieval times may be 
defined as the use of supernatural knowledge for the purposes of evil, the 
invocation of diabolic and infernal powers that they may become the slaves 
and emissaries of man's will; in short, a perversion of legitimate mystic 
science. This art and its attendant practices can be traced from the time of 
the ancient Egyptians and Persians, from the Greeks and Hebrews to the 
period when it reached its apogee in the Middle Ages, thus forming an 
unbroken chain; for in medieval magic may be found the perpetuation of the 
popular rites of paganism - the ancient gods had become devils, their 
mysteries orgies, their worship sorcery.
     Some historians have tried to trace the areas in Europe most affected 
by these devilish practices. Spain is said to have excelled all in infamy, 
to have plumbed the depths of the abyss. The south of France next became a 
hotbed of sorcery, whence it branched northwards to Paris and the countries 
and islands beyond, southward to Italy, finally extending into the Tyrol and 
Germany.
     In Black Magic human perversity found the means of ministering to its 
most terrible demands and the possible attainment of its darkest imaginings. 
To gain limitless power over god, demon and man; for personal aggrandise-
ment and glorification; to cheat, trick and mock; to gratify base appetites; 
to aid religious bigotry and jealous-ies ; to satisfy private and public 
enmities; to further political intrigue; to encompass disease, calamity and 
death-these were the ends and aims of Black Magic and its followers.
     So widespread, so intense was the belief in the Powers of Evil that it 
may truly be said the Devil reigned supreme, if the strength and fervour of 
a universal fear be weighed against the weak and wavering manifestations of 
love and goodwill, peace and charity enjoined by religion in the worship of 
God.
     Under the influence of this belief the world became to the mind and 
imagination of man a place of dread. At set of sun, at midnight, in twilight 
of dawn and eve, the legions of evil were abroad on their mission of terror. 
A running stream, a lake, or thick forest, held each its horde of malevolent 
spirits lying in wait for the lonely wayfarer, while the churchyard close to 
the House of God, the place of the gallows away from the habitation of man, 
the pestilential marsh, wilderness and mysterious cavern, the barren slopes 
and summits of mountains, were the dread meeting-places of the Devil and his 
myrmidons, the scenes of their infamous orgies, the temples of their 
blasphemous rites.
     And the night was troubled by evil and ominous winds blowing from the 
Netherworld, heavy with the beating of the innumerable wings of the birds of 
ill-omen presaging woe; the darkness was faintly lit by the flitting 
phosphores-cent forms of sepulchral larvae, waiting to batten on the souls 
arid bodies of man; of stryges infesting the tombs and dese-crating the 
dead; of incubi and succubi surrounding the homes of the living to bring 
dishonour and madness to sleeping man and woman and beget monstrous and 
myriad life of ravenous vampires in search of victims for their feast of 
blood. Moon and stars might illumine the darkness, but in their beams were 
spells and enchantments, in their rising and waning the inexorable workings 
of Fate, while against their light could be seen the dishevelled or naked 
forms of warlock and witch passing overhead to their dia-bolical Sabbaths. 
The familiar happenings and actions of life might be nothing but the 
machinations of sorcery-to eat and drink might be to swallow evil; to look 
upon beauty in any form, the sesame to malign influence; to laugh, but to 
echo infernal mockery and mirth.
     In this fruitful soil of superstition and grotesque ignor-ance, Black 
Magic sowed and reaped its terrible harvest of evil, persecution, madness 
and death. Such a state of mind must, of necessity, have induced a weakness 
of will and imagination specially prone to the influence of hyp-notic 
suggestion by a stronger 'sill, and even more ready to fall an easy prey to 
self-hypnotism, which must have often been the result of such an atmosphere 
of foreboding and dread.
     The simplest ailments or most revolting diseases, cata-lepsy and 
somnambulism, hysteria, and insanity, all these were traced to the power of 
Black Magic, caused through the conjurations of sorcery. It followed that 
curative medicine was also a branch of magic, not a rational science, the 
cures being nothing if not fantastic in the last degree
-incantations and exorcisms, amulets and talismans of precious stones, 
metals or weird medicaments rendered powerful by spells; philtres and 
enchanted drinks, the cure of epilepsy by buried 
peach-blossoms, and though in the use of herbs and chemicals was laid the 
foundation of the curative science of to-day, it was more for their en-
chanted and symbolic significance that they were pre scribed by the 
magicians.
     History shows us that the followers of the Black Art swarmed 
everywhere. In this fraternity as in others there were grades, from the 
pretenders, charlatans and diviners of the common people, to the various 
secret societies and orders of initiates, amongst whom were kings and 
queens, and popes, dignitaries of church and state, where the know-ledge and 
ritual were carefully cherished and preserved in manuscripts, some of which 
are extant at the present day, ancient grimoires (q.v.), variously termed 
the Black, the Red, the Great Grimoire, each full of weird rites, formulae 
and conjurations, evocations of evil malice and lust in the names of 
barbaric deities; charms and be-witchments clothed in incomprehensible 
jargon, 'and ceremonial processes for the fulfillment of imprecations of 
misfortune, calamity, sin and death.
     The deity who was worshipped, whose powers were invoked in the practice 
of Black Magic, was the Source and Creator of Evil, Satanas, Belial, the 
Devil, a direct des-cendant of the Egyptian Set, the Persian Ahriman, the 
Python of the Greeks, the Jewish Serpent, Baphomet of the Templars, the 
Goat-deity of the Witches' Sabbath. He was said to have the head and legs of 
a goat, and the breasts of a woman.
     To his followers he was known by many names, among these being debased 
names of forgotten deities, also the Black One, the Black He-goat, the Black 
Raven, the Dog, the Wolf and Snake, the Dragon, the Hell-hound, Hell-hand, 
and Hell-bolt.     His transformations were unlimited, as is indicated by 
many of his names; other favourite and familiar forms were a cat, a mouse, a 
toad, or a worm, or again, the human form, especially as a young and hand-
some man when on his amorous adventures. The signs by which he might be 
identified, though not invariably, were the cloven hoof, the goat's beard, 
cock's feathers, 
or ox's tail.
     In all his grotesquery are embedded ancient mysteries and their 
symbols, the detritus of dead faiths and faded civilizations. The Greek Pan 
with the goat limbs mas-querades as the Devil, also the goat as emblematic 
of fire and symbol of generation, and perhaps traces of the Jewish tradition 
where two goats were taken, one pure, the other impure, the first offered as 
sacrifice in expiation of sin, the other, the impure burdened with sins by 
impre-cation and driven into the wilderness, in short, the scape-goat. In 
the Hebrew Kabala, Satan's name is that of Jehovah reversed. He is not a 
devil, but the negation of deity.
     Beneath the Devil's sway were numberless hordes and legions of demons 
and spirits, ready and able to procure and work any and every evil or 
disaster the mind of man might conceive and desire. In one Grimoire it tells 
of nine orders of evil spirits, these being False Gods, Lying Spirits, 
Vessels of Iniquity, Revenge led by Asmodeus, Deluders by the Serpent, 
Turbulents by Merigum, Furies by Apollyon, Calumniators by Astaroth, and 
Tempters by Mammon. These demons again are named separately, the meaning of 
each name indicating the possessor's capacity, such as destroyer, 
devastator, tumult, ravage, and so forth.
     Again each earthly vice and calamity was personified by a demon, 
Moloch, who devours. infants; Nisroch, god of hatred, despair, fatality; 
Astarte, Lilith and Astaroth, deities of debauchery and abortion; Adramelek, 
of murder, and Belial, of red anarchy.
     According to the Grimoires, the rites and rules are multifarious, each 
demon demanding special invocation and procedure. The ends that may be 
obtained by these means are sufficiently indicated in the headings of the 
chapters : To take possession of all kinds of treasure; to live in opulence; 
to ruin possessions  to demolish buildings and strongholds; to cause armed 
men to appear; to excite every description of hatred, discord, failure and 
vengeance; to excite tempests; to excite love in a virgin, in a married 
person; to procure adulteries; to cause enchanted music and lascivious 
dances to appear; to learn all secrets from those of Venus to Mars; to 
render oneself invisible; to fly in the air and travel; to operate under 
water for twenty-four hours; to open every kind of lock without a key, 
without noise and thus gain en-trance to prison, larder or charnel-house; to 
innoculate the walls of houses with plague and disease; to bind fa-miliar 
spirits; to cause a dead body to revive to transform one's self; to 
transform men into animals or animals into men.
     These rites fell under the classification of divination, bewitchments 
and necromancy. The first named was carried out by magical readings of fire, 
smoke, water or blood; by letters of names, numbers, symbols, arrange-ments 
of dots; by lines of hand or finger nails; by birds and their flight or 
their entrails; by dice or cards, rings or mirrors.
     Bewitchments were carried out by means of nails, ani-mals, toads or 
waxen figures and mostly to bring about suffering or death. In the first 
method nails were conse-crated to evil by spells and invocations, then 
nailed cross-wise above the imprint of the feet of the one who is destined 
for torment. The next was by selection of some animal supposed to resemble 
the intended victim and attaching to it some of his 'lair or garments. They 
gave it the name and then proceeded to torture it, in whole or part 
according to the end desired, by driving nails, red-hot pins and thorns into 
the body to the rhythm of muttered maledictions. For like purpose a fat toad 
was often selected, baptised, made to swallow a host, both consecrated and 
execrated, tied with hairs of the victim upon which the sorcerer had 
previously spat, and finally buried at the threshold of the bewitched one's 
door, whence it issued as nightmare and vampire for his undoing.
     The last and most favoured method was by the use of waxen images. Into 
the wax was mixed baptismal oil and ash of consecrated hosts, and out of 
this was fashioned a figure resembling the one to be bewitched. It was then 
baptised, receiving the persons name in full; received the Sacraments, and 
next subjected to curses, torture by knives or fire; then finally stabbed to 
the heart. It was also possible to bewitch a person by insufflation, 
breathing upon them, and so causing a heaviness of their will and 
corresponding compliance to the sorcerer.
     Necromancy (q.v.) was the raising of the dead by evoca-tions and 
sacrilegious rites, for the customary purposes of evil. The scene of 
operation might be about pits filled with blood and resembling a shambles, 
in a darkened and suffocating room, in a churchyard or beneath swinging 
gibbets, and the number of ghosts so summoned and gal-vanized into life 
might be one of legion.
For whatever end, the procedure usually included prof-anation of Christian 
ritual, such as diabolical masses and administration of polluted sacraments 
to animals and reptiles ; bloody sacrifices of animals, often of children; 
of orgiastic dances, generally of circular formation, such as that of the 
Witches' Sabbath in which undreamed-of evil and abominations, all 
distortions and monstrosities of reality and imagination took part, to end 
in a nightmare of obscene madness.
     For paraphernalia and accessories the sorcerers scoured the world and 
the imagination and mind of man, bending all things, beautiful or horrible 
to their service. The different planets ruled over certain objects and 
states and invocations, for such were of great potency if delivered under 
their auspices. Mars favoured wars and strife, Venus love, Jupiter ambition 
and intrigue, Saturn male-diction and death.
     Vestments and symbols proper to the occasion must be donned. The 
electric furs of the panther, lynx and cat added their quota of influence to 
the ceremonial. Colours also must be observed and suitable ornaments. For 
opera-tions of vengeance the robe must be the hue of leaping flame, or rust 
and blood, with belt and bracelets of steel, and crown of rue and wormwood. 
Blue, Green and Rose were the colours for amorous incantations; whilst for 
the encompassing of death black must be worn, with belt of lead and wreath 
of cypress, amid loathsome incense of sulphur and assafoetida.
     Precious stones and metals also added their influence to the spells. 
Geometrical figures, stars, pentagrams, columns, triangles, were used; also 
herbs, such as belladonna and assafoetida;  flowers, honeysuckle, being the 
witches' ladder, the arum, deadly nightshade and black poppies; 
distillations and philtres composed of the virus of loath-some diseases, 
venom of reptiles, secretions of animals, poisonous sap and fungi and 
fruits, such as the fatal man-chineel, pulverised flint, impure ashes and 
human blood. Amulets and talismans were made of the skins of criminals, 
wrought from the skulls of hanged men, or ornaments rifled from corpses and 
thus of special virtue, or the pared nails of an executed thief.
     To make themselves invisible the sorcerers used an unguent compounded 
from the incinerated bodies of new-born infants and mixed with the blood of 
night-birds. For personal preparation a fast of fifteen days was observed. 
When that was past, it was necessary to get drunk every five days, after 
sundown, on wine in which poppies and hemp had been steeped.
     For the actual rites the light must be that of candles made from the 
fat of corpses and fashioned in the form of a cross; the bowls to be of 
skulls, those of parricides being of greatest virtue; the fires must be fed 
with cypress branches, with the wood of desecrated crucifixes and blood-
stained gibbets; the magic fork fashioned of hazel or almond, severed at one 
blow; the ceremonial cloth to be woven by a prostitute, whilst round about 
the mystic circle must be traced with the embers of a polluted cross. 
Another potent instrument of magic was the mandragore to be unearthed from 
beneath gallows where corpses are suspended, by a d6g tied to the plant. The 
dog is killed by a mortal blow after which its soul will pass into the 
fantastic root, attracting also that of the hanged man.
     The history of the Middle Ages is shot through with the shadows cast by 
this terrible belief in Black Magic. Mach-inations and counter-machinations 
in which church and state, rich and poor, learned and ignorant were alike 
in-volved ; persecutions and prosecutions where the persecutor and judge 
often met the fate they dealt to the victim and condemned-a dreadful 
phantasmagoria and procession where we may find the haughty Templars, the 
blood-stained Gilles de Laval, the original of Bluebeard; Catherine de 
Medici and Marshals of France; popes. princes and priests. In literature 
also we find its trace, in weird legends and monstrous tales: in stories of 
spells and enchantments; in the tale of Dr. Faustus and his pact with the 
Devil, his pleasures and their penalty when his soul must needs pass down to 
Hell in forfeit; we may find its traces in lewd verses and songs. Art, too, 
yields her testimony to the infernal influence in pictures, sculptures and 
carvings, decorating palace and cathedral; where we may find the Devil's 
likeness peeping out from carven screen and stall, and his demons made 
visible in the horde of gargoyles grinning and leering from niche and 
corner, and clustering beneath the eaves. K. N.

Black Mass : It is known from the confessions of witches sorcerers that the 
devil also has mass said at his Sabbath. Pierre Aupetit, an apostate priest

consecration the frequenters of the Sabbath said: "Beelzebub, Beelzebub, 
Beelzebub." The devil in the shape of a butterfly. flew round those who were 
celebrating the mass, and who ate a black host, which they were obliged to 
chew before swallowing.

Black Pullet, The : A French magical publication supposedly printed in 1740, 
purporting to be a narrative of an officer who was employed in Egypt. While 
in Egypt the narrator fell in with a magician to whom he rendered 
considerable service, and who when he expired left him the secret of 
manufacturing a black pullet which had much skill in gold-finding. In it we 
find much plagiarism from the Comte de Gabalis (See Elementary Spirits,) and 
the whole work if interesting, is distinctly derivative. It contains many 
illustrations of talismans and magical rings. The receipt for bringing the 
black pullet into existences describes that a black hen should be set to 
hatch one of its own eggs, and that during the process a hood should be 
drawn over its eyes so that it cannot see. It is also to be placed in a box 
lined with black material. The chick thus hatched will have a particular 
instinct for detecting the places wherein gold is hidden.

Blake, William :  (1757-1827) Poet, Mystic. Painter and Engraver. is one of 
the most curious and significant figures in the whole history of English 
literature, and a man who has likewise exerted a wide influence on the 
graphic arts. He was born in London on the 28th of November, 1757. It would 
seem that his parents and other relatives were bumble folk, but little is 
known definitely about the family while their ancestry is a matter of 
discussion. Mr. W. B. Yeats, who is an ardent devotee of Blake, and has 
edited his writings, would have it that the poet was of Irish descent but 
though it is true that the name Blake is common in Ireland to this day, 
especially in Galway, Mr. Yeat's con-tention is not supported by much 
trustworthy evidence, and it is contradicted by Mr. Martin J. Blake in his 
gene-alogical work, Blake Family Records.
     William manifested aesthetic predilections at a very early age, and his 
father and mother did not discourage him herein, but offered to place him in 
the studio of a painter. The young man demurred however, pointing out that 
the apprenticeship was a costly one, and saying gen-erously that his 
numerous brothers and Sisters should be considered, and that it was not fair 
that the family's ex-chequer should be impoverished on his behalf. 
Thereafter engraving was suggested to him as a profession, not just because 
it necessitated a less expensive training than painting, but also as being 
more likely than the latter to yield a speedy financial return; and 
accepting this offer, Blake went at the age of fourteen to study under James 
Basire, an engraver whose plates are but little esteemed to-day, yet who 
enjoyed considerable reputation while alive, and was employed officially by 
the Society of An-tiquaries. Previous to this a more noted manipulator of 
the burin, William Ryland, a protege of George III, bad been suggested as 
one who would probably give a capital training to the boy: but the latter, 
on being taken to see Ryland, evinced a strong dislike for him, and refused 
stoutly to accept his teaching, declaring that the man looked as though born 
to be hanged. And it is interesting to note that the future artist of the 
Prophetic Books was right, for only a few years later Ryland was convicted 
of forgery, and forfeited his life in consequence.
     Blake worked under Basire for seven years, and during the greater part 
of his time the pupil was engaged mainly in doing drawings of Westminster 
Abbey, these being destined to illustrate a huge book then in progress, the 
Sepulchral Monuments of Richard. Gough. It is said that Blake was chosen by 
his master to go and do these drawings not so much because he showed 
particular aptitude for draughtmanship. as because he was eternally 
quarrelling with his fellow-apprentices: and one may well believe, indeed, 
that the young artist was convinced of his superi-ority to his confreres, 
and made enemies by failing to con-ceal this conviction, Whilst at the 
Abbey. Blake asserted that he saw many visions. In 1778, he entered the 
Royal Academy School, then recently founded: and here he continued his 
studies under George Moser, a chaser and enameller who engraved the first 
great seal of George III. Yet it was not to Moser that the budding visionary 
really looked for instruction, he was far more occupied with study-ing 
prints after the old masters, especially Michael Angelo and Raphael; and one 
day Rosa found him engaged thus, reproved him kindly but firmly, and told 
him he would be acting more wisely if he took Charles le Brun as his exem-
plar. He even hastened to show the pupil a volume of engravings after that. 
painter, so redolent. always of the worst tendencies of le grand siecle; 
and, with this incident in mind, it may be assumed that Blake was deeply 
grateful when, a little later he had shaken off the futile shackles of the 
Royal Academy. and began to work on his own account. He had to work hard, 
however, for meanwhile his affections had been engaged by a young woman, 
Cath-erine Boucher, and funds were of course necessary ere it was possible 
for the pair to marry. But Blake slaved manfully with his burin, engraving 
illustrations for maga-zines and the like; and in I 782 he had his reward, 
his marriage being solemnized in that year. His wife's name indicates that 
she was of French origin. and it would be interesting to know if she was 
related to Francois Boucher. or to the fine engraver of the French Empire, 
Boucher- - Desnoyers; but waiving these speculations, it is pleasant to 
recall that the marriage proved a singularly happy one, Blake's spouse 
clinging to him lovingly throughout all his troubles and privations, and 
ever showing a keen appre-ciation of his genius. As regards Catherine's 
appearance there still exists a small pencil-drawing by Blake, commonly 
supposed to be a portrait of his wife; and it shows a. slim, graceful woman, 
just the type of woman predominating in Blake's other pictures ; so it may 
be presumed that she frequently acted as his model, or-for Blake had no 
fond-ness for drawing from nature- that her appearance gradually 
crystallised itself in his brain, and thus trans-pired in the bulk of his 
works.
     After his marriage Blake took lodgings in Green Street, Leicester 
Fields; and feeling, no doubt, that engraving was but a poor staff for a 
married man to lean upon, he opened a print shop in Broad Street. He made 
many friends at this period, the most favoured among them being Flaxman, the 
sculptor; and the latter introduced him to Mr. Matthew, a clergyman of 
artistic tastes, who, manifesting keen interest in the few poems which Blake 
had already written, generously offered to defray the cost of printing them. 
The writer gladly accepted the offer
and the result was a tiny volume, Poetical Sketches by W. B. Thus 
encouraged, Blake gave up his printselling business, while simultaneously he 
went to live in Poland Street, and soon after this removal he published his 
Songs of Innocence, the letterpress enriched by designs from his own hand. 
Nor was this the only remarkable thing about the book, for the whole thing 
was printed by the author himself, and by a new method of his own invention-
a method which can scarcely be detailed here owing to lack of space, but 
which the reader will find described adequately in Mr. Arthur Hind's 
monumental History of Engraving and Etching. Blake lived in Poland Street 
for five years, and during this time he achieved and issued The Book of 
Thel, The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, and the first book of The French 
Revolution. In 1792 he removed to Hercules Buildings, Lambeth; and while 
staying here he war forced by dire poverty to do much commercial work, 
notably a series of illustrations to Young's Night Thoughts, yet he found 
leisure for original drawing and writing also, and to this period of his 
life belong the Gates of Paradise and Songs of Experience. In a while he 
tired of London how-ever, and so he went to Felpham, near Bognor, in Sussex, 
taking a cottage there hard by where Aubrey Beardsley was to live at a later 
date, and here he composed Milton, Jeru-salem, and a large part of the 
Prophetic Books, while he made a new friend, William Hayley, who repeatedly 
aided him with handsome presents of money. The Sussex scenery, beside - 
afterwards to inspire Whistler and Con-der-appealed keenly to the poet, and 
in one of his lyrics he exclaims
     "Away to sweet Felpham, for Heaven is there," while to Flaxman he wrote 
:-"Felpham is a sweet place for study, because it is more spiritual than 
London. Heaven opens here on all sides her golden gates; her windows are not 
obstructed by vapours, voices of celestial inhabitants are more distinctly 
heard, and their forms more distinctly seen, and my cottage is also a shadow 
of their houses.
     Yet Blake tired of Sussex as he had tired of his former home, and in 
1803 he returned to London, taking a house in South Bolton Street. Here 
again he endured much poverty, and was then forced into doing illustrations 
to Virgil, and also a series of designs for Blair's Grave; but later his 
financial horizon was brightened by help from John Linnell, the landscape 
painter, and shortly after-wards the artist did some of his finest things, 
for instance his Spiritual Portraits, and his drawings for The Book of Job, 
while after completing these he commenced illustrating the Divine Comedy of 
Dante. In 1821 he again changed his home, taking up his abode now in 
Fountain Court, Strand, and here he continued to work at the Dante draw-
ings; but only seven of them were ever published, for Blake's health was 
beginning to fail, his energies were slackening, and he died in 1827.
     Sixteen years before his death Blake held a public ex-hibition of his 
drawings, engravings, illustrations and the like; and the affair was treated 
with haughty disdain, the only paper which saw fit to print a criticism 
being The Examiner, edited by Leigh Hunt. It is customary for BIake's 
idolators of to-day to attempt to heap scorn on those who thus expressed 
callousness towards his work, and to vituperate more particularly the many 
people among his contemporaries who showed him frank antag-onism, but is not 
all this noisy blaming of his bygone ene-mies and critics unnecessarily 
severe? For it must be borne in mind that the artist came as a complete 
novelty, the mysticism permeating his pictures having virtually no parallel 
in English painting prior to his advent. And it should be remembered, too, 
that Blake as a technician has many grave limitations; and limitations which 
must have been exasperating to people accustomed to the art of that amazing 
century which begot masters like Ramsay, Gainsborough and Romney, Watteau 
and Fragonard, De la Tour and Clodion, all of them producing works eminently 
graceful and pre-emenently decorative. Now comparing him to any of there 
men, Blake's modelling appears sadly timid and amateurish, as witness his 
drawing of himself, or his copy of Laurence's portrait of Cowper; while 
passing to his draughtsmanship, this is frequently inaccurate, and nowhere 
embodies the fluency and charming rhythm re-flected by nearly all the 
artists aforesaid. His colour again is often thin and tawdry; while as to 
his composition, he is admirable only on very rare occasions, the incon-
testable truth being that, in the bulk of his pictures, the different parts 
have little or no relation to one another. This is true especially of those 
of his works which include a vast assembly of figures, yet even in various 
others of simpler cast this lack of anything like arrangement is equally 
paramount, and to choose an example, one need only look at "The Door of 
Death" in America. This is two pictures rather than one, and the spectator's 
gaze wanders from side to side, fretted and bewildered.
     It were injustice to Blake himself, to omit noting these technical 
flaws in his workmanship, yet it were no less unjust, if not actually 
ridiculous, to write at any length contrasting him with the other masters of 
his century; for his outlook and intention were wholly different from 
theirs, and, lacking their charm and decorative value, he transcends these 
men withal in divers respects. He is a prince among mystics, his finest 
drawings are flushed with weirdness and mystery, and he reincarnates visions 
and phantasies as no one else has done in line and colour, not even Rosetti. 
For Blake contrived to remain a child throughout the whole of his life, and 
so, for him, dreams were an actuality, the things he saw in his trances were 
real and living, and he perpetuated all these things with just that obvious 
and definite symbolism which a child would naturally use. When he wants to 
express "Vain Desires' he draws a man trying to reach the stars with the aid 
of an enormous ladder; in the "Resurrection of the Dead" he delineates 
actual bodies soaring heavenwards, and when his topic is morning, he shows a 
nude form shining from the dusky mountain tops; while for Blake "The Door of 
Death" is an actual stone portal, and when illus-trating the text in Job, 
"With dreams upon my bed Thou scarest me," he is not content to depict a 
sleeper with a frightened expression on his face, but draws all around the 
sleeper the imaginary horrors which tormented him - serpents, chains, and 
distorted human creatures. Now in the hands of most men all this sort of 
thing would yield nothing but the laughable, yet somehow Blake's drawings, 
even those which are weakest technically, invariably possess just that 
curious air of distinction which is the dominant characteristic of all truly 
great pictures. In fine, he expressed the outlook of a child with a sublime 
mastery never vouchsafed to children.
     If Blake the draughtsman and illustrator was a fierce iconoclast, 
turning his back resolutely on the styles current in his time, most 
assuredly Blake the poet, enacted a kin-dred role, evincing a sublime 
contempt for the trammels of Augustanism, and thus making straight the way 
for Burns, for Wordsworth, and for the divine Shelley. Yet just as Burns was 
tinged slightly by the typical failings of the pastoral century, so also 
Blake would seem to have found it difficult originally to break his 
shackles: for oc-casionally one finds him employing expletives, and this 
suggests that at first he thought with Pope and his school that verse is 
futile unless precise; while some of his pic-tures of child life in Songs of 
Innocence are unduly pretty and idyllic, almost as idyllic as the scenes in 
Goldsmith's Deserted Village. Unlike Lowry and Mr. Kenneth Grahame those 
exquisite adepts in the delineation of children, Blake shows only one side 
of child-life : for his children are nearly all out for a holiday, they are 
seldom vexed, or cross, or angry, and their eyes are hardly ever dim with 
tears. At least, however, they are prone to dream dreams and see visions: 
and it is significant that, in one poem, the writer describes a child unto 
whom are revealed things hidden from his 
father's eyes :-

Father, O father! what do we here,
In this land of unbelief and fear ?
The land of dreams is better far
Above the light of the morning star."

That verse and many others besides, charm at once by a fusion of complete 
naturalness with rare beauty: and the genius of Blake in his earlier poems 
is really this, that with the simple language of childhood, and out of the 
simple events of child-life, he makes a noble and enduring art-an art, 
charged as surely as his own drawings with an air of distinction.
     Had Blake contented himself with writing his Poetical Sketches, his 
Songs of Innocence and the subsequent Songs of Experience, the charge of 
madness could not well have been levelled at him by his contemporaries. It 
was his later writings like The Book of Thel and the Prophetic Books which 
begot this imputation, for in these later poems the writer casts his mantle 
of simplicity to the winds, he sets himself to give literary form to 
visions, and he is so purely spiritual and ethereal, so far beyond the realm 
of normal human speech, that mysticism frequently devolves into crypticism. 
His rhythm, too, is often so subtle that it hardly seems rhythm at all; yet 
even in his weirdest flights Blake is still the master, he still embodies 
that curious something which differentiates great art from the rank and file 
of asthetic products. And if, as observed before, the colouring in many of 
his water-colour drawings is sadly thin and poor, the very reverse is true, 
and true abundantly of the poems written towards the close of his life. 
Glowing and gorgeous tones are omnipresent in these, they have the barbaric 
pomp of Gautier's finest prose, the glitter and opulence of Berlioz’ or 
Wagner's orchestration, nay the richness and splendour of a sunset among 
towering mountains.
     No account of Blake would be complete without some account of the 
literature which has grown up around his name, a literature whereof many 
items are more than worthy of the topic they celebrate. The earliest 
systematic biography of the master is that by Alexander Gilchrist, 1863, a 
book, the more valuable inasmuch as it contains many reproductions of 
Blake's drawings, notably the whole of the Job set : and since Gilchrist's 
day the artist's life has been rewritten by Alfred I. Story, 1893, and by 
Edwin J. Ellis, 1907, while his letters have been collected and annotated by 
Frederick Tatham, 1906. Much interesting and important matter concerning 
Blake is contained in The Life and Letters of Samuel Palmer, by A. W. 
Palmer, 1892 in A Memoir of Edward Calvert by Samuel Calvert, 1893, and in 
The Life of John Linnell by A. T. Story, 1892, while as regards critical 
studies of the master, perhaps the best is Swinburne's eloquent tribute, 
i868, and further works of note are those of Richard Garnett, Mr. Arthur 
Symons and M. Basil de Selincourt. The student should also consult Ideas of 
Good and Evil by W. B. Yeats, 1903, and The Rosetti Papers by W. M Rossetti, 
1903, while he will find it advisable to look also at an edition of the Job 
illustrations containing an able introduction by Mr. Laur-ence Binyon, 1906. 
To speak finally of editions of Blake's own writings these are of course 
numerous, but the only one which is really complete is that edited by E. J 
Ellis, 1906.	W. G. B-M.

Blavatsky, Helena Petrovna : was born at Ekaterinoslav Russia, on the 31st 
of July, 1831. She was the daughter of Colonel Peter Hahn, a. member of a 
Mecklenburg family settled in Russia. She married, at the age of seventeen 
Nicephore Blavatsky, a Russian official in Caucasia, a man very much older 
than herself. Her married life was of short duration as she separated from 
her husband in a few months. The next year or so she occupied chiefly in 
travelling, Texas Mexico, Canada and India, were each in turn the scene of 
her wanderings, and she twice attempted to enter Tibet. on one occasion she 
managed to cross its frontier in disguise but lost her way, and after 
various adventures was found by a body of horsemen and escorted homewards. 
The period between 1848 and 1858, she described as the" veiled" time of her 
life, refusing to divulge anything that happened to her in these ten years, 
save stray allusions to a seven years' stay in Little and Great Tibet, or in 
a " Himalayan Retreat." In 1858 she returned to Russia, where she soon 
achieved distinction as a spiritualistic medium. Later on she went to the 
United States where she remained for six years, and became a naturalised 
citizen. She became prominent in spiritualistic circles in America about 
1870. It was there that she founded her school of Theosophy. The idea 
occurred to her of combining her spiritualistic control" with Buddhistic 
legends about Tibetan sages, and she professed to have direct "astral" 
communication with two Tibetan mahatmas.
     With the aid of Col. Henry Olcott, she founded in New York, in 1875, 
the Theosophical Society with a threefold aim: (1) to form a universal 
brotherhood of man; (2) to study and make known the ancient religions, 
philosophies and sciences  (3) to investigate the laws of nature and develop 
the divine powers latent in man. In order to gain converts to Theosophy she 
was obliged to appear to perform miracles. This she did with a large measure 
of success, but her "methods" were on several occasions detected as fraudu-
lent. Nevertheless her commanding personality secured for her a large 
following, and when she died, in 1891, she was at the head of a large body 
of believers in her teaching, numbering about 100,000 persons. (See 
Theosophy.)

Bodhisattva : is the official in the theosophical hierarchy who has charge 
of the religion and education of the world. He is the founder of religions,

still continues the direction of it.

Bodin, Jean : a jurisconsult and student of demonology, who died of the 
plague in 1596. An Angevin by birth, he studied law in youth and published 
his Republique, which La Harpe calls " the rerm of the spirit of law," but 
it is his Demonomanie des Sorciers by which he is known to occultists. In 
this work he defended sorcery, but propa-gated numerous errors. By his 
Colloquium heptaplomeron de abdites rerum sublimium varcanus he aroused very 
un-favourable opinions regarding his religious views. In it. he discusses in 
the form of dialogue the theological opinions of Jews, Mussulmans, and 
deists to the disadvantage of the Christian faith, and although he died a 
Catholic he professed in his time the tenets of Protestantism, Judaism, 
sorcery, atheism and deism. The Demonomanie was pub-lished in Paris, in 
1581, and again under the title of Fleau des demons et des sorciers at 
Wiort, in 1616. In its first and second books Bodin demonstrates that 
spirits have com-munication with mankind, and traces the various charac-
teristics and forms which distinguish good spirits from evil. He unfolds the 
methods of diabolic prophecy and communication, and those of evocation of 
evil existences of pacts with the Devil, of journeys through the air to the 
sorcerers' Sabbath, of infernal ecstasies, of spells by which one may change 
himself into a werewolf, and of carnal communion with incubi and succubi. 
The third book speaks of the manner of preventing the work of sorcerers and 
obviating their charms and enchantments, and the fourth of the manner in 
which sorcerers may be known. He concludes his study by refuting the work of 
John Wier or Wierius (q.v.) who, he asserts, was in error in believing 
sorcerers to be fools and people of unsound mind, and states that the books 
of that author should be burned "for the honour of God."
     Sir Walter Scott says: "Bodin, a lively Frenchman, explained the zeal 
of Wierius to protect the tribe of sorcerers from punishment, by stating 
that he himself was a conjurer and the scholar of Cornelius Agrippa, and 
might therefore well desire to save the lives of those accused of the same 
league with Satan. Hence they threw on their antagonists' the offensive 
names of witch-patrons and witch-advocates, as if it were impossible for any 
to hold the opinion of Naudseus, Wierius, Scot, etc., without patron-izing 
the devil and the witches against their brethren of mortality. Assailed by 
such heavy charges, the philoso-phers themselves lost patience, and retorted 
abuse in their turn, calling Bodin, Delrio, and others who used their 
arguments, witch-advocates, and the like, as the affirming and defending the 
existence of the crime seemed to increase the number of witches, and 
assuredly augmented the list of executions. But for a certain time the 
preponderance of the argument lay on the side of the Demonologists.

Boehme, Jakob: (1575-1624): German Mystic. The name of this illustrious 
mystic and philosopher, who has excited so wide and lasting an influence, is 
sometimes spelt Beem or Behm, Behmon or Behmont, while commoner still is the 
form used at the head of this article; but it is probable that Jakob's name 
was really Bohme, for that spelling savours far more of bygone Germany than 
any of the multifarious others do. Born in 1575, at Altsteidenberg, in Upper 
Lusatia, the philosopher came of humble peasant stock, and accordingly his 
education consisted in but a brief sojourn at the village school of 
Seidenberg, about a mile from his own home, while the greater part of his 
childhood was spent in tending his father's flocks on the grassy sides of a 
mountain, known as the Landskrone. This profession doubtless appealed to a 
boy of speculative and introspective temperament, but betimes it transpired 
that Jakob was not strong enough physically to make a good shepherd, and 
consequently he left home at the age of thirteen, going to seek his fortune 
at Gorlitz, the nearest town of any size.
     To this day Gorlitz is famous for its shoemakers, while in Boehme's 
time it was a very centre and stronghold of the cobbling industry; so it was 
to a cobbler that the boy went first in search of employment, and very soon 
he had found what he wanted. Unfortunately, the few authentic records of his 
career offer little information concerning his early years, but apparently 
he prospered tolerably well, it being recorded that in 1599 he became a 
master-shoemaker, and that soon afterwards he was married to Kathar-ina, 
daughter of Hans Kantzschmann, a butcher. The young couple took a house near 
the bridge in Neiss Voistadt -their dwelling is still pointed out to the 
tourist-and some years later Boehme sought to improve his business by adding 
gloves to his stock in trade, a departure which sent him periodically to 
Prague to acquire consignments of the goods in question.
     It is likely that Boehme began to write soon after be-coming a master-
cobbler, if not even at an earlier period, but it was not till he was 
approaching forty that his gifts became known and appreciated. About the 
year 1612, he composed a philosophical treatise, Aurora, oder die Mor-
genrote un Aufgang, and, though this was not printed till much later, 
manuscript copies were passed from hand to hand, the result being that the 
writer soon found himself the centre of a local circle of thinkers and 
scholars, many of them people far above him in the social scale. These did 
not say that the cobbler should stick to his last, but realised that his 
intellect was an exceptionally keen one:
and Boehme would no doubt have proceeded to print and publish his work but 
for an unfortunate occurrence, just that occurrence which has always been 
liable to  harass the man of bold and original mind. In short, a charge of 
heresy was brought against him by the Lutheran Church; he was loudly 
denounced from the pulpit by Gregorius Richter, pastor primarius of Gorlitz, 
and anon, the town council, fearing to contend with the omnipotent eccles-
iastical authorities, took possession of the original manu-script of 
Boehme's work, and bade the unfortunate author desist from writing in the 
meantime. So far as can be ascertained, he obeyed instructions for a little 
while, per-haps fearing the persecution which would await him if he did 
otherwise, but by 1618 he was busy again, compiling polemical and expository 
treatises; while in 1622, he wrote certain short pieces on repentance, 
resignation, and the like. These last were the only things from his pen 
which were published in book form during his lifetime, and with his consent, 
nor were they of a nature likely to excite clerical hostility; but a little 
later Boehme circulated a less cautious theological work, Der Weg zu 
Christa, and this was the signal for a fresh outburst of hatred on the part 
of the church, Richter storming from his pulpit once again. The philosopher, 
however, contrived to go unscathed, and, during a brief sojourn at Dresden, 
he had the pleasure of listening to sundry orations made in his praise by 
some of his admirers, whose number was now greatly increased, But Boehme was 
not destined to survive this triumph long, for, struck down by fever at 
Dresden, he was carried with great difficulty to his home at Gorlltz, and 
there he died in 1624, his wife being absent at the time
     Boehme's literary output divides itself easily and natur-ally into 
three distinct sections, and indeed he himself observed this, and drew up a 
sort of specification wherein he virtually indicated his successive alms. At 
first he was concerned simply with the study of the deity, and to this 
period belongs his Aurora; next he grew interested in the manifestation of 
the divine in the structure of the world and of man, a predilection which 
resulted in four great works, Die Drei Principien Gottlichens Wes Wescus, 
Vom Dreifachen Leben der Menschen, Von der Menschwerdung Christi, and Von 
der Geburt and Bezlichnung Aller Wescu; while finally, he devoted himself to 
advanced theological speculations and researches, the main outcome being his 
Von Christi Testamenten and his Von der Chaden-wahl: Mysterium Magnum. Other 
notable work" from his hand, are his seven Quellgeister, and likewise his 
study of the three first properties of eternal nature, a treatise in which 
some of his ardent devotees have found Sir Adam Newton's formulae 
anticipated, and which certainly 
resembles Schelling's Theogonische Natur.
     Alchemist or not himself, Boehme’s writings demonstrate that he studied 
Paracclsas closely, while they also reflect the influence of Valentine 
Weigel, and of the earliest protestant mystic, Kaspar Schwenhfeld. Nor was 
it other than natural that the latter should appeal keenly to the 
philosopher of G6rlitz, he too being essentially a stout Protestant, and 
having little or nothing in common with the mystics of other forms of 
Christianity. That is to say, he is seldom or never dogmatic, but always 
speculative, true Teuton that he was; while his writings disclose none of 
those religious ecstasies which fill the pages of Santa Theresa, and he 
never talks of holding converse with spirits or angels, or with bygone 
saints; he never refers to miracles worked on his behalf, practically the 
one exception being a passage where he tells how, when a shepherd boy on the 
Landskrone, he was vouchsafed an apparition of a pail of gold. At the same 
time, he seems to have felt a curious and constant intimacy with the 
invisible world, he appears to have had a strangely per-spicacious vision of 
the Urgrund, as he calls it, which is, being literally translated, primitive 
cause; and it was probably his gift in these particular ways, and the 
typically German clearness with which he sets down his ideas and 
convictions, which chiefly begot his vast and wide influence over subsequent 
people inclined to mysticism. Through-out the latter half of the seventeenth 
century, his works were translated into a number of different languages, and 
found a place in the library of nearly every broadminded English theologian; 
while they proved a great and acknow-ledged source of inspiration to William 
Law, the author of Christian Perfection and A Serious Call to a Devout Life. 
Since then, various religious bodies, regarding Boehme as their high priest, 
have been founded in Great Britain and in Holland ; while in America, too, 
the sect known as Philadelphians owe their dominant tenets to the mystic of 
Gorlitz.	W. S. B-M.

Bogey : Perhaps derived from the Slavonic bog, god. Other forms of the name 
of this ancient sprite, spectre or goblin are bug-a-boo, boo (Yorkshire), 
boggart, bogle (Scotland), boggle, ho-guest, bar-guest, boll, boman, and 
bock. Bull-beggar is probably a form of bu and bogey allied to boll 
(Northern), an apparition.

Boguet Henri : Grand Justice of the district Saint Claude, in Burgundy, who 
died in 1619. He was the author of a work full of peurile and ferocious zeal 
against sorcerers. This book, published at the commencement of the seven-
teenth century, was latterly burnt because of the inhu-manities which 
crowded its pages. It is entitled Discours des sorciers, with many 
instructions concerning how to judge sorcerers and their acts. It is, in 
short, a compilation of procedures, at the majority of which the author has 
himself presided, and which exhibit the most incredible absurdities and 
criminal credulity. In its pages we dis-cover the proceedings against the 
unfortunate little Louise Maillat, who at the age of eight was possessed of 
eight demons, of Francoise Secretain, a sorceress, who had meetings with the 
said demons, and who had the Devil for her lover, and of the sorcerers Gros-
Jacques and Willir-moz. Claude Gailiard and Roland Duvernois and many others 
figure in the dreadful role of the sanguinary author's dread judgments. 
Boguet details the horrible doings of the witches' Sabbath, how the 
sorcerers caused hail to fall of which they made a powder to be used as 
poison, how they used an unguent which carried them to the Sabbath, how a 
sorcerer was enabled to slay whom he would by means of a mere breath, and 
how, when arraigned before a judge they cannot shed tears. He further 
enlarges on the Devil's mark which was found on the skins of these 
unfortunates, of how all sorcerers and magicians possess the power of 
changing their forms into those of wolves, and how, for these offences they 
were burnt at the stake without sacrament, so that they were destroyed body 
and soul. The work terminates with instructions to judges of cases of 
sorcery, and is often known as the Code des Sorciers.

Boh : A magical word greatly used to frighten children. a Greek word is 
synonymous with the Latin
"Clamor signifying our English" cry;" and it is possible that the cry of the 
ox "boo' may have suggested this exclamation, as this sound would quite 
naturally be very terrifying to a young child. One also suspects some con-
nection between this monosyllable and the " Bogle-boe' or "bwgwly" of Welsh 
people. According to Warton, it was the name of a fierce Gothic general, 
whose name like those of other great conquerors was remembered as a word of 
terror.

Bohmius, Jean : The author of a work entitled Pyschologie, a treatise on 
spirits, published at Amsterdam in 1632. Of its author nothing is known.

Bolomanoy : (See Belomancy.)

Bonati : A Florentine astrologer who flourished in the thir-teenth century. 
H lived in a most original manner, and perfected the art of prediction. When 
the army of Martin IV, beseiged Forli, a town of the Romagna, defended by 
the Count of Montferrat, Bonati announced to the Count that he would succeed 
in repulsing the enemy, but that he would be wounded in the fray. The event 
justified his prediction, and the Count who had taken with him the necessary 
materials to staunch his wound in case the pro-phecy came true, became a 
devout adherent of astrology. Bonati became a Franciscan towards the close 
of his life, and died in 1300. His works were published by Jacobus Cauterus 
under the title of Liber Astronomicus, at Augsberg. in 1491.

Boniface VIII., Pope : who gained an unenviable notoriety in Dante's Inferno 
has been regarded by many as an ex-ponent of the black art, and so romantic 
are the alleged magical circumstances connected with him that they are 
worthy of repetition. Boniface, a noted jurisconsult, was born at Anagni. 
about 1228, and was elected Pope in 1294. He was a sturdy protagonist of 
papal supremacy, and before he had been seated two years on the throne of 
St. Peter he quarrelled seriously with Phillippe le Bel, King of Prance, 
whom he excommunicated. This quarrel originated in the determination of the 
king to check in his own dominions the power and insolence of the church and 
the ambitious pretensions of the see of Rome. In 1303, Phillippe's min-
isters and agents, having collected pretended evidence in Italy, boldly 
accused Boniface of heresy and sorcery, and the king called a council at 
Paris to hear witnesses and pronounce judgment. The pope resisted, and 
refused to acknowledge a council not called by himself; but the insults and 
outrages to which he was exposed proved too much for him, and he died the 
same year, in the midst of these vindictive proceedings. His enemies spread 
abroad a report. that in his last moments he had confessed his league with 
the demon, and that his death was attended with "so much thunder and 
tempest, with dragons flying in the air and vomiting flames, and such 
lightning and other prodigies, that the people of Rome believed that the 
whole city was going to be swallowed up in the abyss." His successor, 
Benedict XI. undertook to defend his memory but he died in the first year of 
his pontificate (in 1304), it was said by poison, and the holy see remained 
vacant during eleven months. In the middle of June, 1305, a Frenchman, the 
archbishop of Bordeaux, was elected to the papal chair under the title of 
Clement V. 
     It was understood that Clement was raised to the papacy Boniface in a 
great measure by the king's influence, who is said to have stipulated as one 
of the conditions, that he should allow the proceedings against Boniface, 
which were to make his memory infamous. Preparations were again made to 
carry on the trial of Boniface, but the king's ne-cessities compelled him to 
seek other boons of the supreme pontiff, in consideration of which he agreed 
to drop the prosecution, and at last, in 1312, Boniface was declared in the 
council of Vienne, innocent of all the offences with which he had been 
charged.
     If we may place any faith at all in the witnesses who were adduced 
against him, Boniface was at bottom a freethinker, who concealed under the 
mitre, the spirit of mockery which afterwards shone forth in his country-man 
Rabelais, and that in moments of relaxation, especially among those with 
whom he was familiar, he was in the habit of speaking in bold-even in 
cynical-language, of things which the church regarded as sacred. Persons 
were brought forward who deposed to having heard expressions from the lips 
of the pope, which, if not invented or exag-gerated, savour of infidelity, 
and even of atheism. Other persons deposed that it was commonly reported in 
Italy, that Boniface had communication with demons, to whom he offered his 
worship, whom he bound to his service by necromancy, and by whose agency be 
acted. They said further, that he had been heard to hold conversation with 
spirits in the night; that he had a certain "idol" in which a "diabolical 
spirit" was enclosed, whom he was in the habit of consulting; while others 
said he had a demon enclosed in a ring which he wore on his finger. The wit-
nesses in general spoke of these reports only as things which they had 
heard; but one a friar, brother Bernard de Sorano, deposed, that when 
Boniface was a cardinal, and held the office of notary to Nicholas III., he 
lay with the papal army before the castle of Puriano, and he (brother 
Bernard) was sent to receive the surrender of the castle. He returned with 
the cardinal to Viterbo, where he was lodged in the palace  Late one night, 
as he and the cardinal chamberlain were looking out of the window of the 
room he occupied, they saw Benedict of Gaeta (which was Boniface’s name 
before he was made pope) enter a garden adjoining the palace, alone, and in 
a mysterious manner. He made a circle on the ground with a sword, and placed 
himself in the middle, having with him a cock, and a fire in an earthen pot 
(in quadam olla terrea). Having seated himself in the middle of the circle, 
he killed the cock and threw its blood in the fire, from which smoke 
immediately issued, while Benedict read in a certain book to conjure demons. 
Presently brother Bernard heard ,' great noise (rumorem magnum) and was much 
terrified. Then he could distinguish the voice of some one saying "Give us 
the share," upon which Benedict took the cock, threw it out of the garden, 
and walked away without uttering a word. Though he met several persons on 
his way, he spoke to nobody, but proceeded immediately to a chamber near 
that of brother Bernard, and shut himself up. Bernard declared that, though 
he knew there was nobody in the room with the cardinal, he not only hear( 
him talking all night, but lie could distinctly perceive strange voice 
answering him.

Bonnevault, Pierre : A sorcerer of Poitou in the seventeenth century, who 
was arrested as he was on his way to the Devil's Sabbath. He confessed that 
on the first occasion he had been present at that unholy meeting he had been 
taken thither by his parents and dedicated to the Devil, to whom he had 
promised to leave his bones after death but that he had not bargained to 
leave his infernal majesty his immortal soul. He admitted that he called 
Satan master, that the Enemy of Man had assisted him in various magical 
acts, and that he, Bonnevault, had slain various persons through Satanic 
agency. In the end he was con-demned to death. His brother Jean, accused of 
sorcery at the same time, prayed to the Devil for assistance, and was raised 
some four or five feet from the ground and dashed back thereon, his skin 
turning at the same time to a blue-black hue. He confessed that he had met 
at the Sabbath a young man through whom he had promised one of his fingers 
to Satan after his death. He also told how he had been transported through 
the air to the Sabbath, how he had received powders to slay certain people 
whom he named, and for these crimes he received the punishment of death.

Bonnevault, Maturin de : Father of the preceding also accused of sorcery, 
visited by experts who found upon his right shoulder a mark resembling a 
small rose, and when a long pin was thrust into this he displayed such signs 
of distress that it was judged that he must be a sor-cerer, indeed, he 
confessed that he had espoused Berthomee de la Bedouche, who with her father 
and mother practised sorcery, and how he had gone to seek serpents and toads 
for the purposes of their sorceries. He said that the Sab-bath was held four 
times yearly, at the feasts of Saint John the Baptist, Christmas, Mardi gras 
and Paques. He had slain seven persons by sorcery, and avowed that he had 
been a sorcerer since he was seven years of age. He met a like fate with his 
sons.

Book of Celestial Chivalry : Appeared in the middle of the sixteenth 
century. It is of Spanish origin; and treats of suppositious knightly 
adventures, in a semi-romantic, semi-mystical vein.

Book of Secrets : (See Kabala.)

Book of the Dead: An arbitrary title given to an Egyptian funerary work 
called pert em hru, the proper translation of which is: "coming forth by 
day," or ' manifested in the light." There are several versions or 
recensions of this work, namely those of Heliopolis, Thebes and Sais, these 
editions differing only inasmuch as they were edited by the colleges of 
priests founded at these centres. Many papyri of the work have been 
discovered, and passages from it have been inscribed upon the walls of tombs 
and pyramids. and on sarcophagi and mummy-wrappings. It is undoubtedly of 
extremely early date: how early it would indeed be difficult to say with any 
exactness, but in the course of centuries it was greatly added to and modi-
fied. In all, about 200 chapters exist, but no papyrus has been found 
containing. all these. The chapters are quite independent of one another, 
and were probably all com-posed at different times. The main subject of the 
whole is the beatification of the dead, who were supposed to recite the 
chapters in order that they might gain power and enjoy the privileges of the 
new life.
      The work abounds in magical references, and it is its magical side 
alone which we can consider here. The whole trend of the Book of the Dead is 
thaumatmagic, as its purpose is to guard the dead against the dangers which 
they have to face in reaching the other world. As in most mythologies, the 
dead Egyptian had to encounter malig-nant spirits, and was threatened by 
many dangers before reaching his haven of rest. He had also to undergo judg-
ment by Osiris, and to justify himself before being per-mitted to enter the 
realms of bliss. This he imagined he could in great part accomplish by the 
recitation of various magical formulae, and spells, which would ward off the 
evil influences opposed to him. To this end every Egyptian of means had 
buried with him a papyrus of the Book of the Dead, in which was contained at 
least all the chapters necessary to his encounter with such formidable 
adversaries as he would meet at the gates of Amenti (q.v.), the Egyptian 
Hades, and which would assist him in making replies during his ceremony of 
justification. First amongst these spells were the "words of power" (See 
"Egypt"). The Egyp-tians believed that to discover the" secret" name of a 
god was to gain complete ascendancy over him. Sympathetic magic was in vogue 
in Egyptian burial practice, for we find in Egyptian tombs of the better 
sort, paintings of tables laden with viands of several descriptions, the in-
scriptions attached to which convey the idea of boundless liberality. 
Inscriptions like the following are extremely common-" To the Ka or soul of 
so-and-so, 5,000 loaves of bread, 500 geese. and 5,000 jugs of beer." Those 
dedica-tions cost the generous donors little, as they merely had the objects 
named painted upon the wall of the tomb, imagining that their kas or astral 
counterparts would be eatable and drinkable by the deceased. This of course 
is merely an extension of the neolithic savage conception that articles 
buried with a man had their astral counter-parts and would be of use to him 
in another world.
     Pictorial representation played a considerable part in the magical 
ritual of the Book of the Dead. One of the pleasures of the dead was to sail 
over Heaven in the boat of Ra, and to secure this for the deceased one must 
paint certain pictures and mutter over them words of power. On this, Budge 
in his Egyptian Magic says  "On a piece of clean papyrus a boat is to be 
drawn with ink made of green abut mixed with anti water, and in it are to be 
figures of Isis, Thoth, Shu, and Khepera, and the deceased; when this had 
been done the papyrus must be fastened to the breast of the deceased, care 
being taken that it does not actually touch his body. Then shall his spirit 
enter into the boat of Ra each day, and the god Thoth shall take heed to 
him, and he shall sail about with him into any place that he wisheth. 
Elsewhere it is ordered that the boat of Ra be painted 'in a pure place,' 
and in the bows is to be painted a figure of the deceased; but Ra was 
supposed to travel in one boat (called Atet) until noon, and another (called 
Sektet) until sunset, and provision had to be made for the deceased in both 
boats. How was this to be done? On one side of the picture of the boat a 
figure of the morning boat of Ra was to be drawn, and on the other a figure 
of the afternoon boat; thus the one picture was capable of becoming two 
boats, And, provided the proper offerings were made for the deceased on the 
birthday of Osiris, his soul would live for ever, and he would not die a 
second time. According to the rubric to the chapter in which these 
directions are given, the text of it is as old, at least, as the time of 
Hesepti, the fifth king of the 1st. dynasty, who reigned about B.C. 4350, 
and the custom of painting the boat upon papyrus is prob-ably 
contemporaneous. The two following rubrics from Chapters CXXXIII. and 
CXXXIV., respectively, will explain still further the importance of such 
pictures
     "1. ' This chapter shall be recited over a boat four cubits in length. 
and made of green porcelain (on which have been painted) the divine 
sovereign chiefs of the cities; and a figure of heaven with its stars shall 
be made also, and this thou shalt have made ceremonially pure by means of 
natron and incense. And behold, thou shalt make an image of Pa in yellow 
colour upon a new plaque and set it at the bows of the boat. And behold, 
thou shalt make an image of the spirit which thou dost wish to make per-fect 
(and place it) in this boat, and thou shalt make it to travel about in the 
boat (which shall be made in the form .of the boat) of Ra; and he shall see 
the form of the god Ra himself therein. Let not the eye of any man what-
soever look upon it, with the exception of thine own self, or thy father, or 
thy son, and guard (this) with great care. Then shall the spirit be perfect 
in the heart of Ra, and it shall give unto him power with the company of the 
gods; and the gods shall look upon him as a divine being like
unto themselves; and mankind and the dead shall fall down upon their faces. 
and he shall be seen in the under-world in the form of the radiance of Ra.'
     “2.	'This chapter shall be recited over a hawk standing and 
having the white crown upon his head, (and over figures of) the gods Tem, 
Shu, Tefnut, Seb, Nut, Osiris, Isis, Suti, and Nephthys, painted in yellow 
colour upon a new plaque, which shall be placed in (a model of) the boat (of 
Ra) along with a figure of the spirit whom thou wouldst make perfect. These 
thou shalt anoint with cedar oil, and incense shall be offered up to then' 
on the fire, and feathered fowl shall be roasted. It is an act of praise to 
Pa as he journeyeth, and it shall cause a man to have his being along with 
Ra day by day, whithersoever the god vayageth; and it shall destroy the 
enemies of Ra in very truth regularly and continually.'"
It was understood that the words of power were not to be spoken until after 
death. They were "a great mys-tery" but "the eye of no man whatsoever must 
see it, for it is a thing of abomination for every man to know it. Hide it, 
therefore, the Book of the Lady of the Hidden Temple is its name." This 
would seem to refer to some spell uttered by Isis-Hathor which delivered the 
god Ra or Horns from trouble, or was of benefit to him, and it is concluded 
that it may be equally efficacious in the case of the deceased.
     Many spells were included in the Book of the Dead for the purpose of 
preserving the mummy against mouldering, for assisting the owner of the 
papyrus to become as a god and to be able to transform himself into any 
shape he desired. Painted offerings were also provided for him in order that 
he might give gifts to the gods. Thus. we see that the Book of the Dead was 
undoubtedly magical in its character, consisting as it did of a series of 
spells or words of power, which enabled the speaker to have perfect control 
over all the powers of Amenti. The only moment in which the dead man is not 
master of his fate is when his heart is weighed by Thoth before Osiris. If 
it does not conform to the standard required for justification, he is cast 
out; but this excepted, an absolute knowledge of the Book of the Dead 
safeguarded the deceased in every way from the danger of damnation. So 
numerous are the spells and charms for the use of the deceased, that to 
merely enumerate them would be to take up a good deal of space. A number of 
the chapters consist of prayers and hymns to the gods. but the directions as 
to the magical uses of the book are equally numerous. and the conception of 
supplication is mingled with the idea of circumvention by sorcery in the 
most extraordinary manner.

Born, Josephe-Francois: An alchemistical imposter of the seventeenth 
century, born at Milan, in 1627. In youth his conduct was so wayward that at 
last he was compelled to seek refuge in a church in dread of the vengeance 
of those whom. he had wronged. However, he speedily cloaked his 
delinquencies under the cloak of imposture and hypocrisy, and he pretended 
that God had chosen him to reform mankind and to re-establish His reign 
below. He also claimed to be the champion of the Papal power against all 
heretics and Protestants, and wore a wondrous sword which he alleged Saint 
Michael had presented him with. He said that he had beheld in heaven a 
luminous palm-branch which was reserved for him. He held that the Virgin was 
divine in nature, that she had conceived through inspiration, and that she 
was equal to her Son, with Whom she was present in the Eucharist, that the 
Holy Spirit was incarnate in her, that the second and third Persons of the 
Trinity were inferior to the Father. Accord-ing to some writers Born 
proclaimed himself as the Holy Spirit incarnate. He was arrested after the 
death of Innocent X by order of the Inquisition, and on 3rd of January, 
1661, condemned to be burnt as a heretic. But he succeeded in escaping to 
Germany where he received much money from the Queen Christina to whom he 
claimed that he could manufacture the Philosophers' Stone. He afterwards 
fled to Copenhagen, whence he wished to sail to Turkey. But he was tracked 
to a small village hard by and arrested along with a conspirator. He was 
sent back to Rome, where he died in prison, August 10th, 1695. He is the 
author of a work entitled, The Key of the Cabinet of the Chevalier Born 
(Geneva, 1681) which is chiefly concerned with elementary spirits, and it is 
this work which the Abbe de Villars has given in an abridged form as the 
Comte de Gabalis (q.v.).

Borroughs, George : (See America, U.S. of.)

Bors, Bohors or Boort : One of King Arthur's knights. He was associated with 
Sir Galahad and Lancelot in their search for the Holy Grail. He is the hero 
of many magical adventures; one of which we relate. During the quest for the 
Holy Grail, a damsel offers him her love, which he refuses; and she, with 
twelve other damsels, thereupon threatens to throw herself from a tower. 
Bors, though of a kindly disposition, thinks they had better lose their 
souls than his. They fall from the tower, Bors crosses himself, and the 
whole vanishes, being a deceit of the devil. After the quest is ended Bors 
comes to Camelot; he relates his adventures, which it is said were written 
down and kept in the Abbey of Salisbury.

Botanomancy : A method of divination by means of burning the branches of 
vervein and brier, upon which were carved the questions of the practitioner.

Bottle Imps : A class of German spirits, similar in many ways to Familiars. 
The following is the prescription of an old alchymist, given by the Bishop 
of Dromore in his Relics of Ancient Poetry, for the purpose of securing one 
of these fairies. First, take a broad square crystal or Vene-tian glass, 
about tree inches in breadth and length. Lay it in the blood of a white hen 
on three Wednesdays or three Fridays. Then take it and wash it with holy 
water and fumigate it. Then take three hazel sticks a year old; take the 
bark off them; make them long enough to write on them the name of the fairy 
or spirit whom you may desire three times on each stick, which must be fiat 
on one side. Bury them under some hill haunted by fairies on the Wednesday 
before you call her; and on the Friday following dig them out, and call her 
at night, or three, or ten o'clock, which are good times for this purpose. 
In order to do so successfully one must be pure, and face to-ward the East. 
When you get her, tie her to the glass.

Bourru : A monkish apparition spoken of in many tales as that of an 
imaginary phantom which appears to the Parisians, walking the streets in the 
darkest hours of the night, and glancing in at the windows of timid folk-
passing and re-parsing a number of times. Nurses are wont to frighten their 
small charges with the Monk Bourru. The origin of the spectre is unknown.

Boville (or Bovillus), Charles de : A Picard who died about 1553. He desired 
to establish in his work De sensu the opinion, anciently held, that the 
world is an animal,-an idea also imagined by Felix Nogaret. Others works by 
Boville are his Lettres, his Life of Raymond Lully, his Traite des douze 
nombres, and his Trois Dialogues sur l'Im-mortalite de l'Ame, le 
Resurrection, et la Fin du Monde,

Bowls, Magical : (See Magic.)

Boxhorn, Mark Querius : A celebrated Dutch critic, born at Bergen-op.Zoom, 
in 1612. His Treatise on Dreams (Leyden 1639) is of great rarity.

Braccesco, Jean : A canon and alchemist of Brescia, who flourished in the 
seventeenth century He gave much study to the hermetic philosophy, and 
commented upon the work of Geber. His most curious work is The Tree of Life 
a dissertation upon the uses of the Philosophers' Stone in medicine. (Rome. 
1542.)

Bradlaugh, Charles : A prominent member of the Committee of the London 
Dialectical Society, appointed in 1869 to investigate the alleged phenomena 
of spiritualism. He and Dr. Edmunds were among those who served on sub-
committee No, 5, which held seances with Home, at which the phenomena were 
not at all satisfactory. The two investigators named therefore signed a 
minority report, containing a careful and critical treatment of the 
evidence.

Bragadini, Mark Antony : An alchemist of Venice, beheaded in 1595, because 
he boasted that he had. made Some gold from a recipe which he had received 
from a demon. He was tried at Munich, by order of Duke William IL. Two black 
dogs which accompanied him were also arrested, charged with being familiars, 
and duly tried. They were shot with an arquebuse in the public square.

Brahan Seer, The : Coinneach Odhar (Kenneth Ore). Al-though Coinneach Odhar 
is still spoken of and believed in as a seer throughout the Highlands, and 
especially in the county of Ross and Cromarty, his reputation is of 
comparatively recent growth. The first literary reference to him was made by 
Hugh Miller in his Scenes and Legends of the North of Scotland (1835). About 
half a century later a collection of the Seer's predictions was published by 
the late Mr. Alexander Mackenzie, Inverness, the author of several clan 
histories. Many of these alleged foretellings are of a trivial character. 
The most important prophecies attributed to Coinneach (Kenneth) are those 
which refer to the house of Seaforth Mackenzies. One, which is sup-posed to 
have been uttered in the middle of the seven-teenth century, foretold that 
the last of the Seaforths would be deaf. It was uttered at Brahan Castle, 
the chief seat of the Seaforths, near Dingwall, after the seer had been 
condemned to death by burning, by Lady Seaforth for some offensive remark. 
He declared to her ladyship that he would go to heaven, but she would never 
reach it. As a sign of this he declared that when he was burned a raven and 
a dove would hasten towards his ashes. If the dove was the first to arrive 
it would be proved his hope was well founded. The same legend is attached to 
the memory of Michael Scott-a rather suggestive fact. Ac-cording to 
tradition, Kenneth was burned on Chanonry Point, near Fortrose. No record 
survives of this event. The first authentic evidence regarding the alleged 
seer, was unearthed by Mr. William M. Mackenzie, editor of Barbour's Bruce, 
who found among the Scottish Parlia-mentary records of the sixteenth century 
an order, which was sent to the Ross-shire authorities, to prosecute several 
wizards, including Coinneach Odhar. This was many years before there was a 
Seaforth. It is quite probable that Kenneth was burned, but the legendary 
cause of the tale must have been a" filling in" of late tradition. Kenneth's 
memory apparently had attached to it many floating prophecies and sayings 
including those attributed to Thomas and Michael Scott. The sayings of "True 
Thomas" were hawked through the Highlands in Gaelic chap books, and so 
strongly did the bard appeal to the imaginations of the eighteenth century 
folks of Inverness, that they associate him with the Fairies and Fingalians 
(Fians) of the local fairy mound, Tom-na-hurich. A Gaelic saying runs, "When 
the horn is blown, True Thomas will come forth."
Thomas took the place of Fingal (Finn or Fionn) as chief of the " Seven 
Sleepers" in Tom-na-hurich, Inverness. At Cromarty, which was once destroyed 
by the sea, Thomas is alleged to have foretold that it would be thrice 
destroyed. Of course, the Rhymer was never in Cromarty and probably knew 
nothing about it. As he supplanted Fingal at Inverness, so at Cromarty he 
appear." to have supplanted some other legendary individual. The only 
authentic historical fact which remains is that Coin-neach Odhar war a 
notorious wizard, and of mature years, in the middle of the sixteenth 
century. Wizards were not necessarily seers. It is significant that no 
reference is made to Kenneth in the letters received by Pepys from Lord 
Reay, regarding second-sight in the seventeenth century, or in the account 
of Dr. Johnson's Highland tour, although the learned doctor investigated the 
pro-blem sympathetically.
     In the Scottish Highlands no higher compliment could be paid to the 
memory of any popular man than to attribute to him the gift of "second 
sight." Rev. John Morrison, minister of Petty, near Inverness, who was a 
bard, was one of the reputed seers of this order. Many of his" wonderful 
sayings" were collected long after his death. Rev. Dr. Kennedy, a Dingwall 
Free Church minister, and a man of strong personality and pronounced piety, 
is reputed to have had not only the "gift of prophecy" but also the "gift of 
healing." He was himself a believer in "second sight" and stated that his 
father was able to foretell events. In his The Days of the Fathers in Ross-
shire (1861), he makes reference to several individuals who were similarly 
"gifted" with what he believed to be a God-given power. One of his seers was 
reputed to have foretold the "Dis-ruption" of the Church of Scotland about 
sixteen years before the event took place. By this time the seers had 
acquired the piety of the people who believed in them. Even the notorious 
Kenneth, the Brahan seer a Pagan and a wizard, became glorified by doubtful 
tradition, like the notorious Michael Scott, one of his prototype".
     References to second sight in the Highlands are made in the following 
publications: Kirk's Secret Commonwealth of Elves, Fauns and Fairies  
Martin's Western Isles of Scotland; Deuterosophia (Second Knowledge) or a 
Brief Discourse concerning Second Sight by Rev. John Frazer (Edinburgh, 
Ruddiman, Aned and Co, 1763), Miscellanies by John Aubrey, F.R.S (London, 
1696). That there is sufficient evidence to justify the serious 
investigation of "Second sight" phenomena in the Scottish Highlands, no 
doubt can remain. But that is no reason why the Bra Ii an Seer" legends 
should be accepted as genuine, especially when it is found that Kenneth died 
before the Seaforth branch of the Mackenzies came into existence. Whoever 
foretold the fall of that house. it was certainly not the "notorious wizard" 
of the Scottish Parliamentary records. No doubt, Kenneth made himself 
notorious by tyrannizing over a superstitious people in the sixteenth 
century, and was remembered on that account. During his lifetime he must 
have been credited with many hap-penings supposed to have been caused by his 
spells. After his death he gathered an undeserved reputation for prophecy 
and piety by the snowball process-a not un-familiar happening in the past of 
the Scottish Highlands, where Sir William Wallace, St. Patrick, St. Bean, 
and others were reputed to have been giants who flung glaciated boulders 
from hill-top to hill-top across wide glens and over lochs of respectable 
dimensions.                                         DONALD MACKENZIE.

Brahma Charin : (See India,)

Braid : (See Hypnotism.)
Breathings, The : One of the methods of yoga practice. There are three 
varieties of breathing amongst yogis: (s) by quite emptying the lungs. and 
holding them so as long as possible; (2) by filling the lungs as full as may 
be: and (3) by merely retaining whatever breath happens to be in them. 'It 
is thus possible to suppress thought, thereby saving up much vital force.

Bredis : French medium. (See France.)

Briah : In the Kabala, the third of the three stages of spirit progress, the 
three original ranks or classes. Men are called upon to proceed from the 
lower to the higher. In the Apocalypse Briah is represented as the feet of " 
the mighty angel with the face of the sun."

Briatic World : (See Kabala.)

Briccriu : surnamed "of the Poisoned Tongue": an Ulster chieftain mentioned 
in the myth of Cuchulain, a medieval Irish romance. It is said that upon one 
occasion he asked certain warriors to a feast, and started the question of 
which of them was the greatest. Conall, Laery, and Cu-chulain, were 
selected, and a demon called " The Terrible" was requested to decide the 
point. He suggested who. ever could cut off his, The Terrible's, head to-
day, and allow his own head to be cut off on the morrow, would be the most 
courageous, and therefore most deserve the title of champion. Cuchulain 
succeeded in beheading the devil, who immediately picked up his head and 
vanished. The next day he reappeared in his usual form in order to cut off 
Cuchulain's head.  On his placing his head on the block, the demon told him 
to rise, and acknowledged that he was champion of Ireland.

Bridge of Souls : The superstition that the souls of the dead sought the 
other world by means of a bridge is pretty widely disseminated. The Rev. S. 
Baring Gould in his Book of Folklore says: "As peoples became more civilised 
and thought more deeply of the mystery of death, they conceived of, a place 
where the souls lived on, and being puzzled to account for the rainbow, came 
to the conclusion that it was a bridge by means of which spirits mounted to 
their abode above the clouds. The Milky Way was called variously the Road of 
the Gods or the Road of Souls. Among the Norsemen, after Odin had 
constructed his heavenly palace, aided by the dwarfs, he reared the bridge 
Bifrost, which men call the rainbow, by which it could be reached. It is of 
three colours; that in the middle is red, and is of fire, to consume any 
unworthy souls that would venture up the bridge. In connection with this 
idea of a bridge uniting heaven and earth, up which souls ascended, arose 
the custom of persons constructing bridges for the good souls of their 
kinsfolk, On runic grave-stones in Denmark and Sweden we find such 
inscriptions as these 'Nageilfr had this bridge built for Anund, his good 
son.' 'The mother built the bridge for her only son.' 'Holdfast had the 
bridge constructed for Hame, his father, who lived in Viby.' 'Holdfast had 
the road made for Igul and for Urn, his dear wife.' At Sundbystein, in the 
Up-lands, is an inscription showing that three brothers and sisters erected 
a bridge over a ford for their father.
     The bridge as a means of passage for the soul from this earth to 
eternity must have been known also to the Ancients for in the cult of 
Demeter, the goddess of Death, at Eleusis, where her mysteries were gone 
through, in order to pass at once aiter death into Elyisium, there was an 
order of Bridge priestesses; and the goddess bore the name of the Lady of 
the Bridge. In Rome also the priest was a bridge-builder pontifex., as he 
undertook the charge of souls. In Austria and parts of Germany it is still 
sup-posed that children's souls are led up the rainbow to heaven. Both in 
England and among the Chinese it is regarded as a sin to point with the 
finger at the bow. With us no trace of the idea that it is a Bridge of Souls 
remains. Prob-ably this was thought to be a heathen belief and was ac-
cordingly forbidden, for children in the North of England
to this day when a rainbow appears, make a cross on the ground with a couple 
of twigs or straws, "to cross out the bow." The West Riding recipe for 
driving away a rain-bow is  "Make a cross of two sticks and lay four pebbles 
on it, one at each end."

Brig of Dread, The :  There is an old belief, alluded to by Sir Walter 
Scott, that the soul, on leaving the body, has to pass over the Brig of 
Dread, a bridge as narrow as a thread, crossing a great gulf. If the soul 
succeed in passing it he shall enter heaven, if he fall off he is lost.

Brimstone : Pliny says that houses were formerly hallowed against evil 
spirits by the use of Brimstone.

Brisin : An enchantress who figures in the Morte d'Arthur. She plays an 
important part in the annunciation of Galahad and the allurement of 
Lancelot.

British National Association of Spiritualists : A society formed in 1873, 
mainly through the instrumentality of Mr. Dawson Rogers, to promote the 
interests of spiritualism in Great Britain. It numbered among its original 
vice-presidents and members of council the most prominent spiritualists of 
the day-Benjamin Coleman, Mrs. Mak-dongall Gregory, Sir Charles Isham, 
Messrs. Jacken, Dawson Rogers. and Moreli Theobald, Drs. Wyld, Stanhope 
Speer. and many others-while many eminent people of other lands joined the 
association as corresponding members. The B.N.A.S. in 1882 decided to change 
its name to "The Central Association of Spiritualists." Among its com-
mittees was one for systematic research into the pheno-mena of spiritualism, 
in which connection some interesting scientific experiments were made in 
1878. Early in 1882 conferences were held at the Association's rooms, 
presided over by Professor Barrett, which resulted in the formation of the 
Society for Psychical Research. Many members of the latter society were 
recruited from the council of the B.N.A.S., such as the Rev. Stainton Moses, 
Dr. George Wyld, Messrs. Dawson Rogers, and Morell Theobald. The B.N.A .5. 
was at first associated with the Spiritualist, edited by W. H. Harrison, but 
in 1879 the reports of its proceedings were transferred to Spiritual Notes, 
a paper which, founded in the previous year, came to an end in 1881, as did 
also the Spiritualist. in the latter year Dawson Rogers founded Light, with 
which the society was henceforth associated.  From the beginning of its 
career, the B.N.A .5. has held itself apart from religious and philosophical 
dogmatism, and has included among its members spiritualists of all sects and 
opinions.

British Spiritual Telegraph : Spiritualistic journal.  (See Spiritualism.)

Britten, Mrs. Emma Hardinge : Mrs. Emma Hardinge, after-wards Mrs. Hardinge 
Britten, was a distinguished "in-spirational" speaker, a native of London, 
but whose first championship of spiritualism was carried out in America. In 
1865 she came to Britain with the intention of retiring from active service, 
but was persuaded by the spiritualists there to continue her labours.  Her 
eloquent extempore lectures, delivered presumedly under spirit control, 
dealt often with subjects chosen by the audience, and were of a lofty and 
erudite character. She was the author of a History of Modern American 
Spiritualism, and a careful, if biased resume' of spiritualism in all parts 
of the world, entitled Nineteenth Century Miracles.

Broceliande : A magic forest in Brittany, which figures in the Arthurian 
legend.  It was in this place that Merlin was enchanted by Nimue or Viviana, 
Lady of the Lake, and imprisoned beneath a huge stone. The name Bro-celiande 
is often employed as symbolic of the dim un-reality of legendary scenery.

Brohou, Jean : A physician of Coutarces, in the seventeenth century. He was 
the author of an 
Almanack or Journal of Astrology, with prognostications for the year 1572,
(Rouen, 1571), and a Description d'une Merveilleuse et Prodiigeuse Comete, 
with a treatise on comets, and the events they prognosticate (Paris, 1568).

Broichan, or Druid : (See Celts.)

Broom : In Romania and Tuscany it is thought that a broom laid beneath the 
pillow will keep witches and evil spirits away.

Broomstick : Witches were wont to ride through the air on switches or 
broomsticks, on their nocturnal journey to the Sabbath. Does the broomstick 
magically take the place of a flying home?

Brotherhood of the Trowel : An esoteric society which sprang up at Florence 
towards the end of the fifteenth century, which was composed of eminent 
architects, sculptors and painters; and continued in existents for over four 
hundred years. Their' patron was St. Andrew, whose festival was commemorated 
annually by ceremonies allied to the old Mysteries.

Brothers of Purity : An association of Arab philosophers founded at Bosra in 
the tenth century.. They had forms of initiation, and they wrote many works 
which were afterwards much studied by the Jews of Spain

Brown, John Mason: on prophecy by American medicine man. (See Divination.)

Browne, Sir Thomas : A learned English medical man who died in 1682 at an 
advanced age. Besides his famous Religio Medici and Urn Burial, he was 
chiefly celebrated by the manner in which he combatted popular errors in a 
work entitled Pseudodoxia Epadinium. an essay on popu-lar errors,-an 
examination of many circumstances in his time received as veritable facts, 
and which he proved to be false or doubtful. But frequently the learned 
author replaces one error by another, if on the whole his book is 
wonderfully accurate considering the date of its composi-tion. The work is 
divided into seven books, the first of which deals with those errors which 
spring from man's love of the marvellous; the second, errors arising from 
popular beliefs concerning plants and metals, the third, absurd beliefs 
connected with animals; the fourth book treats of errors relative to man; 
the fifth, errors recorded by pictures; the sixth deals with cosmographical 
and historical errors; and the seventh, with certain commonly accepted 
absurdities concerning the wonders of the world. For the publication of this 
work he was charged with atheism, which drew from him his famous Religio 
Medica

Bruhesen, Peter Van : A Dutch doctor and astrologer who died at Bruges, in 
1571. He published in that town in 1550 a Grand and Perpetual Almanack in 
which he scrupu-lously indicated by the tenets of judicial astrology the 
correct days for bathing, shaving, hair-cutting and so forth. The work 
caused offence to a certain magistrate of Bruges who plied the tonsorial 
trade, with the result that there appeared against Bruhesen's volume another 
Grand and Perpetual AImanack, with the flippant sub-title a scourge for 
empirics and charlatans. This squib was published by a rival medico, 
Francois Rapaert, but Peter Haschaerts, a surgeon, and a protagonist of  
astro-logical science, warmly defended Bruhesen in his Astro-logical 
Buckler.

Bruillant : One of the actors mentioned in the Grand Saint Graal. He it was 
who discovered the Grail Sword in Solomon's ship, and with it slew Lambor. 
For this use of the holy sword, however, the whole of Britain suffered, for 
no wheat grew, the fruit trees bare no fruit, and there was no fish in the 
sea. Bruillant himself was punished with death.

Buckingham, Duke of : (See England.)

Buddhic Plane : (See Intuitional World.)

Buer : According to Wierius, a demon of the second class. He has naturally 
the form of a star, and is gifted with a knowledge of philosophy and of the 
virtues of medicinal herbs. He gives domestic feliticy and health to the 
sick. He has charge over fifteen legions.

Buguet: A French photographer who came to London in 1874 and there produced 
spirit photographs with consid-erable skill. Many persons claimed to 
recognise their friends in the spirit pictures, and even after Buguet bad 
been arrested, and had confessed that he had resorted to trickery, there 
were yet a number of persons who refused to believe that he was a fraud, and 
thought that he had been bribed to confess trickery of which he was 
innocent. (See Spirit Photography.)

Bune : According to Wierius a most powerful demon, and one of the Grand 
Dukes of the Infernal Regions. His form is that of a man. He does not speak 
save by signs only, He removes corpses, haunts cemeteries, and marshals the 
demons around tombs and the places of the dead. He enriches and renders 
eloquent those who serve him. Thirty legions of the infernal army obey his 
call. The demons who own his sway called Bunis, are regarded by the Tartars 
as exceedingly evil. Their power is great and their number immense. But 
their sorcerers are ever in communication with these demons by means of whom 
they carry on their dark practices.

Burgot, Pierre : A werewolf, burned at Besancon in 1521 with Michel Verdun 
(q.v.).

Burial with Feet to the East: It was formerly the custom among Christians to 
bury their dead with the feet towards the east and head towards the west. 
Various reasons are given for this practice, some authorities stating that 
the corpse was placed thus in preparation for the resur-rection, when the 
dead will rise with their faces towards the east. Others think this mode of 
burial is practised in imitation of the posture of prayer.

Burma: A country east of India and south of China, and a province of British 
India, inhabited by an indigenous stock of Indo-Chinese type which 
originally migrated from Western China, at different periods, and which is 
now represented by three principal divisions, the Talaings, the Shans, and 
the Bama, or Burmese proper, although groups of several other allied races 
are found in the more remote portions of the country. The civilised part of 
the community, which, roughly speaking, is perhaps one half of the 
population, recognizes a religion the constituents of which are animism 
(q.v.) and Indian Brahmanic demon-olatry, modified to some extent by 
Buddhistic influences, and this cult is steadily making progress in the less 
en-lightened and outlying tribes. We have here to do only with that portion 
of the popular belief which deals with the more directly occult and with 
superstition, and we shall refrain from any description of Burmese religion 
proper which presents similar features to those cults from which it takes 
its origin, and which are fully described elsewhere.
     The Burmese believe the soul immaterial and indepen-dent of the body, 
to which it is only bound by special attraction. It can quit and return to 
the body at will, but can also be captured and kept from returning to it. 
After death the' soul hovers near the corpse as an invisible butterfly, 
known as leippya. A witch or demon may capture the leippya while it wanders 
during the hours of sleep, when sickness is sure to result. Offerings are 
made to the magician or devil to induce him to release the soul. The Kachins 
of the Northern Hills of Burma believe that persons having the evil eye 
possess two souls, the secondary soul being the cause of the malign 
influence.
     Belief in Spirits.-Belief in spirits, mostly malign, is very general in 
Burma, and takes a prominent place in the religious belief of the people. 
The spirits of rain, wind
and the heavenly bodies are in that condition of evolution which usually 
result' in their becoming full-fledged deities, with whom placation gives 
place to worship.
But the spirits of the forest are true demons with well-marked animistic 
characteristics.  Thus the nat or seiktha dwells in every tree or grove. His 
nature is usually malign, but occasionally we find him the tutelar or 
guardian of a village. In any case he possesses a shrine where he may be 
propiatiated by gifts of food and drink. Several of these demoniac figures 
have almost achieved godhead, so widespread have their cults become, and 
Hmin Nat, Chiton, and Wannein Nat, may be instanced as fiends of power. the 
dread of which has spread across extensive districts. The nats are probably 
of Indian origin, and although now quite animistic in character may at one 
time have been members of the Hindu pantheon. Many spirit families such as 
the Seikkaso, Akathaso, and Bommaso, who inhabit various parts of the jungle 
trees, are of Indian origin. The fulfillment of every wish depends upon the 
nats or spirits, who are all powerful as far as man is con-cerned. They are 
innumerable. Every house' has its complement, who swarm in its several rooms 
and take up their abode in its hearth, door-posts, verandahs, and corners. 
The nats also inhabit or inspire wild beasts, and all misfortune is supposed 
to emanate from them. The Burmans believe' that the more materialistic dead 
haunt the living with a malign purpose. The people have a great dread of 
their newly deceased ancestors, whom they imagine to haunt. the vicinity of 
their dwellings for the purpose of ambushing them. No dead body may be 
carried to a cemetery except by the shortest route, even should this 
necessitate the cutting a hole in the wall of the house. The spirits of 
those who have died a violent death haunt the scene of their fatality. Like 
the ancient Mexicans (See Ciupipiltin), the Burmans have a great dread of 
the ghosts of women who have died in childbed. The Kachins believe such 
women to turn. into vampires (swawmx) who are accompanied by their children 
when these die with them. The spirits of children are often supposed to in-
habit the bodies of cats and dogs. The Burmans are' extremely circumspect as 
to how they speak and act to-wards the inhabitants of the spirit-world, as 
they believe that disrespect or mockery will at once bring down upon them 
misfortune or disease. An infinite' number of guardian spirits is .included 
in the Burman demonological system, and these are chiefly supposed to be 
Brahmanic importations. These dwell in the houses like the evil nats, and 
are the tutelars of village communities, and even of clans. They are duly 
propitiated, at which ceremonies rice, beer, and tea-salad are offered to 
them. Women are employed as exorcists in a case of driving out the evil 
nats, but at the festivals connected with the guardian nats they are not 
permitted to officiate.
     Necromancy and Occult Medicine.-Necromancy is of general occurrence 
among the Burmese. The weza or wizards are of two kinds, good and evil, and 
these are again each subdivided into four classes, according to the 
materials which they employ, as, for example, magic squares, mercury or 
iron. The native doctors profess. to cure the diseases caused by witchcraft, 
and often specialise in various ail-ments. Besides being necromantic, 
medicine is largely astrological. There is said to be in Lower Burma a town 
of wizards at Kale Thaungtot on the Chindwin River, and many journey thence 
to have' the effects of bewitchment neutralised by its chief. Sympathetic 
magic is employed to render an enemy sick. Indian and native alchemy and 
cheiromancy are exceedingly rife. Noise is the uni-versal method of 
exorcism, and in casc3 of illness the patient is often severely beaten, the 
idea being that the fiend which possesses him is the sufferer.

Mediums and Exorcists.-The tumsa or natsaw are magi-cians, diviners, or 
“wise" men and women who practise their arts in a private' and not in a 
hierophantic capacity among the' rural Burmans. The wise man physician who 
works in iron (than weza) is at the head of his profession, and sells 
amulets which guard the purchasers from injury. female mediums profess to be 
the spouses of certain nats, and can only retain their supernatural 
connection with a certain spirit so long as they are wed to him. With the 
exorcists training is voluntary and even perfunctory. But with the mediums 
it is severe and prolonged. Among the civilised Burmans. a much more 
exhaustive apprentice-ship is demanded. Indeed a thorough and intricate 
knowledge of some' departments of magical and astrological practice is 
necessary to recognition by the brotherhood, the entire art of which is 
medico-magical. consisting of the exorcism of evil spirits from human beings 
and animals. The methods employed are such as usually accompany exorcism 
among all semi-civilised peoples, that is, dancing, flagellation of the 
afflicted person, induction of ecstasy, oblation to the' fiend in 
possession, and noise'.
     Prophecy and Divination.-These are purely popular in Burma, and not 
hierophantic, and in some measure are controlled by the use of the Deitton, 
an astrological book of Indian origin. The direction in which the blood of a 
sacrificed animal flows, the knots in. torn leaves, the length of a split 
bamboo pole, and the whiteness or otherwise' of a hard-boiled egg, serve 
among others as methods of au-gury. But by far the most important mode of 
divination in use in Burma is that by means of the' bones of fowls. It is 
indeed universal as deciding all the difficulties of Burmese existence.  
Those' wing or thigh bones in which the' holes exhibit regularity are 
chosen. Pieces of bamboo are inserted into these holes, and the resulting 
slant of the stick defines the augury. If the stick slants outwards it 
decides in favour of the measure under test, If it slants inwards, the omen 
is unfavourable. Other methods of divination are by the entrails of animals 
and by the con-tents of blown eggs.
     Astrology.-Burmese astrology derives both from Indian and Chinese' 
sources, and powerfully affects the entire people. Every Burman is fully 
aware from his private astrologer, of the' trend of his horoscope regarding 
the near future, and while active and enterprising on his lucky days, 
nothing will induce him to undertake any form of work should the day be' 
pyatthadane or ominous. The' Bedin-saya, or astrologers proper, practise a 
fully developed Hindu astrology, but they are few in number, and are 
practically neglected for the' rural soothsayers, who follow the Chinese 
system known as Hpewan, almost identical with the Taoist astrological tables 
of Chinese' diviners. From this system are' derived horoscope's, fortune's, 
happy marriage's, and prognostications regarding business affairs. But in 
practice' the' system is often confounded with the Buddhist calendar and 
much confusion results. The Buddhist calendar is in popular use', whilst 
the' Hpewan is purely astrological. Therefore' the Burman who is ig-norant 
of the latter must perforce consult an astrologer who is able' to collate 
the two regarding his lucky and unlucky days. The' chief horoscopic 
influences are day of birth, day of the week, which is represented by the' 
symbol of a certain animal, and the position of the dragon's mouth to the 
terminal syllables of the day-names.
Magic.-Burmese magic consists in the' making of charms the' manufacture of 
occult medicine which will cause' hallu-cination, second sight, the 
prophetic state, invisibility, or invulnerability.  It is frequently 
"sympathetic." (See Magic) and overlaps into necromancy and astrology. It 
doe's not appear to be at all ceremonial, and is to a great extent 
unsophisticated, save where it has been influenced
by Indian and Buddhist monks, who also draw on native sources to enlarge 
their own knowledge.

Busardier : An alchemist of whom few particulars are on record. He' lived at 
Prague' with a noble Courtier. Fall-ing sick and feeling the approach of 
death, he' sent a letter to his friend Richtausen, at Vienna, asking him to 
come' and stay with him during his last moments, Richtausen set out at once 
but on arriving at Prague found that Busardier was dead. On inquiring if the 
adept had left anything behind him the' steward of the nobleman with whom 
he' had lived stated that only some powder had been left which the' nobleman 
desired to preserve. Richtausen by some' means got possession- of the powder 
and took his departure. On discovering this the nobleman threatened to hang 
his steward if he' did not recover the powder. The steward surmising that no 
one but Richtausen could have taken the' powder, armed himself and set out 
in pursuit. Overtaking him on the road he' at the point of the pistol, made 
Richtausen hand over the' powder. Richtausen however contrived to abstract a 
considerable quantity. Richtausen knowing the' value' of the' powder 
presented himself to the Emperor Ferdinand, himself an alchemist, and gave 
him a quantity of the' powder. The Emperor assisted by his Mine Master, 
Count Russe', succeeded in converting three' pounds of mercury into gold by 
means of one grain of the powder. The Emperor is said to have commemorated 
the event by having a medal struck bear-ing the effigy of Apollo with the 
caduceus of Mercury and an appropriate' motto.
Richtausen was ennobled under the title of Baron Chaos. 
     Mr. A. E. White in his Lives of the Alchemists states that "Among many 
transformations performed by the same' powder was one by the Elector of 
Mayence, in 1651. He made' projections with all the' precautions possible to 
a learned and skilful philosopher. The powder enclosed in gum tragacanth to 
retain it effectually, was put into the wax of a taper, which was lighted, 
the' wax being then placed at the bottom of a crucet. These preparations 
were undertaken by the Elector himself. He poured four ounces of quicksilver 
of the wax, and put the whole' into a fire covered with charcoal above, 
below and around. Then they began blowing to the utmost, and in about half 
an hour on removing the coals, they saw that the melted gold was over red, 
the' proper colour being green. The baron said the matter was yet too high 
and it was necessary to put some silver into it. The Elector took some coins 
out of his pocket, put them into the melting pot, combined the liquefied 
silver with the matter in the crucet, and having poured out the whole' when 
in perfect fusion into a lingot, he found after cooling, that it was very 
fine gold, but rather hard, which was attributed to the lingot. On again 
melting, it became exceedingly soft and the Master of the Mint declared to 
His Highness that it was more than twenty-four carats and that he had never 
seen so fine a quality of the precious metal."

Butter, Witches' : The devil gives to the witches of Sweden cats which are 
called carriers, because they are' sent by their mistresses to steal in the 
neighbourhood. The greedy animals on such occasions cannot forbear to 
satisfy their own appetite's. Sometimes they eat to repletion and are 
obliged to disgorge their stolen meal. Their vomit is always found in 
kitchen gardens, is of a yellow colour, and is called witches' butter.

C

Caacrinolaas : According to Wierius (q.v.) Grand President of Hell also 
known as Caasimolar and Glasya.  He is figured in the shape of a god with 
the wings of a griffon. He is supposed to Inspire knowledge of the liberal 
arts, and to incite homicides.  It is this fiend who can render man 
invisible.  He commands thirty-six legions.


Cabiri, or more properly Cabeiri : A group of minor deities of Greek origin, 
of the nature and worship of whom very little is known.  The name appears to 
be of Semitic origin, signifying the “great gods," and the Cabiri seem to 
have been connected in some manner with the sea, protecting sailors and 
vessels. The chief seats of their worship were Lemnos, Samothrace, Thessalia 
and Boeotia. They were originally only two in number -the elder identified 
with Dionysus, and the younger identified with Hermes, who was also known as 
Cadmilus. Their worship was at an early date amalgamated with that of 
Demeter and Ceres, with the result that two sets of Cabiri came into being-
Dionysus and Demeter, and Cadmilus and Ceres.  A Greek writer of the second 
century B.C. states that they were four in number-Axisros, Axiokersa, 
Axiokersos, and Cas-milus, corresponding, he states to Demeter, Persephone, 
Hades and Hermes. The Romans identified the Cabiri with the Penates.  In 
Lemnos a festival of these deities was held annually and lasted nine days, 
during which all domestic and other fires were extinguished, and sacred fire 
was brought, from Dabs.  From this fact it has been judged that the Cabiri 
may have been volcanic demons; but this view has latterly been abandoned.  
It was in Samothracia that the cult of the Cabiri attained its widest 
significance, and in this island as early as the fifth century B.C. their 
mysteries were held with great eclat, and at-tracted almost universal 
attention. Initiation into these was regarded as a safeguard against 
misfortune of all kinds, and persons of distinction exerted all their 
influence to become initiates.  In 1888 interesting details as to the 
bacchanal cult of the Cabiri were obtained by the excava-tion of their 
temple near Thebes. Statues of a deity called Cabeiros were found, attended 
by a boy cup-bearer. His attributes appear to be bacchic.
     The Cabiri are often mentioned as powerful magicians, and Herodotus and 
other writers speak of the Cabiri as sons of Vulcan. Cicero, however, 
regards them as the children of Proserpine; and Jupiter is often named as 
their father. Strabo, on the other hand, regards them as the ministers of 
Hecate and Bochart recognises in them the three principal infernal deities, 
Pluto, Proserpine, and Mercury.  It is more than likely that they were 
originally of Semitic or Egyptian origin-more probably the former; but we 
find a temple of Memphis consecrated to them in Egypt.  It is not unlikely, 
as Herodotus supposes, that the cult is Pelasgian in origin, as it is known 
thatt the Pe-lasgians occupied the island of Samothrace, and established 
there certain mysteries, which they afterwards carried to Athens. There are 
also traditions that the worship of the Cabiri originally came from the 
Troad, a Semitic centre.  Kenrick in his Egypt  before Herodotus brings 
forward the following conclusions concerning the Cabiri
     “1. The existence of the worship of the Cabiri at Mem-phis under a 
pigmy form, and its connection with the worship of Vulcan.  The coins of 
Thessalonica also es-tablish this connection   those which bear the legend 
Kabeiros' having a figure with a hammer in his hand, the pileus and apron of 
Vulcan, and sometimes an anvil near the feet.
     “2. The Cabiri belonged also to the Phoenician the-ology.  The proofs 
are drawn from the statements of Herodotus. Also the coins of Cossyra, a 
Phoenician settlement, exhibit a dwarfish figure with the hammer and short 
apron, and sometimes a radiated head, apparently allusive to the element of 
fire, like the star of the Dioscuri.
     “3. The isle of Lemnos was another remarkable seat of the worship of 
the Cabiri and of Vulcan, as representing the element of fire. Mystic rites 
were celebrated here over which they presided, and the coins of the island 
ex-hibit the head of Vulcan, or a Cabirus, with the pileus, hammer and 
forceps. It was this connection with fire, metallurgy, and the most 
remarkable product of the art, weapons of war, which caused the Cabiri to be 
identified with the Cureks of Etolia, the Idaei Dactyli of Crete, the 
Corybantes of Phrygia, and the Telchines of Rhodes. They were the same 
probably in Phoenician origin, the same in mystical and orgiastic rites, but 
different in number. gene-alogy, and local circumstances, and by the mixture 
of other mythical traditions, according to the various coun-tries in which 
their worship prevailed. The fable that one Cabirus had been killed by his 
brother or brothers was probably a moral mythus representing the result of 
the invention of armour and analogous to the story of the mutual destruction 
of the men in brazen armour, who sprang from the dragon's teeth sown by 
Cadmus and Jason. It is remarkable that the name of the first fratricide 
sig-nifies a 'lance,' and in Arabic a 'smith.'
     "4. The worship of the Cabiri prevailed also in Imbros, near the 
entrance of the Hellespont, which makes it probable that the great gods in 
the neighbouring island of Samothrace were of the same origin. The Cabiri, 
Cu-retes, and Corybantes appear to have represented air as well as fire. 
This island was inhabited by Pelasgi, who may have derived from the 
neighbouring country of Thrace and Phrygia, and with the old Pelasgic 
mysteries of Ceres. Hence the various explanations given of the Samothracan 
deities, and the number of them so differently stated, some making them two, 
some four, some eight, the latter agree-ing with the number of early 
Egyptian gods mentioned by Herodotus.  It is still probable that their 
original number was two, from their identification with the Dios-curi and 
Tyndaridae, and from the number of the Pateeci on Phoenician vessels. The 
addition of Vulcan as their father or brother made them three, and a fourth 
may have been their mother Cabira.
     "5. The Samothracian divinities continued to be held in high veneration 
in late times, but are commonly spoken of in connection with navigation, as 
the twin Dioscuri or Tyndaridae; on the other hand the Dioscuri are spoken 
of as the Curetes or Corybantes. The coins of Tripolis exhibit the spears 
and star of the Dioscuri, with the legend' Cabiri.'
     "6. The Roman Penates have been identified with the Dioscuri, and 
Dionysius states that he had seen two figures of ancient workmanship, 
representing youths armed with spears, which, from an antique inscription on 
them, he knew to be meant for Penates.  So, the 'Lares' of Etruria and Rome.
     “7. The worship of the Cabiri furnishes the key to the wanderings of 
AEneas, the foundation of Rome, and the War of Troy itself, as well as the 
Argonautic expedition. Samothrace and the Troad were so closely connected in 
this worship, that it is difficult to judge in which of the two it 
originated, and the gods of Lavinium, the supposed colony from Troy, were 
Samothracian. Also the Palla-dium, a pigmy image, was connected at once with 
AEneas and the Troad, with Rome, Vesta, and the Penates, and the religious 
belief and traditions of several towns in the south of Italy. Mr. Kenrick 
also recognises a mythical personage in AEneas, whose attributes were 
derived from those of the Cabiri, and continues with some interesting  
observations on the Homeric fables. He concludes that the essential part of 
the War of Troy originated in the desire to connect together and explain the 
traces of ancient religion. It fine, he notes one other remarkable 
circumstance, that the countries in which the Samothracian and Cabiriac 
worship prevailed were peopled either  the Pelasgi, or by the AEolians, who 
of all the tribes comprehended under the general name Hellenes, approach the 
most nearly in antiquity and language to the Pelasgi, 'We seem warranted, 
then (our author observes), in two conclusions  first that the Pelasgian 
tribes in Italy, Greece and Asia were united in times reaching high above 
the commencement of history, by community of religious ideas and rites, as 
well as letters, arts, and language ; an( secondly, that large portions of 
what is called the hero history of Greece, are nothing else than fictions 
devise to account for the traces of this affinity, when time an the 
ascendancy of other nations had destroyed the primitive connection, and 
rendered the cause of the similarly obscure. The original derivation of the 
Cabiriac system from Phoenicia and Egypt is a less certain, though still 
highly probable conclusion.
     "8. The name Cabiri has been very generally deduce the Phoenician 
'mighty' and this etymology is in accordance with the fact that the gods of 
Samothrace were called ' Divi potes.' Mr. Kenrick believes, however, that 
the Phoenicians used some other name which the Greek translated' Kabeiros,' 
and that it denoted the two element of fire and wind'."
    Pococke in his India in Greece will have it that the Cabiri are the 
'Khyberi" or people of the " Khyber," or a Buddhist tribe - totally unlikely 
origin for them.
     In the Generations of Sanconiathon, the Cabiri an claimed for the 
Phoenicians, though we understand the whole mystically. The myth proceeds 
thus.  Of the Wind and the Night were born two mortal men, AEon and 
Protogonus. The immediate descendants of these were, 'Genus and 'Genea,' man 
and woman  To Genus were born their mortal children, Phos, Pur, and Phlox, 
who discovered fire, and these again begat "sons of vast bulk and height 
whose names were given to the mountains in which they dwelt, Cassiul, 
Libanus, Antilibanus, and Brathu. The issue of these giant men by their own 
mothers were Mein-rumus, Hypsuranius, and Usous.  Hypsuranius inhabited 
Tyre; and Usous becoming a huntsman, consecrated two pillars to fire and the 
wind, with the blood of the wild beasts that he captured. In times long 
subsequent to these, the race of Hypsuranius gave being to Agreus and 
Halieus, inventors, it is said, of the arts of hunting and fishing.  From 
these descended two brothers, one of whom was Chrysor or Hephaestus; in 
words,  charms and divinations; he also invented boats, and was the first 
that sailed. His brother first built walls with bricks, and their 
descendants in the second generation seem to have completed the invention of 
houses, by the addition of courts, porticos, and crypts. They are called 
Aletae and Titans, and in their time began husbandry and hunting with dogs. 
From the Titans descended Amynus, a builder, and Magus, who taught men to 
construct villages and tend flocks; and of these two were begotten Misor 
(perhaps Mizraim), whose name signifies Well-freed; and Sydic, whose name 
denotes the Just; these found the use of salt. We now come to the important 
point in this line of wonders. From Misor descended Taautus (Thoth, 
Athothis, or Hermes Trismegistus), who invented letters and from Sydic 
descended the Dioscuri, or Cabiri, or Cory-bantes, or Samothraces. These, 
according to Sanconia-thon, first built a complete ship, and others 
descended from them who discovered medicine and charms.  All this dates 
prior to Babylon and the gods of Paganism, the elder of whom are next 
introduced in the' Generations.' Finally, Sanconiathon settles Poseidon 
(Neptune) and the Cabiri at Berytus ; but not till circumsision, the sac-
rifice of human beings. and the portrayal of the gods had been introduced.  
In recording this event, the Cabiri are called husbandmen and fishermen, 
which leads to the presumption that the people who worshipped those ancient 
gods were at length called by their name. But little is known regarding the 
methods of initiation:-
     "The candidate for initiation was crowned with a garland of olive, and 
wore a purple band round his loins.  Thus attired, and prepared by secret 
ceremonies (probably mes-meric), he was seated on a throne brilliantly 
lighted, and the other initiates then danced round him in hieroglyphic 
measures.  It may be imagined that solemnities of this nature would easily 
degenerate into orgies of the most immoral tendency, as the ancient faith 
and reverence for sacred things perished, and such was really the case. 
Still, the primitive institution was pure in form and beautiful in its 
mystic signification, which passed from one ritual to another,  till its 
last glimmer expired in the freema-sonry of a very recent period. The 
general idea represented was the passage through death to a higher life, and 
while the outward senses were held in the thrall of magnetism, it is 
probable that revelations, good or evil, were made to the high priests of 
these ceremonies."
     It is extremely difficult to arrive at any scientific con-clusion 
regarding the origin of the Cabiri, but, to summarise, they were probably of 
Semitic origin, arriving in Greece through Phoenician influence; and that 
they approximated in character to the gods with whom the Greeks identified 
them is extremely likely. (See Strabo,L. 10; Varro, DeLinguaLatina, L. 4; 
Herodotus, L. 3, c. 37; Eusebius, Praep Evang; Pausanius, L. 9; Bryant, 
Antient Mythology, Vol.III.)


Cacodaemons : Deities of inferior rank, one of whom it was believed by many 
was attached to each mortal from his birth as a constant companion, and were 
capable of giving impulses, and acting as a sort of messenger between the 
gods and men. The cacodaemons were of a hostile nature, as opposed to the 
agathodaemons who were friendly.  It is said that one of the cacodaemons who 
appeared to Cassius was a man of huge stature, and of a black hue. The 
belief in these daemons is probably traditional, and it is said that they 
are the rebellious angels who were expelled from heaven for their crimes.  
They tried, but in vain, to obtain a settlement in various parts of the 
universe; and their final abode is believed to be all the space between the 
earth and the stars. There they abide, hated by all the elements, and 
finding their pleasure in revenge and injury. Their king was called Hades by 
the Greeks, Typhon by the Egyptians, and Ahrimanes by the Persians and 
Chaldaeans.


Cacodemon : The name given by the ancients to an evil spirit.  He changed 
his shape so frequently that no one could tell in what guise he most 
generally appeared to man.  Each person was also supposed to have a good and 
bad genius, the evil being the cacodemon. The astrologers also called the 
twelfth house of the sun, which is regarded as evil, that of cacodemon.


Cactomite : A marvellous stone, said to possess occult prop-erties, which 
was known to the ancients, and which was probably the cornelian.  Any one 
wearing it was supposed to be assured of victory in battle.


Caer : The daughter of Ethal Anubal, Prince of the Danaans of Connaught, and 
mentioned in Irish myths.  It was said that she lived year about in the form 
of a maiden and of a swan.  She was beloved by Angus Og, who also found 
himself transformed into a swan; and all who heard the rapturous song of the 
swan-lovers were plunged into a deep sleep, lasting for three days and 
nights.

Caetulum  : (See Lithomancy.)


Cagliostro : one of the greatest occult figures of all time.  It was the 
fashion during the latter half of the XIXth century to regard Cagliostro as 
a charlatan and impostor, and this point of view was greatly aided by the 
savage attack per-petrated on his memory by Carlyle, who alluded to him as 
the " Prince of Quacks."  Recent researches, however, and especially those 
made by Mr. W. R. H. Trowbridge in his Cagliostro : the Splendour and Misery 
of a Master of Magic (1910), go to show that if Cagliostro was not a man of 
unimpeachable honour, he was by no means the quack and scoundrel that so 
many have made him out to be.  In the first place it will be well to give a 
brief outline of his life as known to us before Mr. Trowbridge's exam-
ination of the whole question placed Cagliostro's circum-stances in a 
different light, and then to check the details of his career in view of what 
may be termed Mr. Trowbridge' s discoveries.
     We find that Carlyle possessed a strong prejudice in regard to 
Cagliostro, and that he made no allowance for the flagrant mendacity of the 
documentary evidence re-garding the so-called magician; and this leads up to 
the fact that although documents and books relating to Cag-liostro abound, 
they possess little or no value. An account compiled from all these sources 
would present the following features
     Cagliostro's father whose name is alleged to have been Peter Balsamo, a 
person of humble origin, died young, and his mother, unable to support him, 
was glad to receive assistance for this purpose from one of her brothers; 
but from infancy he showed himself averse to proper courses, and when placed 
in an religious seminary at Palermo, he more than once ran away from it, 
usually to be recaptured in undesirable company. Sent next to a Benedictine 
con-vent, where he was under the care of a Father Superior, who quickly 
discovered his natural aptitude, he became the assistant of an apothecary 
attached to the convent, from whom he learned the principles of chemistry 
and medicine; but even then his desire was more to discover surprising and 
astonishing chemical combinations than to gain more useful knowledge. Tiring 
of the life at last, he succeeded in escaping from the convent, and betook 
himself to Palermo where he associated with rascals and vagabonds.  He was 
constantly in the hands of the police, and his kind uncle who tried to 
assist him was rewarded by being robbed of a considerable sum.  Engaged in 
every description of rascality, he was even said to have assisted in the 
assassination of a wealthy canon.  At this time it is asserted that he was 
only fourteen years of age, but, later, becoming tired of lesser villainies 
he resolved upon a grand stroke, upon which to lay the foundations of his 
fortunes.
     At Palermo resided an avaricious goldsmith named Marano, a stupid, 
superstitious man who believed devout-edly in the efficacy of magic.  He 
became attracted to Cagliostro, who at the age of seventeen posed as being 
deeply versed in occultism, and had been seen evoking spirits. Marano made 
his acquaintance and confided to him that he had spent a great deal of money 
upon quack alchemists; but that he was convinced that in meeting him 
(Cagliostro) he had at last chanced upon a real master of magic.  Cagliostro 
willingly ministered to the man's superstitions, and told him as a profound 
secret that in a field at no great distance from Palermo lay a buried 
treasure which, by the aid of magic ceremonies he could absolutely locate. 
But the operation necessitated some expensive preliminaries-at least 60 oz. 
of gold would be required in connection with it. To this very considerable 
sum Marano demurred, and Cagliostro cooly asserted that he would enjoy the 
vast treasure alone. But the credulity of Marano was too strong for his 
better sense, and at length he agreed to furnish the necessary funds.
     At midnight they sought the field where it was supposed the treasure 
was hid.  Cagliostro proceeded with his in-cantations and Marano, terrified 
at their dreadful nature, fell prostrate on his face, in which position he 
was un-mercifully belaboured by a number of scoundrels whom Cagliostro had 
collected for that purpose. Palermo rang with the affair, but Cagliostro 
managed to escape to Messina, where he adopted the title of " Count."
     It was in this town that he first met with the mysterious Althotas.  He 
was walking one day in the vicinity of the harbour when he encountered a 
person of singular dress and countenance. This man, apparently about fifty 
years of age, was dressed as an oriental, with caftan and robes, and was 
accompanied by an Albanian greyhound. At-tracted by his appearance 
Cagliostro saluted him, and after some conversation the stranger offered to 
tell the pseudo-count the story of his past, and to reveal what was actually 
passing in his mind at that moment.  Cagliostro was in-terested and made 
arrangements for visiting the stranger, who pointed out to him the house in 
which he resided, requesting him to call a little before midnight, and to 
rap twice on the knocker, then three times more slowly, when he would be 
admitted. At the time appointed Cagliostro duly appeared and was conducted 
along a narrow passage lit by a single lamp in a niche of the wall. At the 
end of this was a spacious apartment illuminated by wax candles, and 
furnished with everything necessary for the practice of alchemy. Althotas 
expressed himself as a believer in the mutability of physical law rather 
than of magic, which he regarded as a science having fixed laws discoverable 
and reducible to reason.  He proposed to depart for Egypt, and to carry 
Cagliostro thither with him-a proposal which the latter joyfully accepted. 
Althotas acquainted him with the fact that he possessed no funds, and upon 
Cag-liostro's expressing some annoyance at this circumstance laughed at him, 
telling him that it was an easy matter for him to make sufficient gold to 
pay the expenses of their voyage. Authorities differ greatly regarding the 
per-sonality of Althotas; but we will leave this part of the Cagliostro 
mystery for the moment.
     Embarking upon a Genoese ship they duly came to Alexandria where 
Althotas told his comrade that he was absolutely ignorant regarding his 
birth and parentage, and said that he was much older than he appeared to be, 
but that he was in possession of certain secrets for the preservation of 
strength and health. "Nothing" he said "astonishes me; nothing grieves me, 
save the evils which I am powerless to prevent; and I trust to reach in 
peace the term of my protracted existence."  His early years had been passed 
near Tunis on the coast of Barbary, where he had been the slave of a wealthy 
Mussulman pirate.  At twelve years of age he spoke Arabic fluently, studied 
botany, and read the Koran to his master, who died when Althotas was 
sixteen. Althotas now found himself free and master of a very considerable 
sum which had been bequeathed him by his late owner.
     Accompanied by Cagliostro he penetrated into Africa and the heart of 
Egypt, visiting the Pyramids, making the acquaintance of the priests of 
different temples, and receiving from them much hidden knowledge.  (The 
slightest acquaintance with Egyptian history would have saved the author of 
this statement from making such an absurd anachronism). Following upon their 
Egyptian tour, however, they visited the principal kingdoms of Africa and 
Asia, and they are subsequently discovered at Rhodes pursuing alchemical 
operations. At Malta they assisted the Grand-master Pinto, who was 
infatuated with alchemical experiments, and from that moment Althotas 
completely disappears-the memoir of Cagliostro merely sta-ting that during 
their residence in Malta he passed away. Cagliostro on the death of his 
comrade repaired to Naples. He was in funds, for Pinto had well provided him 
before he left Malta.  In Naples he met with a Sicilian prince, who 
conceived a strong predilection for his society, and invited him to his 
castle near Palermo.  This was dan-gerous ground but Cagliostro was nothing 
if not courageous, and besides he was curious to revisit the haunts of his 
youth. He had not been long in Palermo when one day he travelled to Messina 
where he encountered by chance one of his confederates in the affair of 
Marano the gold-smith. This man warned him strongly not to enter the town of 
Palermo, and finally persuaded him to return to Naples to open a gambling-
house for the plucking of wealthy foreigners. This scheme the pair carried 
out, but the Neapolitan authorities regarded them with such grave suspicion 
that they betook themselves to the Papal States. Here they parted company, 
and regarding this time the alleged memoir of Cagliostro is not very clear. 
It however leads us to believe that the so-called Count had no lack of 
dupes, and from this obscurity he emerges' at Rome where we find him 
established as an empiric, retailing specifics for all the diseases that 
flesh is heir to. Money flowed in upon him, and he lived in considerable 
luxury.
     It was at this time that he met the young and beautiful Lorenza 
Feliciani, to whom he proposed marriage; her father dazzled by Cagliostro's 
apparent wealth and im-portance consented, and the marriage took place with 
some ceremony. All biographers of Cagliostro agree in stating that Lorenza 
was a thoroughly good woman, honest, devoted and modest. The most dreadful 
accusations have been made concerning the manner in which Cagliostro treated 
his wife, and it has been alleged that he thoroughly ruined her character 
and corrupted her mind.  But we shall discover later that this account has 
been coloured by the unscrupulous imagination of the Jesuitical writers of 
the Roman Inquisition. All biographers agree that Cagliostro hastened his 
wife's ruin, but it is difficult to know how they came by their data; and in 
any case they disagree substantially in their details.  Cagliostro's resi-
dence now became the resort of card-sharpers and other undesirables. and it 
is said that he himself assumed the title and uniform of a Prussian colonel; 
but he and his confederates quarrelled and with his wife he was forced to 
quit Rome with a so-called Marquis D'Agriata. They took the road to Venice, 
and reached Bergamo, which through their rogueries they had speedily to 
leave. They then made the best of their way through Sardinia and Genoa, and 
indeed spent several years in wandering through Southern Europe. At last 
they arrived in Spain by way of Barcelona, where they tarried for six 
months. proceeding afterwards to Madrid and Lisbon.  From Lisbon they sailed 
to England, where Cagliostro lived upon his wits, duping certain 
foreigners.. An English life of Cagliostro gives an account of his 
adventures in London, and tells how he was robbed of a large sum in plate, 
jewels and money; how he hired apartments in Whitcomb Street, where he spent 
most of his time in studying chemistry and physics, giving away much money 
and comporting himself generously and decently on all sides.
     In 1772 he returned to France with his wife and a certain Duplaisir. At 
this time it is said that Duplaisir eloped with Lorenza, and that Cagliostro 
obtaining an order for her arrest, she was imprisoned in a penitentiary, 
where she was detained for several months.  On her release, it is alleged, 
an immediate reconciliation occurred between husband and wife. At this time 
Cagliostro had attracted much attention in Paris by his alchemical 
successes.  It was the period of mystic enthusiasm in Europe, when princes, 
bishops, and the nobility generally were keen to
probe the secrets of nature, and when alchemy and the allied sciences were 
the pursuits and hobbies of the great. But according to his Italian 
biographer Cagliostro went too far and raised such hopes in the breasts of 
his dupes that at last they entertained suspicions of his honesty, so that 
he was' forced to flee to Brussels, whence he made his way to his native 
town of Palermo, where he was speedily arrested by the goldsmith Marano.  A 
certain nobleman, however, interested himself on his behalf, and procured 
his release, and he embarked with his wife who had accom-panied him, for 
Malta.  From that island they soon retired to Naples, and from there to 
Marseilles and Barcelona. Their progress was marked by considerable state, 
and having cheated a certain alchemist of 100,000 crowns under the pretence 
of achieving some alchemical secret, they hurried to England.
      It was during his second visit to London that the Count was initiated 
into Masonry, and conceived his great idea of employing that system for his 
own behoof. With this grand object in view he incessantly visited the 
various London Lodges, and ingratiated himself with their prin-cipals and 
officials. At this period he is said to have picked up in an obscure London 
bookstall a curious manuscript which is said to have belonged to a certain 
George Gaston, concerning whom nothing is known. This document dealt with 
the mysteries of Egyptian Masonry, and abounded in magical and mystical 
references.  It was from this, it is alleged, that Cagliostro gathered his 
occult inspirations. He studied it closely and laid his plans carefully.  
After another and somewhat harassed tour through Holland, Italy and Germany, 
he paid a visit to the celebrated Count de St. Germain.  In his usual 
eccentric manner, St. Ger-main arranged their meeting for the hour of two in 
the morning, at which time Cagliostro and his wife, robed in white garments, 
and cinctured by girdles of rose colour, presented themselves before the 
Count's temple of mystery. The drawbridge was lowered, and a man of 
exceptional height led them into a dimly lighted apartment where folded 
doors sprang suddenly open, and they beheld a temple illuminated by hundreds 
of wax lights. The Count of St. Germain sat upon the altar, and at his feet 
two aco-lytes swung golden censers.  In the Lives of the AIchemystical 
Philosophers this interview is thus detailed.  " The divinity bore upon his 
breast a diamond pentagram of almost intolerable radiance.  A majestic 
statue, white and diaphanous, upheld on the steps of the altar a vase 
inscribed, ' Elixir of Immortality,' while a vast mirror was on the wall, 
and before it a living being, majestic as the statue, walked to and fro. 
Above the mirror were these singular words'-' Store House of Wandering 
Souls.' The most solemn silence prevailed in this sacred retreat, but at 
length a voice, which seemed hardly a voice, pronounced these words'-' Who 
are you ? Whence come you? What would you?' Then the Count and Countess Cag-
liostro prostrated themselves, and the former answered after a long pause, ' 
I come to invoke the God of the faith-ful, the Son of Nature, the Sire of 
Truth.  I come to demand of him one of the fourteen thousand seven hundred 
secrets which are treasured in his breast, I come to proclaim myself his 
slave, his' apostle his' martyr.'
     "The divinity did not respond, but after a long silence, the same voice 
asked :-' What does the partner of thy long wanderings intend?'
     “To obey and to serve,” answered Lorenza.
     "Simultaneously with her words, profound darkness succeeded the glare 
of light, uproar followed on tranquillity, terror on trust, and a sharp and 
menacing voice cried loudly :-' Woe to those who cannot stand the tests.'
     "Husband and wife were immediately separated to undergo their 
respective trials, which they endured with exemplary fortitude, and which 
are detailed in the text of their memoirs.  When the romantic mummery was 
over,  the two postulants' were led back into the temple with the promise of 
admission to the divine mysteries'  There a man mysteriously draped in a 
long mantle cried out to them :- Know ye that the arcanum of our great art 
is the government of mankind, and that the one means to rule them is never 
to tell them the truth. Do not foolishly regulate your actions according to 
the rules of common sense; rather outrage reason and cour-ageously maintain 
every unbelievable absurdity. Re-member that reproduction is the palmary 
active power in nature, politics and society alike; that it is a mania with 
mortals' to be immortal, to know the future without under-standing the 
present, and to be spiritual while all that surrounds' them is material.'
     "After this harangue the orator genuflected devoutly before the 
divinity of the temple and retired.  At the same moment a man of gigantic 
stature led the countess to the feet of the immortal Count de St. Germain 
who thus spoke
     “’Elected from my tenderest youth to the things of greatness, I 
employed myself in ascertaining the nature of veritable glory.  Politics 
appeared to me nothing but the science of deception, tactics the art of 
assassination, philosophy the ambitious' imbecility of complete irration-
ality; physics fine fancies about Nature and the continual mistakes of 
persons' suddenly transplanted into a country which is utterly unknown to 
them; theology the science of the misery which results from human pride; 
history the melancholy spectacle of perpetual perfidy and blun-dering. 
Thence I concluded that the statesman was a skilful liar, the hero an 
illustrious' idiot, the philosopher an eccentric creature, the physician a 
pitiable and blind man, the theologian an anatical pedagogue, and the his-
torian a word-monger.  Then did I hear of the divinity of this temple.  I 
cast my cares upon him, with my in-certitudes and aspirations. When he took 
possession of my soul he caused me to perceive all objects' in a new light; 
I began to read futurity.  This' universe so limited, so narrow, so desert, 
was now enlarged.  I abode not only with those who are, but with those who 
were. He united me to the loveliest women of antiquity.  I found it em-
inently delectable to know all without studying anything, to dispose of the 
treasures of the earth without the so-licitations of monarchs', to rule the 
elements rather than men.  Heaven made me liberal;  I have sufficient to 
satisfy my taste; all that surrounds me is rich, loving, predestinated.
     When the service was finished the costume of ordinary life was resumed.  
A superb repast terminated the cere-mony. During the course of the banquet 
the two guests were informed that the Elixir of Immortality was merely Tokay 
coloured green or red according to the necessities of the case.  Several 
essential precepts were enjoined upon them, among others that they must 
detest, avoid, and calumniate men of understanding, but flatter, foster, and 
blind fools, that they must spread abroad with much mystery the intelligence 
that the Count de St. Germain was' five hundred years old, and that they 
must make gold, but dupes before all."
     There is no good authority for this singular interview, but if it 
really occurred it only probably served to confirm Cagliostro in the 
projects he had mapped out for himself.
     Travelling into Courland, he and his wife succeeded in establishing 
several Masonic Lodges according to the rite of what he called Egyptian 
Freemasonry.  Persons of high rank flocked around the couple, and it is even 
said that he plotted for the sovereignty of the Grand Duchy. Be this as' it 
may, it is alleged that he collected a very large treasure of presents and 
money, and ret out for St. Peters-burg, where. he established himself as a 
physician.
     A large number of cures have been credited to Cagliostro throughout 
his' career, and his' methods have been the subject of considerable 
controversy.  But there is' little doubt that the basis of them was a 
species' of mesmeric influence.  It has' been said that he trusted simply to 
the laying on of hands; that he charged nothing for his ser-vice; that most 
of his' time was occupied in treating the poor, among whom he distributed 
vast amounts of money. The source of this wealth was' said to have been 
derived from the Masonic Lodges', with whose assistance and coun-tenance he 
had undertaken this' work.
     Returning to Germany he was received in most of the towns' through 
which he passed as a benefactor of the human race. Some regarded his cures 
as' miracles, others' as' sorceries, while he himself asserted that they 
were effected by celestial aid.
     For three years Cagliostro remained at Strasburg, feted and lauded by 
all.  He formed a strong friendship with the famous Cardinal-archbishop, the 
Prince de Rohan who was' fired by the idea of achieving alchemical 
successes. Rohan was' extremely credulous, and leaned greatly to the 
marvellous. Cagliostro accomplished supposed transmutations under his eyes, 
and the Prince delighted with the seeming successes lavished immense sume 
upon the Count.  He even believed that the elixir of life was known to 
Cagliostro and built a small house in which he was to undergo a physical 
regeneration. When he had sucked the Prince almost dry, Cagliostro repaired 
to Bordeaux, proceeding afterwards' to Lyons', where he occupied him-self 
with the foundation of headquarters' for his Egyptian Masonic rite. He now 
betook himself to Paris, where he assumed the role of a master of practical 
magic, and where it is said he evoked phantoms which he caused to appear at 
the wish of the enquirer in a vase of clear water, or mirror. Mr. Waite 
thinks in this connection that fraud was an impossibility, and appears to 
lean to the theory that the visions evoked by Cagliostro were such as occur 
in crystal-gazing, and that no one was more astonished than the Count 
himself at the results he obtained. Paris' rang with his name and he won the 
appellation of the "Divine Cagliostro."  Introduced to the Court of Louis' 
XVI. he succeeded in evoking apparitions in mirrors be-fore many spectators-
these including many deceased persons specially selected by those present. 
His residence was' isolated and surrounded by gardens, and here he es-
tablished a laboratory.  His wife affected great privacy, and only appeared 
in a diaphanous costume at certain hours, before a very select company. 
This' heightened the mystery surrounding them, and the elite of Parisian 
society vied with one another to be present at their magic suppers', at 
which the evocation of the illustrious' dead the principal amusement. It is 
even stated that deceased statesmen, authors and nobles took their seats at 
Cagliostro's supper-table.
     But the grand object of Cagliostro appears to have been the spread of 
his Egyptian Masonic rite.  The lodges which he founded were androgynal, 
that is they admitted both men and women; the ladies being instructed by the 
Mas-ter's' wife, who figured as the Grand Mistress' of the Order
-her husband adopting the title of Grand Copt. There is little doubt that a 
good deal of money was subscribed by the neophytes of the various lodges: 
the ladies who joined, each sacrificing on the altar of mysticism no less 
than 100 louis; and Cagliostro's immense wealth, which has' never been 
doubted by any authority on his life, in the strictest probability found 
its' source in the numerous gifts which showered in upon him from the 
powerful and wealthy for the purpose of furthering his masonic schemes.
     But although he lived in considerable magnificence, Cag-liostro by no 
means led a life of abandoned luxury; for there is the best evidence that he 
gave away vast sums to the poor and needy, that he attended the sick hand 
and foot, and in short played the part of healer and reformer at one and the 
same time.
     A great deal of mystery surrounded the doings of the Egyptian Masonry 
in its headquarters in the Faubourg Saint Honor, and the seances for 
initiation took place at midnight. Figuier and the Marquis de Luchet have 
both given striking accounts of what occurred during the female initiations
    “On entering the first apartment," says Figuier, "the ladies were 
obliged to disrobe and assume a white garment, with a girdle of various 
colours. They were divided into six groups, distinguished by the tint of 
their cinctures A large veil was also provided, and they were caused to 
enter a temple lighted from the root and furnished with thirty-six arm-
chairs covered with black satin  Lorenza clothed in white, was seated On a 
species of throne, sup-ported by two tall figures, 50 habited that their sex 
could not be determined. The light was lowered by degrees till surrounding 
objects could scarcely be distinguished, when the Grand Mistress commanded 
the ladies to uncover their left legs as far as the thigh, and raising the 
right arm to rest it on a neighbouring pillar. Two young women then entered 
sword in hand, and with silk ropes bound all the ladies together by the arms 
and legs. Then after a period of impressive silence, Lorenza pronounced an 
oration, which is given at length, but on doubtful authority, by several 
biographers, and which preached fervidly the emancipation of womankind from 
the shameful bonds imposed on them by the lords of creation.
     "These bonds were symbolised by the silken ropes from which the fair 
initiates were released at the end of the harangue, when they were conducted 
into separate apart-ments, each opening on the Garden, where they had the 
most unheard-of experiences. Some were pursued by men who unmercifully 
persecuted' them with barbarous solicitations; others encountered less 
dreadful admirers, who sighed in the most languishing postures at their 
feet. More than one discovered the counterpart of her own love but the oath 
they had all taken necessitated the most in-exorable inhumanity, and all 
faithfully fulfilled what was required of them. The new spirit infused into 
regenerated woman triumphed along the whole line of the six and thirty 
initiates, who with intact and immaculate symbols re-entered triumphant and 
palpitating, the twilight of the vaulted temple to receive the 
congratulations of the sovereign priestess.
     “When they had breathed a little after their trials, the vaulted roof 
opened suddenly, and, on a vast sphere of gold, there descended a man, naked 
as the unfallen Adam, holding a serpent in his hand, and having a burning 
star upon his head.
     "The Grand Mistress announced that this was the genius of Truth, the 
immortal, the divine Cagliostro, issued with-out procreation from the bosom 
of our father Abraham, and the depositary of all that hath been, is, or 
shall be known on the universal earth.  He was there to initiate them into 
the secrets of which they had been fraudently deprived. The Grand Copt 
thereupon commanded them to dispense with the profanity of clothing, for if 
they would receive truth they must be as naked as itself. The sov-ereign 
priestess setting the example unbound her girdle and permitted her drapery 
to fall to the ground, and the fair initiates following her example exposed 
themselves in all the nudity of their charms to the magnetic glances of the 
celestial genius, who then commenced his revelations.
     "He informed his daughters that the much abused magical art was the 
secret of doing good to humanity. It was initiation into the mysteries of 
Nature, and the power to make use of her occult force?. The visions which 
they had beheld in the Garden where so many had seen and recognised those 
who were dearest to their hearts, proved the reality of hermetic operations. 
They had shewn themselves worthy to know the truth; he under-took to 
instruct them by gradations therein.  It was enough at the outset to inform 
them that the sublime end of that Egyptian Freemasonry which he had brought 
from the very heart of the Orient was the happiness of mankind. This 
happiness was illimitable in its nature, including material enjoyments as 
much as spiritual peace, and the pleasures of the understanding.
     The Grand Copt at the end of this harangue once more seated himself 
upon the sphere of gold and was borne away through the roof; and the 
proceedings ended, rather absurdly in a ball. This sort of thing was of 
course as the breath of his nostrils to Cagliostro, who could not have 
existed without the atmosphere of theatrical mysticism, in which he 
perfectly revelled.
     It was at this period that Cagliostro became implicated in the 
extraordinary affair of the Diamond Necklace. He had been on terms of great 
intimacy with the Cardinal de Rohan. A certain Countess de Lamotte had 
petitioned that prince for a pension on account of long aristocratic 
descent. De Rohan was greatly ambitious to become First Minister of the 
Throne, but Marie Antoinette, the Queen, disliked him and stood in the way 
of such an honour. Mm. Lamotte soon discovered this, and for purposes of her 
own told the Cardinal that the Queen favoured his am-bitions, and either 
forged, or procured someone else to forge, letters to the Cardinal 
purporting to come from the Queen, some of which begged for money for a poor 
family in which her Majesty was interested. The letters con-tinued of the 
begging description, and Rohan, who was himself heavily in debt, and had 
misappropriated the funds of various institutions, was driven into the hands 
of money-lenders. The wretched Countess de Lamotte met by chance a poor 
woman whose resemblance to the Queen was exceedingly marked. This person she 
trained to represent Marie Antoinette, and arranged nightly meetings between 
her and Rohan, in which the disguised woman made all sorts of promises to 
the Cardinal. Be-tween them the adventuresses mulcted the unfortunate 
prelate in immense sums. Meanwhile a certain Bahmer, a jeweller, was very 
desirous of selling a wonderful diamond necklace in which, for over ten 
years he had locked up his whole fortune. Hearing that Mme. de Lamotte had 
great influence 'with the Queen, he approached her for the purpose of 
getting her to induce Marie Antoinette to purchase it. She at once 
corresponded with De Rohan on the matter, who came post haste to Paris, to 
be told by Mme. de Lamotte that the Queen wished him to be security for the 
purchase of the necklace, for which she had agreed to pay 1,600,000 livres, 
or £64,000, in four half-yearly installments. He was naturally staggered at 
the suggestion but however, affixed his signature to the agreement, and Mme. 
de Lamotte became the possessor of the necklace. She speedily broke it up, 
picking the jewels from their setting with an ordinary penknife. Mat-ters 
went smoothly enough until the date when the first installment of 400,000 
livres became due. De Rohan, never dreaming that the Queen would not meet 
it, could not lay his hands on such a sum, and Bahmer noting his anxiety 
mentioned the matter to one of the Queen's ladies-in-waiting, who retorted 
that he must be mad, as the Queen had never purchased the necklace at all. 
He went at once to Mme. de Lamotte who laughed at him, said he was being 
fooled, that it had nothing to do with her, and told him to go to the 
Cardinal. The terrified jeweller did not however take her advice, but went 
to the King.
     The amazed Louis XVI. listened to the story quietly enough, and then 
turned to the Queen who was present, who at once broke forth in a tempest of 
indignation. As a matter of fact Bahmer had for years pestered her to buy 
the necklace, but the crowning indignity was that Do Rohan, whom she 
cordially detested, should have been made the medium for such a scandalous 
disgrace in con-nection with her name, and she at once gave directions that 
the Cardinal should be arrested. The King acquiesced in this, and shortly 
afterwards the Countess de Lamotte, Cagliostro and his wife, and others, 
followed him to the Bastille.
     The trial which followed was one of the most sensational and stirring 
in the annals of French history. The King was greatly blamed for allowing 
the affair to become pub-lic at all, and there is little doubt that such 
conduct as the evidence displayed as that of 
aristocrats assisted to hasten the French Revolution.
     It was Mme. de Lamotte who charged Cagliostro with the robbery of the 
necklace, and she did not hesitate to invent for him a terrible past, 
designating him an empiric, alchemist, false prophet, and Jew. This is not 
the place to deal with the trial at length, and it will suffice to state 
that Cagliostro easily proved his complete innocence. But the Parisian 
public looked to Cagliostro to supply the comedy in this great drama, and 
assuredly they were not disappointed, for he provided them with what must be 
described as 'one of the most romantic and fanciful, if manifestly absurd, 
life stories in the history of autobi-ography. His account of himself which 
is worth quoting at length is as follows
     "I cannot," he says, "speak positively as to the place of my nativity, 
nor to the parents who gave me birth. All my inquiries have ended only in 
giving me some great notions, it is true, but altogether vague and 
uncertain, concerning my family.
     "I spent the years of my childhood in the city of Medina in Arabia. 
There I was brought up under the name of Acharat, which I preserved during 
my progress through Africa and Asia. I had my apartments in the palace of 
the Muphti Salahaym. It is needless to add that the Muphti is the chief of 
the Mahometan religion, and that his constant residence is at Medina.
     "I recollect perfectly that I had then four persons at-tached to my 
service: a governor, between forty-five and sixty years of age, whose name 
was Althotas, and three servants, a white one who attended me as "'valet de 
chambre and two blacks, one of whom was constantly about me night and day.
     "My governor always told me that I had been left an orphan when only 
about three months old, that my parents were Christians and nobly born; but 
he left me absolutely in the dark about their names and the place of my 
nativity. Some words, however, which he let fall by chance have induced ms 
to suspect that I was born at Malta. Althotas, whose name I cannot speak 
without he tenderest emotion, treated me with great care and all the 
attention of a father. He thought to develop the talent I displayed for the 
sci-ences. I may truly say that he knew them all, from the most abstruse 
down to those of mere amusement. My greatest aptitude was for the study of 
botany and chemistry.
     "By him I was taught to worship God, to love and assist my neighbours, 
and to respect everywhere religion and the laws. We both dressed like 
Mahometans and conformed outwardly to the worship of Islam; but the true 
religion was imprinted in our hearts.
     “The Muphiti, who often visited me, always treated me with great 
goodness and seemed to entertain the highest regard for my governor. The 
latter instructed me in most of the Eastern languages. He would often 
converse with me on the pyramids of Egypt, on those vast subterraneous caves 
dug out by the ancient Egyptians, to be the repository of human knowledge 
and to shelter the precious trust from the injuries of time.
     "The desire of travelling and of beholding the wonders of which he 
spoke grew so strong upon me, that Medina and my youthful sports there lost 
all the allurements I had found in them before. At least, when I was in my 
twelfth year, Althotas informed me one day that we were going to commence 
our travels. A caravan was prepared and we set out, after having taken our 
leave of the Muphti who was pleased to express his concern at our departure 
in the most obliging manner.
     "On our arrival at Mecca we alighted at the palace of the Cherif. Here 
Althotas provided me with sumptuous apparel and presented me to the Cherif, 
who honoured me with the most endearing caresses. At sight of this prince my 
senses experienced a sudden emotion, which it is not in the power of words 
to express, and my eyes dropped the most delicious tears I have ever shed in 
my life. His, I perceived, he could hardly contain.
     "I remained in Mecca for the space of three years; not a day passed 
without my being admitted to the sovereign's presence, and every hour 
increased his attachment and added to my gratitude. I sometimes surprised 
his gaze riveted upon me, and turned to heaven with every  ex-pression of 
pity and commiseration. Thoughtful, I would go from him a prey to an ever-
fruitless curiosity. I dared not question Althotas, who always rebuked me 
with great severity, as if it had been a crime in me to wish for some 
information concerning my parents and the place where I was born. I 
attempted in vain to get the secret from the negro who slept in my 
apartment. If I chanced to talk of my parents he would turn a deaf ear to my 
questions. But one night when I was more pressing than usual, he told me 
that if ever I should leave Mecca I was threatened with the greatest 
misfortunes, and bid me, above all, beware of the city of Trebizond.
     "My inclination, however, got the better of his  fore-boding. I was 
tired of the uniformity of life I led at the Cherif's court. One day when I 
was alone the prince en-tered my apartment; he strained me to his bosom with 
more than usual tenderness, bid me never cease to adore the Almighty, and 
added, bedewing my cheeks with his tears: 'Nature’s unfortunate child, adieu 
!'
     "This was our last interview. The caravan waited only for me and I set 
off, leaving Mecca never to re-enter it more
     "I directed my course first to Egypt, where I inspected these 
celebrated pyramids which to the eye of the super-ficial observer only 
appear an enormous mass of marble and granite. I also got acquainted with 
the priests of the various temples, who had the complacence to introduce me 
into such places as no ordinary traveller ever entered before. The next 
three years of my progress were spent in the principal kingdoms of Africa 
and Asia. Accompanied by Althotas, and the three attendants who continued in 
my service, I arrived in 1766 at the island of Rhodes, and there embarked on 
a French ship bound to Malta.
     "Notwithstanding the general rule by which all vessels coming from the 
Levant are obliged to enter quarantine, I obtained on the second day leave 
to go ashore. Pinto, the Grand Master of the Knights of Malta, gave us 
apart-ments in his palace, and I perfectly recollect that mine were near the 
laboratory.
     " The first thing the Grand Master was pleased to do was to request the 
Chevalier d'Aquino, of the princely house of Caramanica, to bear me company 
and do me the honours of the island. It was here that I first assumed; 
European dress and with it the name of Count Cagliostro, nor was it a small 
matter of surprise to me to see Althotas appear in a clerical dress with the 
insignia of the Order of Malta.
     "I have every reason to believe that the Grand Master Pinto was 
acquainted with my real origin. He often spoke to me of the Cherif and 
mentioned the city of Trebizond, but never would consent to enter into 
further particulars on the subject. Meanwhile he treated me with the utmost 
distinction, and assured me of very rapid preferment if I would consent to 
take the cross. But my taste for trav-elling and the predominant desire of 
practising medicine, induced me to decline an offer that was as generous as 
it was honourable.
It was' in the island of Malta that I had the misfortune of losing my best 
friend and master, the wisest as well as the most learned of men, the 
venerable Althotas. Some minutes before he expired, pressing my hand, he 
said in a feeble voice', 'My son, keep for ever before your eyes the' fear 
of God and the love of your fellow-creatures; you will soon be convinced by 
experience of what you have been taught by me.
     “The spot where I had parted for ever from the friend who had been as a 
father to me, soon became odious. I begged leave of the Grand Master to quit 
the island in order to travel over Europe; he consented reluctantly, and the 
Chevalier d'Aquino was so obliging as to accom-pany me. Our first trip was 
to Sicily, from thence we went to the different islands of the Greek 
Archipelago, and returning, arrived at Naples, the birthplace of my 
companion.
     "The Chevalier, owing to his private affairs, being obliged to 
undertake a private journey, I proceeded alone to Rome, provided with a 
letter of credit on the banking house of Signor Bellone. In the capital of 
the Christian world I resolved upon keeping the strictest incognito. One 
morn-ing, as I was shut up in my apartment, endeavouring to improve myself 
in the Italian language, my valet de chambre introduced to my presence the 
secretary of Cardinal Orsini, who requested me to wait on his Eminence. I 
repaired at once to his palace and was received with the most flat-tering 
civility. The Cardinal often invited me to his table and procured me the 
acquaintance of several cardinals and Roman' princes, amongst others, 
Cardinals York and Ganganelli, who was afterwards Pope Clement XIV. Pope 
Rezzonico, who then filled the papal chair, having ex-pressed a desire of 
seeing me, I had the honour of frequent interviews with his Holiness.
     "I was then (1 770) in my twenty-second year, when by chance I met a 
young lady of quality, Seraphina Fell ciani, whose budding charms kindled in 
my bosom a flame which sixteen years of marriage have only served to 
strengthen. It is that unfortunate woman, whom neither her virtues, her 
innocence, nor her quality of stranger could save from the hardships of a 
captivity as cruel as it is unmerited."
     Cagliostro is reticent regarding his life between the period last dealt 
with, and the date of his coming to Paris. But .although proved innocent he 
had through his ver} inno-cence offended so many persons in high places that 
he was banished, amidst shouts of laughter from everyone in the court. Even 
the judges were convulsed, but on his return from the court-house the mob 
cheered him heartily. If he had accomplished nothing else he had at least 
won the hearts of the populace by his kindness and the many acts of faithful 
service he had lavished upon them. and it was partly to his popularity, and 
partly to the violent hatred of the Court, that he owed the reception 
accorded to him. He was re-united to his wife, and shortly after-wards took 
his departure for London where he was received with considerable eclat. Here 
he addressed a letter to the people of France, which obtained wide 
circulation and predicted the French Revolution, the demolishment of the 
Bastille, and the downfall of the monarchy. Following upon this the Courser 
de l'Europe a French paper published in London, printed a so-called exposure 
of the real life of Cagliostro from beginning to end. From that moment, 
however, his descent was headlong; his reputation had Switzerland and 
Austria, he could find no rest for the sole of his foot. At last he came 'to 
Rome, whither Lorenza, his wife accompanied him. At first he was well 
received there, and even entertained by several cardinals, privately 
studying medicine, and living very quietly: but he made the grand mistake of 
attempting to further his masonic ideas within the bounds of the Papal 
States. Masonry was of course anathema to the Roman Church, and upon his 
attempting to found a Lodge in the Eternal City itself, he was arrested on 
the 27th September, 1789, by order of the Holy Inquisition, and imprisoned 
in the Castle of Saint Angelo. His examination occupied his inquisitors for 
no less than eighteen months, and he was sentenced to death on the 7th 
April, 1791. He was, however, recom-mended to mercy, and the Pope commuted 
his sentence to perpetual imprisonment in the Castle of Saint Angelo. On one 
occasion he made a desperate attempt to escape: requesting the services of a 
confessor he attempted to strangle the Brother sent to him, but the burly 
priest, whose habit he had intended to disguise himself in proved too strong 
for him, and he was quickly overpowered. After this he was imprisoned in the 
solitary Castle of San Leo near Montefeltro, the situation of which 
stronghold is one of the most singular in Europe, where he died and was 
interred in 1795. The manner of his death is abso-lutely unknown, but an 
official commissioned by Napoleon to visit the Italian prisons gives some 
account of Cagliostro's quarters there.
     "The galleries," he reports, "which have been cut out of the solid 
rock, were divided into cells, and old dried-up cisterns had been converted 
into' dungeons for the worst criminals, and further surrounded by high 
walls, so that the only possible egress, if escape was attempted, would be 
by a staircase cut in the rock and guarded night and day by sentinels.
     "It was in one of these cisterns that the celebrated Cagliostro was 
interred in 1791. In recommending the Pope to commute the sentence of death, 
which the Inquisition had passed upon him, into perpetual imprisonment, the 
Holy Tribunal took care that the commutation should be equivalent to the 
death penalty. His only communi-cation with mankind was when his jailers 
raised the trap to let food down to him. Here he languished for three years 
without air, movement, or intercourse with his fellow-creatures. During the 
last months of his life his condition excited the pity of the governor, who 
had him removed from this dungeon to a cell on the level with the ground, 
where the curious, who obtain permission to visit the prison, may read on 
the walls various inscriptions and sentences traced there by the unhappy 
alchemist. The last bears the date of the 6th of March 1795."
     The Countess Cagliostro was also sentenced by the In-quisition to 
imprisonment for life. She was confined' in the Convent of St. Appolonia, a 
penitentiary for women in Rome, where it was rumoured that she died in 1794, 
Cagliostro's manuscript volume entitled "Egyptian Freemasonry" fell with his 
other papers into the hands of the Inquisition, and was solemnly condemned 
by it as subversive to the interests of Christianity. It was pub-licly 
burned, but oddly enough the Inquisition set apart
Cagliostro one of its brethren to write--" concoct" is the better word -some 
kind of Life of Cagliostro and in this are given several valuable 
particulars concerning his Masonic method as follows
     "It may be unnecessary to enter into some details con-cerning Egyptian 
Masonry. We shall extract our facts from a book compiled by himself, and now 
in our posses-sion, by which he owns he was always directed in the exercise 
of his functions, and from which those regu-lations and instructions were 
copied, wherewith he enriched many mother lodges. In this treatise, which is 
written in French, he promises to conduct his disciples to perfection by 
means of physical and moral regeneration, to confer perpetual youth and 
beauty on them, and restore them to that state of innocence which they were 
deprived of by means of original sin. He asserts that Egyptian Ma-sonry was 
first propagated by Enoch and Elias, but that since that time it has lost 
much of its purity and splendour. Common masonry, according to him, has 
degenerated into mere buffoonery, and women have of late been entirely 
excluded from its mysteries; but the time was now ar-rived when the Grand 
Copt was about to restore the glory of masonry, and allow its benefits to be 
participated by both sexes.
     “The statutes of the order then follow in rotation, the division of the 
members into three distinct classes, the various signs by' which they might 
discover each other, the officers who are to preside over and regulate the 
society, the stated times when the members are to assemble, the erection of 
a tribunal for deciding all differences that may arise between the several 
lodges or the particular members of each, and the various ceremonies which 
ought to take place at the admission of the candidates. In every part of 
this book the pious reader is disgusted with the sacrilege, the profanity, 
the superstition, and the idolatry with which it abounds-the invocations in 
the name of God, the 
pros-trations, the adorations paid to the Grand Master, the fumigations, the 
incense, the exorcisms, the emblems of the Divine Triad, of the moon, of the 
sun, of the compass, of the square, and a thousand other scandalous 
particulars, with which the world is at present acquainted.
      "The Grand Copt, or chief of the lodge, is compared to God the Father. 
He is invoked upon every occasion; he regulates all the actions of the 
members and all the ceremonies of the lodge, and he is even supposed to have 
communication with angels and with the Divinity. In the exercise of many of 
the rites they are desired to repeat the Venii and the Te Deum-nay, to such 
an excess of im-piety are they enjoined, that in reciting the psalm Memento 
Domine David, the name of the Grand Master is always to be substituted for 
that of the King of Israel.
People of all religions are admitted into the society of Egyptian Masonry-
the Jew, the Calvinist, the Lutheran are to be received into it as well as 
the Catholic-provided they believe in the existence of God and the 
immortality of the soul, and have been previously allowed to participate in 
the mysteries of the common masonry. When men are admitted, they receive a 
pair of garters from the Grand Copt, as is usual in all lodges, for their 
mistresses; and when women are received into the society, they are 
pre--seated by the Grand Mistress with a cockade, which they are desired to 
give to that man to whom they are most attached.
     “We shall here recount the ceremonies made use of on admitting a 
female.
     "The candidate having presented herself, the Grand Mistress (Madame 
Cagliostro generally presided in that capacity) breathed upon her face from 
the forehead to the chin, and then said, I breathe upon you on purpose to 
inspire you with virtues which we possess, so that they may take root and 
flourish in your heart, I thus fortify your soul, I thus confirm you in the 
faith of your brethren and sisters. according to the engagements which you 
have contracted with them. We now admit you as a daughter of the Egyptian 
lodge. We order that you be acknow-ledged in that capacity by all the 
brethren and sisters of the Egyptian lodges, and that you enjoy with them 
the same prerogatives as with ourselves.'
     "The Grand Master thus addresses the male candidate: 'In virtue of the 
power which I have received from the Grand Copt, the founder of our order, 
and by the particular grace of God, I hereby confer upon you the honour of 
being admitted into our lodge in the name of Hellos, Mene,  Tetragrammaton.'
     "In a book said to be printed at Paris in 1780, it is asserted that the 
last words were suggested to Cagliostro as sacred and cabalistical 
expressions by a pretended con-juror. who said that he was assisted by a 
spirit, and that this spirit was no other than a cabalistical Jew, who by 
means of the magical art had murdered his own father before the incarnation 
of Jesus Christ.
     "'Common masons have been accustomed to regard St. John as their 
patron, and to celebrate' the festival of that saint. Cagliostro also 
adopted him as his protector. and it is not a little remarkable that he was 
imprisoned at Rome on the very festival of his patron. The reason for his 
veneration of this great prophet was, if we are to believe himself, the 
great similarity between the Apocalypse and the rites of his institution.
     "We must here observe that when any of his disciples were admitted into 
the highest class, the following exec-rable ceremony took place. A young boy 
or girl, in the state of virgin innocence and purity, was procured, who was 
called the pupil, and to whom power was given over the seven spirits that 
surround the throne of their divinity and preside over the seven planets. 
Their names according to Cagliostro's book are Anael, Michael, Raphael, 
Gabriel, Uriel, Zobiachel, and Anachiel. The pupil is then made use of as an 
intermediate agent between the spiritual and physical worlds, and being 
clothed in a long white robe, adorned with a red ribbon, and blue silk 
festoons, he is shut up in a little closet. From that place he gives re-
sponses to the Grand Master, and tells whether the spirits and Moses have 
agreed to receive the candidates into the highest class of Egyptian masons.
     "In his instructions to obtain the moral and physical regeneration 
which he had promised to his disciples, he is exceedingly careful to give a 
minute description of the operations to which they have to submit. Those who 
are desirous of experiencing the moral regeneration are to retire from the 
world for the space of forty days, and to distribute their time into certain 
proportions. Six hours are to be employed in reflection, three in prayer to 
the Deity, nine in the holy operations of Egyptian Masonry, while the 
remaining period is to be dedicated to repose. At the end of the' thirty-
three days a visible communica-tion is to take place between the patient and 
the seven primitive spirits, and on the morning of the fortieth day his soul 
will be inspired with divine knowledge, and his body be as pure as that of a 
new-born infant.
     "To procure a physical regeneration, the patient is to retire into the 
country in the month of May, and during forty days is to live according to 
the most strict and austere rules, eating very little, and then only 
laxative and sana-tive herbs, and making use of no other drink than 
distilled water, or rain that has fallen in the course of the month. On the 
seventeenth day, after having let blood certain white drops are to be taken, 
six at night and six in the morning, increasing them two a day in 
progression. In three days more a small quantity of blood is again to be let 
from the arm before sunrise, and the patient is to retire to bed till the 
operation is completed. A grain of the panacea is then to be taken; this 
panacea is the same as that of which God created man when He first made him 
immortal. When this is swallowed the candidate loses his speech and his 
reflection for three entire days, and he is subject to frequent convulsions, 
struggles, and perspirations. Having recovered from this state, in which 
however, he experiences no pain whatever, on that day, he takes the third 
and last grain of the panacea, which causes him to fail into a profound and 
tranquil sleep; it is then that he loses his hair, his skin, and his teeth.  
These again are all reproduced in a few hours, and having become a new man, 
on the morning of the fortieth day he leaves his room, enjoying a complete 
rejuvenescence, by which he is enabled to live 5557 years, or to such time 
as he, of his own accord, may be desirous of going to the world of spirits."
     To revert to the question of the researches of Mr. Trow-bridge, it will 
appear to any unbiassed reader of his work that he has proved that 
Cagliostro was not the same as Joseph Balsamo with whom his detractors have 
identified him. Balsamo was a Sicilian vagabond adventurer, and the 
statement that he and Cagliostro were one and the same person originally 
rests on the word of the editor of the Courier de l' Europe, a person of the 
lowest and most profligate habits, and upon an anonymous letter from Palermo 
to the Chief of the Paris police. Mr. Trowbridge sees in the circumstance 
that the names of the Countess Cagliostro and the wife of Balsamo were 
identical nothing but a mere coincidence, as the name Lorenza Feliciani is a 
very common one in Italy.  He also proves that the testimony of the 
handwriting experts as to the remarkable similarity between the writing of 
Balsamo and Cagliostro is worthless, and states that nobody who had known 
Bal-samo ever saw Cagliostro. He also points out that Balsamo, who had been 
in England in 1771, was "wanted" by the London police: how was it then that 
six years afterward they did not recognise him in Count Cagliostro who spent 
four months in a debtors' prison there, for no fault of his own? The whole 
evidence against Cagliostro's character rests with the editor of the Courier 
de l'Europe and his Inquisition biographer, neither of whom can be credited 
for various good reasons. Again, it must be recollected that the narrative 
of the Inquisition biographer is supposed to be based upon the confessions 
of Cagliostro under torture in the Castle of St. Angelo. Neither was the 
damaging disclosure of the editor of the Courier de l'Europe at all topical, 
as he raked up matter which was at least fourteen years old, and of which he 
had no personal knowledge whatsoever. Mr. Trowbridge also proves that the 
dossier discovered in the French archives in 1783, which was supposed to 
embody the Countess Cagliostro's confessions regarding the career of her 
husband when she was im-prisoned in the Salpetriere prison, is palpably a 
forgery, and he further disposes of the statements that Cagliostro lived on 
the immoral earnings of his wife.
     It is distinctly no easy matter to get at the bed-rock truth regarding 
Cagliostro or to form any just estimate of his true character. That he was 
vain, naturally pom-pous, fond of theatrical mystery, and of the popular 
side of occultism, is most probable. Another circumstance which stands out 
in relation to his personality is that he was vastly desirous of gaining 
cheap popularity. He was probably a little mad. On the other hand he was 
benefi-cent, and felt it his mission in the then king-ridden state of Europe 
to found Egyptian Masonry for the protection of society in general, and the 
middle and lower classes in particular. A born adventurer, he was by no 
means a rogue, as his lack of shrewdness has been proved on many
occasions. There is small question either that the various Masonic lodges 
which he founded and which were 
patron-ised by persons of ample means, provided him with exten-sive funds, 
and it is a known fact that he was subsidised by several extremely wealthy 
men, who, themselves dissatisfied with the state of affairs in Europe, did 
not hesitate to place their riches at his disposal for the purpose of 
undermining the tyrannic powers which then wielded sway. There is reason to 
believe that he had in some way and 'at some period of his life acquired a 
certain working knowledge of practical occultism, and that he possessed 
certain elementary psychic powers of hypnotism and telepathy. His absurd 
account of his childhood is almost undoubtedly a plagiarism of that stated 
in the first mani-festo to the public of the mysterious Rosicrucian Brother-
hood, (q.v) as containing an account of the childhood of their Chief But on 
the whole he is a mystery, and in all likelihood the clouds which surround 
his origin and earlier years will never be dispersed. It is probably better 
that this should be so, as although Cagliostro was by no means an exalted 
character, he was yet one of the most picturesque figures in the later 
history of Europe; and assuredly not the least aid to his picturesque 
figures is the obscurity in which his origin is involved. Consult-

Cahagnet, Alphonse : A French cabinet-maker who became interested in 
somnambulic phenomena about the year 1845, and thenceforward recorded and 
analysed the trance utterances of various somnambules. His Arcanes de la vie 
future dovoilees, published in January, 1848, contained much information 
concerning the various spheres, and the conditions under which discarnate 
spirits lived. This was followed in 1849 by a second volume, describing 
seances held with Adle Maginot. Through this medium sitters could 
communicate with their deceased friends or with those who were far away, 
evidences of clairvoyance, diag-nosis and cure of disease were given, and, 
in short all the phenomena of American-French mediumship were antici-pated. 
A third volume of Arcanes was published later. Cahagnet’s work is notable in 
many ways. His own good faith was transparent, he took great pains to 
procure the written testimony of the sitters, and thus the trance utterances 
of his somnambules are among the best attested of their kind.


Cailleach or Harvest Old Wife: In the Highlands of Scot-land, there is to be 
found the belief that whoever is last with his harvesting will be saddled 
with the Harvest Old Wife to keep until the next year.
The first farmer to be done, made a doll of some blades of corn, which was 
called the "old wife," and sent it to his nearest neighbour. He, in turn, 
when finished, sent it on to another, and so on until the person last done 
had the "old woman" to keep. Needless to say this fear acted as a spur to 
the superstitious Highlanders. (See Scotland.)

Caiumarath, or Kaid-mords : According to the Persians, the first man. He 
lived a thousand years and reigned five hundred and sixty. He produced a 
tree, from the fruits of which were born the human race. The devil seduced 
and corrupted the first couple, who after their fall, dressed themselves in 
black garments and sadly awaited the 'resurrection, for they had introduced 
sin into the world.

monstrosity was sent against Cuchulain, who succeeded in .catching its 
eight-and-twenty spears on his shield. The Clan, however managed to throw 
him down and ground his face in the gravel. Cuchulain was assisted by the 
son of an Ulster exile, who cut off the creature's heads while Cuchulain 
hacked it to pieces.;

Calmet, Dom Augustin : A Benedictine of the congregation of Saint-Vannes, 
and one of the most diligent and active of his order, who died in 1757 at 
his abbey of Sesones. He was the author of a Dictionnair de la Bible and of 
many well-known commentaries on the scriptures. But he is chiefly famous 
among occultists for his Dissertation sur les apparitions des anger, des 
demons et des esprits, et sur les revenans et vampires de Hongrie, de 
Boheme, de Moravie et de Silesie. (Paris 1746, and 1751-the latter being the 
best edition). It was translated into English in 1750. and is alluded to in 
the article "Vampire." The greatest faith in the supernatural (some might 
perhaps stigmatise it as credulity) marks the work. But he notices unfavour-
able theories equally with those which suit his hypotheses, and if he places 
too much credence in the classical authors, he is never dull. He became the 
butt of Voltaire, who wrote beneath his portrait in verse of.
questionable quality:

“Des oracles sacres quo Dieu daigna nous rendre
Son travail assidu perca l’obscurite
II fit plus, il lea crut avec simplicite
Et fut, par ses vertus, digne de les entendre."


Calundronius : A magic stone without form or colour which has the virtues' 
of resisting malign spirits, destroying enchantments, giving to the owner an 
advantage over his enemies, and of dissipating despair.

and Delamare. Some are more kindly disposed to the human race than others. 
Luther says of them in his Colloquies that they show no sign of life before 
seven years of age. He says that he saw one which cried when he touched it. 
Maiole states, according to Boguet in his Discours des Sorciers (chap. 
XIV.), that a Galician mendicant was in the habit of exciting public pity by 
carrying about a Campion.  One day, a horseman observing him to be  much  
hampered by the seeming infant in crossing a river, took the supposed child 
before him on his horse. But he was so heavy that the animal sank under the 
weight. Some time after-wards the mendicant was taken and admitted that the 
child he habitually carried was a little demon whom he had trained so 
carefully that no one refused him alms whilst carrying it.


Cambodia : The Cambodia of today is bounded by French Cochin-China, Annam, 
Siam and the Gulf of Siam. Of its population of I,500,000 inhabitants, the 
main part is composed of the Khmer people, and Chinese, Annamese Malaya and 
aboriginal elements are also' represented.
     Magic.-Magic is mixed up to a' surprising degree with the daily life of 
this people. They consult sorcerers upon the most trivial matters, and are 
constantly at great pains to discover whether any small venture is' likely 
to prove lucky or unlucky. There are two kinds of sorcerers (or 
sorceresses), the soothsayers (ap thmop) and the medicine--sorcerers (kru). 
Of these the latter enjoy the highest reputation as healers and exorcists, 
while the former are less respected, dealing, as they do in charms and 
philtres
for the sake of gain, or in evil incantations and spells to indulge their 
spite and hatred. The outcast kru, however, can be ministers of destruction 
as well as of healing. One of the means used to take the. life of an enemy 
is the old device favoured by witches.' They make a wax figure 'of the 
victim, prick it at the spot where they wish to harm him, and thus bring 
disease and death upon him. Another plan is to take two skulls from which 
the tops have been removed, place them against each other, and convey them 
secretly under the bed of a healthy man where they have very evil results. 
Sometimes by means of spells they transform wood-shavings or grains of' rice 
into a large. beetle, or into worms, which enter the body of their victim 
and cause his illness, and, perhaps his death. If the man thus attacked 
happens to possess the friendship of a more powerful sorcerer, however, the 
latter may afford him his protection,. and thus undo the mischief,. The more 
harmless occupations of the wizards consist in making philtres and amulets 
to insure the admiration of women, the favour of the king, and success at 
play.
     Evil Spirits.-The evil spirits, to whom they ascribe the moat malicious 
intent, are called pray. Of these the most fearsome variety is the "wicked 
dead" (khmoc o£ pray), which includes the spirits of women who have died in 
childbed. From their hiding-place in the trees these spirits torment 
inoffensive passers-by with their hideous laughter, and shower down stones 
upon them. These practices arc, of course, calculated either to kill or to 
drive the unfortunate . recipients of their attentions insane. Among the 
trees there are also concealed mischievous demons who inflict terrible and 
incurable diseases upon mankind.
     Those. who have suffered a violent death are also greatly to be feared. 
From the nethermost regions they return, wan and terrible, to demand food 
from human beings, who dare not deny it to them. Their name beisac signi-
fies "'goblin," and they have the power to inflict all manner of evil on 
those who refuse their request. So the good Cambodian, to avert such 
happenings, puts. his offering of rice or other food in the brushwood to 
appease the goblins. The pray, it may be bald, require to have their 
offerings laid 'on. the winnowing fan that enters so largely into Cambodian 
superstition.
    Were-wolves, both male and female, strike terror into the hearts of the 
natives. By the use of certain magical rites and formulae, men can become 
endowed with super-natural powers, such as the ability to swallow dishes, 
and are thereupon changed to were'-wolves. Women who have been rubbed with 
oil which a wizard has consecrated are said to lose their reason, and to 
flee away to the woods They retain their human shape for seven days. If 
during that time a man shall undergo the same process .of being rubbed with 
consecrated oil, and shall follow the toman to the woods, and strike her on 
the head with a heavy bar-then, the Cambodians say, she shall recover her 
reason and may return' home. If, on the other hand, no such drastic remedy 
is to be found, at the end of seven days the woman shall turn into a 
tigress. In order to cure men who have the powers of a were-wolf, one must 
strike them on the shoulder with a hook.
     The Cambodians believe that ghosts issue from dead bodies during the 
process of decomposition. When this ceases the ghosts are no longer seen, 
and the remains are changed into owls and other nocturnal birds.
Most hideous of all the evil spirits in Cambodia, are the srei ap or ghouls, 
who, represented only by head and ali-mentary canal, prowl nightly in search 
of their gruesome orgies. They are known by their terrible and blood-shot 
eyes, and are much feared, since even their wish to harm can inflict injury. 
When anyone is denounced as a ghoul she is treated with great severity, 
either by the authorities, who may sentence her to banishment or death, or 
by the villagers, who sometimes take the law into their own hands and punish 
the supposed offender.
     Astrology, etc.-The science of astrology is not without its votaries in 
Cambodia. Astrologers, or, as they are called, horas, are attached to the 
court, and their direct employment by the king gives them some standing in 
the country. At the beginning of each year they make a calendar, which 
contains, besides the usual astronomical information, weather and other 
predictions. They are consulted by the people on all sorts of subjects, and 
are believed to be able to avert the calamities they predict.
     It is not surprising that in such a country, where good and evil powers 
are ascribed so lavishly, much attention should be paid to omens, and much 
time spent in rites to avert misfortune. The wind, the fog, the trees, are 
objects of fear and awe, and must be approached with circumspection lest 
they send disease and misfortune, or withhold some good. For instance, trees 
whose roots grow under a house bring ill-luck to it. The bamboo and cotton-
plant are also dangerous when planted near a house, for should they grow 
higher than the house, they would wish, out ,of a perverted sense of 
gratitude, to provide a funeral cushion and matting for the occupants.
     Animals receive their share of superstitious veneration. Tigers are 
regarded as malevolent creatures, 'whose whiskers are very poisonous. 
Elephants are looked upon as sacred, and particularly so white elephants, 
Monkeys they 'will on no account destroy. Should a butterfly enter the 
house, it is considered extremely unlucky, while a grass-hopper, on the 
contrary, indicates coming good4ortune.
There are other superstitions relating to household objects, customs, etc., 
which do not differ greatly from those of other countries.

Candles Burning Blue : There is a superstition that candles and other lights 
burn blue at the apparition of spirits, probably because of the sulphurous

Capnomancy : Was the observation of smoke, which con-sisted in two principal 
methods. The more important was the smoke of the sacrifices, .which augured 
well if it rose lightly from the altar, and ascended straight to the clouds; 
but the contrary if it hung about. Another method was to throw a few jasmine 
or poppy seeds upon burning coals. There was yet a third practice by 
breathing the smoke of the sacrificial fire.


Caqueux or Cacoux: Formerly a caste of rope-makers dwelling in Brittany, who 
in some of the cantons of that country were treated as pariahs, perhaps 
because the ropes they manufactured were to the people the symbols of 
slavery and death by hanging. Be that as it may, they were interdicted from 
entering the churches, and were regarded as sorcerers. They did not hesitate 
to profit by this evil reputation, but dealt in talismans which were 
supposed to render their wearers invulnerable, and also acted as diviners. 
They were further credited with the ability to raise and sell winds and 
tempests like the sorcerers of Finland It is said that they were originally 
of Jewish origin, separated like lepers from other folk. Francois II, Duke 
of Brittany, enacted that they should wear a mark composed of red cloth on a 
part of their dress where it could be readily seen. (See Cambry, Voyage dans 
le Finistere, t.3, p.146).


Carbuncle : The ancients supposed this stone to give out a native light 
without reflection, and they ranked it fifth in order after diamonds, 
emeralds, opal, and pearls. It is among the gems ruled by the sun, and is 
both male and female-the former distinguished by the brightness which 
appears as if burning within it, while the latter throws it out. It takes no 
colour from any other gem, applied to it, but imparts its' own. The virtue 
of the carbuncle is to drive away poisonous air, repress luxury, and 
preserve the health of the body. It also reconciles differences among 
friends.


Cardan, Jerome : A so-called magician, who lived about the end of the 
fifteenth, or the beginning of the sixteenth, century. He was contemporary 
with Faustus and Para-celsus, to whom, as to the other necromancers of his 
age, he was entirely dissimilar. He has left in his Memoirs a frank and 
detailed analysis of a curiously .complicated and abnormal intellectuality, 
sensitive, intense, and not altogether free from the taint of insanity. He 
declares himself subject to strange fits of abstraction and exaltation, the 
intensity of which became at length so intolerable that he was forced to 
inflict on himself severe bodily pain as a means of banishing them. He 
would, he tells us, talk habitually of those things which were most likely 
to be distasteful to the company; he would argue on any side of a 'question, 
quite irrespective of whether he believed it right or wrong, and he had an 
extraordinary passion for gambling. He tells us of three peculiarities, in 
winch we may trace the workings of a diseased imagination, and in the third, 
at least, that abnormal delicacy of perception which characterised him. The 
first was the faculty of projecting his spirit outside his body, to the 
accompaniment of strange physical sensations. The second was the ability to 
perceive sensibly anything he desired to perceive. As a child, he explains, 
he saw these images involuntarily and without the power of selection, but 
when he reached manhood he could control them to suit his choice. The third 
of his peculiar qualities was, that before every event of moment in his 
.life, he had a dream which warned him of it. Indeed, he himself has written 
a commentary of considerable length on Synesius's treatise on dreams, in 
which he advances the theory that any virtuous person can acquire the 
faculty of interpreting dreams, that, in fact, anyone can draw up for 
himself a code of dream-interpretations by merely studying carefully his own 
dreams. We cannot put much faith in Cardan's wonderful. dreams, however. His 
is not the type of mind to. which we would go for an accurate statement 
concerning mental phenomena, but such significant dreams as he may have 
had,. were probably, as has already been suggested, the result of his 
abnormal sub-conscious perceptiveness.' In one instance at least, his 
prediction was not entirely suc-cessful. He foretold the date of his own 
death, and, at the age of seventy-five, was obliged to abstain from food in 
order to die at the time he had predicted.

Carpoeratlans : A sect of Gnostics founded by Carpocrites of Alexandria. It 
taught that Christ derived the mysteries of his religion from the Temple. of 
Isis in Egypt, where he had studied for six years, and that he taught them 
to his 'apostles, who transmitted them to Carpocrites. This body used 
theurgic incantations, and had grips, signs and words, symbols and degrees. 
It is believed to have en-dured for some centuries. (See Gnostics.)

Castle of the Interior Man, The : The  mystical name given to the seven 
stages of the soul's ascent towards the Divinity. These seven processes of 
psychic evolution are briefly as follows: (x) The state of prayer, being 
concentration on God; (2) The state of mental prayer, in which one seeks to 
discover the mystic significance of all things ; (3) The obscure night, 
believed to be the most difficult, in which self must be utterly renounced; 
(4) The prayer of quietism, complete surrender to the will of God; (5) The 
state of union, in which the will of man and the will of God become 
identified ; (6) The state of ecstatic prayer, in which the soul is 
transported with joy, and love enters into it; (7) The state of ravishment, 
which is the mystic marriage, the perfect union, and the entrance of God and 
Heaven into the interior man.


Catabolignes: Demons who bore men away, killed them, and broke and crushed 
them having this power over them. We are told that a certain Campester wrote 
a book wherein it is related how these demons treated their agents, the 
magicians and sorcerers.


Catalepsy : A condition involving the sudden suspension of sensation and 
volition, and the partial suspension of the vital functions. The body 
assumes a rigid and statues-que appearance, sometimes mistaken for death, 
and the patient remains unconscious throughout the attack. On occasion, the 
cataleptic state may be marked by symptoms of intense mental excitement. and 
by apparently volitional speech and action. Sometimes the symptoms are 
hardly distinguishable from those of hysteria. The period covered by the 
attack may vary from a few minutes to several days, though the latter only 
in exceptional cases; it may, however, recur on trifling provocation in the 
absence of resistance from the will-power of the patient. The affection is 
caused by a pathological condition of the nervous system, generally produced 
by severe or prolonged mental emotion, and it must not be confused with the 
hypnotic trance. The belief that it may occur in a per-fectly healthy person 
is, on the whole, fallacious. There is some reason to suppose that 
catalepsy, like ecstacy and mediumistic faculties, may at times prove 
contagious. Dr. Petetin, in his Electricite Animale (1808) makes mention of 
as many as eight cases met with in a restricted area, although catalepsy is 
in ordinary circumstances of rare occurrence. Petetin also mentions certain 
strange pheno-mena witnessed by him in connection with the state of 
spontaneous catalepsy (see Stomach, seeing with). which would seem to show 
that persons in this condition are, amenable to suggestion in a high degree. 
The true physical reasons for catalepsy are still practically unknown to 
science. But there seem to be good reasons for believing that it can be 
self-induced in certain cases. Many Eastern fakirs have been known to cast 
themselves into cataleptic sleep lasting for months and cases have even been 
known where they per-mitted themselves to be buried, being exhumed when the 
grass had grown over their graves. 
(See Dendy, Philosophy of Mystery.)


Cathari : (See Gnostics.)


Catoptromancy, or Enoptromaney : is a species of divination by the mirror, 
which Pausanius describes : "Before the Temple of Ceres at Patras, there was 
a fountain, separated from the temple by a wall, and there was an oracle, 
very truthful, not for all events, but for the sick only. The sick person 
let down a mirror, suspended by a thread, till its base touched the surface 
of the water, having first prayed to the goddess and offered incense. Then 
looking in the mirror, he saw the presage of death or recovery, according as 
the face appeared fresh and healthy, or of a ghastly aspect." Another method 
of using the mirror was to place it at the back of a boy's or girl's head, 
whose eyes were bandaged. In Thessaly, the response appeared in char-acters 
of blood on the face of the moon, probably repre-sented in the mirror. The 
Thessalian sorceresses derived their art from the Persians, who always 
endeavoured to plant their religion and mystic rites in the countries they 
invaded.


Cats, Elfin : These are to be found in the Scottish Highlands, and arc said 
to be of a wild breed, as large as dogs, black in colour, with a white spot 
on the breast, and to have arched backs' and erect bristles. By some, these 
cats are said to be witches in disguise.


Cauldron, Devil’s : An abyss at the summit of the Peak of Teneriffe. A stone 
cast into the gulf resounds as though a copper vessel were being struck by a 
huge hammer, and on this account its name has been bestowed on it by the 
Spaniards. The natives of the Island are persuaded that the infernal regions 
are there, where dwell for ever the souls of the wicked.


Causimomancy : Divination by fire. It is a happy presage when combustible 
objects cast into the fire do not burn.


Cazotte, Jacques: (1720-1792) : A French romance writer, and the reputed 
author of the famous Prophetie de Cazotte, concerning the Revolution. His 
sympathies were not with the revolutionary party. His letters were seized, 
and he and his daughter Elizabeth thrown into prison. During the September 
massacres, Elizabeth saved his life by flinging herself between him and the 
cut-throats who sought to kill him. He escaped, but was arrested, condemned, 
and beheaded.  He was the author of the celebrated occult romance Le Diable 
Amoureux.


Celestial Light : The sacred light of all the ages, which is' "as the 
lightning which shineth from the west to the east." It is the halo which 
surrounds certain visions of a mystical character, but can only be seen by 
those who have lived ascetically, when respiration is feeble, and life has 
almost left the body.


Cellini, Benvenuto: This celebrated Italian artist and crafts-man had 
several most interesting adventures with demons and professors of the black 
art. In his Life he writes as follows.
     "It happened, through a variety of odd accidents, that I made 
acquaintance with a Sicilian priest, who was a man of genius, and well 
versed in the ,Latin and Greek author. Happening one day to have some 
conversation with him, when the subject turned on the subject of necromancy, 
I, who had a great desire to know something of the matter, told him, that I 
had all my life felt a curiosity to be ac-quainted with the mysteries of 
this art. The priest made answer, 'That the man must be of a resolute and 
steady temper who enters upon that study.' I replied, 'That I had fortitude 
and resolution enough, if I could but find an opportunity.' The priest 
subjoined, 'If you think you have the heart to venture, I will give you all 
the satisfaction you can desire.' Thus we agreed to enter upon a plan of 
necromancy. The priest one evening prepared to satisfy me, and desired me to 
look out for a companion or two. I invited one Vincenzio Romoli, who was my 
intimate acquaintance: he brought with him a native of Pistoia, who 
cultivated the black art himself. We repaired to the Colloseo, and the 
priest, according to the custom of necromancers, began to draw circles upon 
the ground with the most impressive ceremonies imaginable: he likewise 
brought hither assafoetida, several precious perfumes and fire, with some 
compositions also which diffused noisome odour. As soon as he was in 
readiness, he made an open-ing to the circle, and having taken us by the 
hand, ordered the other necromancer, his partner, to throw the perfumes into 
the fire at the proper time, intrusting the care of' the fire and the 
perfumes to the rest; and then he began his incantations. This ceremony 
lasted above an hour and a half, when there appeared several legions of 
devils a half, when there appeared several legions of devils inso-much that 
the amphitheatre was quite filled with them. I was busy about the perfumes, 
when the priest, perceiving there was a considerable number of infernal 
spirits, turned to me and said, 'Benvenuto, ask them something.' I answered, 
'Let them bring me into the company of my Sicilian mistress, Angelica.' That 
night we obtained no answer of any sort; but I had received great 
satisfaction in having my curiosity so far indulged. The necromancer told 
me, it was requisite we should go a second time, assur-ing me, that I should 
be satisfied in whatever I asked; but that I must bring with me a pure 
immaculate boy.
     "I took with me a youth who was in my service, of about twelve years of 
age, together with the same Vin-cenzio Romoli, who had been my companion the 
first time and one Agnolino Gaddi, an intimate acquaintance, whom I likewise 
prevailed on to assist at the ceremony. When we came to the place appointed, 
the priest having made his preparations as before, with the same and. even 
mor6 striking ceremonies, placed us within the circle, which he had likewise 
drawn with a more wonderful art, and in a more solemn manner, than at our 
former meeting. Thus having committed the care of the perfume and the fire 
to my friend Vincenzio, who was assisted by Agnolino Gaddi, he put into my 
hand a pintacula or magical chart, and bid me turn it towards the places 
that he should direct me; and under the pintacula I held the boy. The 
necromancer having begun to make his tremendous invocations, called by their 
names a multitude of demons, who were the leaders of the several legions, 
and questioned them by the power of the eternal uncreated God, who lives for 
ever, in the Hebrew language, as likewise in Latin and Greek; inso-much that 
the amphitheatre was almost in an instant filled with demons more numerous 
than at the former conjuration. Vincenzio Romoli was busied in making a 
fire, with the assistance of Agnolino, and burning a great quantity of 
precious perfumes. I. by the direction of the necromancer, again desired to 
be in the company of my Angelica. The former thereupon turning to me, said, 
'Know, they have declared, that in the space of a month you shall be in her 
company.
     "He then requested me to stand resolutely by him, because the legions 
were now above a thousand more in number than he had designed; and, besides 
these were the most dangerous;. so that, after they had answered my 
question, it behoved him to be civil to them, and dis-miss them quietly. At 
the same time the hay under the pintacula was in a terrible fright, saying, 
that there were in that place a million of fierce men, who threatened to 
destroy us; and that, moreover, four armed giants of an enormous stature 
were endeavouring to break into our circle. During this time, whilst the 
necromancer, trembling with fear, endeavoured by mild and gentle methods to 
dismiss them in the best way he could, Vincenzio Romoli, who quivered like 
an aspen leaf, took care of the perfumes.. Though I was as much terrified as 
any of them, I did my utmost to conceal the terror I felt; so that I greatly 
contributed to inspire the rest with resolution; but the truth is, I gave 
myself over for a dead man, seeing the horrid fright the necromancer was in. 
The boy placed his head between his knees, and said, ' In this posture I 
will die; for we shall all surely perish.' I told him that all these demons 
were under us, and what he saw was smoke and shadows; so I bid him hold up 
his head and take courage. No sooner did he look up, but he cried out,' The 
whole amphitheatre is burning, and the fire is just. falling upon us ;' so 
covering his eyes with his hands, he again exclaimed that destruction was 
inevitable, and he desired to see no more. The necromancer entreated me to 
have a good heart, and take care to burn the proper perfumes; upon which I 
turned to Romoli, and bid him burn all the Most precious perfumes he had. At 
the same time I cast my eye upon Agnolino Gaddi, who was terrified to such a 
degree that he could scarce distinguish objects, and seemed to be half-dead. 
Seeing him in this condition, I said,  Agnolino, upon these occasions a man 
should not yield to fear, but should stir about and give his assistance; so 
come directly and put on some more of these perfumes.' Poor Agnolino, upon 
attempting to move, was so violently terrified that the effects of his fear 
overpowered all the perfumes we were burning. The boy, hearing a 
crepitation, ventured once more to raise his head, when, seeing me laugh, he 
began to take courage, and. said, 'That the devils were flying away with a 
vengeance.
     "In this condition we stayed till the bell rang for morn-ing prayer. 
The boy again told us, that there remained but few devils, and these were at 
a great distance. When the magician had performed the rest of his 
ceremonies, he stripped off his gown and took up a wallet full of books 
which he had brought with him. We all went out of the circle together, 
keeping as close to each other as we possibly could, especially the boy, who 
had placed himself in the middle, holding the necromancer by the coat, and 
me by the cloak. As we were going to our houses in the quarter of Banchi, 
the boy told us that two of the demons whom we had seen at the amphitheatre, 
went on before us leaping and skipping, sometimes running upon the roofs of 
the houses, and sometimes upon the ground. The priest declared, that though 
he had often entered magic circles, nothing so extraordinary had ever 
happened to him. As we went along, he would fain persuade me to assist with 
him at consecrating a book, from which, he said, we should derive immense 
riches  we should then ask the demons to discover to us the various 
treasures with which the earth abounds, which would raise us to opulence and 
power; but that those love affairs were mere follies, from whence no good 
could be expected. I answered, 'That I would readily have accepted his 
proposal if I understood Latin:' he redoubled his persuasions, assuring me, 
that the know-ledge of the Latin language was by no means material. He 
added, that he could have Latin scholars enough, if he had thought it worth 
while to look out for them; but that he could never have met with a partner 
of resolution and intrepidity equal to mine, and that I should by all means 
follow his advice. Whilst we were engaged in this conversation, we arrived 
at our respective homes, and all that night dreamt of nothing but devils."


Celonitis or Celontes: This wonderful stone is found in the tortoise, and 
its property is to resist fire. Its healing virtues are two-fold, similar to 
those of the Asinius. Carried under the tongue on the day of the new moon, 
and for the fifteen days following, during the lunar ascen-sion, it inspires 
its fortunate possessor to foretell future events every day from sunrising 
to six o'clock; and in the decrease during the intervening hours.


Celts: Magic : among the Celtic peoples in ancient times was so closely 
identified with Druidism that its origin may be said to have been Druidic. 
That Druidism was of Celtic origin, however, is a question upon which much 
discussion has been lavished, some authorities, among them Rhys, believing 
it to have been non-Celtic and even non-Aryan origin. This is to say that 
the earliest non-Aryan or so-called "Iberian" or Megalithic people of 
Britain intro-duced the immigrant Celts to the Druidic religion. An argument 
in favour of this theory is that the continental Celts sent their neophyte 
Druid priests to Britain to undergo a special training at the hands of the 
Druids there, and there is little doubt that this island was regarded as the 
headquarters of the cult. The people of Cisalpine Gaul, for instance, had no 
Druidic priesthood.  (See Rice Holmes' Caesar's Conquest, pp. 532-536). 
Caesar has told us that in Gaul Druidic seminaries were very numerous , and 
that in them severe study and discipline were entailed upon the neophytes, 
the principal business of whom was to commit to memory countless verses 
enshrining Druidic knowledge and tradition. That this instruction was astro-
logical and magical we have the fullest proof, and it is with these aspects 
of the Celtic religion alone that we have to deal in this place.
     The Druids were magi as they were hierophants in the same sense that 
the American-Indian medicine-man is both magus and priest. That is they were 
medicine-men On a higher-scale, and possessed a larger share of trans-
cendental knowledge than the shamans of more barbarous races. Thus they may 
be said to be a link between the shaman and the magus of medieval times. 
Many o: their practices were purely shamanistic, whilst others were more 
closely connected with medieval magical rite. But they were not the only 
magicians among the Celts, for we find that magic power is frequently the 
progression of wo-men and the poetic craft. The art magic of Druidism bad 
many points of comparison 'with most magical systems, and may be said to 
have approximated more to that black magic which desires power for the sake 
of power alone, than to any more transcendental type. Thus it included the 
power to render oneself invisible, to change the bodily shape, to produce an 
enchanted sleep, to induce lunacy, and the utterance of spells and charms 
which caused death. Power over the elements was also claimed, as in the case 
of Broichan, a Caledonian Druid who opposed Saint Co-lumbia, as we read in 
Adamnan's Life of that saint as follows
     "Broichan, speaking one day to the holy man, says: 'Tell me, Columba, 
at what time dost thou propose to sail forth? "On the third day,' says the 
Saint, 'God willing and life remaining, we propose to begin our voyage.' 
'Thou wilt not be able to do so,' says Broichan in reply, 'for I can make 
the wind contrary for thee, and bring dark clouds upon thee.' The Saint 
says: 'The omnipo-tence of God rules over all things, in Whose Name all our 
movements, He Himself governing them, are directed.’ What more need be said? 
On the same day as he had purposed in his heart the Saint came to the long 
lake of the river Ness, a great crowd following. But the Druids then began 
to rejoice when they saw a great darkness coming over, and a contrary wind 
with a tempest. Nor should it be wondered at that these things can be done 
by the art of demons, God permitting it, so that even winds and waters are 
roused to fury.
For it was thus that legions of devils once met the holy bishop Germanus in 
mid-ocean, what time he was sailing from the Gallican Gulf (the British 
Channel) to Britain in the cause of man's salvation, and stirred up 
dangerous storms and spread darkness over the sky and obscured daylight. All 
which storms, however, were stilled at the prayer of St. Germanus, and, 
quicker than said, ceased, and the darkness was swept away.
     "Our Columba, therefore, seeing the furious elements stirred up against 
him, calls upon Christ the Lord, and entering the boat while the sailors are 
hesitating, he with all the more confidence, orders the sail to be rigged 
against the wind. Which being done, the whole crowd looking on meanwhile, 
the boat is borne along against the contrary winds with amazing velocity. 
And after no great interval, the adverse winds veer round to the advantage 
of the voyage amid the astonishment of all. And thus, through-out that whole 
day, the blessed man's boat was driven along by gentle favouring breezes, 
and reached the desired haven. Let the reader, therefore, consider how great 
and saintly was that venerable man through whom Almighty God manifested His 
glorious Name by such miracu-lous powers as have just been described in the 
presence of a heathen people."
     The art of rain-making. bringing down fire from the sky, and causing 
mists, snow-storms and floods was also claimed by the Druids. Many of the 
spells probably in nse among the Druids survived until a comparatively late 
period, and are still in use in some remote Celtic localities-the names of 
Saints being substituted for those of Celtic deities, -as in Well-worship 
(q.v.) a possibly Druidic cultus, and certain ritual practices which are 
still carried out in the vicinity of megalithic structures. In pronouncing 
incan-tations, the usual method employed was to stand upon one leg, to point 
to the person or object on which the spell was to be laid with the fore-
finger, at the same time closing an eye, as if to concentrate the force of 
the entire person-ality upon that which was to be placed under ban. A 
manuscript preserved in the Monastery of St. Gall and dating from the eighth 
or ninth century, has preserved magical formulae for the preservation of 
butter and the healing of certain diseases in the name of the Irish god 
Diancecht. These and others bear a close resemblance to Babylonian and 
Etruscan spells, and this goes to strengthen the hypothesis often put 
forward with more or less ability that Druidism had an eastern origin. All 
magical rites were accompanied by spells. Druids often accompanied an army 
to assist by their magical art in confounding the enemy.
There is little doubt that the conception of a Druidic priesthood has 
descended down to our own time in a more or less debased condition in 
British Celtic areas. Thus the existence of guardians and keepers of wells 
said to possess magical properties, and the fact that certain familiar 
magical spells and formulae are handed down from one  generation to another, 
is a proof of the survival of Druidic tradition, however feeble. Females are 
generally the conservators of these mysteries, but that there were Druid 
priestesses is fairly certain.
     There are also indications that to some extent Scottish witchcraft was 
a survival of Celtic religio-magical practice. (See Witchcraft, Scottish in 
article Scotland.)
     Amulets were extensively worn by the Cells, the prin-cipal forms in use 
being phallic (against the evil eye), coral, the "serpent's egg "-some 
description of fossil. The person who passed a number of serpents together 
forming such an "egg" from their collected spume had to catch it in his 
cloak ere it fell to earth, and then make all speed over a running-stream 
where he was safe from the reptiles' vengeance. Totemic amulets were also 
common. (See Scotland and Ireland.)

Cepionidus : A stone of many colours, said to reflect the likeness of the 
beholder.


Ceraunius, or Cerraclus : is described as a pyramidal crystal-line stone, 
tinged with saffron, and is said to fall from the clouds. It preserves from 
drowning, from injury by light-ning, and gives pleasant dreams.


Ceraunescopy : Divination practised by the ancients by the examination of 
the phenomena of the. air.


Ceremonial Magic : Ceremonial magic is chiefly occupied with the art of 
dealing with spirits. Its rites are supposedly religious, and the rituals 
which contain it partake largely of the nature of religious observances. It 
is not, as gen-erally supposed, a reversed Christianity or Judaism, nor does 
it partake of the profanation of religious ritual. It is in effect an 
attempt to derive power from God for the successful control of evil spirits. 
In the Grimoires and Keys of Black Magic, the operator is constantly 
reminded that he must meditate continually on the undertaking in hand, and 
centre every hope in the infinite goodness of the Great Adonai. The god 
invoked in Black Magic is not Satan as is so often supposed, but the Jehovah 
of the Jews, and the Trinity of the Christians. The founda-tion of practical 
magic is almost certainly the belief in the power of divine words to compel 
the obedience of all spirits to those who could pronounce them. Such words 
and names were supposed to invoke or dismiss the deni-zens of the spirit 
world, and these with suitable prayers were used in all magical ceremonies. 
Again it was thought that it was easier to control evil spirits than to 
enlist the sympathies of angels.
     He who 'would gain such power over demons is exhorted in the magical 
texts which exist to observe continence and abstinence, to disrobe as seldom 
and sleep as little as possible during the period of preparation, to 
meditate continually on his undertaking and centre all his hopes on the 
Great Adonai. The fast should be most austere, and human society must be 
avoided as much as possible. The concluding days of the fast should be 
additionally strict-sustenance being reduced to bread and water. Daily 
ablutions are necessary, and these must be made in water which has been 
previously exorcised according to the ritual: especially must this be 
observed immediately before the ceremony. Certain periods of the day and 
night are ruled by certain planets and these are to be found in the book 
known as the Key of Solomon the King (q.v). (See also Astrology.) The Book 
of Black Magic taught that the hours of Saturn, Mars and Venus are good for 
communion with spirits,-the hour of the first named planet for invoking 
souls in Hell; and that of the second those who have been slain in battle. 
In fact these hours and seasons are ruled by the laws of astrology. In the 
preparation of the instruments employed, the cere-monies of purifying and 
consecrating, must be carefully observed. An aspergillum composed of mint, 
marjoram, and rosemary should be used for the first and should be contained 
in a pot of glazed earth. For fumigation a chafing dish should be used 
filled with freshly kindled coal and perfumed with aloe-wood or mace, 
benzoin or storax.
     The experiment of holding converse with spirits should be made in the 
day and hour of Mercury: that is the 1st or 8th, or the 15th or 22nd (See 
Necromancy). The Grand Grimoire says that when the night of action has 
arrived, the operator shall take a rod, a goat-skin, a Wood-stone, two 
crowns of vervain, and two candlesticks with candles; also a new steel and 
two new flints, enough wood to make a fire, half a bottle of brandy, incense 
and camphor, and four nails from the coffin of a dead child. Either one or 
three persons must take part in the ceremony-on of whom only must address 
the spirit. The Kabbalistic circle is formed with strips of kid's skin 
fastened to the ground by the four nails. With the blood-stone a triangle is 
traced within the circle, beginning at the eastern point. The letters a e a 
j must be drawn in like manner, as also the Name of the Saviour between two 
crosses. The candles and vervain crowns are then set in the left and right 
sides of the triangle within the circle, and they with the brazier are set 
alight-the fire being fed with brandy and camphor. A prayer is then 
repeated. The operator must be careful to have no alloyed metal about him 
except a gold or silver coin wrapped in paper. which must be cast to the 
spirit when he appears outside the circle. The spirit is then conjured three 
times. Should the spirit fail to appear. the two ends of the magic rod must 
be plunged into the flames of the brazier. This ritual is known as the Rite 
of Lucifuge, and is believed to invoke the demon Lucifuge Rofocale.
     For further information concerning the ceremonial of magic. See 
Necromancy and the articles on the various rituals of magic, such as 
Arbatel. Key of Solomon, Grimo-rium Verum, etc. (See Magic.)


Ceroscopy : Divination by wax. The process was as follows. Fine wax was 
melted in a brass vessel until it became a liquid of uniform consistence. It 
was then poured slowly into another vessel filled with cold water, in such a 
way that the wax congealed in tiny discs upon the surface of the water. The 
magician then interpreted the figures thus presented as he saw fit.


Chagrin or Cagrino : An evil spirit believed in by the Con-tinental Gypsies. 
It has the form of a hedgehog, is yellow in colour, and is a foot and a half 
in length and a span in breadth. " I am certain," says Wlislocki, "that this 
creature is none other than the equally demoniac being called Harginn, still 
believed in by the inhabitants of North-western India. Horses are the 
special prey of the Chagrin, who rides them into a state of exhaustion, as 
does the Guecubu (q.v.) of Chili. The next day they appear sick and weary, 
with tangled manes and bathed in sweat. When this is observed they are 
tethered to a stake which has been rubbed with garlic juice. then a red 
thread is laid on the ground in the form of a cross, or else some of the 
hair of the animal is mixed with salt, meal and the blood of a bat and 
cooked to bread, with which the hoof of the horse is smeared. The empty 
vessel which contained the mix-ture is put in the trunk of a high tree while 
these words are uttered:

"Tarry, pipkin, in this tree. 
Till such time as full ye be."

Chain, Forming a : In spiritualism, a term denoting the joining of the hands 
of the sitters round a table, whereby the magnetic current is strengthened 
and reinforced. The Baron de Guldenstubbe gives the following directions for 
forming a chain. "In order to form a chain, the twelve persons each place 
their right hand on the table, and their left hand on that of their 
neighbour, thus making a circle round the table. Observe that the medium or 
mediums if there be more than one, are entirely isolated from those who form 
the chain."
     Dr. Lapponi, in his Hypnotism and Spiritism (trans. London, 1906), 
gives an account of the usual procedure for the formation of a chain. "He 
(the medium) makes those present choose a table, which they may examine as 
much as they like, and may place in whatever part of the room they choose. 
He then invites some of the assistants to place their hands on the table in 
the following manner:
The two thumbs of each person are to be touching each other, and each little 
finger is to be in communication with the little finger of the persons on 
either side. He himself completes the chain with his two hands. The hands of 
all altogether rest on the edge of the table. (See Planetary Chains.)

Chakras : These. are, according to theosophists, the sense organs of the 
etheral body (q.v.) and receive their name from their appearance which 
resembles vortices. Alto-gether there are ten chakras-visible only to 
clairvoyants-but of these it is advisable to use only seven. They are 
situated, not on the denser physical body, but opposite certain parts of it 
as follows: (1) the top of the head, (2) between the eyebrows, (3) the 
throat, (4) the heart, (5) the spleen-(where vitality is indrawn from the 
sun), (6) the solar plexus, (7) the base of the spine. The remaining three 
chakras are situated in the lower part of the pelvis and normally are not 
used, but are brought into play only in Black Magic. It is by means of the 
chakras that the trained occultist can become acquainted with the astral 
world. (See Theosophy.)


Chalcedony : A good specific against phantasy and the illu-sions of evil 
spirits. It also quickens the power of the body, and renders its possessor 
fortunate in law. To the latter effect it must be perforated and suspended 
by hairs from an ass. The black variety prevents hoarseness and clears the 
voice.


Chams : A race of Indo-Chinese origin, numbering about 130,000 souls, 
settled in Annam, Siam, Cochin-China, and Cambodia. They have some 
reputation among the sur-rounding population as sorcerers; this corruption 
probably arising from the mythic influence of a conquered race. Their 
magicians claim to be able to slay at a distance, or to bring ruin and 
disease by the aid of magical formula. Among' the Cambodian Chams, sorcerers 
are cordially de-tested by the common people as they are believed to be the 
source of all the evil which befalls them, and the ma-jority of them usually 
end their days by secret assassina-tion. They are nearly always of the 
female sex, and enter the sisterhood by means of a secret initiation held in 
the depths of the forest at the hour of midnight. Indeed the actual method 
of initiation is known to us. The woman who desires to become a sorceress 
procures the nest of a termite, and sacrifices thereon a cock (See Cook), 
cutting it in two from the head to the tail, and dancing in front of it in a 
condition of complete nudity, until by force of her incantations the two 
halves of the bird approach one another and it becomes once more alive and 
gives vent to a crow. Sorceresses are said to be known by the ten-dency of 
their complexion to alter its hue, and by their swollen and bloodshot eyes. 
They possess numerous rites for the propitiation of evil spirits, in which, 
in common with the neighbouring and surrounding populations, they implicitly 
believe  Thus in building a house numerous propitiatory rites must be 
observed, accompanied by in-vocation of the protecting deities. They believe 
in lucky and unlucky days, and are careful not to undertake any-thing of 
importance unless favoured by propitious omens. They possess many peculiar 
superstitions. Thus they 'will not disturb grain which has been stored 
during the day time, as they say it is then asleep, and wait until night-
fall before supplying themselves from it. They also have many magical 
agricultural formulae, such as the "instruc-tion" to, and  passing" of, the 
standing rice-stems in the harvest field before they are cut and garnered, 
so that they may be worthy to be stored. The Brahmanic Chams believe that 
the souls of good men betake themselves to the sun, those of women to the 
moon, and those of the coolie class into clouds, but these are only places 
of tem-porary sojourn, until such time as all finally come to reside within 
the centre of the earth. The belief in metempsy-chosis is also highly 
popular. See E. Aymonier, Les Tchames et leur Religions, Paris, 1891;  
Aymonier Chaton, Dictionnaire Cam-Francaise, Paris, 1906; Cahaton, Nou-
velles recherches sur les chams, Paris, 1901.


Changelings : The substitution of a little old mannikin of the elf race, for 
a young child. There are many tales repre-sentative of this ,belief in 
Scotland. The changeling grows up peevish and misshapen, always crying, and 
gives many proofs of its origin to those versed in such matters. There are 
many ways of getting rid of him, such as sticking a knife into him, making 
him sit on a gridiron with a fire below, dropping him into a river, etc.,-
which one would imagine would prove fairly successful  The changeling 
sometimes gives himself away by 'unthinking reference to his age.

Charlemagne; or Charles the Great : The greatest of Frank-ish kings; was the 
elder son of Pepin the Short, and suc-ceeded his father in 768 A.D. He is 
included in this work chiefly because of his close connection with the 
supernatural so far as legend is concerned. Again and again in the pages of 
French romance, notably in these romances dealing with the adventures of 
William of Orange, do we find the Emperor visited by angels who are the 
direct messengers of the heavenly power. This of course is to symbolise his 
position as the head and front of Christendom in the world. He was its 
champion and upholder, surrounded as he was on all sides by the forces of 
paganism,-' the Moors on his southern borders, and the Prussian and Saxons 
on his flank. Charles was regarded by the Christians of Europe as the direct 
representative of heaven,, whose mission it was to Christianise Europe and 
to defend the true faith in every way. No less do we find him and his court 
connected with the realm of fiery. Notices of the encounters of the fairy 
folk by his paladins are not so nu-merous in the original French romances 
which deal with him and them; but in the hands of Boiardo, Ariosto, and 
Pulci, they dwelt in an enchanted region where at any moment they might meet 
with all kinds of supernatural beings. But both in the older and later 
romances the powers of magic and enchantment are ever present. These are 
chiefly instanced in magical weapons such as the Sword Durandal of Roland 
which cannot be shivered; the mag-ical ointments of giant-like Ferragus, 
which rubbed on their bodies make them invulnerable; the wearing of armour 
which exercises a similar guardianship on the body of its possessor, and so 
forth. but we find heroes like Ogier, the Dane, penetrating into fairy land 
itself, and wedding its queen. This was the fate of a great many medieval 
heroes, and Ogier finds in the enchanted realm King Arthur. and several 
other paladins. The analogous cases of Tom-a-Lincolne. Taunhauser and Thomas 
the Rhymer, will readily occur to the reader. The magical and the marvellous 
is everywhere in use in the romances which deal with Charlemagne. Indeed in 
this respect they entirely put in the shade the later romances proper, as 
distinguished from the Chansons de Geste.


Charm (Carmen) : A magical formula, sung or recited to bring about a 
supposedly beneficial result, or to confer magical efficacy on an amulet. In 
popular usage the same word is employed to designate the incantation and the 
object which is charmed. For the material object (See Amulet:) for the 
recital (See Spells.)


Charnock, Thomas :  Alchemist.  (1524 ? - 1581).  Com-paratively little 
biographical matter concerning this Eng-lish alchemist is forthcoming, but 
it is recorded that he was born somewhere in the Isle of Thanet, Kent; while 
as to the date, this is revealed inasmuch as one of his manu-scripts, dated 
1574, is stated by the writer to have been penned in  the fifty years of my 
age." As a young man he travelled all over England in search of alchemistic 
know-ledge, but eventually he fixed his residence at Oxford, and here he 
chanced to make the acquaintance of a noted scien-tist. The latter, greatly 
impressed with the youth's cleverness, straightway appointed him his 
confidant and assistant in general; and, after working in this capacity for 
a number of years, Charnock found himself the sole legatee of his patron's 
paraphernalia. and likewise of the various secrets written in his note-
books. Armed thus, he proceeded to devote himself more eagerly than ever to 
the quest of gold-production; but in 1555, just as he im-agined himself on 
the verge of triumph, his hopes were frustrated by a sudden explosion in his 
laboratory; while in 1557, when he again thought that success was imminent. 
the press-gang arrived at his house and laid violent hands on him, being 
anxious for recruits wherewith to swell the English army then fighting the 
French. The alchemist was bitterly chagrined on being kidnapped in this 
wise, and, lest his secrets should be discovered by prying eyes, he set 
himself to destroy all his precious impedinlenta.

"With my works made such a furious faire 
That the gold flew forth in the aire,"-

so he writes concerning this iconoclasm, and, subsequent to this event, he 
proceeded to France as a soldier, and took part in the disastrous campaign 
which culminated in the English being worsted at Calais by the Duc de Guise. 
How Charnock fared during the expedition is not known, and it is likely that 
he found small pleasure in the rough life; but be that as it may, he 
returned to England safely, and in 1562 he was married to one Agnes Norton. 
There-after he settled at Stockland, in the county of Somerset, and here he 
continued to pursue scientific researches, ap-parently unmolested by further 
visitations from the military powers. Nor would it seem that the clergy 
molested him either, or 'looked askance on his alchemistic studies; for on 
his death, which occurred in 1581, his mortal remains were duly interred at 
Otterhampton Church, Bridgwater.       
     That facetious antiquary and historian, Anthony Wood, in his Athenae 
Oxoniensis, credits Charnock with a consid-erable amount of writing, and it 
is possible that several items enumerated are in reality from some other pen 
than the alchemist's. However, there are certain books which the latter 
undoubtedly wrote, notably AEnigma ad Alchi-miam, issued in 1572; while no 
less interesting than this is the Breviary of Natural Philosophy, which is 
couched in verse, was published originally in 1557, and was subse-quently 
reprinted in the Theatrum Chemicum of Elias Ashmole.

China: Although it can hardly be said that any system of magic worthy of the 
name ever originated in China, and though magical practice was uncommon, yet 
instances are not wanting of the employment of magical means in the 
Celestial Empire, and the belief in a supernatural world peopled by gods, 
demons and other beings is very strong in the popular Chinese mind.
     "Although the Chinese mind possessed under such a constitution but few 
elements in which magic could strike root and throw out its ramifications 
and influence, yet we find many traces giving evidence of the instinctive 
movement of the mind, as well as of magical influence; though certainly not 
in the manner or abundance that we meet with it in India. The great variety 
of these appear-ances is, however, striking, as in no other country are they 
so seldom met with.
     As the King, as it were, microcosmically represents the human races in 
fortune or misfortune before the divinity so must his eye be constantly 
directed to those signs in which the will of the Most High is revealed; 'He 
must observe dreams as much as the phenomena of nature, the eclipses and the 
positions of the stars; and, when all else is wanting, he must consult the 
oracle of the tortoise, or the Plant Tsche, and direct his actions 
accordingly.' He is therefore, as it were, the universal oracle of the 
people, as the popular mind is relieved from every flight of imag-ination by 
a highly remarkable mental compulsion."
     "It is easy to understand from these circumstances wherefore we find so 
few of these phenomena of magic and the visionary and ecstatic state, in 
other parts of the East so frequent, and therefore they are scattered and 
uncertain. Accounts are, however, not wanting to show that the phenomena as 
well as theories of prophecy were known in more remote times. Under the 
Emperor Hoel Ti, about A.D. 304, a mystical sect arose in China calling 
themselves the teachers of the emptiness and nothingness of all things. They 
also exhibited the art of binding the power of the senses, and producing a 
condition which they believed perfection."
     Demonism and Obsession. The Chinese are implicit believers in demons 
whom they imagine surround them on every hand. Says Peebles  "English 
officials, Ameri-can missionaries, mandarins and many of the Chinese 
literati (Confucians, Taoists and Buddhist believers alike) declare that 
spritism in some form, and under some name, is the almost universal belief 
of China. It is generally denominated 'ancestral worship.'"
     "There is no driving out of these Chinese," says Father Gonzalo, "the 
cursed belief that the spirits of their an-cestors are ever about them, 
availing themselves of every opportunity to give advice and counsel."
     "The medium consulted," remarks Dr. Doolittle, "takes in the hand a 
stick of lighted incense to dispel ad defiling influences, then prayers of 
some kind are ,repeated, the body becomes spasmodic, the medium’s eyes are 
shut, and the form sways about, assuming the walk and peculiar attitude of 
the spirit when in the body. Then the com-munication' from the divinity 
begins, which may be of a faultfinding or a flattering character. . . . 
Sometimes these Chinese mediums profess to be possessed by some specified 
historical god of great healing power, and in this condition they prescribe 
for the sick. It is believed that the ghoul or spirit invoked actually casts 
himself into the medium, and dictates the medicine."
    "Volume, might be written upon the gods, genii and familiar spirits 
supposed to be continually in communi-cation with this people," writes Dr. 
John L. Nevius, in his works, China and The Chinese. "The Chinese have a 
large number of books upon this subject, among the most noted of which is 
the Liau-chai-chei,' a large work of sixteen volumes. . . . Tu Sein 
signifies a spirit in the body, and there are a class of familiar spirits 
supposed to dwell in the bodies of certain Chinese who became the mediums of 
communication with the unseen world. In-dividuals said 'to be possessed by 
these spirits are visited
by multitudes, particularly those who have lost recently relatives by death, 
and wish to converse with them.
Remarkable disclosures and revelations are believed to be made by the 
involuntary movements of a bamboo pencil, and through a similar method some 
claim to see in the dark. Persons considering themselves endowed with 
superior intelligence are firm believers in those and other modes of 
consulting spirits."
     The public teacher in Chen Sin Ling (W. J. Plumb says) " In the 
district of Tu-ching, obsessions by evil spirits or demons are very common.  
He further writes that "there are very many cases also in Chang-lo." Again 
he says:
     "When a man is thus afflicted, the spirit (Kwei) takes possession of 
his body without regard to his being strong or weak in health. It is not 
easy to resist the demon's power. Though without bodily ailments, possessed 
per-sons appear as if ill. When under the entrancing spell of the demon, 
they seem different from their ordinary selves.
     "In most cases the spirit takes possession of a man's body contrary to 
his will, and he is helpless in the matter. The kwei has the power of 
driving out the man's spirit, as in sleep or dreams. When the subject awakes 
to consciousness, he has not the slightest knowledge of what has tran-
spired.
     "The actions of possessed persons vary exceedingly. They leap about and 
toss their arms, and then the demon tells them what particular spirit he is, 
often taking a false name, or deceitfully calling himself a god, or one of 
the genii come down to the abodes of mortals. Or, perhaps, it professes to 
be the spirit of a deceased husband or wife. There are also kwei of the 
quiet sort, who talk and laugh like other people, only that the voice is 
changed. Some have a voice like a bird. Some speak Mandarin-the language of 
Northern China-and some the local dialect; but though the speech proceeds 
from the mouth of the man, what is said does not appear to come from him. 
The outward appearance and manner is also changed.
     “In Fu-show there is a class of persons who collect in large numbers 
and make use of incense, pictures, candles and lamps to establish what are 
called incense tables.' Taoist priests are engaged to attend the ceremonies 
and they also make use of 'mediums.' The Taoist writes a charm for the 
medium, who, taking the incense .stick in his hand, stands like a graven 
image, thus signifying his willingness to have the demon come and take 
possession of him. Afterward, the charm is burned and the demon-spirit is 
worshipped and invoked, the priest, in the mean-while' going on with his 
chanting. After a while the medium begins to tremble, and then speaks and 
announces what spirit has descended, and asks what is wanted of him. Then, 
whoever has requests to make, takes incense sticks, makes prostrations, and 
asks a response respecting some disease, or for protection from some 
calamity. In winter the same performances are carried on to a great extent 
by gambling companies; If some of the responses hit the mark, a large number 
of people are attracted. They establish a shrine and offer sacrifices, and 
appoint days, calling upon people from every quarter to come and consult the 
spirit respecting diseases. .
     "There is also a class of men who establish what they call a 'Hall of 
Revelations.' At the present time there are many engaged in this practice. 
They are, for the most part, literary men of great ability. The people in 
large numbers apply to them for responses. The mediums spoken of above are 
also numerous. All of the above practices are not spirits seeking to possess 
men; but rather men seeking spirits to possess them, and allowing them-
selves to be voluntarily used as their instruments.
As to the outward appearance of persons when possessed, of course, they are 
the same person as to outward form as at ordinary times; but the colour of 
the counte-nance may change. The demon may cause the subject to assume a 
threatening air, and a fierce, violent manner, The muscles often stand out 
on the face, the eyes are closed, or they protrude with a frightful stare. 
These demons sometimes prophesy.
     "The words spoken certainly proceed from the mouths of the persons 
possessed; but what is said does not appear to come from their minds or 
wills, but rather from some other personality, often accompanied by a change 
of voice. Of this there can be no doubt. When the subject returns to 
consciousness, he invariably declares himself ignorant of what he has said.
     "The Chinese make use of various methods to cast out demons. They are 
so troubled and vexed by inflictions affecting bodily health, or it may be 
throwing stones, moving furniture, or the moving about and destruction of 
family utensils, that they are driven to call in the service of some 
respected scholar or Taoist priest, to offer sacrifices, or chant sacred 
books, and pray for protection and ex-emption from suffering. Some make use 
of sacrifices and offerings of paper clothes and money in order to induce 
the demon to go back to the gloomy region of Yan-chow. As to whether these 
methods. have any effect, I do not know. As a rule, when demons are not very 
troublesome, the families afflicted by them generally think it best to hide 
their affliction, or to keep these wicked spirits quiet by sacrifices, and 
burning incense to them."
     An article in the London Daily News gives lengthy extracts from an 
address upon the Chinese by Mrs. Montague Beaucham, who had spent many years 
in China in edu-cational work. Speaking of their spiritism, she said, "The 
latest London craze in using the planchette has been one of the recognized 
means in China of conversing with evil spirits from time immemorial." She 
had lived in one of the particular provinces known as demon land, where the 
natives are bound up in the belief and worship of spirits. "There is a real 
power," she added, "in this necromancy. They do healings and tell fortunes." 
She personally knew of one instance that the spirits through the planchette 
had foretold a great flood. The boxer rising was prophesied by the 
planchette.. These spirits disturbed family rela-tions, caused fits of 
frothing at the mouth, and made some of their victims insane. In closing she 
declared that "Chinese spiritism was from hell," the obsession baffling the 
power of both Christian missionaries and native priests.
     Dr. Nevius sent out a circular communication for the purpose of 
discovering the actual beliefs of the Chinese regarding demonism through 
which he obtained much valuable information. Wang Wu-Fang, an educated 
Chinese wrote:
     "Cases of demon possession abound among all classes. They are found 
among persons of robust health, as well as those who are weak and sickly. In 
many unquestion-able cases of obsession, the unwilling subjects have 
resisted, but have been obliged to submit themselves to the control of the 
demon.
     "In the majority of cases of possession, the beginning of the malady is 
a fit of grief, anger or mourning. These conditions seem to open the door to 
the demons. The outward manifestations are apt to be fierce and violent. It 
may be that the subject alternately talks and laughs; he walks awhile and 
then sits, or he rolls on the ground, or leaps about; or exhibits 
contortions of the body and twistings of the neck. . . . It was common 
among. them to send for exorcists, who made use of written charms, or 
chanted verses. or punctured the body with needles These are among the 
Chinese methods of cure.
     "Demons are of different kinds. There are those which clearly declare 
themselves; and then those who work in secret. There are those which are 
cast out with difficulty, and others with ease.
"In cases of possession by familiar demons, what is said by the subject 
certainly does not proceed, from his own will. When the demon has gone out 
and the subject re-covers consciousness, he has no recollection whatever of 
what he has said or done. This is true almost invariably.
     "The methods by which the Chinese cast out demons are enticing them to 
leave by burning charms and paper money, or by begging and exhorting them, 
or by frightening them with magic spells and incantations, or driving them 
away by pricking with needles, or pinching with the fingers, in which case 
they cry out and promise to go.
     “I was formerly accustomed to drive out demons by means of needles. At 
that time cases of possession by evil spirits were very common in our 
villages, and my services were in very frequent demand     
The Rev. Timothy Richard, missionary, also writing in response to Dr. 
Nevius’ circular, says:
     "The Chinese orthodox definition of spirit is, 'the soul of the 
departed;' some of the best of whom are raised to the rank of gods. . . . 
There is no disease to which the Chinese are' ordinarily subject that may 
not be caused by demons. In this case the mind is untouched. It is only the 
body that suffers; and the Chinese endeavour to get rid of the demon by vows 
and offerings to the gods. The subject in this case is an involuntary one.
     "Persons possessed range between fifteen and fifty years of age, quite 
irrespective of sex. This infliction comes on very suddenly, sometimes in 
the day, and sometimes in the night. The demoniac talks madly, smashes 
every-thing near him, acquires unusual strength, tears his clothes into 
rags, and rushes into the street, or to the mountains or kills himself 
unless prevented. After this violent pos-session, the demoniac calms down 
and submits to his fate, but under the most heart-rending protests. These 
mad spells which are experienced on the demon's entrance return at 
intervals, and increase in frequency, and gen-erally also in intensity, so 
that death at last ensues from their violence.
     "A Chefoo boy of fifteen was going on an errand. His path led through 
fields where men were working at their crops. When he came up to the men and 
had exchanged a word or two with them, he suddenly began to rave wildly; his 
eyes rolled, then he made for a pond near by. Seeing this, the people ran up 
to him, stopped him from drowning himself and took him home to his parents. 
When he got home, he sprang up from the ground to such a height as 
manifested almost a superhuman strength. After a few days he calmed down and 
became unusually quiet and gentle; but his own consciousness was lost. The 
demon spoke of its friends in Nan-Kin. After six months this demon departed. 
He has been in the service of several foreigners in Chefoo since. In this 
case no worship was offered to the demon.
     "Now we proceed to those, who involuntarily possessed, yield to and 
worship the demon. The demon says he will cease tormenting the demoniac if 
he will worship him, and he will reward him by increasing his riches. But if 
not, he will punish his victim, make heavier his torments and rob him of his 
property. People find that their food is cursed. They cannot prepare any, 
but filth and dirt comes down from the air to render it uneatable. Their 
wells are likewise cursed; their wardrobes are set on fire, and their money 
very mysteriously disappears. Hence arose the custom of cutting off the head 
of a string of cash that it might not run away. . . . When all efforts to 
rid themselves of the demon fail, they yield to it, and say
'Hold! Cease thy tormenting and we will worship thee!, A picture is pasted 
upon the wall, sometimes of a woman, and sometimes of a man, and incense is 
burned, and pros-trations are made to it twice a month. Being thus rev-
erenced, money now comes in mysteriously, instead of going out. Even mill-
stones are made to move at the demon's orders, and the family becomes rich 
at once. But it is said that no luck attends such families, and they will 
eventually be reduced to poverty. Officials believe these things. Palaces 
are known to have been built by them for these demons, who, however, are 
obliged to be satis-fied with humbler shrines from the poor.
     "Somewhat similar to the above class is another small one which has 
power to enter the lower regions. There are the opposite of necromancers, 
for instead of calling up the dead and learning of them about the future. 
destiny of the individual in whose behalf they are engaged, they lie in a 
trance for two days, when their spirits are said to have gone to the Prince 
of Darkness, to inquire how long the sick person shall be left among the 
living.
     "Let us now note the different methods adopted to cast out the evil 
'spirits from the demoniacs. Doctors are called to do it. They use needles 
to puncture the tips of the fingers, the nose, the neck. They also use a 
certain pill, and apply it in the following manner: the thumbs of the two 
hands are tied tightly together, and the two big toes are tied together in 
the same manner. Then one pill is put on the two big toes at the root of the 
nail, and the other at the root of the thumb nails. At the same instant the 
two pills are set on fire, and they are kept until the flesh is burned. In 
the application of the pills, or in the piercing of the needle, the 
invariable cry is: 'I am going; I am going immediately. I will never dare to 
come back again. Oh, have mercy on me this once. I'll never return I
     "When the doctors fail, they' call on people who practise spiritism. 
They themselves cannot drive the demon away, but they call another demon to 
do it. Both the Confu-cianists and Taoists practise this method. . . . Some-
times the spirits are very ungovernable. Tables are turned, chairs are 
rattled, and a general noise of smashing is heard, until the very mediums 
themselves tremble with fear. If the demon is of this dreadful character, 
they quickly write another charm with the name of the par-ticular spirit 
whose quiet disposition is known to them. Lu-tsu is a favourite one of this 
kind. After the burning of the charm and incense, and when prostrations are 
made, a little frame is procured, to which a Chinese pencil is at-tached. 
Two men on each side hold it on a table spread with sand or millet. 
Sometimes a prescription is written, the pencil moving of its own accord(  
They buy the medi-cine prescribed and give it to the possessed. . . . Should 
they find that burning incense and offering sacrifices fails to ,liberate 
the poor victim, they may call in conjurors, such as the Taoists, who sit on 
mats and are carried by invisible power from place to place. They ascend to 
a height of twenty or fifty feet, and are carried to a distance of four or 
five Ii (about half a mile). Of this class are those who, in Manchuria call 
down fire from the sky in those funerals where the corpse is burned. .
     "These exorcists may belong to any of the three 
religions in China. The dragon procession. on the fifteenth of the first 
month, is said by some to commemorate a Buddhist priest's victory over evil 
spirits. . . . They paste up charms on windows and doors, and on the body of 
the demoniac, and conjure the demon never to return. The evil spirit 
answers: ' I'll never return  You need not 'take tile trouble of pasting all 
these charms upon the doors and windows.
     "Exorcists are specially hated by the evil spirits. Some-
times they feel themselves beaten fearfully; but no hand is seen. Bricks and 
stones may fall on them from the sky or housetops. On the road they may 
without any warning be plastered over from head to foot with mud or filth, 
or may be seized when approaching a river. and held under the water and 
drowned."
In his Social Life among She Chinese, Dr. Doolittle says:
     "They have invented several ways by which they find out the pleasure of 
gods and spirits. One of the most common of their utensils is the Ka-pue, a 
piece of bamboo root, bean-shaped, and divided in the centre, to indicate 
the, positive and the. negative. The incense lighted, the Ka-pue properly 
manipulated before the symbol god, the pieces are tossed from the medium's 
hand, indicating the will of the spirit by the way they fall."
     The following manifestation is mental rather than physical:
     "The professional takes in the hand a stick of lighted incense to expel 
all defiling influences; prayers of some sort are repeated, the fingers 
interlaced, and the medium's eyes are shut, giving unmistakable evidence of 
being possessed by some supernatural or spiritual power. The body sways back 
and forward; the incense falls, and the person begins to step about, 
assuming the walk and peculiar attitude of the spirit. This is considered as 
infallible proof that the divinity has entered the' body of the medium. 
Some-times the god, using the mouth of the medium, gives the supplicant a 
sound scolding for invoking his aid to obtain unlawful ,or unworthy ends.
     "Divination," writes Sir John Burrows, "with many strange' methods of 
summoning the dead to instruct the living and reveal the future, is of very 
ancient origin, as is proved by Chinese manuscripts antedating the 
revelations of the Jewish Scriptures."
     An ancient Chinese book called Poh-shi-ching-tsung, consisting of six 
volumes on the "Source of True Divina-tion,' contains the following preface:
     "The secret of augury consists in the study of the mys-teries and in 
communications with gods and demons. The interpretations of the 
transformations are deep and mys-terious. The theory of the science is most 
intricate, the practice of it most important. The sacred classic says: 'That 
which is true gives indications of the future.' To know the condition, of 
the dead, and hold with them in-telligent intercourse, as did the ancients, 
produces a most salutary influence upon the parties     But when from 
intoxication or feasting, or licentious pleasures, they pro-ceed to invoke 
the gods, what infatuation to suppose that their prayers will move them  
Often when no response is given. 'or the interpretation is not verified, 
they lay the blame at the door of the augur, forgetting that their failure 
is due to their want of sincerity. ., . . It is the great fault of augurs, 
too, that, from a desire of gain, they use the art of divination as a trap 
to ensnare' the people."
     Peebles adds; "Naturally undemonstrative and secre-tive, the higher 
classes of Chinese seek to conceal their full knowledge of spirit 
intercourse from foreigners, and from the inferior castes of their own 
countrymen. thinking them not sufficiently. intelligent to rightly use it. 
The lower orders, superstitious and money-grasping, often prostitute their 
magic gifts to gain and fortune-telling. These clair-voyant fortune-tellers, 
surpassing wandering gypsies in 'hitting' the past, infest the temples, 
streets and toad-sides, promising to find lost property, discover precious 
metals and reveal the hidden future."
     Ghosts.-The Chinese are strong in' the belief that they are surrounded 
by the spirits of the dead. Indeed an-cestor-worship constitutes a powerful 
feature in the national faith, but as it deals with religion it does not 
come within the scope of this article. Suffice it to say that the Celestial 
has ever before him the likelihood and 'desirability of communion with the 
dead. On the death of a person they make a hole in the roof to permit the 
soul to 'effect its escape from the house. When a child is at the point of 
death, its mother will go into the garden and call its name, hoping thereby 
to bring back its wandering spirit.
     "With the Chinese the souls of suicides are specially obnoxious, and 
they consider that the very worst penalty that can befall a soul is the 
sight of its former surroundings. This, it is supposed that, in the case of 
the wicked man, 'they only see their homes as if they were near them: they 
see their last wishes disregarded, everything upside down, their substance 
squandered, strangers possess the old estate; in their misery the dead man's 
family curse him, his children become corrupt, land is gone, the wife sees 
her husband tortured, the husband sees his wife' stricken down with mortal 
disease; even friends forget, but some, perhaps, for the sake of bygone 
times, may stroke the coffin and let fall a tear, departing with a cold 
smile.'"
     "In China, the ghosts which are animated by a, sense of duty are 
frequently ,seen: at one time' they seek to serve virtue in distress, and at 
another they aim to restore wrong-fully held" treasure. Indeed, as it has 
been observed, one of the most powerful as well as the most widely diffused 
of the people's ghost stories is that which treats of the persecuted child 
whose mother comes out of' the grave to succour him."'
     "The Chinese have a dread of the wandering spirits of persons who have 
come to an unfortunate end. At Canton, 1817, the wife of an officer of 
Government had occasioned the death of two female domestic slaves, from some 
jealous suspicion it was supposed of her husband's conduct to-wards the 
girls; and, in order to screen herself from the consequences, she suspended 
the bodies by the neck, with a view to its being construed into an act of 
suicide. But the conscious of the woman tormented her to such a degree that 
she became insane, and at times personated the vic-tims of her cruelty, or, 
as the Chinese supposed. the spirits of the murdered girls possessed her, 
and utilised her mouth to declare her own guilt. In her ravings she tore her 
clothes and beat her own person with all the fury of madness; after which 
she would recover her senses for a time, when it was supposed the demons 
quitted her, but only to return with greater frenzy, which took place a 
short time previous to her death. According to Mr. Dennys, the most common 
forms of Chinese ghost story is that wherein the ghost seeks to bring to 
justice the murderer who shuffled off its mortal coil."
     Poltergeists (q.v.) are not uncommon in China, and several cases of 
their occurrence have been recorded by the Jesuit missionaries of the 
eighteenth century in Cochin China. Mr. Dennys in his Folklore of China, 
mentions a case in which a Chinaman was forced to take refuge in a temple by 
the usual phenomena - throwing about of crockery, etc., after the decease of 
a monkey.

It has sometimes been claimed that the systems of Con-fucius and Lao-Tze are 
magical or kabalistic, but such claims have been advanced by persons who did 
not appre-ciate their proper status as philosophic systems. (See Y-Kin, Book 
of.)
     Symbolism. There are numerous mysteries of meaning in the strange 
symbols, characters, personages. birds, beasts, etc. which adorn all species 
of Chinese art objects. For example a rectangular Chinese vase is feminine 
representing the creative or ultimate principle. A group of seemingly 
miscellaneous art objects, depicted perhaps upon a brush tray, are probably 
the po-ku, or 'hundred antiques,' em-blematic of culture and implying a 
delicate compliment to the recipient of the tray. Birds and animals occur 
with
frequency on Chinese porcelains, and, if one will observe closely, it is a 
somewhat select menagerie, in which certain types are emphasised by 
repetition. For instance, the dragon. is so familiar as to be no longer 
remarked, and yet his' significance is perhaps not fully understood by all. 
There are, in fact, three kinds of dragons, the lung of the sky, the Ii of 
the sea, and the kiau. of the marshes. The lung is the favourite kind, 
however, and may be known when met by his having' the head of a camel, the 
horns of a deer, the eyes of a rabbit, ears of a cow, neck of a snake, belly 
of a frog, scales of a carp, claws of a hawk, and palm of a tiger.' His 
special office is to 'guard and support the man-sions of the gods, and he is 
naturally the peculiar symbol of the Emperor,. or Son of Heaven.
     A less familiar beast is the chi-lin, which resembles in part a 
rhinoceros, but has head, feet, and legs like ,a deer, and a tufted tail. In 
spite of his unprepossessing appear-ance he is of a benevolent disposition, 
and his image on a vase or other ornament is an emblem of good government 
and length of days. A strange bird, having the head of a pheasant, a long 
flexible neck and a plumed tail, may often be seen flying in the midst of 
scroll-like clouds, or walking in a grove of treepeonies. This is the 
fengbuang, the Chinese phoenix, emblem of immortality and appearing to 
mortals only as a presage of the auspicious reign of a vir-tuous Emperor. 
The tortoise (kuei), which bears upon its back the seagirt abode of the 
Eight Immortals, is a third supernatural creature associated with strength, 
lon-gevity, and (because of the markings on its back) with a mystic plan of 
numerals which is a key to the philosophy of the unseen.
     Colours have their significance, blue being the colour of the heavens, 
yellow of the earth and the Emperor, red of the sun, white of Jupiter or the 
Year Star, while each dynasty had its own particular hue, that of' the Chou 
dy-nasty being described as 'blue of the sky after rain where it appears 
between the clouds.'
     One could go on indefinitely 'reading' the meaning of the seemingly' 
fantastic creations of the Chinese artist-devotee, but enough has been said 
to show that the strange beings, the conventional arrangements, the 
apparently haphazard conjunction of objective in his decorative schemes are 
far from being matter of chance, but add to their decora-tive properties the 
intellectual charm of significance.

Churchyard : It is not difficult to understand how the church-yard has come 
to be regarded as the special haunt of ghosts. The popular imagination may 
well be excused for sup-posing that the spirits of the dead continue to 
hover over the spot where their bodies are laid. The ancient Greeks thought 
that the souls of the dead were especially powerful near their graves or 
sepulchres, because of some natural tie binding soul and body, even after 
death. The more gross and earthly' a soul was, the less willing was it to 
leave the vicinity of its body, and in consequence. spectres encountered in 
a churchyard were more to be feared than those met with elsewhere. The 
apparitions witnessed at the tombs of saints, however, were to be regarded 
rather as. good angels than the souls of the saints themselves.

Circe : (See Greece.)


Circles, Spiritualistic : A group of persons who meet at intervals for the 
purpose of holding seances for spirit communication. It is essential that at 
least one among them be a medium; occasionally there are several mediums in 
one circle. But indeed ail the members of a circle must be chosen with care, 
if the seances are to be productive of phenomena. The Baron de Guldenstubbe, 
in his Practical Experimental Pheumatology, or the Reality of Spirits and 
the Marvellous Phenomenon of their Direct Writing, published early in the 
history of the movement, gives directions for the forming of a circle after 
the Ameri-can fashion.
     "Setting aside the moral conditions," he says, "which are equally 
requisite it is known that American Circles are based on the distinction of 
positive and 'electric or negative magnetic currents.
     "The circles consist of twelve persons, representing in equal 
proportions 'the positive and negative or sensitive elements. This 
distinction does not follow the sex of the members, though generally women 
are negative and sensitive, while men are positive and. magnetic. The mental 
and physical constitution of each individual must be studied before forming 
the circles, for some delicate women have masculine qualities, while some 
"strong men are, morally speaking, women. A table is placed in a clear and 
ventilated spot; the medium is seated at one end and entirely isolated; by 
his calm and contem-plative quietude he serves as a conductor for the 
electricity and it may be noted that a good somnambulist is usually an 
excellent medium. The six electrical or negative dispositions, which are 
generally recognised by their emotional qualities and their sensibility, are 
placed at the right of the medium, the most sensitive of all being next to 
him. The same rule is followed with the positive personalities, who are at 
the left of the medium, with' the most positive among them next to him. In 
order to form a chain, the twelve person each ,place their right hand on the 
table, and their left hand on that of the neighbour, thus making a circle 
round the table. Observe that the medium or mediums, if there be more than 
one, are entirely isolated from those who form the chain."
The formation of a circle is accomplished on similar lines at the present 
day. M. Camille  Flammarion states that the alternation of the sexes is 
generally provided to "rein-force the fluids." That the seance may be as 
productive when the circle is composed of a few investigators, following no 
rules, but their own, has been abundantly proved in recent years. The one 
indispensable feature is the medium.


Clairaudience ("'Clear Hearing") : The ability to hear sounds inaudible to 
the normal ear, such as "spirit" voices; a faculty analogous to 
clairvoyance, (q.v.), but considerably less frequently met with. If 
clairaudience be ascribed to auditory, as clairvoyance to visual, 
hallucination, its comparative rareness is accounted for, since visual 
hallu-cination is the more common of the two. At the same time there are a 
goodly number of instances of the clair-audient faculty on record, some of 
them of a very pictures-que nature. (See Spirit Music). Perhaps the best 
known case is that of Joan of Arc, but she was not the only martyr who heard 
the voices of saints and angels urging them to the performance of some 
special task. In spiritualistic circles the faculty is frequently claimed by 
mediums, but distinction must be made between the "inner voice," in which 
the latter are supposed to receive communications from the denizens of the 
other world, and an externalised voice comparable to an actual physical 
sound. Frequently some such physical sounds form the basis of an auditory 
hallucination, just as the points of light in a crystal are said to form 
points de repere round which the hallucination of the visualiser may shape 
itself.


Clairvoyance ( i.e. , "clear vision") : A term denoting the supposed 
supernormal faculty of seeing persons and events which are distant in time 
or place, and of which no know-ledge can reach the seer through the normal 
sense-channels. Clairvoyance may be roughly divided into three classes-
retrocognition and premonition, or the perception of past and future events 
respectively, and the perception of contemporary events happening at a 
distance, or outside the range of the normal vision. Clairvoyance may 
include psychometry, second sight, and crystal-gazing, all of which see. For 
the early history of clairvoyance, see Divination. In prophecy, we have a 
form of clairvoyance extending back into antiquity, and second-sight also is 
an ancient form. It is notable that spiritualism in Great Britain was 
directly heralded, about the third decade of the nineteenth century, by an 
outbreak of clairvoyance. Among the clairvoyants of that period may be 
mentioned Alexis Didier (q.v.), whose phenomena suggested that telepathy at 
least entered into his feats, which included the reading of letters enclosed 
in sealed packets, the playing of ecarte. with bandaged eyes, and others of 
a like nature. Clairvoyance remains to the present day a prominent feature 
of the spiritualistic seance. Though there exists a quantity of evidence, 
collected by the members of the Society for Psychical Research and other 
scientific investigators, which would seem to support the theory of a 
supernormal vision, yet at the same time it must be acknowledged that many 
cases of clairvoyance lend themselves to a more mundane ex-planation. For 
instance, it has been shown that it is almost, if not quite, impossible so 
to bandage the eyes of the medium that he cannot make some use of his. 
normal vision. The possibility of hyperaesthesia during trance must also be 
taken into account, nor must we overlook the hypothetical factor of 
telepathy, which may conceiv-ably play a part in clairvoyant performances. A 
private enquiry agency might also be suggested as a possible source of some 
of the knowledge displayed by the professional clairvoyant. The crystal is, 
as has been indicated, a favourite mode of exercising the clairvoyant 
faculty, presumably because the hypnotic state is favourable to the 
development of the supernormal vision, though it might also be suggested 
that the condition thus induced favoured the rising into the upper 
consciousness of knowledge' sub-consciously gleaned. The term clairvoyance 
is also used to cover the power to see discarnate spirits, and is thus 
applied to mediumship generally.


Clan Morna : In Irish romance one of the divisions of the Fianna, whose 
treasure bag containing magic weapons and precious jewels of the Danaan age 
was kept by Fia of that clan.


Clavel :	Author of Histoire Pittoresque de 1a Francmazonnerie. He 
hints in it that when Freemasonry .in Austria was sup-pressed by Charles 
VI., the Order of Mopses was established in its place.


Cledonism, or in full, Cledonismantia :  is the good or evil presage of 
certain words uttered without premeditation when persons come together in 
any way. It also regulated the words to be used on particular occasions. 
Cicero says the Pythagoreans were very attentive to these presages; and 
according to Pausanius, it was a favourite method of divination at Smyrna, 
where the oracles of Apollo were thus interpreted..


Cleromancy : was practised by throwing black and white beans, little bones 
or dice, and perhaps, stones; anything,. in short, suitable for lots. A 
method of practising clero-mancy in the streets of Egypt is mentioned under 
the head of Sortilege, and the same thing was common in Rome. The Thriaean 
lots, named before, meant indifferently the same thing as cleromancy; it was 
nothing more than dicing, only that the objects used bore particular marks 
or charac-ters, ,and were consecrated to Mercury, who was regarded as the 
patron of this method of divination. For this rea-son an olive leaf, called" 
the lot of Mercury," was generally put in the urn in order to propitiate his 
favour.


Clidomancy : could be exercised when the sun or moon is in Virgo. the name 
should be written upon a key the key should be tied' to a Bible, and both 
should be hung upon the nail of the ring-finger of a virgin, who must thrice 
softly repeat certain words. According as the key and book turns or is 
stationary, the name is to be considered right or wrong. Some ancients added 
the seven Psalms with litanies and sacred prayers, and then more fearful 
effects were produced upon the guilty; for not only the key and the book 
turned, but either the impression of the key was found upon him, or he lost 
an eye. Another .method of practising with the Bible and key, is to place 
the street door key on the fiftieth-psalm, close the volume and fasten it 
very tightly with the garter of a female; it is then suspended to a nail and 
will turn when the name of the thief is mentioned. By a third method, two 
persons suspend the Bible between them; holding the ring of the key by their 
two forefingers.


Clothes, Phantom : (See Phantom Dress.)


Cloven Foot : There is an old belief, buttressed by countless tales of 
apparitions, that the Devil always appears with a cloven foot, as a sort of 
distinguishing mark. It has been suggested that the Evil One, having fallen 
lower than any man, is not permitted to take the perfect human form, but 
must have some sort of deformity, i.e., the cloven foot.

Cock : The cock has always been connected with. magical practice in the 
various parts of the world throughout the ages, and is to be considered in 
more than one light in this connection. He is the herald of the dawn, and 
many examples might be cited of assemblies of demons and sorcerers where his 
shrill cry, announcing dayspring, has put the infernal Sabbath to rout. It 
is said that for the purpose of averting such a contingency, sorcerers were 
wont to smear the head and breast of the cock with olive oil, or else to 
place around his neck a collar of vine-branches. In many cases the future 
was divined through the instru-mentality of this bird. (See Alectryomancy).  
It was also believed that in the stomach of the cock was found a stone, 
called Lappilus Alectorius, from the Greek name of the bird, the virtue of 
which was to give strength and courage, and which is said to have inspired 
the gigantic might of Milo of Crotona.
     Originally a native of India, the cock arrived in Europe in early 
times, via. Persia, where we find him alluded to in the Zoroastrian books as 
the beadle of Sraosa, the sun, and affrighter of demons. Among the Arabs, it 
is said that he crows when 'he becomes aware of the presence of jinns. The 
Jews received their conception of the cock as a scarer of evil spirits from 
the Persians, as did the Armenians, who say that he greets with his clarion 
call the guardian angels, who descend to earth. with the day, and that he 
gives' the key-note to the angelic choirs of heaven to commence their daily 
round of song. In India, too, and among the Pagan Slavs, he was supposed to 
scare away demons from dwelling
places, and was often the first living creature introduced into a newly-
built house. The Jews, however, believe that it is possible for the cock to 
become the victim of demons, and they say that if he upsets a dish he should 
be killed. The cock is often used directly in magical practice. Thus, in 
Scotland, he is buried under the patients' bed in cases of epilepsy. The 
Germans believed that if a sorcerer throws a black cock into the air, 
thunder and lightning will follow, and among the Chams of Cambodia, a woman 
who wishes to become a sorceress, sacrifices a live cock on a termite's 
nest, cutting the bird in two from the head to the tail, and placing it on 
an altar, in front of which she dances and sings, until the two halves of 
the bird come together again, and it comes to life and crows. His name was 
often pronounced by the Greeks as a cure for the diseases of animals, and it 
was said by the Romans that locked doors could be opened with his tail 
feathers. The bird was often pictured on amulets in early times, and figured 
as the symbol of Abraxas, the principal deity of a Gnostic sect.
     The cock is often regarded as the guide of souls to the underworld, and 
in this respect was associated by the Greeks with Persephone and Hermes, 
'and the Slavs of pagan times often sacrificed cocks to the dead, and 'to 
the household 'serpents in which they believed their ancestors to be 
reincarnated. Conversely, the cock was sometimes pictured as having an 
infernal connection, especially if his colour be black. Indeed he is often 
employed in black magic, perhaps the earliest instance of this being in the 
Atharia Veda. A black cock is offered up to propitiate the Devil in Hungary, 
and a black hen was used or the same purpose in Germany. The Greek syrens, 
the Shedim of the Talmud, and the Izpuzteque, whom the dead Aztec encounters 
on the road to Mictlan, the Place of the Dead, all have cock's feet. There 
is a widespread folk-belief that once in seven years the cock lays a little 
egg. In Germany it is necessary to throw this over the roof, or tempests 
will wreck the homestead, but should the egg be hatched, it will produce a 
cockatrice or basilisk. In Lithuania they put the cock's egg in a pot, and 
place it in the oven. From this egg is hatched a Kauks a bird with a tail 
like that of a golden pheasant, which, if properly tended, will bring its 
owner great good luck. Gross mentions in a chronicle of Bile, in 
Switzerland, that in the month of August, 1474, a cock of that town was 
accused and convicted of laying an egg. and was condemned to death. He was 
publicly burned along with his egg, at a place called Kablenberg, in sight 
of a great multitude of people.
     The cock was also regarded as having a connection with light and with 
the sun, probably because of the redness of his comb, and the fiery sheen of 
his plumage, or perhaps because he heralds the day. It is the cock who daily 
wakens the heroes in the Scandinavian Asgard.  (See Alectromancy.)


Cock Lane Ghost : The supposed cause of a mysterious out-break of rappings, 
apparitions, and similar manifestations which broke out at a house in Cock 
Lane, Smithfield, London, in 1762. The disturbance was of the usual char-
acter of poltergeist hauntings, but for some reason or other it attracted 
wide-spread attention in London. Crowds flocked to the haunted spot, and 
claimed to have witnessed the manifestations. The ghost purported to be the 
spirit of a former resident in the Cock Lane house, a Mrs. Kent, and stated 
that she had been murdered by her husband. The tenant of the house at the 
time of the disturbance was a man named Parsons, and it was more than 
surmised that he had invented the ghost for the purpose of blackmailing the 
deceased's woman's husband. The disturbance was finally traced to Parson's 
daughter, a girl of eleven, and Parsons himself was prosecuted and 
pilloried. (See Andrew Lang's Cock Lane and Common Sense, (1894).


Coffin Nails : In Devonshire it is said that a ring made from three nails or 
screws that have been used to fasten a coffin, and dug up in a churchyard, 
will act as a charm against convulsions and fits of every kind.

Coleridge, Samuel Taylor : English author and mystic (1772-1834). Samuel 
Taylor Coleridge, one of the greatest of English poets and critics, was born 
in the year 1772 at Ottery St. Mary, Devonshire, his father being John Cole-
ridge, a clergyman and schoolmaster, who enjoyed con-siderable reputation as 
a theological scholar, and was author of a Latin grammar. Samuel's childhood 
was mostly spent at the native village, and from the first his parents 
observed that his was no ordinary temperament, for he showed a marked 
aversion to games. he even eschewed the company of other children, and 
instead gave his time chiefly to promiscuous reading.   At six years of 
age," he writes in one of his letters to his friend, Thomas Poole, I 
remember to have read Belisarius, Robinson Crusoe, and Philip Quarll, and 
then I found the Arabian Nights Entertainments," while in this same letter 
he tells how the boys around him despised him for his eccentricity, the 
result being that he soon became a confirmed dreamer, finding in the kingdom 
of his mind a welcome haven of refuge from the scorn thus levelled at him.
     By the time be was nine years old, Coleridge had shown a marked 
predilection for mysticism, in consequence where of his father decided to 
make him a clergyman; and in 1782 the boy left home to go to Christ's 
Hospital, London, Here he found among his fellow pupils at least one who 
shared his literary tastes, Charles Lamb, and a warm friendship quickly 
sprang up between the two; while a little later Coleridge conceived an 
affection for a young girl called Mary Evans, but the progress of the love 
affair was soon arrested, the poet leaving London In 1790 to go to 
Cambridge. Beginning his university career as a sizar at Jesus College, he 
soon became known as a brilliant conversationalist, yet he made enemies by 
his extreme views on politics and religion, and in 1793, finding himself in 
various difficulties, he went back to London where he enlisted in the 15th 
Dragoons. Bought out soon after-wards by his relations, he returned to 
Cambridge, and in 1794, he published his drama, The Fall of Robespierre, 
while in the following year he was married to Sarah Fricker, and in 1796 he 
issued a volume of Poems. He now began to preach occasionally in Unitarian 
chapels, while in 1797 he met Wordsworth, with whom he speedily became 
intimate, and whom he joined in publishing Lyrical Ballads, this containing 
some of Coleridge's finest things, notably The Ancient Mariner. Nor was this 
the only masterpiece he wrote at this time, for scarcely was it finished, 
ere he composed two other poems of like worth, Christabel and Kubla Khan; 
while in 1798 he was  appointed Unitarian minister at Shrewsbury, and after 
holding this post for a little while, he went to travel in Germany, the 
requisite funds having been given him by Josiah and Thomas Wedgwood, both of 
whom were keen admirers of Cole-ridge's philosophical powers, and were of 
opinion that study on the continent would be of material service to him.
     Among Coleridge's first acts on returning from Germany was to publish 
his translation of Schiller's Wallenstein, while simultaneously he took a 
cottage at Keswick, intend-ing to live there quietly for many years. But 
peace and quiet are benefits usually sought in vain by poets, and Coleridge 
was no exception herein, for early in life he had begun to take occasional 
doses of laudanum, and now this
practice developed into a habit which ruled his whole life. In 1804 he 
sought relief by going to Malta, while afterwards' he visited Rome, and 
though, on returning to England, he was cheered by finding that a small 
annuity had been left him by the Wedgwoods, he was quite incapable of 
shaking off this deadly drug habit. As yet, however, it had not begun to 
vitiate his gifts altogether; and, after staying for awhile with Wordsworth 
at Grasmere, he delivered a series of lectures on poetry at Bristol and sub-
sequently in London. Especially in the Metropolis his genius was quickly 
recognised. and he was made a pensioner of the Society of Literature, this 
enabling him to take a small house at Highgate, and there he mainly spent 
his declining years, while it was in Highgate Cemetery that his remains were 
interred after his death in 1834.
     Everything from Coleridge's hand is penetrated by a wealth of thought. 
Apart from his purely metaphysical works, of which the most notable are Aids 
to Reflection and Confessions of an Enquiring Spirit, his Biographia 
Literaria and other fine contributions to critical literature are all of a 
mystical temper; for Coleridge -more,. perhaps, than any other critics, not 
even excepting Goethe and Walter Pater-is never content with handling the 
surface of things, but always reflects a striving to understand and lay bare 
the mysterious point where artistic creation begins. For him, literature is 
a form of life, one of the most myster-ious forms of life, and while he is 
supremely quick at noticing purely aesthetic merit, and equally quick at 
marking defect, it is really the philosophical element in his criticism 
which gives it its transcendant value and interest.
     Coleridge's metaphysical predilections are not more salient in his 
prose than in his verse, In a singularly beautiful poem, To the Evening 
Star, he tells that he gazes thereon,

"Till I, myself, all spirit seem to grow."

And in most of his poems, indeed, he is "all spirit," while often he 
hypnotises the reader into feeling something of the author"' spirituality. 
Here and there, no doubt, he attempt to express in words things too deep and 
mysterious to be resolved into that sadly limited mode of utterance, the 
result being a baffling and even exasperating obscurity; but waiving 
altogether Coleridge's metaphysical poems, may it not be said justly that he 
introduced the occult into verse with a mastery wholly unsurpassed in 
English literature? May it not be said that The Ancient Mariner, and more 
especially Christabel, are the most beautiful of all poems in which the 
supernatural plays an important part?

Colloquy of the Ancients : A collection of Ossianic legends, made into one 
about the thirteenth or fourteenth centuries. It relates how the Fian 
heroes, Keelta and Oisin, each with eight warriors, met to talk over the 
glorious past for the last time. Then Oisin returns to the Fairy Mound of 
his mother, and Keelta meets with St. Patrick and his monks at Drumdreg. 
Keelta tells the saint many tales, inter-spersed with lyrics, with which he 
is delighted, and he eventually baptises Keelta and his warriors and grants 
them absolution.

Community of Sensation : The term. applied by the early mesmerists to a 
phenomenon of the hypnotic' trance, wherein the somnambule seemed to share 
the sensations of the operator. Thus an hypnotic subject, insensible to pain 
and utterly indifferent to any stimulus applied to his own organism, would 
immediately respond to such stimuli applied to the hypnotist. If the latter 
had his nose tweaked or his hair pulled, the entranced subject, though in a 
separate apartment, would rub the corresponding part of his own person. with 
every sign of pain and indignation. The most common sensations shared in 
this wise were those of tasting and smelling. but apparent community of 
sight and even hearing were not unknown. In the. days of Reichenbach such 
experiences were largely attributed to fraud, but they have since been 
proved to be genuine trance phenomena, probably arising from unconscious 
suggestion and hyperaesthesia, or, in the few cases where that hypo-thesis 
will not cover the ground, telepathic communication between operator and 
subject. Community of Sensation is not, however. confined to the trance -
condition. Many instances of community of sensation arising spontaneously in 
the cases of persons in rapport with one another are to be found in the 
Journal and Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research.


Compacts with the Devil : An anonymous writer has handed down to us the 
agreement entered into between Louis Gaufridi and the devil:
     "I, Louis, a priest, renounce each and every one of the spiritual and 
corporal gifts which may accrue to me from God, from the Virgin, and from 
all the saints, and especially from my patron John the Baptist, and the 
apostles Peter and Paul and St. Francis. And to you, Lucifer, now before me, 
I give myself and all the good I may accomplish, except the returns from the 
sacrament in the cases where I may administer it; all of which I sign and 
attest."
     On his side Lucifer made the following agreement with Louis Gaufridi:
     "I, Lucifer, bind myself to give you, Louis Gaufridi, priest, 'the 
faculty and power of bewitching by blowing with the mouth, all and any of 
the women and -girls you may desire; in proof of which I sign myself 
Lucifer."
     Bodin gives the following: "Magdalen of the Cross, native of Cordova in 
Spain and abbess of a convent, finding that she was suspected by the nuns 
and fearing that she would be burnt if charged, desired to anticipate them, 
and obtain the pardon of the pope' by confessing that from the age of twelve 
years, a bad spirit in the form of a black Moor had desired her chastity, 
and that she had given in, and this had gone on for thirty years or more, 
she usually sleeping with him. Through his means while in the church, she 
was raised up. and when the nuns took the Sacrament after the consecration, 
the host came even to her in the. air, in the sight of the other nuns who 
re-garded it as sacred and the priest also, who used-to complain at that 
time of a host."
     According to Don Calmet there is to be seen at Molsheim in the chapel 
of St. Ignatius in the church of the Jesuit fathers a well-known inscription 
giving the history of a young German nobleman named Michel Louis, of the 
family of Boubenhoren, who was sent when quite young to the court. of the 
Duke of Lorraine to learn French and there lost all his money at cards. 
Reduced to despair he decided. to give himself up to the devil if that 
spirit of evil could or would give him good money. for he was afraid that he 
would be able to supply him only with counterfeit. While thinking this over 
a young man his own age, well-built and well-clothed, suddenly appeared 
before him and asking him the cause of his distress, put out his hand full 
of money and invited him to prove its worth, telling him to look him up 
again. on the morrow. Michel- returned' to his companions who were still 
playing, won back all he had lost and all that of his companions. Then he 
called on his devil who asked in return three drops of. blood which he 
collected in an acorn shell, and offering a pen to Michel told him to write 
to his dictation. This consisted of unknown words, which were taken down
     Compacts on two different notes, one of which the devil retained, and 
the other was put into the arm of Michel in the same places from which the 
blood had been taken. The devil then said: " I undertake to serve you for 
seven years, after which you belong to me without reserve." The young man 
agreed, though with some dread, and the devil did not fail to appear to him, 
day and night in various forms, inspiring him to things varied, unknown and 
curious and always with a tendency of evil. The fatal period of seven years 
was drawing to a end, and the young man was then about twenty years of age. 
He went home to his father, where the devil to whom he had given himself 
inspired him to poison his father and mother, burn the castle and kill 
himself. He tried to carry out all these crimes, but God prevented their 
success -the gun with which he would have' killed himself missed fire twice, 
and the poison failed to act on his parents. Getting more and more uneasy he 
confided the unhappy condition he was in to some of his father's servants 
and begged them to. get help. At the same time the devil seized him, 
twisting his body around and stopping very short of breaking his bones. His 
mother, who followed the teachings of Svenfeld and had enlisted her son in 
them, .finding no help in her cult against the demon who possessed or 
obsessed him, was forced to put him in the care of some monks. But he soon 
left them and escaped to Islade whence lie was sent back to Molsheim by his 
brother, canon of Wissbourg, who put him again into the hands of the Fathers 
of the Society. It was then that the demon made the most violent efforts 
against him, appearing to him in the form of wild animals. One day among 
others the demon, in the form of a man, wild and covered with hair, threw on 
the ground a note or contract different from the true one which he had got 
from the young man, so as to try by this. false show to get him out of' the 
hands of those who were looking after him and to prevent his making a full 
con-fession.  Finally the 20th October, 1603,. was set aside for proof in 
the Chapel of St. Ignatius, and for the repro-duction of the true contract 
containing the deal made with' the demon. The young man made profession of 
the orthodox catholic faith, renounced the demon and received the holy 
Eucharist Then with terrible cries he said that he saw two goats of immense 
size standing with their fore feet in the air and each holding between its 
hoofs one of the contracts or compacts. But when the exorcism was begun and 
the name of St. Ignace was invoked the two goats disappeared and there 
issued from the arm or left hand of the young man practically without pain 
and leaving no scar, the contract, which fell at the feet of the exorcist. 
There still remained. the contract which had been retained by the demon. The 
exorcisms were begun again, St. Ignatius was invoked and a mass was promised 
in his honour, when a stork appeared, large, deformed and ill-shapen, and 
dropped from its beak the second contract, which was found on the altar."
     There is frequent mention among the ancients of certain demons who show 
themselves, especially towards midday, to those with whom they are on 
familiar terms. They visit such persons in the form of men or animals or 
allow themselves to be enclosed in a letter, account or' phial or even in a 
ring, wide and hollow within. "Magicians are known," adds Leloyer, "who make 
use of them, and to my great regret I am forced to admit that the practice 
is only too common."
     Housdorf in his' Theatre des examples du  8e commandement," quoted by 
Goulart, says: "A doctor of medicine forgot himself so far as to form an 
alliance with the enemy of our salvation whom he called up and enclosed in a 
glass from which the seducer and familiar spirit answered him. The doctor 
was fortunate in the cure of ailments, and amassed
great wealth in his practice, so much so that he left his children' the sum 
of 78,000 francs. Shortly before, his death, when his conscience began to 
prick him, he fell into such a frenzy that lie never spoke but to invoke the 
devil or blaspheme the Holy Ghost and it was in this un-fortunate condition 
that he passed away."
     Goulart repeats, from Alexander of Alexandria, the story of a prisoner 
who had, invoked the- help of the devil and had visited the lower regions:
     "The overlord of a small town in the principality of Sulmona and 
Kingdom of Naples, proved very miserly and arrogant in his rule, so much so 
that his subjects were too poor to live beside his harsh 'treatment of them. 
One of them, honest, but poor and despised, gave a sound beating for some 
reason to a hunting dog of this overlord, and the death of the. dog angered 
the latter so much that he had the poor man seized and shut .up in a 
dungeon. After some days the warders, who kept the gates carefully locked 
went to open them as usual to give him a crust of bread, but he was not to 
be found in his cell. Having looked for him. everywhere, again and again, 
and finding no trace of him nor his method of escape, they at last reported 
this wonderful affair to their master, who first ridiculed, and then 
threatened them, ' but realising at length the truth of it, he was no less 
astonished than they. Three days after this alarming incident, and with all 
the doors of the prison and dungeon closed as before, this same prisoner, 
unbeknown to anyone, was found shut up in his own dungeon. He was much 
distracted, and asked to be taken without delay before the overlord as he 
had a matter of much importance to communicate. When taken there he .said 
that he had come back from the lower regions. His case was that, not being 
able to stand any longer the rigors of prison life, overcome with despair, 
fearing death and lacking any good advice, he had invoked the help of the 
devil that he might release him from his confinement. That soon after, the 
Evil One, in a terribly hideous form, had appeared in his dungeon where they 
made a bargain, after which he was dragged out, not without severe injury, 
and projected into subterranean passages, wonderfully hollowed out, like the 
bottom of the earth; there he had seen the dungeons of the wicked, their 
tortures and their miseries, dark and terrible. Kings,. princes and high 
lords were plunged into abysses of darkness where, with inde-scribable 
torture, they were seared with a raging fire. That he had seen popes, 
cardinals and other prelates, beautifully dressed, and other kinds of 
persons in varying garb, suffering' other anguish in gulfs of great depth, 
where the torture was incessant.. Proceeding, he said he had recognised some 
acquaintances and especially a former great friend of his who, recognising 
him in return, enquired as to his condition. The prisoner told him that 
their land was in the hands of a- cruel master, whereupon the other charged 
him to command this cruel master, on returning, to renounce his tyrannical 
ways, otherwise his place would be one of the neighbouring seats, which was 
shown to the prisoner. And (continued this shade) in order that the said 
overlord may have faith in your report recall to him the. secret counsel and 
talks we had together when engaged in a certain war, the chiefs in which he 
named, and then he gave in detail the secret, their agree-ment, the words 
and promises given on each side. The prisoner gave them all distinctly one 
by one in their order, and the lord was much astonished at the message,' 
wondering how things committed to himself and not revealed by him to 
anybody, could be so easily and so boldly unfolded to him by a poor subject 
of his who told them as if he had read them in a book. Further, the prisoner 
enquired of his friend in the lower regions, whether it could be true that 
all the .magnificently dressed persons that he saw were conscious of their 
torments. The other answered that they were seared with an eternal fire, 
overwhelmed with torture and indescribable anguish, and that all this 
scarlet and golden raiment was nought but the colouring of the glowing fire.  
Wishing to test this he drew near to touch this scarlet effect and the other 
begged him to go, but the fierceness of the fire had scorched the whole of 
the palm of his hand, which he showed all roasted and cooked as in the 
embers of a great fire.  The poor prisoner being released, to those who met 
him on his way home he ap-peared stupid.  He neither saw nor heard anything, 
was always deep in thought, spoke little and replied very shortly to the 
questions put to him.  His face, too, had become so hideous, his appearance 
so will and ill-favoured that his wife and children had difficulty in 
recognising him again, and when they did it was only to weep and cry at this 
change in him.  He lived but a few days after his return and so great was 
his distraction that he had great difficulty in looking after his affairs."
     Crespet describes the mark with which Satan brands his own: 
     “It may be assumed that it is no fallacy but very evident that Satan's 
mark on sorcerers is like leprosy, for the spot is insensitive to all 
punctures, and it is in the possession of such marks that one recognises 
them as true sorcerers for they feel the puncture no more than if they were 
leprous, nor does any blood appear, and never indeed, does any,, pain that 
may be inflicted cause them to move the part.
     “They receive, with this badge, the power of injuring and of pleasing', 
and, secretly or openly. their children are made to participate in the oath 
and connection which the fathers have taken with the devil.  Even the 
mothers with this in view, dedicate and consecrate their children to the 
demons, not only as soon as born but even when conceived, and so it happens 
that, through the mini-strations of these demons, sorcerers have been seen 
with two pupils in each eye, while others had the picture of a horse in one 
eye and two pupils in the other, and such serve as marks and badges of 
contracts made with them, for these demons can engrave and render in effigy 
such or similar lines and features on the bodies of the very young embryo."
     “These marks," says Jacques Fontaine, "are not en-graved on the bodies 
of sorcerers by the demons for re-cognition purposes only, as the captains 
of companies of light-horse know those of their number by the colour of 
their coats, but to imitate the creator of all things, to show his power and 
the authority he has gained over those miserable beings who have allowed 
themselves to be caught by his cunning and trickery, and by the recognition 
of these marks of their master to keep them in his power. Further, to 
prevent them, as far as possible, from with-drawing from their promises and 
oaths of fidelity, because though breaking faith with him the marks still 
remain with them and serve, in an accusation, as a means of be-traying them, 
with even the smallest amount of evidence that may be brought forward."
     “Louis Gaufridy, a prisoner, who had just been con-demned to be burnt 
as marked in more than thirty places over the body and on the loins 
especially there was a mark of lust so large and deep, considering the site, 
that a needle could be inserted for the width of three fingers across it 
without any feeling being shown by the puncture."
     The same author shows that the marks on sorcerers are areas which have 
mortified' from the touch of the devil's finger.
     “About 1591, Leonarde Chastenet, an old woman of eighty, was taken up 
as a sorceress while begging in Poitou. Brought before Mathurin Bonnevault, 
who deponed to
having seen her at the meeting of witches, she confessed that she had been 
there with her husband, and that the devil, a very disgusting beast, was 
there in the form of a goat.  She denied that she would have carried out any 
witchcraft, but nineteen witnesses testified to her having caused the death 
of five labourers and a number of animals.
     “Finding her crimes discovered and herself condemned she confessed that 
she had made a compact with the devil, given him some of her hair, and 
promised to do all the harm she could.  She added that at night in prison 
the devil had appeared to her, in the form of a cat, to which she expressed 
the wish to die, whereupon this devil pre-sented her with two pieces of wax 
telling her to eat them and she would die, but she had been unwilling to do 
it. She had the pieces of wax with her, but on examination their composition 
could not be made out.  She was then condemned and the pieces of wax burnt 
with her."


Compass Brothers : Between the years 1400 arid 1790, there existed at Lubeck 
a guild of this name, which met twice a year. Their badge was a compass and 
sector suspended from a crowned letter  “C," over which was a radiated 
triangular plate. In 1485 they adopted chains composed of these emblems 
united by eagles' tails.  They appear to have been a magical or Kabbalistic 
society.


Conan Mae Morna : A figure in the Ossianic cycle of Irish legend, described 
as scoffing and deriding all that was high and noble.  One day while 
hunting, he and others of the Fians, entered a magnificent palace which they 
found empty and began to feast.  It soon became apparent, however, that the 
palace was enchanted, and the walls 'shrank to the size of a fox's hole. 
Conan seemed to be unaware of the danger and continued to eat; but two of 
the Fians pulled him off his chair, to which some of his skin stuck. To 
soothe the pain a black sheep-skin was placed on his back, on to which it 
grew, and he wore it till he died.


Conary Mor : A legendary High King of Ireland.  It is said that his great-
grandfather destroyed the Fairy Mound of Bri-Leith, and thus brought down 
ill-fate upon Conary Mor.  When a child he left his three foster-brothers on 
the Plains of Liffey, and followed a flock of beautiful birds down to the 
shore. These were transformed into armed men, who told him that they 
belonged to his father and were his kin.  His geise (or taboo) was made 
known to him. and later he was proclaimed King of Erin.  His reign was good, 
happy and prosperous, until the Danaan folk lured 'aim to the breaking of 
his geise.  It is told how Conary, dying of thirst after battle, sent his 
warrior Mac Cecht to bring him water. Mac Cecht had much difficulty in 
obtaining this, and on his return found that Conary had been beheaded : the 
water, however, was raised to the mouth of the bodyless head-which, it is 
said, thanked Mac Cecht for his deed.


Conferentes : Gods of the ancients, spoken of by Arnobe, whom Leloyes 
identifies with incubi.


Conjuretors : Magicians who claim to have the power to evoke demons and 
tempests


Conte Del Graal : One of the " Quest " versions of the legend of the Holy 
Grail (q,v.) compiled by various authors. It tells how Perceval was reared 
to the life of a forester by his mother; but forsaking her he becomes a 
member of the Court of King Arthur. Thence he goes forth as a knight - 
errant, and his numerous adventures are recited. During these, he meets with 
certain mysteries, but returns to the court. The adventures of Gauvain, 
another of the knights are fully detailed. Perceval, himself, sets forth 
again, and wanders about for five years in a very godless state of mind. One 
Good Friday he meets with a band of pilgrims, who remonstrate with him for 
riding armed on a holy day ; and he turns aside to confess to a hermit who 
turns out to be his uncle. From him he learns that only the sinless can find 
the Grail, and that he has sinned in abandoning his mother, and thus causing 
her death. In a continuation of the legend by a different author, Perceval 
appears to continue his search, but apparently unsuccessfully;  and finally, 
by yet another compiler we are told that Perceval after many adventures 
marries Blanchfleure.  The nature and origin of the Grail are described in 
these continuations of the legend.


Control : A spiritualistic term, denoting the spirit who controls the 
physical organisation of a medium.-(See Spiritualism.)


Convulsionaries of St. Medard : During the first half of the eighteenth 
century there occurred in the cemetery of St. Medard, Paris, an 
extraordinary outbreak of convulsions and religious extasy, whose victims 
were the Jansenists, at that time suffering much persecution at the hands of 
the government and the church. The outbreak commenced with a few isolated 
cases of miraculous healing.  One, Mlle. Morsaron, a paralytic, having for 
her confessor an enthusiastic Jansenist, was recommended by him to seek the 
tomb of St. Francis de Paris, in the cemetery of St. Medard. When she had 
repaired thither a few times she recovered her health. The news spread 
abroad, and other cures followed. Violent convulsions became a feature of 
the crisis which preceded these cures. At length the healing by Deacon Paris 
of a more than usually obstinate case, by a crisis of more than ordinary 
severity, was the signal for a violent outburst of epidemic frenzy.  People 
of both sexes and all ages repaired to the tomb of the holy deacon, where 
the most appalling scenes were witnessed. People from the provinces helped 
to swell the ranks, till there was not a vacant foot of ground in the 
neighbourhood of St. Medard. At length, on January 27th, 1732, the cemetery 
was closed by order of the king.  On its closed gate a wit inscribed the 
lines

De par le roi defense 
Dieu De faire miracle en ce lieu.

However the king's ordinance did not put an end to the epidemic, which 
spread from Paris to many other towns. Ten years after its commencement-in 
1741-it seemed to have died away, but in 1759 it burst out in Paris with 
renewed vigour, accompanied by scenes still more awful. In the following 
year it disappeared once more, though isolated examples persisted so late as 
1787.


Cook, Florence :   An English medium, the first to present the phenomenon of 
materialisation in its complete form. In the production of the crowning 
physical manifestation, she was associated at the Outset of her mediumistic 
career at the beginning of the decade 1870-80 - with the medium Herne, but 
ere long dispensed with his assistance.  So that she might not be under the 
necessity of taking fees for her services, a wealthy Manchester 
spiritualist, Mr. Charles Blackburn, paid her a sum of money annually. She 
was thus practically a private medium, and for the most part, her seances 
were held in her own home.  Her principal control was the now famous spirit 
Katie King. Mr.-now  Sir William - Crookes,  who  investigated the phenomena 
produced in Miss Cook's presence, declared his conviction that Katie and the 
medium were two separate entities, and was satisfied of the supernormal 
nature of the former. Not all the sitters, however, were equally convinced. 
Many persons traced a resemblance in form and feature between medium and 
control, and it has been suggested that the apparent differences were 
achieved by a change in the mode of hair-dressing, by tip-toeing, and other 
mechanical means.


Coral (red) : It stops bleeding, preserves houses from thunder, and children 
from evil spirits, goblins, and sorceresses. It also strengthens digestion, 
and If taken in powder as soon as the child is born, preserves it from 
epilepsy.


Corbenic : A magic castle of the Arthurian legend. in which it is said the 
Holy Grail was kept.  It was guarded by two lions.  Lancelot tries to enter 
it by his own strength, in-instead of leaning on his Creator, and as a 
result is struck dumb by a fiery wind.  In this state he remains for 
fourteen days without food or drink.


Cordovero : A famous Kabalist of the sixteenth century.


Cornwall : (See Sea Phantoms and Superstitions.)


Corpse Candles :  Mysterious lights supposed to presage death. They are also 
called fetch-lights and dead men's candles.


Coscinomancy : is practised with a sieve, and a pair of tongs or shears, 
which are supported upon the thumb nails of two persons, who look one upon 
the other, or the nails of the middle finger maybe used.  Potter, in his 
Greek Antiquities, says : " It was generally used to discover thieves, or 
others suspected of any crime, in this manner: they tied a thread to the 
sieve by which it was upheld, or else placed a pair of shears, which they 
held up by two fingers, then prayed to the gods to direct and assist them ; 
after that they repeated the names of the persons under suspicion, and he, 
at whose name the sieve whirled round or moved, was thought guilty."  In the 
Athenian Oracle it is called " the trick of the sieve and scissors, the 
coskiomancy of the ancients, as old as Theocritus," he having mentioned in 
his third idyll, a woman who was very skilful in it. Saunders, in his 
Chiromancy, and Agrippa, at the end of his works, gives certain mystic words 
to be pronounced before the sieve will turn.  It was used to discover love 
secrets as well as unknown persons.  According to Grose, a chapter in the 
Bible is to be read, and the appeal made to St. Peter or St. Paul.


Costume, Phantom : (See Phantom Dress.)


Counter Charms:  Charms employed to counteract the effect of other charms.  
When magicians wish to dis-enchant animals they sprinkle salt in a porringer 
with some blood from one of the bewitched creatures, and repeat certain 
formulae for nine days.


Counts of Hell : Demons of a superior order in the infernal hierarchy, who 
command numerous legions.  They may be evoked at all hours of the day. 
provided the evocation takes place in a wild, unfrequented spot.


Courier de l'Europe :  (See Cagliostro) 


Cox, Sergeant : (See Psychological Society).


Cramp-Rings, Hallowing  : A ceremony which took place in England on Good 
Friday.  It consisted of the repetition of certain psalms and prayers, 
during which the king rubbed the rings between his hands.  It was said that 
rings thus consecrated on Good Friday by the kings of England, had the power 
of curing cramp; and the rings, which were given away were much in request 
even by foreign ambassadors.


Critomancy : Divination by means of observing viands and cakes.  The paste 
of cakes which are' offered in sacrifice, is closely examined, and from the 
flour which is spread upon them, omens are drawn.


Crollius, Oswald : A disciple of the school of Paracelsus, and author of the 
Book of Signatures -the preface to which contains a good sketch of hermetic 
philosophy.  The writer seeks to demonstrate that God and Nature have, so to 
speak, signed all their works, that every product of a given natural force 
is as the sum of that force, printed in indelible characters, so that he who 
is initiated in the occult writings can read as in an open book the 
sympathies and antipathies of things, the properties of substances, and all 
other secrets of creation.  " The characters of different writings," says 
Eliphas Levi, " were borrowed primitively from these natural signatures 
existing in stars and flowers, in mountains and the smallest pebble; the 
figures of crystals. the marks on minerals, were impressions of the thought 
which the Creator had in their creation.
. . . .But we lack any grammar of this mysterious language of worlds, and a 
mathematical vocabulary of this primitive and absolute speech. King Solomon 
alone is credited with having accomplished the dual labour, but the books of 
Solomon are lost. The enterprise of Crollius was not the reconstitution of 
these, but an attempt to discover the fundamental principles obtaining in 
the universal language of the creative world. It was recog-nised in these 
principles that the original hieroglyphics, based on the prime elements of 
geometry, corresponded to the constitutive and essential laws of forms, 
determined by alternating or combined movements, which, in their turn, were 
determined by equilibratory attractions. Simples were distinguished from 
composites by their external figures; and by the correspondence between 
figures and numbers it became possible to make a mathematical classification 
of all substances revealed by the lines of their services. At the root of 
these endeavours, which are reminiscences of Edenic science, there is a 
whole world of discoveries awaiting the sciences. Paracelsus had defined 
them, Crollius indicates them, another, who shall follow, will realise and 
provide the demonstration concerning them. What seemed the folly of 
yesterday will be the genius of to-morrow, and progress will hail the 
sublime seekers who first looked into this lost and recovered world, this 
Atlantis of human knowledge."


Crosland, Mrs. Newton  An early spiritualistic medium.
Under the name of Camilla Toulmin, she published, in
1857, Light in the Valley, a record of her experiences.
There is a trend of Swedenborgian mysticism in her writings.
(See Spiritualism.)


Cross-Correspondences: Corespondences found in the script - of two or more 
automatic writers acting without collusion, and under such conditions that 
the possibility of  communicating by normal means is removed. Since the 
begin-ning of the present century efforts have been made by members of the 
Society for Psychical Research to prove, by the production of script 
containing cross-correspondence. the existence of discarnate intelligences, 
- and their ability to operate through the physical organism of a medium. 
The first instances were of a spontaneous character, and occurred in 'the 
trance -utterances of Mrs. Thompson and those of another medium, Miss 
Rawson. Thereafter the idea was conceived of deliberately cultivating them, 
and several ladies-Mrs. Verrall, Mrs. Holland, and others-who had been 
successful in producing automatic script, sent it to the Society for 
Psychical Research, where the writings were found to show more numerous 
correspond-ences than mere coincidence would warrant, It --was arranged that 
experiments should be made under stricter-test conditions. Frequently the 
script of Mrs. Verral was of an allusive and enigmatical character, so that 
she herself was unable to interpret it until the key had been supplied by 
the writings of a second automatist. Some-times three automatists succeeded 
in producing writings having a decided connection with each other, Two 
obscure -writings have been rendered intelligible by means of a third, 
perhaps in itself equally obscure. In at least one case correspondences 
occurred in the script of no less than six automatists, under somewhat 
curious circumstances. Mr. Piddington, a well known member of the Society 
for Psychical Research, had written a "test" letter, which he proposed 
should be opened after his death. The con-tents, which dealt emphatically 
with the 'number seven, he told to no one. On hearing, however, of the 
remarkable cross-correspondences- all dealing with the number seven-he 
opened his letter, four years after it was written, and supplied the clue. 
In 1906, Mrs. Piper was brought to this country so that the correspondences 
might be studied to better advantage. The experiments were successful to a 
surprising degree, and seemed to place beyond a doubt the operation in all 
the writings of an intelligence other than the automatist's. Mr. Podmore, 
however, would refer the phenomena of cross-correspondences, at least in 
part, to the operation of a complex form of tele-pathy-a possible, but in 
view of the facts, not very probable, explanation.


Crow : The cawing of a crow is an omen of evil. 

Crow's Head : (See Philosopher's Stone.)

Crystal: Crystal prevails against unpleasant dreams, dis-solves 
enchantments, and is a medium for magical visions. Being bruised with honey, 
it fills the breasts with milk. Leonardus appears to have indulged a little 
spite against this beautiful mineral. " The principal use of - crystal," he 
says, "is for making cups, rather than anything else that is good."


Crystalomancy, or Crystal Gazing : A mode of divination practised from very 
early times with the aid of a crystal globe, a pool of water, a mirror, or 
indeed any transparent object. Divinations by means' of-. water, ink, and 
such substances are also known by the name of hydromancy (q.v.). Crystal 
gazing may be a very simple or a very elaborate-performance, according to 
the period in which it was practised, but in every case the object is to 
induce in the clairvoyant a form of hypnosis, so that he may see visions in 
the crystal. The "crystal" most in favour among modern crystal gazers is a 
spherical or oval globe, about four inches in diameter, and preferably a 
genuine crystal; but as a crystal of - this size and shape is necessarily 
ex-pensive, a sphere of glass is frequently substituted, and with very good 
results. It must, however, be a perfect sphere of oval, free from speck or 
flaw, highly polished, and contained in a stand of polished ebony, ivory, or 
box-wood. Among the Hindus, a cup of treacle or -a pool of ink is made to 
serve the same purpose. Precious stones' were much used by crystallomancers 
in the past, the favour-ite stone being the beryl in pale sea green or 
reddish tints. By the ancients crystallomancy was practised with a view to 
the invocation of spirits, and very elaborate preparations and ceremonials 
were considered necessary. He who would practise invocations in this wise 
must, in the first instance, be a man of pure life and religious 
disposition. For the few days immediately preceding the inspection of the 
crystal, he must make frequent ablutions, and subject himself to strict 
religious discipline, with prayer and fasting. The crystal, as well as the 
stand on which it rests, must be inscribed with sacred characters, - as must 
also the floor of the room in which the invocation is to take place. A 
quiet, retired spot is suggested -for the purpose, where the magician may be 
free from all disturbance. Besides these matters of solitude and- 
cleanliness, there is the question of the mental  attitude to be considered, 
and this is no less important than the material preparations.  A perfect 
faith is an essential condition of success. If the magician would be 
accompanied by one or two of his friends, they also must conform to the same 
rules and be guided by the same principles. The time of the  invocation is 
chosen according to the position in the heavens  of the various planets, all 
preparations having been made during the increase of the moon. All the 
instruments and accessories used in the performance the sword, rod and 
compasses, the fire and the perfume to be burned thereon, as well as the 
crystal itself-are consecrated or "charged" prior to the actual ceremony. 
     During the process of invocation, the magician faces the east and 
summons from the crystal the spirit he desires. Magic circles have 
previously been inscribed on the floor,
and it is desirable that the crystallomancer remain within these for some 
little time after the spirit has been dismissed. It was essential that no 
part of the ceremonial be omitted, otherwise the invocation would be a 
failure. Paracelsus, however, and others declared that all such elaborate 
cere-monies were unnecessary, and that the magnes microcosmi, the magnetic 
principle in man, was in itself sufficient to achieve the desired object. At 
a later period, though the ceremonial was not abolished, it became decidedly 
less imposing. If the person on whose behalf the divination was to be 
performed was not himself gifted with the clairvo-yant faculty, he sought, 
for a suitable medium, the best for the purpose being a young boy or girl, 
born in wedlock, and perfectly pure and innocent. Prayers and magical words 
were pronounced prior to the ceremony, and in-cense and perfumes were 
burned. Sometimes the child's forehead was anointed, and he himself provided 
with gar-ments suitable to the impressive nature of the ceremony. Some 
writers mention a formula of prayers, known as the Call, which preceded the 
inspection of the crystal. Finally, the latter having been charged, it was 
handed over to the medium. The first indication of the clairvoyant vision 
was the appearance of a mist or cloud in the crystal. This gradually cleared 
away, and the vision made its appearance.
     Modern Crystal gazing is carried on in much the same manner, though the 
preparations are simpler. 'The crystal is spherical and of the size of an 
orange; when in use it may be held between the agent's finger and thumb, or, 
if the end be slightly flattened, placed on a table; alternatively it may be 
held in the palm of the hand against a background of black cloth. The 
operation may be more readily carried out in a subdued light. A medium or 
clairvoyant person acts as the seer and if the divination be made for anyone 
else it is advisable that he be allowed to hold the crystal in his hand for 
a few minutes before it is passed into the hands of the clairvoyant. The 
object of crystal gazing is, as has been said, the induction of an hypnotic 
state giving rise to visionary hallucinations, the reflection of light in 
the crystal forming points de repere for such hallucinations. The value of 
elaborate ceremonials and impressive rituals thus lies in their potency to 
affect the mind and imagination of the seer. So far, the mystery of crystal 
vision is no mystery at all. But the remarkable frequency with which, 
according to reliable witnesses, visions seen in the crystal have tallied 
with events hap-pening elsewhere at the same moment, or even with future 
events, is a fact for which science has not yet found an adequate 
explanation. It has been suggested that if telepathy operates with greater 
freedom during the hyp-notic state, so it may be also with the self-induced 
hypnosis of crystal gazing. And this, though it cannot be said to cover the 
entire ground, is perhaps, on the whole, the best explanation yet offered. 
There are many well-attested cases wherein the crystal has been successfully 
used for the purpose of tracing criminals, or recovering lost or stolen 
property. The telepathic theory, however, will hardly apply to these 
instances wherein events have been wit-nessed in the crystal before their 
actual occurrence. Such mysteries as these must be left to the art of the 
psychical researcher to' unravel.


Crucifixion, Gnostic Conception of : As soon as ,Christ was born according 
to the Gnostic speculative view of Christianity, Christos, united himself 
with Sophia (Holy Wisdom). descended through the seven planetary regions, 
assuming in each an analogous form to the region, and concealing his true 
nature from its genii, whilst he attracted into himself the spark of Divine 
Light they severally retained in their angelic essence. Thus Christos, 
having passed through the seven Angelic Regions before the "Throne," entered 
into the man Jesus, at the moment of his baptism In the Jordan. From that 
time forth, being super' naturally gifted, Jesus began to work miracles. 
Before that, he had been completely ignorant of his mission. When on the 
cross, Christos and Sophia left his body, and returned to their own sphere. 
Upon his death, the two took the man "Jesus," and abandoned his material 
body to the earth:
for the Gnostics held that the true Jesus did not (and could not) physically 
suffer on the cross, and die, and that Simon of Cyrene, who bore his cross, 
did in reality suffer in his room  And they compelled one, Simon a Cyrenian, 
who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, 
to bear his cross" (St. Mark XV. 21). The Gnostics contended that a, portion 
of the real history of the Crucifixion was never written. 
     At the resurrection Christos and Sophia gave the man Jesus another 
body, made up of ether (Rosicrucian Aetheroeum).  Thence-forward he 
consisted of the two first Rosicrucian principles only, soul and spirit: 
which was the reason that the disciples did not recognise 'him after the 
resurrection.  During his sojourn upon earth after he had risen, he received 
from Sophia, or Holy Wisdom, that perfect knowledge or illumination, that 
true "Gnosis," which he communicated to the small number of the Apostles who 
were capable of receiving the same.


Ciupipiltin : Vampires in ancient Mexico. (See Mexico and Central America.)


Cursed Bread : Used for purposes of divination, or ordeal by flour or bread. 
A piece of bread, about an ounce in weight, over which a spell had been 
cast, was administered to the suspected person. Should it cause sickness or 
choking the man was said to be guilty, but if he remained well he was 
regarded as innocent. Barley bread was often used for this form of 
divination, being more likely to cause choking. This method of trial was 
practised amongst
Anglo-Saxons. 


Curses : (See Spells.)


Cyamal : The head-chief of the Egbo Assembly, a secret council of Old 
Calabar.




D

Dactylomancy : A term covering various forms of divination practised with 
the aid of rings. One method resembles the table-rapping of modern 
spiritualism. A round table is inscribed with the letters of the alphabet, 
and a ring suspended above it. The ring, it is said, will indicate certain 
letters, which go to make up the message required. It was used, according to 
Ammianus Marcellinus, to find Valen's successor, and the name Theodosius was 
correctly indicated. Solemn services of a religious character ac-companied 
this mode of divination. Another form of dactylomancy, of which there is no 
detailed account, was practised with rings of gold, silver, copper, iron or 
lead, which were placed on the finger-nails in certain conjunc-tions of the 
planets. A wedding ring is, however,' most in favour for purposes of this 
sort. Another way is to suspend the ring within a glass tumbler, or just 
outside of it so, that the ring on being swung may easily touch the glass. 
As with table-rapping, a code may then be, arranged, the glass being struck 
once for an affirmative, twice for a negative answer, and so on. Suspended 
above a sovereign, the ring will indicate the person from whose head hair 
has been taken, or, if requested, any other member of the company.


Dactyls : A class of sorcerers and scientific physicians who had their 
origin in Phrygia. Their number is given differ-ently by different 
authorities. Some say it equals the number of fingers on the hands-five male 
and five female. Pausanias says five, Perecydes fifty-two, twenty right and 
thirty-two left; while Orpheus the Argonaut mentions a large number. The 
dactyls were magicians, exorcists, conjurors, soothsayers .,.Plutarch says 
that they made their appearance in Italy as sorcerers; while their magical 
practices and mysteries threw the inhabitants of- Samo-thrace into 
consternation. They were credited with the discovery of minerals and the 
notes of the musical scale; also with the discovery and use of the Ephesian 
mines They introduced fire into Crete, musical instruments into Greece. They 
were good runners and dancers, skilled in science and learning, and from 
them came the first wise men. They are said by some to have been the 
magnetic powers and spirits, whose head was Hercules.


Daemonologie : by King James VI. and I.: It is customary nowadays to sneer 
at the writings of this royal author, and as Horace Walpole remarks, his 
majesty really has more critics than readers; while it should be borne in 
mind that in his own day the king's books were greatly admired, winning the 
encomiums of Bacon, Jzaak Walton, and nu-merous equally eminent men of 
letters.  In general, how-ever, it was Besilicon -Doron which elicited their 
homage, and compared to this last the king's study of demonology is but a 
mediocre performance.  Published in 1597, it is couched "in forme of ane 
dialogue." the speakers being Philomathes and Epistemon; and the former, 
being very incredulous as regards all kinds of magic, asks Epistemon to 
enlighten him. Thereupon many famous acts of witch-craft are adduced, but, 
when Philomathes requests to be told precisely why the black art should be 
considered in-iquitous, his interterlocutor fails conspicuously to give a 
satis-factory answer.  He merely inveighs against the practice in question, 
and accordingly there is something distinctly trite in the subsequent pages, 
wherein Epistemon is represented as being converted to the other speaker's 
point of view, and declaring loudly that all sorcerers and the like "ought 
to be put to death according to the Law of God, the eivill and imperiall 
Law, and. municipall Law of all Christian Nations.'


Daiver-Logum : The dwelling place of the, daivers (q.v.) a species of Hindoo 
genii.. Besides the daivers, who number three hundred and thirty millions, 
there dwell in the Daiver--Logum those heroes and prophets who' are not yet 
fit for the paradise of Shiva or of Vishnu.


Daivers and Daivergoel : Hindoo genii inhabiting the Daiver--Logum, a world 
of their own.  They are, it seems, related to the Persian divs, from which 
it is suggested that the word  devil" is derived.  They possess material 
'bodies as well as spiritual, and have many human attributes, both good and 
evil. Their king is called Daivuntren, or Indiren, his wife jaderannee, and 
his son Seedcra-hudderen. The latter records the actions of human beings, by 
which they must at last be judged.  In Daivuntren's immense court of 
audience there is room not only for the daivers them-selves, but for a 
multitude of attendants, or companions These are the kuinarer, the musicians 
of Daiver-Logum Dumbarim, Nardir, tile drummers; Kimprusher winged beings of 
great beauty, who' wait on the brie's  Kunda gaindoorer, similar beings, the 
messengers of Vishnu Paunner, the jugglers ; Viddiaser, the bards  Tsettee 
those beings who attend them in their aerial flights. 
Kannanader, or Dordanks, the messengers who lead devotees of Shiva and 
Vishnu to paradise, and the wicked to hell. There is yet another class of 
daivergoel, or genii, which com-prises the eight keepers of the eight sides 
of the world, known by their general name of Aushtatiken-Pauligaur. These 
are Indiren, or Daivuntren, their king ; Augne--Bangauven, god of fire; 
Eemen, king of death and hell; Nerudee, the earth-element personified as a 
giant; Vaivoo, god of the air and winds; Varooner, god of the clouds and 
rain; Gooberen, god of riches; and Essaunien, . Shiva himself, in one of his 
1,008 incarnations.


Dalan : A druid who figures in the medieval Irish legend of Conary Mor 
(q.v.).


Dalton, Thomas : The history of this alchemist is veiled in obscurity, but 
he appears to have lived about the middle of the fifteenth century ; and, as 
he is mentioned in the Ordin all of Alchimy by Thomas Norton, it is likely 
that he was a pupil or at least a friend of the latter. Dalton was a 
churchman, resident at an abbey in Gloucester; and it is reported that, on 
one occasion, he was brought before the king, Edward IV., in whose presence 
he was charged with the surreptitious practice of magic, in those days a 
capital crime.  His accuser was one Debois, to whom the unfortunate 
alchemist had at one time been chaplain, and this Debois affirmed upon oath 
that he had seen the ac-cused create a thousand pounds of pure gold within 
the space of a single day. Thereupon Dalton reminded his accuser that he had 
sworn never to reveal this or any kin-dred facts. Debois acknowledged his 
perfidy herein, yet added that he was acting for the good of the 
commonwealth. The alchemist then addressed the king himself, telling him 
that he had been given the powder of projection by a cer-tain Canon of 
Litchfield, and that since then he had been in so' constant a state of 
trepidation that he had ultimately destroyed the precious  article.  Edward 
accordingly granted him his freedom, at the same time giving him money 
sufficient for his journey home; but on his way there he was seized by a 
certain Thomas Herbert, who had heard of the accusations brought against the 
churchman, and was naturally inquisitive.  Herbert carried his victim to the 
castle of Gloucester, and, incarcerating him in a cell there, tried every 
means to make him disclose the secret at issue.  All was in vain, however, 
and lit length Dalton was condemned to death by his persecutor, and brought 
out to be beheaded in the courtyard of the castle.  He placed his head on 
the block, and, crying out to' God to receive his soul, he called upon the 
executioner to strike speedily; but now a strange scene was enacted, for 
hardly was the axe raised ere Herbert sprang forward to avert it, at the 
same time declaring that he dared not shed inno-cent blood.  In short, the 
projected execution was no more than a dastardly ruse, the persecutor 
imagining that the alchemist would confess all when his life was at stake; 
and, as the plan had failed, Dalton was allowed to go free. So' he returned 
to' his abbey in Gloucestershire, and there he lived quietly and unmolested 
for the rest of his days.

Danaans, The : people of the goddess Dana, often men-tioned in Irish 
medieval romance. They were one of the three Nemedian families who survived 
the Fomorian vic-tory, and returned to Ireland at a later period.  By some 
it was said that they came" out of heaven," and by others that they sprang 
from four cities, in which they learned science and craftsmanship, and from 
each of which they brought away a magical treasure.  From Falias they 
brought the Stone of Destiny (Lia Fail) (q.v.) ; from Gorias an invincible 
sword; from Finias a magical spear; and from Murias the Cauldron of the 
Dagda. They were be-lieved to have been wafted to Ireland on li magic cloud, 
carrying their treasures with them.  After a victorious battle they took 
possession of the whole of Ireland, except Connacht which was given to the 
vanquished. The Daneans were the representatives of power and beauty, of 
science and poetry, to the writer of the myth ; to the common people they 
were gods of earth.  In their battles they were subject to death, but it was 
by magical powers that they conquered their mortal foes.

Davenport Brothers (Ian and William) : Two American mediums who gave seances 
for physical phenomena in America and Britain during the decade 1860-70. 
They seem to have attained to' a considerable measure of fame, and to have 
won a great many people to the belief that their performances were genuine 
spirit manifestations. On their coming to England in 1864 they were 
accompanied by a chaplain, the Rev. J. B. Ferguson, who helped to inspire 
confidence in their good faith. The usual plan of their seances was as 
follows  The Brothers Davenport took their seats vis-a-vis in a small walnut 
cabinet " made very like a wardrobe or clothes-press.   Any two' gentlemen 
from among the audience were requested to' bind them firmly to their 
benches, so' as to' preclude any possibility of their freeing their hands. 
Musical instruments were then placed in the cabinet, apparently out of reach 
of the medium, and the lights were lowered.  Soon the musical instruments 
began to play within the cabinet, dim " spirit hands" were seen in front of 
it.  At the conclusion of the seance, however, the mediums were found tied 
as securely as ever.  They met with a check, however, on their pro-vincial 
tour, for at Liverpool there were two' men among the audience who' possessed 
the secret of a special knot. The" Tom Fool's knot," as it was called, 
baffled the spirits, and the mediums were mobbed.  Later in a seance given 
before a committee of the Anthropological Society, they shirked nearly all 
the conditions, and succeeded in accom-plishing nothing which could not be 
done by a skilful con-jurer.  Tolmagne, Anderson, and other conjurers 
emulated their feats, and Maskelyne and Cooke so successfully that mediums 
had no resource but to class them as' “fellow-adepts."


Davey, S. T.  : A member of the Society for Psychical Re-search who' in i886 
gave imitations of the slate-writing performances of Eglinton and Slade, 
with a view to exposing their fraudulent methods.  By simple conjuring he 
suc-ceeded in emulating all their feats.  (See Slate-writing, Spiritualism.)


Davies, Lady : Eleanor Tuchet, daughter of George, Lord Audley, married Sir 
John Davies, an eminent lawyer in the time of James the First, and author of 
a poem of con-siderable merit On the Immortality of the Soul.  This lady was 
a person of many talents; but what she seems most to have valued herself 
upon, was her gift of prophecy; and she accordingly printed a book of 
Strange and Wonderful Predictions.  She professed to' receive her prophecies 
from a spirit, who communicated to her audibly things about to' come to' 
pass,. though the voice could be heard by no' other person.  Sir John Davies 
was nominated lord chief justice of the king's bench in 1626.  Before he was 
in-ducted into' the office, lady Eleanor, sitting with him on Sunday at 
dinner, suddenly burst into a passion of tears. Sir John asked her what made 
her weep.  To which she replied " These are your funeral tears."  Sir John 
turned off the prediction with a merry answer.  But in a very few days he 
was seized with an apoplexy, of which he pres-ently died.  She also 
predicted the death of the duke of Buckingham in the same year.  For this 
assumption of the gift of prophecy, she was cited before the high-corn-
mission-court and examined in 1634.


Davis, Andrew Jackson : Known as the " Poughkeepsie Seer" from his residence 
in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., was a prophet, clairvoyant, and mystic philosopher, 
who' commenced his mission to the world about 1844, some time before the 
Rochester Rappings had inaugurated the movement known as" modern 
spiritualism."  In 1847 he published a volume of trance discourses, The 
Principles of Nature, Her Divine Revelations, and A Voice to Mankind.  In 
the same year he issued the first number of the Univercaelum, a periodical 
devoted to clairvoyance and trance phenomena generally, which continued till 
1849.  Not until 1850, however, did Davis and his followers identify 
themselves with the spirit-ualists.  In his Revelations the Poughkeepsie 
Seer pro-pounds his Harmonial Philosophy, afterwards to be elab-orated in 
many volumes.  His mission, revealed to him by Galen and Swedenborg, was the 
prophesying of a new dispensation, preceded by a social revolution.  He was 
associated, throughout his career, with many prominent spiritualists.


Death-Coach : There is a widespread superstitious belief that death goes 
round in a coach picking up souls.  The form of the belief varies, of 
course, with the locality.  In some parts of England and Wales the death-
coach passes silently at midnight, without sound of hoof or wheels. Both 
coach and horse are black, and a black hound runs in front.  In some 
localities the horses and coachman are headless, which doubtless adds to' 
the effectiveness of the apparition.  The Breton peasant hears the approach 
at midnight of a cart with a creaking axle.  It is the Ankon death- and when 
the cart stops before a dwelling some-one within must die.


Death-watch : The ticking of the death-watch-a small in-sect found in 
decaying wood- is thought by the super-stitious to presage death.


Decem Viri :  (See Sibylline Books.)


Dectera : A figure of Irish medieval romance.  She was the daughter of 
Cathbad the Druid, and mother of Cuchu-lain (q.v.).  She and fifty other 
maidens disappeared from the court of Conor mac Nessa. Three years later, 
while pursuing a flock of birds which were spoiling the crops, the king and 
courtiers came upon a magnificent palace inhabited by a youth of noble mien 
and a beautiful woman and fifty maidens. These were recognised as Dectera 
and her companions. and the youth as Lugh, the sun-god. Conor summoned 
Dectera to him, but she sent him instead her new-born son, Cuchulain.


Dee, John : Born in London 1527, this remarkable mathe-matician and 
astrologer is supposed to have been descended from a noble old Welsh House, 
the Dees of Nant y Groes in Radnorshire; while he himself affirmed that 
among his direct ancestors was Roderick the Great, Prince of Wales.  Dee's 
father appears to' have been a gentleman server at the court of Henry VIII., 
and, being consequently in tolerably affluent circumstances, he was able to 
give his son a good education.  So at the age of fifteen John proceeded to' 
Cambridge, and after two' years there he took his degree as Bachelor of Arts  
while a little later on his becoming intensely interested in astronomy and 
the like, he decided to leave England and go' and study abroad. In 1547, 
accordingly, he went to the Low Countries, where he consorted with numerous 
scholars, and whence he even-tually brought home the first astronomer's 
staff of brass, and also two' gloves constructed by Gerard Mercetor; but Dee 
was not destined to remain in his native land for long, and in 1548 lie 
lived for some time at Louvain, and in 1550 he spent several months in 
Paris, lecturing there on the principles of geometry.  He was offered, 
indeed, a per-manent post at the Sorbonne; but he declined this, and in 1551 
he returned to England, where, having been recom-mended to Edward VI., he 
was granted the rectory of Upton-upon-Severn, Worcestershire.
     The astrologer was now in a delightful and enviable position, having a 
comfortable home and assured income, and being able to devote himself 
exclusively to the studies he loved.  But hardly had he begun to enjoy these 
bene-fits are an ugly cloud darkened his horizon, for, on the accession of 
Queen Mary in 1553, be was accused of try-ing to take the new sovereign's 
life by thaumaturgic means, and was imprisoned at Hampton Court.  He gained 
his liberty soon afterwards, but he felt very conscious that many people 
looked on him askance on account of his scientific predilections  and, in a 
preface which he wrote for an English translation of Euclid, he complains 
bitterly of being regarded as  a companion of the hehounds, a caller and a 
conjuror of wicked and damned spirits."  How-ever, during the reign of Queen 
Elizabeth his fortunes began tp improve again; and after making another long 
tour abroad, going on this occasion so far afield as St. Helena, he took a 
house at Mortlake on the Thames, and while staying there he rapidly became 
famous for his inti-mate knowledge of astronomy.  In 1572 on the advent of a 
new star, people flocked to hear Dee descant on the subject; while five 
years later, on the appearance of a mysterious comet, the scholar was again 
vouchsafed ample opportunity of displaying his learning, Elizabeth herself 
being among those who came to ask him what this addition to the stellar 
bodies might portend.
     The most romantic circumstances in Dee's life, however, are those which 
deal with his experiments in crystallomancy. Living in comparative solitude-
practising astrology for bread, but studying alchemy for pleasure brooding 
over Talmudic mysteries and Rosicrucian theories-immersed in constant 
contemplation of wonders which he longed to penetrate-and dazzled by visions 
of the elixir of life and the Philosopher's Stone, Dee soon attained to such 
a condition of mystic exaltation that his visions became to him as 
realities, and he persuaded himself that be was the favoured of the 
Invisible.  In his Diary he records that he first saw in his crystal-globe-
that is, saw spirits-on the 25th of May, 1581.  In another year he had at-
tained to' a higher level, and one day, in November, 1582, while on his 
knees and fervently praying, he became aware of a sudden glory which filled 
the west window of his lab-oratory, and in whose midst shone the bright 
angel Uriel. It was impossible for Dee to speak.  His tongue was frozen with 
awe.  But Uriel smiled benignly upon him, gave him a convex piece of 
crystal, and told him that when he wished to' communicate with the beings of 
another world he had but to' examine it intently, and they would imme-
diately appear and reveal the mysteries of the future. Then the angel 
vanished.
      Dee, however, found from experience that it was needful to' 
concentrate all one's faculties upon the crystal before the spirits would 
obey him.  In other words, it was neces-sary to' stimulate the imagination 
to' the highest pitch, until the soul became a willing agent in its self-
deception. Bring the will to' bear upon the imagination, and it is possible 
to' realize a spirit in every shadowy corner-to' hear the song of the 
spirits in the low crooning of the evening wind- to read in the starry 
heavens the omens and por-tents of the future.  One may become with 
marvellous ease the deceiver of one-self,-the dupe of one's own de-lusions,-
and brood upon a particular subject until one passes the mysterious border 
between sanity and madness passes from imagination into mania.
     Dee could never remember what the spirits said in their frequent 
conversations with him.  When the excitement was over, he forgot the fancies 
with which he had been beguiled.  He resolved, therefore, to discover some 
fellow-worker, or neophyte, who should converse with the spirits while he 
himself, in another part of the room, sat and re-corded the interesting 
dialogue.  He found the assistant he sought in one Edward Kelly, who 
unhappily possessed just the requisite boldness and cunning for making a 
dupe of the amiable and credulous enthusiast.
     Edward Kelly was a native of Lancashire, born, accord-ing to Dee's own 
statement, in 1555.  We know nothing of his early years, but after having 
been convicted at Lan-caster of coining-for which offence he lost his ears-
he removed to Worcester, and established himself as a druggist. Sensual, 
ambitious, and luxurious, he longed for wealth, and despairing of securing 
it by honest industry, began to' grope after the Philosopher's Stone, and to 
employ what magical secrets he picked up in imposing upon the ignorant and 
profligate. Dee sought knowledge for the love of it; Kelly as a means to 
gratify his earthly passions.  He con-cealed the loss of his ears by a black 
skull-cap, and being gifted with a good figure and tolerably handsome 
counte-nance, looked the very incarnation of mysterious wisdom, Before his 
acquaintance with Dee began, he had obtained some repute as a necromancer 
and alchymist, who could make the dead utter the secrets of the future.  One 
night he took a wealthy dupe with some of his servants, into' the park of 
Walton le Dale, near Preston in Lancashire, and there alarmed him with the 
most terrific incantations. He then inquired of one of the servants whose 
corpse had been last buried in the neighbouring churchyard, and being told 
that a poor man had been interred there within a very few hours, exhumed the 
body, and pretended to' draw from it oracular utterances.
     Dee appears to have had a shryer, or seer before his in-troduction to 
Kelly, who was named Barnabas Saul.  He records in his Diary On the 9th of 
October, 158i, that the unfortunate medium was strangely troubled by a 
spiritual creature" about midnight.  On the 2nd of December he willed his 
skryer to look into the  great crystalline globe" for the apparition of the 
holy angel Anael.  Saul looked and saw.  But his invention appears to have 
become ex-hausted by the following March, when he confessed that he neither 
saw nor heard any spiritual creature any more; whereat the enthusiastic Dee 
grew strangely dissatisfied, and soon dismissed the unsatisfactory and 
unimaginative medium. Then came Edward Kelly (who' appears to have been also 
called Talbot), and the conferences with the spirits rapidly increased in 
importance as well as curiosity.
     A clever rogue was Kelly.  Gifted with a fertile fancy and prolific 
invention, he never gazed into' the "great crystalline globe"  without  
making some wondrous discoveries, and by his pretended enthusiasm gained the 
entire confidence of the credulous Dee. The mathema-tician, despite his 
learning and his profound intellect, became the easy tool of the plastic, 
subtle Skryer. The latter would sometimes pretend that he doubted the inno-
cent character of the work upon which he was engaged; would affect a holy 
horror of the unholy; and profess that the spirits of the crystal were not 
always " spirits of health," but-perish the thought !-" goblins damn'd;" 
demons whose task it was to compass their destruction. The conferences held 
between Kelly and the spirits were meanwhile, carefully recorded by Dr. Dee; 
and whoever has stomach for the perusal of a great deal of absurdity and not 
a little blasphemy, may consult the folio published in 1659 by the learned 
Meric Casaubon, and entitled " A True and Faithful Relation of what passed 
between Dr. John Dee and some Spirits; tending, had it succeeded, to a 
General Alteration of most States and Kingdoms in the World."
     Two such shining lights could not hide themselves under a bushel, and 
their reputation extended from Mortlake even to the Continent.  Dee now 
declared himself possessed of the elixir vitae, which he had found he said, 
among the ruins of Glastonbury Abbey; so' that the curious were drawn to his 
house by a double attraction.  Gold flowed into' his coffers in an 
exhaustless stream, but his experiments in the transmutation of metals 
absorbed a great portion of his substance.
     At this time the court of England was visited by a Polish nobleman 
named Albert Laski, Count Palatine of Siradz, who was desirous to see the 
magnificence of the famous
“Gloriana.” Elizabeth received him with the flattering welcome she always 
accorded to distinguished strangers, and placed him in charge of the 
splendid Leicester.  He visited all the England of the sixteenth century 
worth showing, and especially her two' Universities, but was sorely 
disappointed at not finding the famous Dr. Dee at Oxford.   I would not have 
come hither," he said to the Earl,  had I wot that Dee was not here."  
Leicester un-dertook to' introduce him to the learned philosopher on their 
return to London, and so soothed his discontent.
     A few days afterwards the Pole and Leicester were wait-ing in the ante-
chamber at Whitehall for an audience of the Queen, when Dr. Dee arrived.  
Leicester embraced the opportunity, and introduced him to' Albert Laski. The 
interview between two' genial spirits was interesting, and led to' frequent 
visits from Laski to Dee's house at Mortlake.  Kelly soon perceived what a 
Pactolus this Pole would prove, and as he was imbued with all the ex-
travagant superstitions of the age relative to the elixir and the 
Philosopher's Stone, it was easy enough to play upon his imagination, and 
entangle him in the meshes of an inextricable deception.  Dee, in want of 
money to' prosecute his splendid chimeras, and influenced by Kelly's artful 
suggestions, lent himself in some measure to the fraud, and speedily the  
great crystalling globe" began to' reveal hints and predictions which 
inflamed the ardent fancy of the  noble Polonian."  But Kelly imposed upon 
Dee as well as upon Laski.  He appears to' have formed some wild but 
magnificent projects for the reconstruction of Europe, to' be effected 
through the agency of the Pole, and thenceforth the spirits could converse 
upon nothing but hazy politics.
     On a careful perusal of Dee's Diary, it is impossible to come to any 
other conclusion than that he was imposed upon by Kelly, and accepted his 
revelations as the actual utterances of the spirits ; and it seems probable 
that the clever, plastic, slippery Kelly not only knew something of the 
optical delusions then practised by the pretended necro-mancers, but 
possessed considerable ventriloquial powers, which largely assisted in his 
nefarious deceptions.
     Kelly had undoubtedly conceived some extravagant notions of a vast 
European monarchy, in which Laski was to' play the part of a Roi faineant 
and he himself of a Maire du Palais. To this point all the spiritual 
revelations now tended, and they were managed, it must be owned, with 
consummate skill.  Laski was proved, by the agency of Madinie, to be 
descended from the Anglo-Norman family of the Lacies.  Then an angel named 
Murifre, who' was clothed like a husbandman, pointed out Laski as destined 
to effect the regeneration of the world.
     But it did not answer Kelly's purposes to bring matters too' suddenly 
to a conclusion, and with the view of showing the extreme value of his 
services, he renewed his complaints upon the wickedness of dealing with 
spirits, and his fear of the perilous enterprises they might enjoin.  He 
threat-ened, moreover, to' abandon his task, a threat which com-pletely 
perturbed the equanimity of Dr. Dee.  Where indeed, could he hope to' meet 
with another skryer of such infinite ability ? Once when Kelly expressed his 
desire of riding from Mortlake to Islington on some pretended busi-ness, the 
doctor grew afraid that it was only an excuse to cover his absolute evasion.  
Whereupon," says the doctor, I asked him why he so hasted to ride thither, 
and I said if it were to ride to Mr. Harry Lee I would go thither, and to be 
acquainted with him, seeing now I had so good leisure, being eased of the 
book writing.  Then he said that one told him the other day that the duke 
(Laski) did but flatter him, and told him other things both against the duke 
and me.  I answered for the duke and myself, and also' said that if the 
forty pounds annuity which Mr. Lee did offer him was the chief cause of his 
mind setting that way (con-trary to many of his former promises to me), that 
then I would assure him of fifty pounds yearly, and would do' my best, by 
following of my suit, to' bring it to pass as soon as I possibly, could; and 
thereupon did make him promise upon the Bible.
     “Then Edward Kelly again upon the same Bible did swear unto' me 
constant friendship, and never to forsake me; and moreover said that unless 
this had so fallen about he would have gone beyond the seas, taking ship at 
New-castle within eight days next.
     “And so we plight Our faith each to the other, taking each other by the 
hand, upon these points of brotherly and friendly fidelity during life, 
which covenant I beseech God to turn to' his honour, glory, and service, and 
the com-fort of our brethren (his children) here on earth."
     Kelly now returned to his crystal and his visions, and Laski was soon 
persuaded that he was destined by the spirits to' achieve great victories 
over the Saracens, and win enduring glory.  But for this purpose it was 
needful he should return to Poland, and to' Poland the poor dupe went, 
taking with him the learned Dr. Dee, the invaluable Edward Kelly, and their 
wives and families. The spirits continued to' respond to' their inquiries 
even while at sea, and so' they landed at the Brill on the 3o'th of July 
1583, and traversed Holland and Friesland to the opulent free town of 
Lubeck.  There they lived sumptuously for a few weeks,. and with recruited 
strength set out for Poland. On Christmas Day they arrived at Stettin, where 
they remained till the middle of January 1584.  They gained Lasco, the 
Pole's principal estate, early in February. Im-mediately the grand work 
commenced for the transmu-tation of iron into' gold, boundless wealth being 
obviously needful for so grand an enterprise as the regeneration of Europe.  
Laski liberally supplied them with means, but the alchymists always failed 
on the very threshold of suc-cess.  Day by day the prince's trees melted 
away in the deceptive crucible; he mortgaged his estates, he sold them, but 
the hungry furnace continued to cry for" More! more "  It soon became 
apparent to' the philosopher's that Laski's fortune was nearly exhausted.  
Madinte, Uriel, and their comrades made the same discovery at the same time, 
and, moreover, began to doubt whether Laski, after all, was the great 
regenerator intended to' revolu-tionize Europe. The whole party lived at 
Cracow from March 1584 until the end of July, and made daily appeals to' the 
spirits in reference to the Polish prince.  They grew more and more 
discouraging in their replies, and as Laski began slowly to awake to the 
conviction that he had been a monstrous dupe, in order to rid himself of the 
burden, he proposed to furnish them with sufficient funds for a journey to 
Prague, and letters of introduction to the Em-peror Rudolph.  At this very 
moment the spirits discov-ered that it was necessary Dee should bear a 
divine message to the Emperor, and Laski's proposal was gladly accepted.
     At Prague the two philosophers were well received by the Emperor. They 
found him very willing to believe in the existence of the famous stone, very 
courteous to Dee as a man of European celebrity, but very suspicious of the 
astute and plausible Kelly. They remained some months at Prague, living upon 
the funds which Laski had supplied, and cherishing hopes of being attached 
to the imperial service.  At last the Papal Nuncio complained to' the 
countenance afforded to' heretical magicians, and the Emperor ordered them 
to quit his dominions within four-and-twenty  hours.  They precipitately 
complied, and by so doing escaped a prison or the stake, to' which the 
Nuncio had received orders from Rome to consign them (May 1586).
     They now proceeded to Erfurdt, and from thence to Cassel, but meeting 
with a cold reception, made their way once more to' Cracow.  Here they 
earned a scantv living by telling fortunes and casting nativities; enduring 
the pangs of penury with an almost heroic composure, for they, the pretended 
possessors of the Philosopher's Stone, durst not reveal their indigence to 
the world, if they would not expose themselves to universal ridicule.  After 
a while, they found a new dupe in Stephen, king of Poland, to whom Kelly's 
spirits predicted that the Emperor Rudolph would shortly be assassinated, 
and that the Germans would elect him to' the Imperial throne.  But he in his 
turn grew weary of the ceaseless demands for pecuniary supplies. Then arose 
a new disciple in the person of Count Rosenberg, a nobleman of large estates 
at Trebona, in Bohemia.  At his castle they remained for upwards of two 
years, eagerly pursuing their alchemical studies, but never approaching any 
nearer to' the desired result.
Dee's enthusiasm and credulity had degraded him into' the tool and slave of 
Kelly; but the latter was neverthe-less very wroth at the superior respect 
which Dee, as really a man of surprising scholarship and considerable 
ability, enjoyed.  Frequent quarrels broke out between them, aggravated by 
the criminal passion which Kelly had con-ceived for the doctor's young and 
handsome wife, and which he had determined to' gratify.  He matured at 
length an artful plan to obtain the fulfillment of his wishes. Knowing Dee's 
entire dependence upon him as a skyer, he suddenly announced his intention 
of resigning that honoured and honourable office, and only consented to' 
remain on the doctor's urgent entreaties.  That day (April j8, 1587) they 
consulted the spirits.  Kelly professed to be shocked at the revelation they 
made, and refused to' repeat it. Dee's curiosity was aroused, and he 
insisted upon hearing it, but was exceedingly discomposed when he found that 
the spirits enjoined the two' philosophers to' have their wives in common.  
Kelly expressed his own abhorrence of the doctrine, and when the spirits 
repeated it, with a mixture of socialistic extravagance to the effect that 
sin was only relative, and could not be sinful if ordered by God, protested 
they must be spirits of evil, not of good,-once more resigned his post as 
skryer,-and left the Castle.
     Dee now attempted to convert his son Arthur into a medium, but the lad 
had neither the invention, the faith, nor the deceptive powers for such an 
office, and the phil-osopher, deprived of those conferences with the other 
world which he had so long enjoyed, began to lament the absence of his old 
confederate.  At this juncture Kelly suddenly returned.  Again he consulted 
the crystal, and again was ordered to practise the socialistic role of all 
things in com-mon.  Dee was too delighted at his return to oppose any longer 
the will of the spirits.  The two' wives resisted the arrangement for some 
time, but finally yielded to what was represented to be the will of Heaven, 
and Dee notes in his Diary that  on Sunday the 3rd of May, anno 1587 (by the 
new account), I, John Dee, Edward Kelly, and our two' wives covenanted with 
God, and subscribed the same for indissoluble and inviolable unities, 
charity, and friendship keeping, between us four, and all things between us 
to be common, as God by sundry means willed us to do'."
     The alchymists now resumed their pursuits with eager-ness; but discord 
soon crept into this happy family of four. The wives, never very well 
content with the social-istic theory, quarrelled violently; the husbands 
began to' be pinched for want of means; and Dee turned his eyes towards 
England as a pleasanter asylum than the castle of Trebona was likely to 
prove for his old age.  He obtained permission from Queen Elizabeth to 
return, and separated finally from Kelly. The latter, who' had been knighted 
at Prague, took with him an elixir found at Glastonbury Abbey, and ventured 
to proceed to the Bohemian capital. He was immediately arrested by order of 
the Emperor, and flung into prison.  Obtaining his release after some 
months' imprisonment, he wandered over Germany, tell-ing fortunes, and 
angling for dupes with the customary magical baits, but never getting a whit 
nearer that enjoy-ment of boundless resources which the possession of the 
Philosopher's Stone should have ensured him.  Arrested a second time as a 
heretic and a sorcerer, and apprehending perpetual imprisonment, he 
endeavoured to escape, but fell from the dungeon-wall, and broke two of his 
ribs and both of his legs.  He expired of the injuries he had received in 
February 1593.
     Dr. Dee set out from Trebona with a splendid train, the expenses of his 
journey apparently being defrayed by the generous Bohemian noble.  Three 
waggons carried his baggage;  three coaches conveyed himself, his family, 
and servants.  A guard of twenty-four soldiers escorted him; each carriage 
was drawn by four horses.  In Eng-land he was well received by the Queen, as 
far as courteous phrases went, and settling himself at Mortlake, he re-sumed 
his chemical studies, and his pursuit of the Phil-osopher's Stone.  But 
nothing prospered with the un-fortunate enthusiast.  He employed two skryers 
at first a rogue, named Bartholomew, and afterwards a charlatan named 
Beckman-but neither could discover anything satisfactory in the  great 
crystalline globe."  He grew poorer and poorer; he sank into' absolute 
indigence; he wearied the Queen with ceaseless importunities; and at length 
obtained a small appointment as Chancellor of St. Paul's Cathedral, which in 
1595 he exchanged for the war-denship of Manchester College.  He performed 
the duties of this position until age and a failing intellect compelled him. 
to resign it about 1602 or 1603.
He then retired to' his old house at Mortlake, where he practised as a 
common fortune-teller, gaining little in return but the unenviable 
reputation of a wizard, "a con-juror, a caller, or invocator of devils."  On 
the 5th of June 1604, he presented a petition to' James the First, imploring 
his protection against such injurious calumnies, and de-claring that none of 
all the great number of  the very strange and frivolous fables or histories 
reported and told of him (as to have been of his doing) were true."
     Dee is an exceptionally interesting figure, and he must have been a man 
of rare intellectual activity.  He made calculations to' facilitate the 
adoption in England of the Gregorian calendar;  and he virtually anticipated 
the Historical Manuscripts Commission, addressing to the crown a petition 
wherein he wrote on the desirability of carefully preserving the old, 
unpublished records of Eng-land's past, many of which documents were at this 
period domiciled in the archives of monasteries.  Moreover he was a 
voluminous writer on science, and, though lack of space makes it impossible 
to' give a full list of his works here, it certainly behoves to' mention the 
following : Monas Hieroglyphica 1564, De Trigono 1565, Testamentum Jo-hannis 
Dee Philosophi Sumni ad Johannem Guryun Trans-missum 1568, An Account of the 
Manner in which a certayn Copper-smith in the Land of Moores, and a certayn 
Moore transmuted Copper to Gold, 1576.

Deleuze, Jean Philippe Francois : French naturalist and adept in animal 
magnetism.  He was born at Sisteron, in 1753, and died in 1835. It is by his 
advocacy of animal magnetism that he is principally remembered, and his 
works on this subject include  Histoire Critique da Mag-netisme, (1813-
1819);  Insruction Pratique sur le Mag-netisme Animale, (1819 and 1836); 
Deense du Magnetisme, (1819); Mimoire sur la Faculte de Prevision, (1836).  
He believed in rapport between patient and magnetiser, in diagnosis of 
disease by clairyovants, and other super-normal phenomena.  (See Hypnotism.)


Delirium : (See Visions.)


De Lisle : (circa. 1710). French Alchemist.  A considerable amount of matter 
concerning this French alchemist is contained in Langlet de Fresnoy's 
invaluable book, Histoire de la Philosophie Hermetique, while Figuier writes 
at some length on the subject ; but neither of these writers furnishes de 
Lisle's Christian name, and neither gives the exact date of his birth. The 
place where the event oc-curred is likewise unknown, although it is commonly 
held that the alchemist was a Provencal; while his position in the social 
hierarchy is likewise a matter of conjecture, the tradition that he sprang 
from humble peasant stock being practically vitiated by the particule in his 
name. True that this is usually spelt Delisle, but One may be fairly certain 
that that is a mere perversion, and that originally the two syllables were 
written separately.
     De Lisle is known to have been active during the first decade of the 
eighteenth century, so it may be assumed that he was born towards the close 
of le grand siecle ; while it would seem that, at an early age, he entered 
the service of a scientist whose name is unrecorded, but who' is sup-posed 
to' have been a pupil of Lascaris.  This nameless scientist, it appears, got 
into trouble of some sort, the likelihood being that he was persecuted on 
account of his hermetic predilections ; and accordingly he left Provence and 
set out for Switzerland, taking with him his young henchman, de Lisle.  En 
route the latter murdered his patron and employer, thereafter appropriating 
all his al-chemistic property, notably some precious transmuting powder; and 
then, about the year 1708, he returned to his native France, where he soon 
attracted attention by changing masses of lead and iron into' silver and 
gold. Noble and influential people now began to court his society and his 
scientific services, and betimes he found himself safely and comfortably 
housed in the castle of La Palud, where he received many visitors from day 
to day, demon-strating his skill before them.  Anon, however, he grew weary 
of this life ; and, having contracted a liaison with a Madame Alnys, he 
commenced wandering with her from place to' place, a son being eventually 
born to the pair.  At this time Madame Alnys' husband was still living, but 
that did not prevent de Lisle from continuing to elicit patronage and favour 
from the rich and great, and in 1710, at the Chateau de St. Auban, he 
performed a curious experiment in the presence of one St. Maurice, then 
president of the royal mint.  Going into the grounds of the chateau one 
evening, de Lisle showed St. Maurice a basket sunk in the ground, and bade 
him bring it into the salle-d-manger where it was duly opened, its contents 
transpiring to' be merely some earth of a blackish hue.  No' very precious 
material! thought St. Maurice, accustomed to' handling ingots and nuggets; 
but de Lisle, after distilling a yellow liquid from the earth, projected 
this on hot quicksilver, and speedily produced in fusion three ounces of 
gold, while subsequently he succeeded in concocting a tolerable quan-tity of 
silver.  Some of the gold was afterwards sent to Paris, where it was put 
through a refining process, and three medals were struck from it, one of 
which, bearing the inscription Aurum Arte Factum, was deposited in the 
cabinet of his most Christian majesty.  Thereupon de Lisle was invited to 
come to Paris himself, and visit the court; but he declined the offer, 
giving as his reason that the southern climate he chiefly lived in was 
necessary to' the success of his experiments, the preparations he worked 
with being purely vegetable. The probability is that, having been signally 
triumphant in duping his clientele so far, he felt the advisability of 
refraining from endeavours which might prove futile, and vitiate his 
reputation.
     We hear nothing of de Lisle later than 1760, 50 presum-ably he died 
about that time; but his son by Madame Alnys seems to have inherited some 
part of his father's predilections, together with a fair quota of his skill.  
Wan-dering for many years through Italy and Germany, he affected 
transmutations successfully before various petty nobles; while at Vienna he 
succeeded in bringing himself under the notice of the Duc de Richelieu, who' 
was acting then as French ambassador to the Viennese court, and Richelieu 
afterwards assured the Abbe Langlet that he not only saw the operation of 
gold-making performed, but did it himself by carrying out instructions given 
him by Alnys.  The latter gradually acquired great wealth, but, falling 
under suspicion, he was imprisoned for a space at Marseilles, whence he 
ultimately escaped to Brussels. Here he continued, not altogether 
unsuccessfully, to' en-gage in alchemy; while here too he became acquainted 
with Percell, the brother of Langlet du Fresnoy, to whom he is supposed to' 
have confided some valuable scientific secrets.  Eventually, however, the 
mysterious death of one Grefier, known to' have been working in Alnys' lab-
oratory, made the Brussels authorities suspicious about the latter's 
character, so he left the town stealthily, never to be heard of again.


Demonius : A stone so called from the supposed demoniacal rainbow that 
appears in it.


Demonocracy :  The government of demons; the immediate influence of evil 
spirits ; the religion of certain peoples of America, Africa, and Asia, who' 
worship devils.


Demonography : The history and description of demons and all that concerns 
them.  Authors who write upon this subject-such as Wierus, Delancre, 
Leloyer-are some-times called demonographers.


Demonology : That branch of magic which deals with male-volent spirits.  In 
religious science it has come to indicate knowledge regarding supernatural 
beings who are not deities.  But, it is in regard to' its magical 
significance only that it falls to be dealt with here.  The Greek term 
Daimon, originally indicated  genius or  spirit, but in England it has come 
to mean a being actively malevolent.  Ancient Demonology will be found dealt 
with in the articles Egypt, Semites, Genius and Devil-Worship, and savage 
demonology under the beads of the various countries and races where it had 
its origin. According to Michael Psellus, demons are divided into' six great 
bodies. First, the demons of fire.  Second, those of the air. Third, those 
of the earth.  The fourth inhabit the waters and rivers, and cause tempests 
and floods; the fifth are sub-terranean, who prepare earthquakes and excite 
volcanic eruptions. The sixth, are shadows, something of the nature of 
ghosts.  St. Augustine comprehends all demons under the last category.  This 
classification of Psellus is not unlike that system of the middle ages, 
which divided all spirits into those belonging to the four elements, fire, 
air, earth, and water, or salamanders, sylphs, undines, and gnomes.
     The medieval idea of demons was, of course, in a direct line from the 
ancient Christian and Gnostic supposition. The Gnostics, of early Christian 
times, in imitation of a classification of the different orders of spirits 
by Plato, had attempted a similar arrangement with respect to an hierarchy 
of angels, the gradation of which stood as fol-lows -The first and highest 
order was named seraphim, the second cherubim, the third was the order of 
thrones, the fourth of dominions, the fifth of virtues, the sixth of powers, 
the seventh of principalities, the eighth of archangels, the ninth, and 
lowest, of angels. This classification was, in a pointed manner, censured by 
the apostles, yet still, strange to say, it almost outlived the 
pneumatologists of the middle ages. These schoolmen, in reference to the 
account that Lucifer rebelled against heaven, and that Michael, the 
archangel, warred against him, long agitated the momentous question: " What 
orders of angels fell on this occasion ? " At length, it became the 
prevailing opinion that Lucifer was of the order of Seraphim.  It was also 
proved after infinite research, that Agares, Belial, and Barbatos, each of 
them deposed angels of great rank, had been of the order of virtues ; that 
Bileth, Focalor, and Phoenix, had been of the order of thrones; that Goap 
had been of the order of powers, and that Purson had been both of the order 
of virtues and of thrones; and Murmur, of thrones and of angels. The 
pretensions of many other noble devils were likewise canvassed, and, in 
equally satisfactory manner, determined.  Afterwards, it became an object of 
enquiry to learn: " How many fallen angels had been engaged in the contest? 
" This was a question of vital importance, which gave rise to the most 
laborious research, and to a variety of discordant opinions. It was next 
agitated: "Where the battle was fought-in the inferior heaven, in the 
highest region of the air, in the firmament, or in Paradise? " " How long it 
lasted ?-whether during one second, or moment of time (punctum temporis), 
two, three, or four seconds ? " These are queries of very difficult 
solution, but the notion which ultimately prevailed was, that the engagement 
was concluded in exactly three seconds from the date of its commencement; 
and that while Lucifer, with a number of his followers, fell into hell, the 
rest were left in the air to tempt man.  A still newer question rose out of 
all these investigations
Whether more angels fell with Lucifer, or remain in heaven with Michael ? " 
Learned clerks, however, were inclined to think that the rebel chief bad 
been beaten by a superior force, and that, consequently, devils of darkness 
were fewer in number than angels of light.
     These discussions which, during the number of successive centuries 
interested the whole of Christendom, too fre-quently exercised the talents 
of the most erudite persons in Europe. The last object of demonologists was 
to collect, in some degree of order, Lucifer's routed forces, and to 
reorganise them under a decided form of subordina-tion or government.  
Hence, extensive districts were given to certain chiefs who fought under 
this general. There was Zimimar, "the lordly monarch of the north," as 
Shakespeare styles him, who had his distinct provinqe of devils; there was 
Gorson, the King of the South Amaymon, the King of the East; and Goap, the 
Prince of the West.  These sovereigns had many noble spirits subordinate to 
them, whose various ranks were settled with all the preciseness of heraldic 
distinction ; there were Devil Dukes, Devil Marquises, Devil Counts, Devil 
Earls, Devil Knights, Devil Presidents, and Devil Prelates. The armed force 
under Lucifer seems to have comprised nearly twenty-four hundred legions, of 
which each demon of rank commanded a certain number. Thus, Beleth, whom 
Scott bas described as "a great king and terrible, riding on a pale horse, 
before whom go trumpets and all melodious music," commanded eighty-five 
legions; Agares, the first duke under the power of the East, commanded 
thirty-one legions; Leraje, a great marquis. thirty legions  Morax, a great 
earl and a president, thirty-six legions; Furcas, a knight, twenty legions; 
and, after the same manner, the forces of the other devil chieftains were 
enumerated.
     Such were the notions once entertained regarding the history, nature, 
and ranks of devils.  Our next object will be to show that, with respect to 
their strange and hideous forms the apparitions connected with the popular 
belief on this subject, were derived from the descriptive writings of such 
demonologists, as either maintained that demons possessed a decided 
corporeal form, and were mortal, or that, like Milton's spirits, they could 
assume any sex, and take any shape they chose.
     When, in the middle ages, conjuration was regularly practised in 
Europe, devils of rank were supposed to appear under decided forms, by which 
they were as well recognised as the head of any ancient family would he by 
his crest and armorial bearings.  Along with their names and characters were 
registered such shapes as they were accustomed to adopt.  A devil would 
appear, either like an angel seated in a fiery chariot, or riding on an 
infernal dragon, and carrying in his right hand a viper; or assum-ing a 
lion's head, a goose's feet, and a hare's tail; or putting on a raven's 
head, and mounted on a strong wolf.  Other forms made use of by demons were 
those of a fierce warrior, or of an old man riding upon a crocodile with a 
hawk in his hand. A human figure would arise having the wings of a griffin; 
or sporting three heads, two of them being like those of a toad and of a 
cat; or defended with huge teeth and horns, and armed with a sword; or 
displaying a dog's teeth and a large raven's head; or mounted upon a pale 
horse, and exhibiting a serpent's tail; or gloriously crowned, and riding 
upon a dromedary; or presenting the face of a lion; or bestriding a bear, 
and grasping a viper. There are also such shapes as those of an archer, or 
of a Zenophilus. A demoniacal king would ride upon a pale horse; or would 
assume a leopard's face and griffin's wings; or put on the three heads of a 
bull, of a man, and a ram, with a serpent's tail, and the feet of a goose; 
and, in this attire, bestride a dragon, and bear in his hand a lance and a 
flag; or, instead of being thus employed, goad the flanks of a furious hear, 
and carry in his fist a hawk. Other forms were those of a goodly knight; or' 
of one who bore lance, ensigns, and even a sceptre; or of a soldier, either 
riding on a black horse, and surrounded by a flame of fire, or wearing on 
has head a duke's crown, and mounted on a crocodile or assuming a lion's 
face, and, with fiery eyes, spurring on a gigantic charger; or, with the 
same frightful aspect, appearing in all the pomp of family distinction, on a 
pale horse; or clad from head to foot in crimson raiment, wearing on his 
bold front a crown, and sallying along on a red steed.  Some infernal duke 
would appear in his proper character, quietly seated on a griffin; another 
spirit of a similar rank would display the three heads of a serpent, a man, 
and a cat; he would also bestride a viper, and carry in his hand a 
firebrand. Another of the same type would appear like a duchess, encircled 
with a fiery zone, and mounted on a camel; a fourth, would wear the aspect 
of a boy, and amuse himself on the back of a two-headed dragon.  A few 
spirits, however, would be content with the simple garbs of a horse, a 
leopard, a lion, an unicorn, a night raven, a stork, a peacock, or a 
dromedary, the latter animal speaking fluently the Egyptian language.  
Others would assume the more complex forms of a lion or of a dog, with a 
griffin's wings attached to each of their shoulders, or of a bull equally 
well gifted; or of the same animal, distinguished by the singular feature of 
a man's face; or of a crow clothed with human flesh; or of a hart with a 
fiery tail. To certain other noble devils were assigned such shapes as those 
of a dragon with three heads, one of these being human; of a wolf with a 
serpent's tail, breath-ing forth flames of fire; of a she-wolf exhibiting 
the same caudal appendage together with griffin's wings, and ejecting from 
her mouth hideous matter.  A lion would appear, either with the head Of a 
branded thief, or astride upon a black horse, and playing with a viper, or 
adorned with the tail of a snake, and grasping in his paws two' hissing 
serpents.
     These were the varied shapes assumed by devils of rank. “It would, 
therefore," says Hibbert, "betray too' much of the aristocratical spirit to' 
omit noticing the forms which the lower orders of such beings displayed.  in 
an ancient Latin poem, describing the lamentable vision of a devoted hermit, 
and supposed to' have been written by St. Bernard in the year 1238, those 
spirits, who' had no more important business upon earth than to' carry away 
condemned souls, were described as blacker than pitch; as having teeth like 
lions, nails on their fingers like those of a wild-boar, on their fore-head 
horns, through the extremities of which poison was emitted, having wide ears 
flowing with cor-ruption, and discharging serpents from their nostrils. The 
devout writer of these verses has even accompanied them from. drawings, in 
which the addition of the cloven feet is not omitted.  But this appendage, 
as Sir Thomas Brown has learnedly proved, is a mistake, which has arisen 
from the devil frequently appearing to the Jews in the shape Of a rough and 
hairy goat, this animal being the emblem of sin-offering."
     It is worthy of further remark, that the form of the demons described 
by St. Bernard differs little from that which is no' less carefully 
portrayed by Reginald Scot, three hundred and fifty years later, and, 
perhaps, by the demonologists of the present day.  " In our childhood," says 
he, ' our mother's maids have so' terrified us with an ouglie divell having 
horns on his head, fier in his mouth, and a tail on his breech, eies like a 
bason, fangs like a dog, clawes like a beare, a skin like a niger, and a 
voice like a roaring lion-whereby we start and are afraid when we hear one 
cry bough."
     Wit the view of illustrating other accounts of appari-tions, we must 
advert to' the doctrines of demonology which were once taught.  Although the 
leading tenets of this occult science may be traced to the Jews and early 
Christ-ians, yet they were matured by our early communication with the Moors 
of Spain, who' were the chief philosophers of the dark ages, and between 
whom and the natives of France and  Italy much  communication  subsisted.  
Toledo', Seville, and Salamanca, became the great schools of magic. At the 
latter city, prelections on the black art were, from a consistent regard to' 
the solemnity of the subject, delivered within the walls of a vast and 
gloomy cavern. The schoolmen taught that all knowledge and power might be 
obtained from the assistance of the fallen angels.  They were skilled in the 
abstract sciences, in the knowledge of precious stones, in alchemy, in the 
various languages of mankind and of the lower animals, in the belles 
lettres, in moral philosophy, pneumatology, divinity, magic. history, and 
prophecy.  They could control the winds, the waters, and the influence of 
the stars ; they could raise earth-quakes, induce diseases, or cure them, 
accomplish all vaster mechanical undertakings, and release souls out of 
purgatory. They could influence the passions of the mind, procure the 
reconcilation of friends or foes, engender mutual discords, induce mania and 
melancholy, or direct the force and objects of the sexual affections.  
According to Wierus, demons are divided into a great many classes, and into' 
regular kingdoms and principalities, nobles and com-moners.  Satan is by no 
means the great sovereign of this monarchy, but his place is taken by 
Beelzebub.  Satan is
alluded to' by Wierus as a dethroned monarch, and Chief of the Opposition; 
Moloch, Chief of the Army; and Pluto', Prince of Fire; and Leonard, Grand 
Master of the Sphere. The masters of these infernal courts are, Adramelech, 
Grand Chancellor;  Astaroth, Grand Treasurer;  and Nergal, Chief of the 
Secret Police; and Baal, Chief of the Satanic Army.  According to' this 
authority, each state in Europe has also its infernal ambassadors.  
Belphegor is thus accredited to France, Mammon to' England, Belial to 
Turkey, Rimmon to Russia, Thamuz to Spain, Hutjin to Italy, and Martinet to 
Switzerland. Berbignier, writing in 1821, has given a sketch of the Infernal 
Court.  He says:
     “This court has representatives on earth.  These manda-tories are 
innumerable.  I give nomenclature and degree of power of each: Moreau, 
magician and sorcerer of Paris, represents Beelzebub ;  Pinel, a doctor of 
Salpetriere, represents Satan ; Bouge, represents Pluto'; Nicholas, a doctor 
of Avigum, represents Moloch; and so on.   Al-together," says Wierus, " 
there are in the infernal regions 6666 legions, each composed of the same 
number of devils."


Demonology and Witchcraft by Sir Walter Scott : This work occupies a curious 
and pathetic place in Sir Walter Scott's vast literary output.  Four years 
subsequent to his finan-cial debacle, in 1826, the author sustained a mild 
apoplec-tic shock, and it was shortly after this that John Murray, who' was 
then issuing a series known as " The Family Library," asked Sir Walter to 
contribute thereto a volume on demonology.  Consent was given readily, but, 
as an entry in Scott's journal makes manifest, he did not care greatly for 
the work, and really engaged in it just because he was still in the throes 
of writing off his debts, and had to accept every commission which was 
offered him.  In short, the book was begun from a purely commercial motive, 
and was composed when the writer's mental faculties were perforce sluggish, 
the natural result being that it is infinitely inferior to his other 
writings.  But despite its inferiority herein, Sir Walter's volume has its 
interest for students of occultism.  The writer is lame enough in what might 
be called the speculative parts of his book-those pages, for instance, in 
which he tries labor-iously to account for the prevalence in the middle-ages 
of belief in witchcraft and the like but his wonderful and well-stored 
memory stood him in good stead when writing those passages concerned purely 
with facts, and thus there is considerable value in his account of 
demonology in France and in Sweden, and in all that he says about Joan of 
Arc. Moreover, his intimate knowledge of early Scottish Litera-ture gives a 
singular importance to all those of his chapters which are concerned with 
his native land, while it is interest mg to find that here and there, he 
offers something of & sidelight on his own immortal novels, as for example, 
when he treats of those spectres which he had dealt with prev-iously in 
Woodstock.


Demonomancy :	Divination by means of demons.  This. divination takes place 
by the oracles they make, or by the answers they give to' those who' evoke 
them.


Demonomania : The mania of those who' believe all that is told concerning 
demons and sorcerers, such as Bodin,. Delancre, Leloyer, and others.  
Bodin's work is entitled Demonomania of the Sorcerers, but in this case it 
signifies devilry.


De Morgan, Mrs. : The author of a mystico-spiritual work entitled From 
Matter to Spirit, published in 1863. Mrs. de Morgan, whose interest in 
spiritualism was awakened at the seances of Mrs. Hayden, was the wife of 
Professor de Morgan, who' himself offered emphatic testimony to' the 
genuineness of Mrs. Hayden's mediumship.


Deoca, or The Woman of the South : A Princess of Munster, who' is mentioned 
in Irish medieval legend.  It is said that she was betrothed to Lairgnan, 
and asked of him as a marriage gift the children of Lir, who' had been 
magically changed by their stepmother into' four wonderful singing swans. 
The hermit who' looked after them refused to give them to Lairgnan, who' 
then seized them.  When brought into the presence of Deoca they were 
transformed into' their human form-withered, white-haired, miserable beings.  
The hermit baptised them before they died, and sorrowed for them so much 
that he himself was laid in their grave.


Dermot of the Love-spot : Thc typical lover of Irish legend, and the hero of 
the myth of Dermot and Grania.  It was in this wise that he got the love-
spot.  One night he and three companions entered a hut for a night's 
shelter, in which dwelt an old man, a young girl (Youth), a wether (the 
World) and a cat (Death).  During the night the girl put the love-spot on 
Dermot's forehead, and hence-forth, it is said, no woman could see him 
without loving him.  He came to be loved by Grania, the betrothed of Finn, 
who' forced him to run away with her.  They were pursued all over Ireland, 
but after sixteen years of out-lawry, Dermot was allowed to return to' his 
patrimony.  He was killed by the Boar of Ben, Bulben, (q.v.) an enchanted 
animal, who had been his step-brother.  His body was borne away on a gilded 
bier by the People of Dana, and was given a soul by Angus Og, the Irish God 
of Love, that he might return each day and talk with him. Dermot was of the 
type of solar hero'; and the bier on which his body was borne away is, of 
course, the sunset.


Dervishes : A sect of Mohammedan priests. In some cases they exercise a 
semi-esoteric doctrine. Their various paths" or systems are of great 
antiquity, and probably are derived from the ancient rites of Persia and 
Egypt, bearing also' a strong resemblance to Magism. Taking the Bektash as 
typical of all, we find that in the fifteenth century Bektash of Bokhara 
received his mantle from Ahmed Yesevee, who' claimed descent from the 
father--in-law of Mohammed.  He established a "path," con-sisting nominally 
of seven degrees, only four of which, however, are essential. These aim at 
the establishment of an affinity between the aspirant and the Sheik, from 
whom he is led through the spirit of the founder, and that of the Prophet to 
Allah. The initiatory ceremony provides a severe test.  The aspirant is 
tried for a year with false secrets, and his time of probation having 
expired, a lamb is slain, from the carcass of which a cord is made for his 
neck and a girdle of initiation for his loins.  Two' armed attendants then 
lead him into' a square chamber, where he is presented to' the Sheik as " a 
slave who' desires to' know truth."  He is then placed before a stone altar, 
on which are twelve escallops.  The Sheik, who' is at-tended by eleven 
others, grips the hand of the aspirant in a peculiar way, and administers 
the oath of the Order, in which the neophyte promises to be poor, chaste and 
obedient.  He is then informed that the penalty of be-traying the Order is 
death.  He then says:  "Mohammed is my guide, Ah is my director," and is 
asked by the Sheik, Do you accept me as your guide? "  The reply being made 
in the affirmative, the Sheik says: " Then I accept you as my son."  He is 
then invested with a girdle on which are three knots, and receives an 
alabaster stone as a token.  The sign of recognition is the same as that in 
the first degree of masonry. Amongst their important symbols are the double 
triangles and two triangles joined at the apex.  One of their maxims is that 
' the man must die that the saint must be born."  As a jewel they make use 
Of a small marble cube with red spots, to typify the blood of the martyred 
Ah. These dervish sects are by no' means popular with the orthodox 
Mussulmans, as they devote themselves entirely to' the well-being of their 
order rather than to Mohammedanism.
A notable exercise indulged in by several Dervish sects, is that of gyration 
in circles for extended periods of time, or prolonged dancing. The object of 
this is obscure, some authorities contending that it is engaged in to bring 
about a condition of ecstasy, whilst others see in it a planetary or 
astronomic significance.


D'Eslon : (See Hypnotism.)


Desmond, Gerald : sixteenth earl of Desmond, who was killed in 1583, had 
some repute as a magician, and was known as the " Great Earl."  Many curious 
stories are current concerning him.  He dwelt in his castle on a small 
island in Lough Gur, and there, in time, he brought his young bride, to' 
whom he was so' passionately attached that he could deny her nothing.  
Seeking him One day in the chamber where he worked his magic spells, she 
demanded to' know the secret of the Black Cat.  In vain he told her of the 
terrible things she must witness; she would not be dissuaded.  So he warned 
her solemnly that if she uttered a word the castle would sink to' the bottom 
of Lough Gur, and set to work.  Terrible indeed were the sights she beheld, 
but she stood firm and uttered neither word nor cry, until her husband lay 
down on the floor and stretched till he reached almost from end to' end of 
the room.  Then she uttered a wild shriek, and the castle sank instantly to 
the bottom of Lough Gur, where it still remains.  Once in every seven yea's 
Desmond, mounted on a white horse; rises from the water and rides round the 
Lough.  His horse is shod with silver shoes, and when these wear out the 
spell will be broken, Desmond will return, and his vast estates shall once 
more be restored to' him.

D'Espagnet, Jean :  A Hermetic philosopher who' left two' treatises 
Enchiridion Physicae Restitutae and Arcanum Philosophiae Hernilacae which 
have also' been claimed as the works of one calling himself the " Chevalier 
Im-perial."  " The Secret of Hermetic Philosophy" em-braces the practical 
side of the Magnum Opus and the Enchiridion treats of the physical 
possibility of trans-mutation. D'Espagnet also wrote the preface to' the 
Tableau de 1' Inconstance des Demons by Pierre Delancre. The "Arcanum" is 
better known as the " Canons of Es-pagnet" and has been claimed as a 
treatise on mystical Alchemy.  The Author states, however, that ' the 
science of producing Nature's grand Secret is a perfect knowledge of nature 
universally and of Art, concerning the realm of Metals; the practice whereof 
is conversant in finding the principles of Mietals by analysis."
     The authorities cited by Espagnet are those who' like Trevisan are 
known to have devoted their lives to practical Alchemy.  Nevertheless, it 
may be granted 
   that while much of the matter treats 6f a physical object it may be 
extended to' the psychic side of Hermetic Art.


"Deuce Take You" : A vulgar saying which had its origin in antiquity. The 
deuce is practically synonymous with the devil, the word being derived from 
Dusins, the ancient name given by the Gauls to a sort of demon or devil.


Devas : In Theosophy, constitute one of the rank's or orders of spirits who' 
compose the hierarchy which rules the uni-verse under the Deity.  Their 
numbers are vast and their functions are not all known to mankind, though 
generally these functions may be said to' be connected with the evo-lution 
of systems and of life.  Of Devas there are three kinds-Bodiless Devas, Form 
Devas and Passion Devas. Bodiless Devas belong to the higher mental world, 
their bodies are composed of mental Elemental Essence, and they belong to' 
the first Elemental kingdom.  Form Devas belong to the lower mental world, 
and while their bodies are composed also of mental Elemental Essence they 
belong to the second Elemental kingdom.  Passion Devas belong to' the astral 
world and their bodies are composed of astral Elemental Essence.  Devas are 
creatures super-latively great and superlatively glorious, of vast knowledge 
and power, calm yet irresistible, and in appearance alto-gether magnificent.


Devil : A name derived from the Greek Diabolos, "slanderer." The name for 
the supreme spirit of evil, the enemy of God and man.  In primitive 
religious systems there is no con-ception of evil, and the gods are neither 
good nor bad, as we conceive these terms, but may possess " good" and "bad" 
attributes at one and the same time.  Thus we have very few traces of beings 
which are absolutely evil in the older religions, and it may be broadly 
stated that the conception of Satan as we have it to-day is almost purely 
Hebrew and Christian.  In Egypt and Babylon, figures like Apepi and Tiawath, 
although clearly in the line of evolution of a Satanic personality, are by 
no means rulers of the infernal regions.  Again the Hades of the Greeks is 
merely a ruler of the shades of the dead, and not an enemy of Olympus or 
mankind.  It is strange that in Mexico, Mictlantecutli, lord of hell, is a 
much more directly Satanic figure than any European or Asiatic ruler of the 
realms of the dead.  But in some mythologies, there are frequent allusions 
to monsters who may quite easily have coloured our conception of Satan.  
Such is the Hindu serpent Ahi, and the Hebrew Leviathan, the prin-ciple of 
Chaos.  In the Teutonic mythology we have the menacing shape of Loki, 
originally a god of fire, but after-wards the personification of evil.  The 
conception of Satan, too, appears to have some deeply-rooted connection with 
the ancient serpent-worship, which seems to have penetrated most oriental 
countries.  Thus we find the Tempter in the Old Testament in the guise of a 
serpent. The serpent or dragon is being generally regarded as the 
personification of night who swallows the sun and enve-lopes the world in 
darkness.
     The Hebrew conception of Satan it is thought, arose in the post-exilic 
period, and exhibits traces of Babylonian or Assyrian influence.  It is not 
likely that before the captivity any specific doctrine respecting evil 
spirits was held by the Hebrews.  Writing on this subject, Mr. F. T. Hall in 
his book The Pedigree of the Devil says
     "The term 'Satan' and 'Satans' which occur in the Old Testament, are 
certainly not applicable to the modern conception of Satan as a spirit of 
evil; although it is not difficult to detect in the Old Hebrew mind a 
fruitful soil, in which the idea, afterwards evolved, would readily take 
root.  The original idea of a ' Satan' is that of an 'adver-sary,' or agent 
of ' opposition.'  The angel which is said to have withstood Balaam is in 
the same breath spoken of as 'The angel of the Lord,' and a 'Satan.'  When 
the Philistines under Achish their king were about to commence hostilities 
against the Israelites under Saul and David and his men were about to march 
with the Philistines; the latter objected, lest, in the day of battle, David 
should become a  Satan' to them, by deserting to the enemy. When David, in 
later life, was returning to Jerusalem, after Absalom's rebellion and death; 
and his lately disaffected subjects were) in turn, making their submission; 
amongst them came the truculent Shimei: Abishai, David's nephew, one of the 
fierce sons of Zeruiah, advised that Shimei should be put to death: this 
grated upon David's feelings, at a time when he was filled with exuberant 
joy at his own restoration; and he rebuked Abishai as a ' Satan.'  Again 
Satan is said to have provoked David to number Israel, and at the same time, 
that 'the Lord moved David to number Israel; ' a course strenuously opposed 
by Joab, another of the sons of Zeruiah.  Solomon in his message to Hiram, 
king of Tyre, congratulated himself on having no ' Satans' and that this 
peaceful immunity from dis-cord enabled him to build the Temple, which had 
been forbidden to his warlike father, David. This immunity was, not, 
however, lasting; for Hadad, the Edomite, and Regon, of Zobah, became ' 
Satans' to Solomon, after his profuse luxury had opened the way for 
corruption and disaffection.  In all these cases, the idea is simply 
identical with the plain meaning of the word: a Satan is an opponent, an 
adversary.  In the elaborate curse embodied in the 109th Psalm, the writer 
speaks of his enemies as his' Satans' and prays that the object of his 
anathema may have' Satan' standing at his right hand. The Psalmist himself, 
in the sequel, fairly assumes the office of his enemy's ' Satan,' by 
enumerating his crimes and failings, and exposing them in their worst light.  
In the 71st Psalm, enemies (v., lo) are identified with' Satans' or 
adversaries (v.13).
     “The only other places in the Old Testament where the word occurs, are 
in the Book of Job, and the prophecy of Zechariah.  In the Book of Job, 
Satan appears with a distinct personality, and is associated with the sons 
of God, and in attendance with them before the throne of Jehovah.  He is the 
cynical critic of Job's actions, and in that character he accuses him of 
insincerity and instabi-lity; and receives permission from Jehovah to test 
the justice of this accusation, by afflicting Job in everything he holds 
dear.  We have here the spy, the informer, the public prosecutor, the 
executioner; all embodied in Satan, the adversary: these attributes are not 
amiable ones, but the writer does not suggest the absolute antagonism 
between Jehovah and Satan, which is a fundamental dogma of modern 
Christianity.
     "In the prophecy of Zechariah, Satan again, with an apparent 
personality, is represented as standing at the right hand of Joshua, the 
high-priest, to resist him: he seems to be claiming strict justice against 
one open to accusation; for Joshua is clothed in filthy garments-the type of 
sin and pollution.  Jehovah relents, and mercy triumphs over justice: the 
filthy garments are taken away, and fair raiment substituted.  Even here, 
the character of Satan, although hard, is not devoid of virtue, for it 
evinces a sense of justice."
     The Babylonians, among whom the Hebrews dwelt during the Captivity, 
believed in the existence of vast multitudes of spirits, both good and bad, 
but there is nothing to show that the Hebrews took over from them any 
extensive pantheon, either good or evil.  Indeed the Hebrew and Babylonian 
religions possessed many things in common, and there was no necessity that 
the captive Jews should borrow an animism which they probably already 
possessed. At the same time it is likely that they adopted the idea of an 
evil agency from their captors, and as the genius of their religion was 
averse to polytheism, the probabilities are that they welded the numerous 
evil forces of Baby-lonian into one central figure. Again, it must have 
occurred to them that if the world contained an evil principle, it could not 
possibly emanate from God, whom they regarded as all-good, and it was 
probably with the intention of separating all evil from God that the 
personality of Satan (having regard to the amount of evil in the universe) 
was invested with such importance.
     In later Judaism we find the conception of Satan strongly coloured by 
Persian dualism, and it has been supposed that Asmodeus of the Book of Tobit 
is the same as Aeshara Daewa of the Ancient Persians.  Both "Satan" and 
“Satans” were mentioned in the Book of Enoch, and in Ecclesiasticus he was 
identified with the serpent of Genesis, and in the" Book of the Secrets of 
Enoch "his revolt against God and expulsion from Heaven are described.  In 
the Jewish Targinn, Samael, highest of the angels, merges with Satan into a 
single personality. 
     The Satan of the New Testament is merely a reproduc-tion of these later 
Jewish forms.  In Matthew he is alluded to as the " Prince of Demons," and 
in Ephesians is spoken of as ruling over a world of evil beings who dwell in 
the lower heavens.  Thus he is prince of the powers of the air.  In 
Revelation the war in Heaven between God and Satan is described, and his 
imprisonment is foreshadowed after the overthrow of the Beast and the Kings 
of the earth, when he will be chained in the bottom-less pit for one 
thousand years.  After another period of freedom he is finally cast into the 
lake of brimstone for ever. According to the orthodox Christian belief of 
the present day, Satan has been endowed with great powers for the purpose of 
tempting man to prove his fortitude.  In the middle-ages. the belief in 
Satan and Satanic agencies was overwhelming, and was inherited by 
Protestantism from Roman Catholicism.  This is not the place to enter into a 
discussion as to the likelihood of the existence of an evil being, but the 
great consensus of theological opinion is in favour of such a theory.


Devil Worship :  (1). The worship of Satan or Lucifer. (2). The worship by 
semi-civilised or barbarous people; of deities having a demoniac form.
     The Worship of Satan or diabolism is spasmodic and oc-casionally 
epidemic.  It dates from the early days of dualism (q.v.) and perhaps 
originated in the Persian dual system when the opposing deities Ormuzd and 
Ahriman symbo-lised the good and bad principles respectively.  Instances of 
pure Satanism are comparatively rare, and it must not be confounded with the 
Sabbatic orgies of witchcraft which partake  more of the nature of (2),  or 
with the evocation of the Evil One, for the purpose of making a pact with 
him. Modern groups practising Satanism are small and obscure, and, 
unorganised as they are, details concerning them are conspicuous by their 
absence.
     Plentiful details, however, are forthcoming concerning the cultus of 
Lucifer, but much discrimination is required in dealing with these, the bulk 
of the literature on the subject being manifestly imaginative and willfully 
misleading.  The members of the church of Lucifer are of two groups, those 
who regard the deity they adore as the evil principle, thus approximating to 
the standpoint of the Satanists, and those who look upon him as the true god 
in opposition to Adonai or Jehovah, whom they regard as an evil deity who 
has with fiendish ingenuity miscreated the world of man to the detriment of 
humanity.
     Modern diabolic literature is written from the point of view of the 
Roman Catholic Church, and much may be said for the theory that it was 
composed to subserve the necessities of that institution.  But this cannot 
be wholly true, as it is a substantial fact that hosts are frequently 
abstracted from Catholic churches for the purpose of Satanic rite which 
requires the destruction of the consecrated wafer as a ritual act. In 1894 a 
hundred consecrated hosts were stolen from Notre Dame by an old woman under 
circum-stances that clearly proved that the vessels which contained them 
were not the objects of the theft, and an extra-ordinary number of such 
larcencies occurred in all parts of France about the end of last century, no 
less than thirteen churches in the diocese of Orleans being thus despoiled.  
In the diocese of Lyons measures were taken to transform the tabernacles 
into strong-boxes, and in eleven of the dioceses similar acts were recorded.  
In Italy, Rome, Liguria and Solerus suffered, and even in the Island of 
Mauritius an outrage of peculiar atrocity occurred in 1895.  It has been 
asserted by many writers such as Archbishop Meurin and Dr. Bataille that 
Freemasonry is merely a mask for Satanism, that is, that in recent years an 
organisation of which the ordinary mason is ignorant has grown up which has 
diabolism for its special object. This it is asserted is recruited from the 
higher branches of masonry and initiates women.  Needless to say, the
change is indignantly denied by masons, but it must be remembered that the 
persons who bring it are Catholics, who have a direct interest in 
humiliating the fraternity. Bataille and Margiotta have it that the order of 
the Palla-dium or Sovereign Council of Wisdom, was constituted in France in 
1737, and this, they infer, is one and the same as the legendary Palladium 
of the Templars, better known by the name of Baphomet (q.v.)  In 1801 one 
Isaac Long, a Jew, carried the "original image" of Baphomet to Charleston in 
the United States, and it is alleged that the lodge he founded then became 
the chief in the Ancient and Accepted Scotch Rite.  He was succeeded in due 
course by Albert Pike, who, it is alleged, extended the Scotch Rite, and 
shared the Anti-Catholic Masonic chieftainship with the Italian patriot 
Mazzini. This new directory was estab-lished, it is asserted, as the new 
Reformed Palladium Rite or the Reformed Palladium. Assisted by Gallatin 
Mackey, one Longfellow, Holbrook and a Swiss, Phileas Walder by name, Pike 
erected the new rite into an occult fraternity with world-wide powers, and 
practised the occult arts so well that we are asked to believe that the head 
lodge at Charleston was in constant communication with Lucifer I Dr. 
Bataille in a wholly ludicrous work Le Diable au XIX, states among other 
things that in 188! his hero "Dr. Hacks" in whom his own personality is but 
thinly disguised, visited Charleston in March 1881, where he met Albert 
Pike, Gallatin Mackey and other Satanists. Mackey showed him his Arcula 
Mystica in appearance like a liqueur stand, but in reality a diabolical 
telephone, worked like the Urim and Thummim.  Miss Diana Vaughan, once a 
Palladist, Grand Mistress of the Temple, and Grand Inspectress of the 
Palladium, was converted to Roman Catholicism, and in Memoirs of an ex-
Palladist, (1895) she has given an exhaustive account of her dealings with 
the Satanists of Charleston.  She clamns to be des-cended from the alchemist 
Thomas Vaughan, and re-counts her adventures with Lucifer.  These are so 
wholly absurd that we must request freedom from the necessity of recounting 
them. There is little doubt that Miss Vaughan was either the victim of 
hallucination or else the instrument of the Roman Catholic Church in its 
attempts to brand Masonry as a vehicle of Satanism. The publi-cations of 
Margiotta and Gabriel  Pages are equally puerile, and we may conclude that, 
if Satanism and the wor-ship of Lucifer exists, that the rites of their 
churches are carried on in such a secret manner, that few, even mystics of 
experience, can be aware of them.
     When applied to the ceremonies of barbarous races, devil-worship is a 
misnomer, as the "devils" adored by them are deities in their eyes, and only 
partake of the diabolic nature in the view of missionaries and others. But 
inasmuch as the gods possess a demoniac form they may be classed as 
diabolic.  Among these may be enumerated many South American and African 
tribes. The Uapes of Brazil worship Jurupari, a fiend-like deity, to whom 
they consecrate tlleir young men.  His cult is invested with the utmost 
secrecy. The myth of his birth states that he was horn of a virgin who 
conceived after drinking a draught of chahiri, or native beer.  She pos-
sessed no sexual parts, and could not give birth to the god until bitten by 
a fish whilst bathing. When arrived at man's estate Jurupari invited the men 
of the tribe to a drinking-bout, but the women refused to provide the 
liquor, and thus gained his ill-will.  He devoured the children of the tribe 
because they had eaten of the uacu tree which was sacred to him. The men, 
enraged at the loss of their offspring, fell upon him, and cast him into a 
fire, from the ashes of which grew the paxiuba tree, which the Uapes say is 
the bones of Jurupari. Whilst it was night the men cut down the tree and 
fashioned it into sacred instruments which must never be seen by the women, 
on account of the dislike Jurupari conceived for them. Should a woman chance 
to see the' sacred symbols per-taining to the worship of Jurupari, she is at 
once poisoned. On hearing the "Jurupari music  of the priests on the 
occasion of one of his festivals the women of the tribe wildly rush into 
concealment, nor dare to emerge from it until all chance of danger is past.  
In all probability this custom proceeds from the ancient usage common to 
most American tribes that the rites of initiation of the men of the tribe 
must not be witnessed by the women thereof, probably on account of some more 
or less obscure totemic reason or sex-jealousy analagous to the exclusion of 
women from the rites of freemasonry, to which, strange to say, the worship 
of Jurupari bears a strong resemblance.
     This is a good example of the " devil worship" of savage races.  The 
Chinese also placate devils (see China) as do the people of Burma and 
Cambodia (q.v.) but in no sense can their oblations to evil spirits be 
classed as "worship," any more than the gods of classic times may be 
regarded a! devils, simply because they were so labelled by early 
Christianity.  (See Gnostics, Obeah, Ju-ju, Devil, Demono-logy, etc.)

Devil's Bridge : A bridge thrown across the Afon Mynach, near Aberystwyth. 
The story goes that an old woman who had lost her cow saw it on the opposite 
side of the chasm to that on which she stood, but knew not how to reach it.  
At that juncture the Evil One appeared to her in the shape of a monk, and 
promised to throw a bridge across, if she would give him the first living 
thing that would pass over it. The old lady agreed, the bridge was 
completed. and the crafty fiend begged that she would try it.  But the old 
woman had observed his cloven hoof, and knee bent backwards, so she took a 
crust from her pocket and flung it across the ravine, bidding her little dog 
go fetch it. The Evil One was outwitted, as he generally is in such tales.


Devil's Chain : There is a tradition in Switzerland that St. Bernard has the 
devil chained in some mountains in the neighbourhood of the Abbey of 
Clairvanx.  From this comes the custom, observed by the farmers of the 
country, of striking three blows with the hammer on the anvil every Monday 
morning before setting to work.  By this means the devil's chain is 
strengthened, so that he may not escape.


Devil's Girdle, The : Witches in mediaeval times were often accused of 
wearing the Devil's Girdle, probably as a mark of allegiance to the Evil 
One. Magical girdles were com-monly worn, and a modern writer suggests that 
the magnetic belts advertised at the present day had their origin in this 
practice.


Devil's Pillar : There are preserved at Prague three stones of a pillar 
which the devil brought from Rome to crush a priest, with whom he had made a 
compact, and to kill him while he said mass. But St. Peter, says the legend, 
threw the devil and his pillar into the sea three times in succession, which 
diversion gave the priest time for repentance. The devil was so chagrined 
that he broke the pillar and saved himself.


Devil's Sonata : (See Visions.)


Devils, Afraid of Bells : It was an old superstition that evil spirits were 
afraid of bells and fled from the sound of them.


Devon, Witchcraft in : The belief in witchcraft is not yet dead in 
Devonshire, as was shown in a curious case heard in Crediton County Court 
not many years ago, when a young woman alleged that she was given a potion 
in a grocer's shop, and that as a result, either of the draught or of the 
incantation delivered while she was in the shop, she was getting thinner 
every day.  Only those who have lived long in Devon can realise the 
widespread belief that still exists ill remote corners of the county of the 
power of the evil eye," and of the credence given to all kinds of weird 
superstitions.  " Witches " are believed to be able to exercise a malign 
influence even after death unless they are buried with their toes downwards.  
Not very long ago, a woman suspected of being a witch, was buried in this 
way within twenty miles of Tiverton.  In no part of the country is 
witchcraft more believed in than in the Culm Valley.  There is a local 
saying that there are enough witches in the valley to roll a hogshead of 
cider up the Beacon Hill, at Culmstock, and old people living in the 
locality are not ashamed to say that they believe in witch-craft. The 
witches are of two kinds-" black" and white." The former profess to have the 
power to con-demn those on whom they are asked to cast a spell, to all kinds 
of misfortunes ; the latter impose on credulous clients by making them 
believe that they can remove evil spells and bring good fortune-for a 
consideration, of course.  For obvious reasons visits to " witches " are 
generally kept dark, but every now and again particulars leak out.  In the 
Culmstock district, not so very long ago, a young girl went with her mother 
to a witch, in order to get a spell cast over an errant swain, who was 
suspected of bestowing his affections on another young lady.  The witch 
professed to be able to bring the young man back to his first love, or to 
condemn him to all kinds of torture, but her price was prohibitive, and so 
the young man was left to marry whom he would.  Farmers are the witches' 
most profitable clients, and it is a noteworthy fact that they generally 
contrive to visit the " wise woman " when they are away from home, " at 
market."  A few years ago, farmers used to go to Exeter for many miles round 
to consult a witch whenever they had any misfortune, and it is commonly 
reported that they can get the same sort of advice in the city at the 
present day.  At many farmhouses Bibles are kept in the dairies to prevent 
witches from retarding the butter-making operations.  " I'm 'witched," or " 
I must have been 'witched," are expressions heard in Devon every day in the 
week.  Generally speaking, it is animals that are supposed to sustain the 
most harm from being "overlooked."  The loss of cattle that have died has 
been put down to the power of evil spirits, and accord-ing to many 
superstitious people, witches have a peculiar power over pigs.  A man who 
believed his pigs had been bewitched was told, not so long ago, to take the 
heart of a pig, stick it full of pins and needles, and roast it at the fire.  
He did this believing this would check the mortality among his swine.


Diadochus : According to Marbodneus, this gem resembles the beryl in its 
properties, and was most valuable in divina-tion.  It serves for the 
invocation of spirits, and oracular responses could be discovered in it.  
Albertus Magnus writes it Diacodos, and it is possibly to this stone that 
Braithwaite alludes in his English Gentleman: " For as the precious stone 
Diacletes, though it have many rare and excellent sovereiguties in it, yet 
loseth them all if put in a dead man's mouth."  Marbodneus mentions this in 
his verses as a property of the diadochus.  The words of Leonardus are too 
curious to omit: ' It disturbs devils beyond all other stones, for, if it be 
thrown in water, with the words of its charm sung, it shows various images 
of devils, and gives answer to those that question it.  Being held in the 
mouth, a man may call any devil out of hell, and receive satisfaction to 
such questions as he may ask." He names it Diacodas or Diacodus.


Diagrams, Magical  (See Magic.)


Diakka : A term used by Andrew Jackson Davis to signify wicked, ignorant, or 
undeveloped spirits.  It is believed that at death no sudden or violent 
change takes place in the character and disposition of an individual. Those 
who are mischievous, unprincipled, sensual, during their lives remain so, 
for a time at least, after they die.  Hudson Tuttle says, " As the spirit 
enters the spirit world just as it leaves this, there must be an innumerable 
host of low, undeveloped, uneducated, or in other words, evil spirits." 
There is, indeed, a special sphere or plane for these diakka, where they are 
put on probation.  It is they who are re-sponsible for the fraud and 
trickery often witnessed at seances; they not only deceive the sitters, but 
the medium as well. The way to avoid their influence is to live a pure, 
refined, and religious life, for these evil spirits are naturally attracted 
to those whose minds most resemble their own.


Diamond : This gem possesses the most marvellous virtues. It gives victory 
to him who carries it bound on his left arm whatever the number of his 
enemies.  Panics, pestilences, enchantments-all fly before it; hence, it is 
good for sleep-walkers and for the insane.  It deprives the lodestone of its 
virtue, and one variety, the Arabian diamond, is said to attract iron more 
powerfully than the magnet itself. The ancients believed that neither fire 
nor blows would overcome its hardness, unless macerated with fresh goat's 
blood; and Cyprian, Austin, Isidore, and others of the fathers, adopting 
this notion, have used it to illustrate the method by which the blood of the 
Cross softens the heart of man.  If bound to a magnet, the diamond, ac-
cording to the belief of the ancients, will deprive it of its virtue.


Diancecht : A Danaan magician of Irish medieval legend. He it was who 
restored to Nuada of the Silver Hand (q.v.) his lost limb and thus his 
throne.


Diaphane : The Kabalistic term for the imagination.


Dickenson, Edmund :  Dr. Edmund Dichenson, physician to King Charles the 
Second, a professed seeker of the her-metic knowledge, produced a book 
entitled, De Quinta Essentia. Philosophorum; which was printed at Oxford in 
i686, and a second time in 1705. A third edition of it was printed in 
Germany in 1721.  In correspon-dence with a French adept, the latter 
explains the reasons why the Brothers of the Rosy Cross concealed 
themselves. As to the universal medicine, Elixir Vitae, or potable form of 
the preternatural menstruum, he positively asserts that it is in the hands 
of the  Illuminated," but that, by the time they discover it, they have 
ceased to desire its uses, being far above them: and as to life for 
centuries, being wishful for other things, they decline availing themselves 
of it.  He adds that the adepts are obliged to conceal themselves for the 
sake of safety, because they would be abandoned in the consolations of the 
intercourse of this world (if they were not, indeed, exposed to worse 
risks), supposing that their gifts were proven to the conviction of the 
bystanders as more than human, when they would become simply abhorrent. 
Thus, there are excellent reasons for the its conduct ; they proceed with 
the utmost caution, and instead of making a display of their powers, as 
vain-glory is the least distinguishing characteristic of these great men, 
they studiously evade the idea that they have any extraordinary or separate 
knowledge. They live simply as mere spectators in the world, and they desire 
to make no disciples, converts nor confidants. They sub-mit to the 
obligations of life, and to relationships-en-joying the fellowship of none, 
admiring none, following none, but themselves. They obey all codes, are 
excellent citizens, and only preserve silence in regard to their own private 
beliefs, giving the world the benefit of their ac-quirements up to a certain 
point; seeking only sympathy at some angles of their multiform character, 
but shutting out curiosity where they do not desire its inquisitive eyes.


Didot Perceval : So-called because the only MS. of this legend discovered 
belonged to A. F. Didot, the famous collector. This version of the Grail 
Legend lays great stress on the illness of the Fisher King.  It tells how 
the Table Round was constructed, and relates the adventures of Sir Perceval, 
which are much the same as those told in the Conte del Graal and include the 
Good Friday incident.  It is said that he, with his brother-in-law, Brons, 
were instructed in the mystic expressions which Christ whispered to Joseph 
of Arimathea when on the cross.

Direct Writing : A term used in spiritualism for spirit writing which is 
produced directly, and not by the hand of a medium, or through a mechanical 
contrivance such as a psycho-graph or planchette.. The best known form of 
direct writing is that made popular by the mediums Slade and Eg-linton-
slate-writing (q.v.)  But the spirits are not depen-dent solely on prepared 
materials, but can produce direct writing anywhere, and under any 
circumstances. Thus during a poltergeist disturbance at Stratford; Conn., in 
1850-51, direct writing was found on turnips which sprang apparently from 
nowhere. An unfinished letter left for a few moments would he found 
completed in a different hand, though during the interval it might have been 
in-accessible to any normal agency. Direct writing may also be produced at 
spiritualistic seances, either by means of slate-writing. or by putting 
scraps of paper and pencil into a sealed drawer or a closed box.  A sound as 
of writing will shortly be heard, and on the paper being withdrawn it will 
be found to contain some sort of message from the spirit world.  Experiments 
on these lines were carried out by a noted spiritualist, Baron de 
Guldenstubbe, in 1856.  Paper and pencil he locked in a small box, the key 
of which he carried about with him.  At the end of thirteen days he found 
some writing on the paper; and on that same day the experiment was 
repeatedly performed, each time with success.  Another method he adopted was 
to visit galleries, churches, and other public places, and to leave writing 
materials on the pedestals of statues, on tombs, and 50 on.  In this way he 
obtained writing in English, French, German, Latin, Greek, and other 
languages purporting to come from Plato, Cicero, St. Paul, Juvenal, Spencer, 
and Mary Stuart. The Baron was accompanied on these expeditions by the Comte 
d'Ourches and others of his friends, while on one occasion a medium is 
mentioned as being present.  It is probable, indeed, that a medium was 
essential to these spirit performances; for, though the medium's physical 
organism is not used as an agent, the writings generally take place in the 
vicinity of one gifted with supernormal faculties. Not only is legible hand-
writing produced in this way; sometimes mysterious hieroglyphs are 
inscribed, which can only be deciphered by those who possess mediumistic 
powers.


Dithorba : Brother of Red Hugh and Kimbay of Irish me-dieval legend.  He was 
killed by his niece Macha, and his five sons expelled from Ulster. They 
resolved to wrest the sovereignty of Ireland from Macha, but she discovers 
them in the forest, overpowers them by her mesmeric influence, and carries 
them to her palace on her back. They build the famous Irish city of Emain 
Macha under her supervision.


Divination : The method of obtaining knowledge of the unknown or the future 
by means of omens.  Astrology (q.v.), and oracular utterances (See Oracles), 
may be re-garded as branches of divination. The derivation of the word 
supposes a direct message from the gods to the diviner or augur.  It is 
practised in all grades of barbarism and civilisation. The methods of 
divination are many and various, and strangely enough in their variety are 
confined to no one portion of the globe. Crystal-gazing has been relegated 
to a separate article.  Shell-hearing and similar methods are allied to 
crystal-gazing and may be classed with it, as that method of divination 
which arises from the personal consciousness of the augur.  Of the same 
class are divi-nation by dreams, automatic writing, and so forth.  What 
might be called divination by " luck" is represented by the use of cards, 
the casting of lots, the use of knuckle-hones as in Africa and elsewhere, 
cocoanuts as in Polynesia. Haruspication, or the inspection of entrails, 
divination by foot-print in ashes, by the flight of birds, by meeting with 
ominous animals, represents the third class of augury.
     The art of divination is usually practised among savages by the shaman 
caste; among less barbarous people by the augur, as in Rome and ancient 
Mexico; and even amongst civilised people by persons who pretend to 
divination, such as the spiritualistic medium or the witch. The art is un-
doubtedly of great antiquity.  It was employed in ancient Egypt side by side 
with astrology, and divination by dream was constantly resorted to, a class 
of priests being kept apart, whose office it was to interpret dreams and 
visions. We find instances of dreams recorded in the Egyptian texts: as for 
example those of Thothmes IV. king of Egypt in 1450 B.C.; and Nut-Amen, king 
of the Eastern Soudan and Egypt about 670 B.C. The Egyptian magician usually 
set himself to procure dreams for his clients by such devices as the drawing 
of magical pictures and the reciting of magical words ; and some of these 
are still extant, such as that in the British Museum papyrus NO.122. We 
find, however, that in Egypt augury was usually ef-fected by astrological 
methods.
     In ancient China the principal method of divination was by means of the 
oracles; but we find such forms as the examination of the marks on the shell 
of a tortoise, which reminds us of the examination of the back of a pec-cary 
by the Maya of Central America. We find a Chinese monarch consulting the 
fates in this manner in 1146 B.C. and finding them unfavourable; but as in 
Egypt, most soothsaying was accomplished by means of astrology. Omens, 
however, were by no means ignored, and were given great prominence, as many 
tales in the ancient books testify.
     In ancient Rome a distinct caste or college of priests called Augurs 
was set apart to interpret the signs of ap-proval or disapproval sent by the 
gods in reference to any coming event. This college probably consisted 
originally of but three members, of whom the king himself was one; and it 
was not until the time of Caesar that the members were increased to sixteen. 
The college remained in ex-istence as late as the fourth century, and its 
members held office for life. The tenets of the Roman augurs were, that for 
signs of the gods one must look towards the sky and glean knowledge of the 
behests of the divine beings from such omens as the lightning-flash, and the 
flight of birds. On a windless night, the augur took up his position on a 
hill which afforded an extensive view. Marking out a space for himself, he 
pitched a tent within it, and seating himself therein with covered head 
requested the gods for a sign, and waited for an answer.  He faced 
southwards, thus having the east, or lucky quarter, on his left, and the 
west, or unfavourable portion of the sky, on his right.  He carefully 
observed every sign which came within the pur-view of his vision: such as 
lightning, the appearance of birds, and so forth. The song or utterance of 
birds was also carefully hearkened to; and these were divided into birds of 
good omen and evil omen: while others referred to definite persons and 
events. The reading of omens was also effected by the feeding of birds and 
observing the manner in which they ate. The course of animals and the sounds 
uttered by them were also closely watched, and all unusual phenomena were 
regarded as omens or warnings.  Sortilege or the casting of lots was often 
re-sorted to by the caste of augurs. The election of magis-trates was nearly 
always referred to the Auspices or College of Diviners, as were the setting 
out of an army for war, and the passing of laws.
     In the East generally, divination appears to have been effected by 
crystal-gazing, dreams. and similar methods of self-hallucination,  or  
self-hypnotism.  Divination flourished in Chaldea and Assyria among the 
Babylonians and Ethiopians, and appears to have been very much the same as 
in Egypt.  In the Jewish Talmud we notice that witches are said to divine by 
means of bread-crumbs. Among The Arabs, the future is often foretold by 
means of the shapes seen in sand. The Burmese and Siamese. pierce an egg at 
each end, and having blown the contents on the ground, trace within them the 
outline of things to be. (See Burma.)  
Divination by astrology too is very common in oriental countries, and 
prophetic utterance is likewise in great favour.
     It is remarkable that among the native races of America. the same arts 
of divination as are known to the peoples of the Old World were and are in 
vogue. These arts, as a rule, are the preserve of the medicine-man and 
priestly class. In ancient Mexico there was a college of augurs 
corresponding in purpose to the Auspices of ancient Rome, the members of 
which occupied themselves with observing the flight and listening to the 
songs of birds. from which they drew their conclusions.  in Mexico, the 
Calmecac or college of priests had a department where divination was taught 
in all its branches, but there were many of officio prophets and augurs, and 
the reader is referred to the article on Mexico for an account of the 
astrological. methods of casting nativities, and so forth.  Oracles were. 
common, and in this connection an amusing Peruvian story may be recalled.  A 
certain huaca or oracle was reported to be of evil influence  orders were 
given to. destroy it; and upon its being broken up a parrot found means to 
escape from within it,-thus giving us a pretty shrewd idea of the means 
employed by the priesthood to effect oracular utterance.  In Peru, still 
other classes of diviners predicted by means of the leaves of tobacco, or 
the grains or juice of coca, the shapes of grains of maize, taken at random, 
the forms assumed by the smoke rising from burning victims, the viscera of 
animals, the course taken by spiders, and the direction in which fruits 
might fall. The professors of these several methods were dis-tinguished by 
different ranks and titles, and their training was a long and arduous one. 
The American tribes as a whole were very keen observers of bird life.  
Strangely enough the bird and serpent are combined in their sym-bolism, and 
indeed in the names of several of their prin-cipal deities. The bird 
appeared to the American savage as a spirit, in all probability under the 
spell of some potent enchanter-a spell which might be broken by some great 
sorcerer or medicine man alone.  As among the ancient Romans, the birds of 
America were divided into those of good and evil omen; and indeed certain 
Brazilian tribes appear to think that the souls of departed Indians enter 
into the bodies of birds. The shamans of certain tribes of Paraguay act as 
go-betweens between the members of their tribes and such birds as they 
imagine enshrine the souls of their departed relatives. This usage would 
appear to combine the acts of augury and necromancy.
     The priesthood of Peru practised oracular methods by "making idols 
speak," and this they probably accomplished by ventriloquial arts. The 
piages or priests of the Uapes of Brazil have a contrivance known to them as 
the paxiuba, which consists of a tree-stem about the height of a man, on 
which the branches and leaves have been left.  Holes are bored in the trunk 
beneath the foliage, and by speaking through these the leaves are made to 
tremble, and the sound so caused is interpreted as a message from Jurupari 
one of their principal deities.  But all over the American continent from 
the Eskimos to the Patagonians, the methods of oracular divination are 
practically identical. The sha-man or medicine-man raises a tent or hut 
which he enters carefully closing the aperture after him.  He then proceeds 
to make his incantations, and in a little while the entire lodge trembles 
and rocks, the poles bend to breaking point, as if a dozen strong men were 
straining at them, and the most violent noise comes from within, seemingly 
now em-anating from the depths of the earth, now from the air above, and now 
from the vicinity of the hut itself. The reason for this disturbance has 
never been properly ac-counted for; and medicine-men who have been converted 
to Christianity have assured scientific workers amongst Indian tribes that 
they have not the least idea of what occurred during the time they occupied 
these enchanted lodges, for the simple reason that they were plunged in a 
deep sleep.  After the supernatural sounds have to some extent faded away, 
the medicine-man proceeds to question The spirit he has evoked,-the answers 
of whom for sheer ambiguity are equal to those of the Pythonesses of ancient 
Greece. There is little doubt that the shamans who practise this method of 
oracular utterance are the victims of hallucination, and many cases are on 
record in which they have excited themselves into a condition of permanent 
lunacy.
     America is the touchstone of the science of anthropology, and since we 
have adopted it as the continent from which to draw the majority of our 
illustrations, it will be as well if we conclude the article on American 
lines for the sake of comparison.  We find then that divination by hypnosis 
is well-known in the western continent.  Jonathan Carver, who travelled 
among the Sioux about the latter end of the eighteenth century, mentions it 
as in use amongst them. The " Ghost Dance" religion of the Indians of Nevada 
had for one of its tenets the belief in hypnotic communion with the dead.  
Divination by means of dreams and visions is extremely common in both sub-
continents of the western hemisphere, as is exemplified by the derivation of 
the word priest "in the native languages: by the Algonquians they are called 
"dreamers of the gods," by the Maya " listen-ers," and so forth. The ability 
to see visions was usually quickened by the use of drugs or the swallowing 
or inhala-tion of cerebral intoxicants, such as tobacco, maguey, coca, the 
snake-plant, and so forth.  Indeed many Indian tribes, such as the Creeks, 
possessed numerous plants which they cultivated for this purpose.  A large 
number of instances are on record in which Indian medicine-men are said to 
have divined the future in a most striking manner, and perhaps the following 
will serve to illustrate this
     In his autobiography, Black Hawk, a celebrated Sac chief, relates that 
his grandfather had a strong belief that in four years' time ' he should see 
a white man, who would be to him as a father.'  Supernaturally directed, as 
he said, he travelled eastward to a certain spot, and there, as he had been 
informed in dreams, met with a Frenchman who concluded an alliance on behalf 
of his country with the Sac nation.  Coincidence is certainly possible here, 
but it can hardly exist in the circumstances of Jonathan Carver.  While he 
was dwelling with the Killistenoes, they were threatened with a famine, and 
on the arrival of certain traders, who brought them food in exchange for 
skins and other goods, their very existence depended. The diviners of the 
tribe were consequently consulted by
the chief, and announced that the next day, at high noon exactly, a canoe 
would make its appearance with news of the anxiously looked-for expedition. 
The entire popu-lation came down to the beach in order to witness its 
arrival, accompanied by the incredulous trader, and, to his intense 
surprise, at the very moment forecasted by the shamans, a canoe rounded a 
distant headland, and, paddling speedily shorewards, brought the patient 
Killistenoes news of the expedition they expected.
     John Mason Brown has put on record an equally singu-lar instance of the 
prophetic gift on the part of an American medicine-man.  (See Atlantic 
Monthly, July, 1866.)  He was engaged several years previously in searching 
for a band of Indians in the neighbourhood of the Mackenzie and Coppermine 
rivers ; but the difficulties of the search induced the majority of his band 
to return, until out of ten men who originally set out only three remained. 
They had all but concluded to abandon their search when they stumbled upon a 
party of braves of the very tribe of which they were in search. These men 
had been sent out by their medicine-men to find three whites, of whose 
horses, accoutrements, and general appearance the shaman had given them an 
exhaustive account ere they set out, and this the warriors related to Brown 
before they saw his companions.  Brown very naturally inquired closely of 
the medicine-man how he had been able to foretell their coming.  But the 
latter, who appeared to be  a frank and simple-minded man,' could only 
explain that 'he saw them coming, and heard them talk on their journey.
     Crystal-gazing is in common use amongst many Indian tribes. The Aztecs 
of Mexico were wont to gaze into small polished pieces of sandstone, and a 
case is on record where a Cherokee Indian kept a divining crystal wrapped up 
in buckskin in a cave, occasionally "feeding" it by rubbing over it the 
blood of a deer. At a village in Guatemala, Stephens saw a remarkable stone 
which had been placed on the altar of the church there, but which had 
previously been used as a divining-stone by the Indians of the district. 
Divination by arrow was also commonly resorted to.
     According to Fuentes, the chronicler of Guatemala the reigning king of 
Kiche, Kicah Tanub, when informed by the ambassador of Montezuma II. that a 
race of irre-sistible white men had conquered Mexico and were pro-ceeding to 
Guatemala, sent for four diviners, whom he commanded to tell him what would 
be the result of this invasion. They asked for time to discover the future 
fate of his kingdom, and taking their bows discharged some arrows against a 
rock. They returned to inform their master that, as no impression had been 
made upon the rock by the arrowheads, they must prognosticate the worst and 
predicted the ultimate triumph of the white man-a circumstance which shows 
that the class to which they belonged stood in no fear of royalty.  Kicah 
Tanub, dis-satisfied, sent for the ' priests,' obviously a different class 
from the diviners, and requested their opinions.  From the ominous 
circumstance of an ancient stone - which had been brought from afar by their 
forefathers-having been broken, they also augured the fall of the Kiche 
empire.
     Many objects such as small clay birds, boats or boat-shaped vessels, 
etc., have been discovered in sepulchral mounds in North America, and it is 
conjectured that these may have been used for purposes of divination.  As 
any object might become a fetish, it is probable that any object might 
become a means of augury. The method employed appears to have been so to 
treat the object that the prob-able chances for or against the happening of 
a certain event would be discovered-much, indeed, as some persons will toss 
coins to " find out" whether an expected event will come to pass or not.  
Portents, too, were implicitly be-lieved in by the American races, and this 
branch of augury was, we find, one of the accomplishments of Nezahualpilli, 
king of Tercuco, near Mexico, whom Montezuma consulted concerning the 
terrible prodigies which startled his people prior to the advance of the 
Spaniards upon his kingdom, and which were supposed to predict the return of 
Quet-zacloatl, the legendary culture-hero of Anahuac, to his own again. 
These included earthquakes, tempests, floods, the appearances of comets and 
strange lights, whilst mys-terious voices were heard in the air-such 
prodigies, indeed, as tradition usually insists upon as the precursors of 
the downfall of a mighty empire.
     The various methods of divination have each been ac-corded a separate 
article : thus the reader is referred to Axinomancy, Belomancy, Capnomaney, 
and so forth; and in the articles dealing with the various countries a 
goodly number of instances of divinatory practice will be discovered.


Divine Name, The : In Jewish mysticism great stress is laid upon the 
importance of the Divine Name.  It consists of forty-two letters ; not, as 
Moses Maimonides points out, comprised in one word, but in a phrase of 
several words, which conveyed an exact notion of the essence of God. With 
the priestly decadence in the last days of the Temple, a name of twelve 
letters was substituted for the Divine Name, and as time went on even this 
secondary name was not divulged to every priest, but only to a few. The 
longer name was sometimes said to contain forty-five or seventy-two letters. 
The ten Sefiroth are also supposed, in a mystical sense, to be the names of 
the Deity. The Divine Name Jahveh is greater than " I am that I am, since 
the latter signifies God as He was before the creation, the Absolute, the 
Unknowable, the Hidden One; but the former denotes the Supreme 
Manifestation, the immanence of God in the Cosmos.


Divine World : Formerly known as the Adi Plane-is in the theosophic scheme 
of things, the first or highest world, (in Theosophy) the world first formed 
by the divine im-pulse in the creative process.  It is unattainable by man 
in his present state.  (See Theosophy and Solar System.)


Divining Rod : A forked rod, or branch of tree, which in the hands of 
certain people is said to indicate, by means of spasmodic movements of 
varying intensity, the presence of water and minerals underground. Traces of 
the rod used for purposes of divination are to be found in the records of 
Ancient Egypt.  Cicero and Tacitus both wrote of the rod "virgule divina." 
This ancient diviing rod was a form of rhabdomancy (q.v.) or divination by 
means of little pieces of stick.  In Germany it was known as the "wishing-
rod" and was used just as fortune-tellers use cards, coffee or tea-grounds 
at the present day.  Agricola's De Re Metallica published at Basle, at the 
beginning of the sixteenth century, makes reference to another rod which be 
calls the virgula furcata," the forked, rod to distinguish it from the " 
virgula divina." This rod, he said, was used by miners to discover mineral 
lodes; rhabdomancy having nothing to do with this use of the divining rod.  
Melanc-thon mentions this use of the rod and ascribed the behaviour of the" 
instrument" in the discovery of metallic ores to the law of sympathy, 
according to the belief then obtaining that metals, trees and other natural 
objects had certain subtle relationships with each other; and believers in 
this theory pointed to the fact that trees which grew above mineral lodes 
droop as though attracted down-wards; the modern scientific explanation of 
this natural phenomenon being that it is due to the poverty of the soil. In 
Sebastian Minister's Cosmography, also of the sixteenth century, may be 
found engravings of these "mineral diviners " at work. The priests of that 
time persecuted them as demons in disguise; they were also included in the 
witchcraft persecutions, suffering tortures and burning
to death.  Among miners on the Continent the use of the “virgula furcata" 
became universal, especially in the Harz Mountains and throughout Saxony.  
In Germany it was called the Schlag-Ruthe, " striking-rod" from the fact of 
its appearing to strike when held over mineral ores.
     Robert Boyle, the ' father of chemistry" is the first to make mention 
of the divining rod in England.  In an essay of his published in 1663 may be 
found the following
     ‘A forked hazel twig is held by its horns, one in each hand, the holder 
walking with it over places where mineral lodes may be suspected, and it is 
said that the fork by dipping down will discover the place where the ore is 
to be found. Many eminent authors, amongst others our distinguished 
countryman Gabriel Plat, ascribe much to this detecting wand, and others, 
far from credulous or ignorant, have as eye-witnesses spoken of its value.  
When visiting the lead-mines of Somersetshire I saw its use, and one gentle-
man who employed it declared that it moved without his will, and I saw it 
bend so strongly as to break in his hand. It will only succeed in some men's 
hands, and those who have seen it may much more readily believe than those 
who have not."  Some authorities on the subject state that it was first 
brought into England in the time of Queen Elizabeth.  In the State papers of 
that reign may be found recorded the fact that commissioners were sent to 
Germany to study the best methods of mining and brought back with them 
German miners from the Harz Mountains; and that these " foreigners  
introduced the divining rod into England seems highly probable.  It was 
first used for water finding, however in Southern France, and not until a 
cen-tury later was it used in England for this purpose.  It became the ' 
dowsing rod  in England and Somersetshire might be called the home of the ' 
dowser."  Locke the philosopher, a Somersetshire man referred in 1691 to the 
dowsing rod  and De Quincey, also belonging to the county, tells 0, singular 
cases of " jousers " as he calls them.  Down to the present day this means 
of finding water is used, farmers and owners of large estates sending for a 
"dowser" when they wish to find a spring of water. These men are not 
geologists, who might have a scientific knowledge of the locality, they are 
often merely labourers. The rods are mostly cut from the hazel, but all 
kinds of nut and fruit trees have been used, white and black thorn and 
privet also being favourites.  Pieces of watch-spring and copper-wire are 
also used ; and in some cases the forked rod is dispensed with, the peculiar 
sensation felt in the arms, hands and body being sufficient to indicate the 
water. These dowsers wander over the ground with the ends of the fork 
grasped in the palms of the hands and the rod downwards and when this moves, 
turning suddenly in his hand, upwards, it is said for water, downwards for 
minerals, at that spot will be found the desired object, absolute 
correctness  frequently bring  achieved.  In later years attempts have been 
made to scientifically in-vestigate the question and amongst amateur " 
dowsers" we find the names of Lord Ferrer and the late Mr. Andrew Lang.  As 
to the theory for these movements the electrical or magnetic theory was 
exploded by Father Kircher in 1654 who balanced the rod on a frictionless 
support like a delicate pair of scales and found that in this position 
nothing would induce it to move over hidden water or metal.  It must be held 
by some human being before the movements take place.  Chevreul, the French 
savant, in 1854 put forward the theory of involuntary muscular action.  A 
modern scientist gives his opinion that very possibly it is due to a faculty 
in the " dowser" akin to that possessed by a medium: " some transcendental 
per-ceptive power unconsciously possessed by certain persons, a faculty 
analogous to what is called clairvoyance. Not exactly to be described as ' 
clear-seeing' but rather, a dim, obscure impression not reaching the brain 
through the organ of vision, seldom ever rising to the level of a con-scious 
impression, but one able to start the nervous reflex action which caused the 
muscles to twitch and the rod or other ‘autoscope' to move.  Doubtless, 
changes of blood pressure and pulse rate also occur in the dowser  and if 
this be so, quite possibly modern instrumental appliances for recording 
these will ultimately supersede the primitive forked twig."  He goes on to 
say that: " The dowser' in fact, 'feels for ' and subconsciously discerns 
the hidden object, whether it be water, hidden treasure or even a malefactor 
concealing himself from justice, who was pur-sued and discovered by the 
agency of the famous dowser Jacques Aymar, using his supernormal powers in 
1692." See Sir W. F. Barrett F.R.S. Lecture on The Dowsing Rod. A. E. Waite, 
The Occult Sciences.


Divs : The div of ancient Persia, pronounced deo, den, or dive, is supposed 
to be the same as the European devil of the middle ages.  In the romances of 
Persia they are repre-sented as male and female, but the male divs are 
considered the more dangerous, and it is from their character, per-sonified 
in a supposed chief, that the devil is painted with his well-known 
attributes. The male divs, according to the legends of Persia, were 
entrusted with the government of the world for seven thousand years anterior 
to the crea-tion of Adam, and they were succeeded by the female divs or 
pens, who under their chief, Gian ben Gian, ruled other two thousand years.  
The dominion of the pens was ter-minated by Eblis (the devil of the Koran) 
who had been created from the elements of fire, and whose abode was 
previously with the angels.  Eblis or Hans, as he is also called,. became 
the leader of the rebellious angels when they were commanded to do homage to 
the first created man, and being joined by the whole race of genii, the male 
and female divs, whom he had formerly subjugated, he was like them deprived 
of grace.  Eblis and  his imme-diate followers were condemned to suffer for 
a long period in the infernal regions, but the remainder were allowed to 
wander over the earth, a constant source of misery to themselves and to the 
human race, whose obedience is put to the test by their devices, and secured 
by the example of their degradation and sufferings. They are supposed to 
assume various forms, especially that of the serpent, and in the drawings 
annexed to the Persian romances they are represented much as our own devils, 
ogres, and giants, in the tales of the middle ages.  The writers of the 
later ages, both Arabian and Persian, have localised the abode of these evil 
genii in the mountain Kaf  their capital is Aherman-abad, the abode of 
Aherman their chief, who is identified with the Ahremanes of the Manicheans, 
that remarkable sect being said to have borrowed their doc-trines from 
Zoroaster. The distinction of sex is a remark-able characteristic of the 
divs, and its evil results in a system of diabolic superstition may be read 
in the stories of the Ephialtae and Hyphialtae, or nightmare.
     Evidently the same in origin as the Persian dius; are the daivers of 
the Hindoos, who inhabit a world which is called, after them, Daiver-Logum.  
We may borrow a brief account of them from Kindersicy's Specimens of Hindon 
Literature.   " The daivers," he says, " per-petually recur in their 
romances, and other literary works, and are represented as possessing not 
only material bodies, but as being subject to human frailties. Those saints 
and heroes who may not as yet be considered worthy of the paradises of 
Shivven or of Veeshnoo, are represented as inhabiting the Daiver-Logum (or 
Sorgum). These daivers are in number no less than three hundred and thirty, 
millions. The principal are- 1..' Daivuntren ' or Indiren their king; to 
whom report is made of all that happens among them.  His court of audience 
is so capacious as to
contain not only the numerous daivers, but also the prophets, attendants, 
etc. They are represented in the mythological romances of the Hindoos, as 
having been engaged in bloody wars) and with various success against the 
giants (Assoores). The family of Daivuntren consists of his wife 
Inderaunee,' and his son ' Seedera-budderen' (born from a cow), who records 
the actions of men, by which they ave finally to he judged.  II. The 
attendants or companions of these daivers are-I. The 'Kinnarer,' who sing 
and play on musical instruments.  2. ' Dum-barim Nardir,' who also perform 
on a species of drum. 3. ' Kimprusher,' who wait on the daivers and are 
repre-sented with the wings and fair countenances of angels. 4. ' Kunda-
gaindoorer,' similar winged beings who execute the mandates of Veeshnoo.  5. 
' Paunner' a species of jugglers, who amuse the daivers with snake dancing, 
etc. 6. ‘Viddiaser,' their bards, who are acquainted with all arts and 
sciences, and entertain them with their histories and discourses.  7. ' 
Tsettee,' who attend them in their aerial journeys.  8. ' Kanuanader,' or ' 
Dovdanks,' mes-sengers, who conduct the votaries of Veeshnoo and Shivven to 
their respective paradises, and the wicked to hell (Narekah), of which ' 
Eemen' is sovereign.  III. The third class of daivergoel, daivers, or genii, 
are the eight keepers of the eight sides of the world, literally signified 
by their general name of ' Aushtatikcu-Pauligaur; they are-I. ' Indiren,' 
who is no other than Daivuntren, named above.  2.' Augne-Baugauven,' the god 
of fire.  3. 'Femen' king of death and the infernal regions.  4. ' Nerudee,' 
the element of earth represented under the figure of a giant. 5. Vaivoo,' 
god of air and winds.  6. ' Varoonen,' god of clouds and rain.  7. 
'Gooberen,' god of riches.  8. 'Es-saunien,' or Shivven himself, in one of 
his 1,008 appear-ances on earth." To these principal daivers, Kindersley 
adds without sufficient reason the ' Reeshees' of the Hin-doos, and their 
tutelary god of virtue, " Derma-Daive."
     For the true oriental doctrine of these evil genii the Zend-Avesta may 
be consulted, which associates the idea of evil more especially with the 
pens or female divs, con-trary to the later romances of Islamism. This 
anomaly reappears in our own fairy tales, the same characters, which at 
times, are invested with the most malignant attributes, being often 
described under forms of sylph-like grace and beauty.


Djemscheed, The Cup of  : A divination cup, which has been the subject of 
many of the poems and myths of ancient Persia.  It was believed to have been 
found while digging the foundations of Persepolis, filled with the elixir of 
im-mortality.  In this magical cup was mirrored the whole world, and 
everything, good and evil, was revealed therein. The Persians had great 
faith in these revelations; and attributed the prosperity of their empire to 
the possession of this famous cup.

Donn : Son of Midir the Proud; an Irish hero of medieval legend.  In the 
Colloquy of the Ancients we are told how Finn and Kelta and five other 
champions were out hunting one day, and followed a beautiful faun until it 
vanished under ground.  Seeking shelter in a noble mansion, they were 
entertained by Donn mac Midir and his brother; and their aid was asked 
against the rest of the Danaan folk.  It seems that thrice in the year they 
had to fight their fairy foes, and all their followers had been killed ex-
cepting the eight-and-twenty warriors themselves. The faun which they had 
followed had been an enchanted maiden sent to entice them.  After a year of 
successful fighting, the Danaans were obliged to make peace.

with Baron de Guldenstubbe in the attempt-successful only after six months 
of endeavour-to establish in France spiritualistic circles such as were bung 
formed at the time in America.  After a time they were successful in 
obtaining such manifestations as raps, the vibration of piano-chords, and 
direct writing.

Draconites : otherwise dentrites, draconius, or obsianus, is described by 
Albertus Magnus as a shining black stone of pyramidal figure.  It is not 
very easy to obtain, as it must be taken out of the head of a dragon, cut 
off while the beast is still panting.  It subdues all sorts of poison, and 
endows its possessor with invincible courage.  The kings of the East 
esteemed it a great treasure.

Dragon : A purely fabulous monster of enormous size, com-mon to almost all 
countries.  Descriptions of its appearance vary; but it appears to have been 
of a reptilian nature. often of a red or green colour, sometimes with 
several heads which vomited forth fire and vapours, and a large and clumsy 
tail.  It was of enormous strength; but the an-cients believed that it could 
be charmed by music, and the dragon which guarded the golden fleece was 
soothed by the voice of Medea.  In India at the time of Alexander the Great, 
a dragon was worshipped as a god; and in occult history it is the 
manifestation of hell. The dragon, how-ever, is best known in legendary 
history as the terrible monster, whose duty it was to provide the hero with 
op-portunities of valour, and in this capacity it has figured in many a 
tale. The legend of St. George and the Dragon is familiar to everyone, and 
also the dragon that was slain by Sir Lancelot, one of the knights of King 
Arthur's Round Table.  In Revelation the dragon, a representation of the 
Evil One, is overcome by the Archangel Michael.  On one side of the coin 
given to those who were cured of possession, about the time of Henry VII., 
there was portrayed an angel standing with both feet on a dragon. The idea 
of the dragon is perhaps evolved from the conception of the earth, as a 
living being, a notion which would gain currency from Earthquake and related 
phenomena.

Dreams : The occult significance of dreams was a matter of speculation among 
the wise at an early period in the history of civilisation.  In the articles 
upon Babylonia and Egypt we have to some extent outlined the methods by 
which the wise men of those countries divined the future from visions seen 
in sleep, and to these we must refer the reader, as well as to the articles 
dealing with other countries, savage and civilised, where he will discover a 
good deal of data relating to dreams and dream-lore.  In this place we can 
only indi-cate some of the more outstanding theories of antiquity regarding 
the nature and causes of dreams and the manner in which the ancient diviners 
generally interpreted them.
     Dreams were regarded as of two kinds-false and true, in either case 
emanating from a supernatural intelligence, evil or good.  By the ancients 
sleep was regarded as a second life, in which the soul was freed from the 
body and therefore much more active than during the waking state. The acts 
it observed and the scenes through which it passed were thought to have a 
bearing on the future life of the dreamer, but it is possible that the 
dream-life was regarded as supernatural and "inverted," and that the events 
which the bodiless spirit beheld were the opposites of those which would 
later occur on the earth-plane.  The idea thus originated that "dreams go by 
contraries," as both popular belief, and the many treatises upon the 
subject of nightly visions assure us is the case.
     However the belief in the divinatory character of dreams arose, there 
is every proof that their causes and nature exercised some of the greatest 
minds of antiquity.  Aris-totle believed them to arise solely from natural 
causes. Posidonius the Stoic was of the opinion that they were of three 
kinds, the first automatic, and coming from the clear sight of the soul, the 
second from spirits and the third from God.  Cratippus, Democritus, and 
Pythagoras held doctrines almost identical or differing only in detail, 
Later, Macrobus divided dreams into five kinds: the dream, the vision, the 
ocular dream, the insomnium and the phantasm.  The first is a figurative and 
mysterious representation which requires an interpretation ;  the second was 
an exact representation of a future event in sleep; the third was a dream 
representing some priest or divinity, who declared to the sleeper things to 
come; the fourth was an ordinary dream not deserving of atten-tion, and the 
fifth was a disturbed half-awake dream, a species of nightmare.  Other 
writers divide dreams into accidental dreams and those which were induced 
for the purposes of divination.  We are told by Herodotus that in the temple 
of Bel in Babylon a priestess lay on a bed ready to dream visions of the 
second class, and that the beds of such soothsayers were often made of the 
skin of a ram is well known.  The ancient Hebrews obtained such dreams by 
sleeping among tombs, and this especial gate-way to the supernatural world 
seems to have been, and still is known to the majority of nations, barbarous 
and the reverse, as intimately as hypnotic and other methods of reaching 
its, planes and hearing its pronouncements. Sleep was, of course, often 
induced by drugs. whether the soma of the Hindoos, the peyollotl of the 
ancient Mexicans, the haschish of the Arabs, or the opium of the Malays or 
Chinese, and these narcotics which have the property of inducing speedy 
sleep and of heightening inward vision were and are greatly prized by 
professional dreamers all over the world, especially as they rendered 
dreaming almost immediately possible.
     With .the nature of ecstatic vision we have dealt under the heading of 
Hypnotism and now that we have outlined the older theories regarding the 
cause and nature of dreams (for with the modern and purely physiological 
theories on the subject we have no concern in this place), we may pass on to 
consider the methods by which dreams were read or divined.  As has been 
remarked, this was generally under-taken by a special class of diviners, who 
in ancient Greece were known as Oneiocritikoi, or interpreters of dreams. 
The first treatise on the subject is that of Artemidorus, who lived in the 
time of Antoninus Pius.  He differentiates between the dreams of Kings and 
those of commoners, as he believes that the visions of royalty must have 
reference to the commonwealth and nut to the individual.  Dreams which 
represent something as happening to the individual who dreams them show that 
they have a personal signifi-cance, whereas if the dream relates to another 
it will concern him alone.  He details the numerous species of dreams 
throughout five hooks, and then adduces numerous exam-pies.  Neither for 
rule nor illustration have we any space here, and indeed, the literature, 
popular and otherwise, which treats of oneiromancy is so extensive and so 
readily accessible that no necessity arises for so doing.  Suffice it to say 
that the rules of Artemidorus are far from clear, and according to them, any 
dream might signify any event, and any interpretation of the same might be 
considered justifiable.  The method of testing dreams according to Amyraldus 
is his Discours sur les Songes divins (Saumur, 1625) is whether the 
instructions and advice that they contain make for good or ill-a test it is 
impossible to apply until after the result is known.  But Amyraldus 
surmounts this difficulty by proposing to test dreams by the evidence they 
show of divine knowledge-by asking oneself in short, whether the dream it 
was desired to examine gave any evidence of such things as God alone could 
know.  It would seem from an examination of such dreams as were submitted to 
the diviners of antiquity that the symbolism they exhibited was of a 
character so pro-found that it could only be unriddled by an interpreter who 
received divine aid, such as was afforded in the case of Moses or Daniel.  
It is plain, however, that the most far-fetched interpretations were given 
to many of the most epoch-making dreams of antiquity, and indeed, the oneio-
critical system is one of the weakest spots in the armour of occult science, 
and was the first of its departments to fall into disrepute and become the 
prey of the charlatan. There are not wanting serious students of the occult 
who doubt entirely the occult significance of dreams, and it must be granted 
that no good reason exists for classing them generally with the vision, or a 
condition of second sight or ecstasy.  See H. Hutchinson, Dreams and their 
Meanings, London, 1901   J. C. Colquohoun, Magic, Witchcraft and Animal 
Magnetism, London,  1851   H. Christmas, The Cradle of the Twin Giants, 
London, 1849, and many other popular and more advanced handbooks on the 
subject.

Dreams of Animals : It was believed by many that animals dreamed.  Pliny 
says: " Evident it is, that horses, dogs, kine, oxen, sheepe and goats, doe 
dreame.  Whereupon it is credibly also thought that all creatures that bring 
forth their young quicke and living, doe the same.  As for those that lay 
egges, it is not so certian that they dreame; but resolved it is that they 
doe sleepe."


Dress, Phantom : The question of the apparel worn by ap-paritions has of 
late years aroused considerable controversy. Says Mr. Podmore: "The 
apparition commonly consists simply of a figure. clothed as the percipient 
was accustomed to see the agent clothed  whereas to be true to life the 
phantasm would as a rule have to appear in bed.  In cases where the vision 
gives no information as to the agent's clothing and surroundings generally-
and, as already said, such cases form the great majority of the well 
attested narratives-we may suppose that what is transmitted is not any part 
of the superficial content of the agent's con-sciousness, but an impression 
from the underlying massive and permanent elements which represent his 
personal identity. The percipient's imagination is clearly com-petent to 
clothe such an impression with appropriate im-agery, must indeed so clothe 
it if it is to rise into conscious-ness at all."  " The ghosts, it will have 
been observed, always appear clothed.  Have clothes also ethereal coun-
terparts ? Such was and is the belief of many early races of mankind, who 
leave clothes, food, and weapons in the graves of the dead, or burn them on 
the funeral pile, that their friends may have all they require in the spirit 
world. But are we prepared to accept this view ? And again, these ghosts 
commonly appear, not in the clothes which they were wearing at death-for 
most deaths take place in bed-but in some others, as will he seen from an 
examination of the stories already cited  Are we to suppose the ethereal 
body going to its wardrobe to clothe its nakedness withal ? or that, as in 
the case of Ensign Cavalcante's appearance to Frau Reiken, the ghost will 
actually take off the ethereal clothes it wore at death and replace them 
with others ? It is scarcely necessary to pursue the subject. The diffi-
culties and contradictions involved in adapting it to ex-plain the clothes 
must prove fatal to the ghost theory."
     Mr. Thistleton Dyer says on the subject
     “It is the familiar dress worn in lifetime that is, in most cases, one 
of the distinguishing features of the ghost, and when Sir George Villiers 
wanted to give a warning to his son, the Duke of Buckingham, his spirit 
appeared to one of the Duke's servants ' in the very clothes he used to 
wear.  Mrs. Crowe, in her Night Side of Nature gave an account of an 
apparition which appeared at a house in Sarratt, Hertfordshire.  It was that 
of a well-dressed gentleman, in a blue coat and bright gilt buttons, but 
without a head.  It seems that this was reported to be the ghost of a poor 
man of that neighbourhood who had been murdered, and whose head had been cut 
off.  He could, therefore, only be recognised by his ' blue coat and bright 
gilt buttons.'  Indeed, many ghosts have been nicknamed from the kinds of 
dress in which they have been in the habit of appearing. Thus the ghost at 
Allan-bank was known as ' Pearlin Jean,' from a species of lace made of 
thread which she wore;  and the 'White Lady' at Ashley Hall-like other 
ghosts who have home the same name-from the white drapery in which she 
presented herself.  Some lady ghosts have been styled Silky,' from the 
rustling of their silken costume, in the wearing of which they have 
maintained the phantom grandeur of their earthly life. Their was the ' 
Silky' at Black Heddon who used to appear in silken attire, often-times ' 
rattling ill her silks '; and the spirit of Denton Hall--also termed ' Silky 
'-walks about in a white silk dress of antique fashion. This last ' Silky' 
was thought to be the ghost of a lady who was mistress to the profligate 
Duke of Argyll in the reign of William III., and died sud-denly, not without 
suspicion of murder, at Chirton, near Shields-one of his residences. The ' 
Banshee of Loch Nigdal,' too, was arrayed in a silk dress, green in colour. 
These traditions date from a period when silk was not in common use, and 
therefore attracted notice in country places.  Some years ago a ghost 
appeared at Hampton Court. habited in a black satin dress with white kid 
gloves. The White 'Lady of Skipsea’ makes her midnight sere-nades clothed in 
long, white drapery.  Lady Bothwell, who haunted the mansion of 
Woodhouselee, always ap-peared in white; and the apparition of the mansion 
of Houndwood, in Berwickshir - bearing the name of 
Chappie '-is clad in silk attire.
     “One of the ghosts seen at the celebrated Willington Mill was that of a 
female in greyish garments.  Sometimes she was said to be wrapped in a 
mantle, with her head depressed and her hands crossed on her lap. Walton 
Abbey had its headless lady who used to haunt a certain wainscotted chamber, 
dressed in blood-stained garments, with her infant in her arms; and, in 
short, most of the ghosts that have tenanted our country houses have been 
noted for their distinctive dress.
     “Daniel Defoe. in his Essay on the History and Reality of Apparitions, 
has given many minute details as to the dress of a ghost.  He tells a 
laughable and highly amusing story of come robbers who broke into a mansion 
in the country, and, while ransacking one of the rooms, they saw, in a 
chair, 'a grave, ancient man, with a long full-bottomed wig, and a rich, 
brocaded gown,' etc.  One of the robbers threatened to tear off his ' rich 
brocaded gown,' another hit at him with a firelock, and was alarmed at 
seeing it pass through the air ; and then the old man changed into the most 
horrible monster that ever was seen, with eyes like two fiery daggers red 
hot.' The same apparition encountered them in different rooms, and at last 
the servants, who were at the top of the house, throw-ing some ' hand 
grenades' down the chimneys of these rooms, the thieves were dispersed.  
Without adding fur-ther stories of this kind, which may be taken for what 
they are worth, it is a generally received belief in ghost lore that spirits 
are accustomed to appear in the dresses which they wore in their lifetime-a 
notion credited from the days of Pliny the Younger to the present day.
     “But the fact of ghosts appearing in earthly raiment has excited the 
ridicule of many philosophers, who, even admitting the possibility of a 
spiritual manifestation, deny that there can be the ghost of a suit of 
clothes.  George Cruikshank, too, who was no believer in ghosts, sums up the 
matter thus :  As it is clearly impossible for spirits to wear dresses made 
of the materials of earth, we should like to know if there are spiritual 
outfitting shops for the clothing of ghosts who pay visits on earth.'  
Whatever the objections may be to the appearance of ghosts in human attire, 
they have not hitherto overthrown the belief in their being seen thus 
clothed, and Byron, describing the Black Friar' who haunted the cloisters 
and other parts of Newstead Abbey, tells us that he was always arrayed In 
cowl, and beads, and dusky garb.
     Indeed, as Dr. Tylor remarks, ' It is an habitual feature of the ghost 
stories of the civilised, as of the savage world, that the ghost comes 
dressed, and even dressed in well-known clothing worn in life.'  And he adds 
that the doc-trine of object-souls is held by the Algonguin tribes, the 
islanders of the Fijian group, and the Karens of Burmah -it being supposed 
that not only men and beasts have souls, but inorganic things. Thus, 
Mariner, describing the Fijian belief, writes: ' If a stone or any other 
sup-stance is broken, immortality is equally its reward; nay, artificial 
bodies have equal good luck with men, and hogs, and yams.  If an axe or a 
chisel is worn out or broken up, away flies its soul for the service of the 
gods.  The Fijians can further show you a sort of natural well, or deep hole 
in the ground, at one of their islands, across the bottom of which runs a 
stream of water, in which you may clearly see the souls of men and women, 
beasts and plants, stocks and stones, canoes and horses, and of all the 
broken utensils of this frail world, swimming, or rather tumbling along, one 
over the other, pell-mell, into the regions of immor-tality.'  As it has 
been observed, animistic conceptions of this kind are no more irrational 
than the popular idea prevalent in civilised communities as to spirits 
appearing in all kinds of garments."

Drummer of Tedworth :  A poltergeist who haunted the house of Mr. John 
Mompesson, of Tedworth, Wilts, about the year 1661 and onwards.  In March of 
that year Mom-pesson had had a vagrant drummer brought before a justice of 
the peace, whereby his drum was confiscated. The instrument was taken to the 
house of Mompesson, during the latter's absence, and immediately a violent 
poltergeist disturbance broke out.  Apparitions were seen by members of the 
household, pieces of furniture were seen to move of themselves, small 
objects were flung about by invisible hands, the younger children were levi-
tated as they lay in their beds, and there was a continual sound of drumming 
every night. The drummer, under-stood to be the cause of the trouble, was 
transported, when peace once more reigned in the afflicted household; but 
ere long he managed to return, when the disturbances broke out with renewed 
vigour. There is no first-hand account of this poltergeist, save that of 
Joseph Glanvil-Sadducismus Triumphatus,  1668-and though Glanvil is our 
authority for the whole story, that part of it which he himself declares to 
have witnessed is certainly not the most marvellous, but describes 
scratchings and pantings heard in the vicinity of the children’s beds.


Du Potet: One of the original founders of spiritualism in France, and one of 
the first experimentalists in table-t-turning, either in that country or 
elsewhere.  (See France).


Du-Sith (Black Elf.) : A little man, believed to be of fairy origin, who 
killed Sir Lachlan Mor M'Clean at the battle of Trai-Gruinard, in Islay, 
Scotland, in the year 1598. The story runs that this little man offered his 
services to Sir James Macdonald, the opponent of Sir Lachlan; and that the 
latter's death was caused by an arrow which struck him on the head, and was 
afterwards found to be an Elf-bolt.  In reply to a question of Macdonald's 
the little man replied : " I am called Du-sith, and you were better to have 
me with you than against you."

Dual Personality : In every form of cerebral dissociation there is a 
disturbance of consciousness. Sometimes, and especially in the trance, there 
occurs what is known as "split consciousness," and the split may be so 
pronounced that the subject seems to have two or more distinct person-
alities. The secondary personality may differ from the primary in many ways, 
and possess entirely distinct intel-lectual and moral characteristics. The 
entranced sub-ject may allude to his normal consciousness in the third 
person, may criticise its opinions and attitude, or even express direct 
antagonism towards it. The secondary personality sometimes alternates with 
the primary in such a way as to suggest that two spirits are struggling to 
possess the same physical organisation.  Another peculiar-ity of this state 
is that whereas the normal consciousness generally knows nothing of the 
others, the secondary personalities have full knowledge of each other and of 
the normal conciousness. Dual personality is not confined to the trance 
state, but may arise spontaneously.  R. L. Stevenson makes effective use of 
it in his Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.


Duguid, David : A Glasgow painting medium who achieved considerable success 
in his line.  He was a cabinet-maker, who in 1866 found himself possessed of 
mediumistic facul-ties. At first an ordinary rapping medium, he speedily 
developed the power of painting in trance, even in the dark.  A still higher 
stage of mediumship was reached when direct drawings were produced in his 
presence. These drawings, generally copies of Dutch masters, purporting to 
be done by the original artists, are said not to have been without some 
merit, apart from the fact that they were done in complete darkness. The two 
principal con-trols were Ruysdael and Steen.  In 1869 control of the 
medium's organism was taken by Hafed, prince of Persia at the beginning of 
the Christian era, and Archmagus. Hafed related his many adventures througn 
Duguid mediumship in a series of sittings extending over some years.  A 
Persian of princely birth, he had borne arms in his country's defence.  
After extensive travels, he was admitted to the magi, and ultimately became 
Archmagus. He was of those who bore rich gifts to Bethlehem at the birth of 
Christ.  Finally he met his death in the arena at Rome. Hafed, Prince of 
Persia, was afterwards pub-lished in book form.  (See Spiritualism)


Duk-duk, The : Members of a secret society of New Pomer-ania, who are also 
called Spirits.


Dumbarin-Nardar :  One of the classes of attendants or companions of the 
Hindoo daivers, whose special duty it is to play upon a kind of drum.


Dupuis, Charles Francois : 1742-1809.  Charles Francois Dupuis was born at 
Trie le-Chateau, and educated by his father and afterwards at the College 
d'Harcourt. At the age of twenty-four he was made professor of rhetoric at 
Lisieux; but his inclination led him into the field of mathematics.  In his 
work, Origine de tous les Cultus he attempts to explain not only all the 
mysteries of antiquity, but also the origin of all religious beliefs.  In 
his Memoire explicatif du Zodiaque chronologique et mythologique (1806) he 
maintains a common origin for the astronomical and  religious opinions of 
the Greeks, Egyptians, Chinese, Persians, and Arabians.

Earth laid upon a Corpse : It is related in Pennant's Tour that it was the 
custom in the Highlands of Scotland to lay on the breast of the deceased a 
wooden platter con-taining a little earth and a little salt  - the former to 
sym-bolize the corruptibility of the body, the latter the incor-ruptibility 
of the soul.


Ebennozophim :  (See Astrology.) 

Eber Don : Chief of the Milesian invaders of Ireland.  Many of their ships 
were lost in a storm which the Danaans (q.v.) raised by magic.

Eblis, or Haris as he is also called : the " Satan" of the Mo-hammedans.  It 
is said that he was an inmate of Azazil, the heaven nearest God; and when 
the angels were com-manded to bow down to the first man, Eblis was the chief 
of those who rebelled. They were cast out of Azazil, and Eblis and his 
followers were sentenced to suffer in hell for a long time.  It is supposed 
that he was composed of the elements of fire  and that he succeeded the 
peris in the government of the world.


Ech-Uisque :  A Gaelic word meaning water-horse. The Ech-nisque was a goblin 
of Highland folk-lore, understood to be a favourite form assumed by the 
Kelpie, in order to lure souls to his master the Devil.  In the disguise of 
a fine steed, beautifully accoutred, the Kelpie grazed inno-cently by the 
wayside. The weary traveller, passing by, and believing this splendid animal 
to have strayed from his master, was tempted to make use of him to help him 
on his way  and the deceitful Kelpie, remaining quiet as a lamb until the 
traveller was fairly mounted. would then with a fiendish yell of triumph 
plunge headlong into an adjacent pool.  It was believed that the soul of the 
un-fortunate man, who had had no time to prepare for death, would thus be 
safely secured to the Evil One  while the Kelpie received the body in 
payment for his trouble.


Echo D'Outre Tombe (Journal) :  (See France.) 


Eckartshausen, K. Von :  Author of The Cloud on the Sanctuary (1800).  
Eckartshausen, by birth and education an intensely religious man, at first 
wrote several little books of devotion that had great vogue in France and 
Germany. He later turned his attention to larger works of a more profound 
character, such as that mentioned above.  Ac-cording to Eckartshausen the 
requisite faculty of true com-munion with the church is the inward 
conception of things spiritual and with this sense present, is possible the 
begin-ning of Regeneration understood as the process of gradually 
eliminating original sin.  His work on the Interior Church is in two parts  
first, elucidation of his doctrine  second, a series of dogmas or assertions 
derived therefrom.


Ectenic Force : A supposed physical force emanating from the person of the 
medium, and directed by his will, by means of which objects may be moved 
without contact in apparent defiance of natural laws. The existence of such 
a force was first postulated by Count Agenor de Gas-parin, to explain the 
phenomena of table-turning and rapping, and the name Ectenic Force was 
bestowed upon the supposed agency by de Gasparin's colleague, M. Thury. The 
experiments of Thury and de Gasparin are declared to offer some of the most 
convincing evidence that  spirit-ualism can produce, and have influenced 
more than one eminent student of psychic research.  If it be true that 
tables were moved without contact, then such a theory
is indeed necessary, but the evidence for this type of phe-nomena is not 
abundant.

Eel : The eel is credited with the possession of many mar-vellous virtues.  
If he is left to die out of the water, his body steeped in strong vinegar 
and the blood of a vulture, and the whole placed under a dunghill, the 
composition will raise from the dead anything brought to it, and will give 
it life as before.  It is also said that he who eats the still warm heart of 
an eel will be seized with the spirit of prophecy, and will predict things 
to come. The Egyptians worshipped the eel, which their priests alone had the 
right to eat. Magic eels were made in the eighteenth century of flour and 
the juice of mutton. There may be added a little anecdote told by William of 
Malmesbury.  A dean of the church of Elgin, in the county of Moray in 
Scotland, having refused to cede his church to some pious monks, was 
changed, with all his canons, into eels,  which  the  brother  cook  made 
into  a stew.


Egbo, The : or Esik, is a secret society of Calabar, near the Niger delta. 
The name means  tiger," and the society is divided into eleven grades, of 
which the first three are not open to slaves.  Members, as a rule, buy 
themselves into the higher grades in their turn, and the money thus obtained 
is shared amongst the Nyampa who form the inner circle. The king is 
president of the society under the title of Cyamba. Each grade has its 
special festival day, on which their Idem or spirit-master exercises 
complete control. Whenever an Egbo day is announced, slaves, women, and 
children take flight in all directions, as the ambassador of the Idem, armed 
with a heavy whip, goes through the village and lashes everyone whom he may 
encounter. The Idem is usually a hermit who lives in the distant bush-land, 
and when he appears it is in a fantastic guise of mats and branches, which 
covers him from head to foot, and with a black mask on his face. The 
principals of the order themselves are linked together by a garb of leaves 
so gath-ered up that they seem to move in a connected mass.
     The Order of Free Egbos, (says Froebenius) is said to have originated 
at the fairs which were held at a great palm-oil market in the interior, 
midway between Calabar and the Kamerun.  As the place became the scene of 
much disorder, while the European trade made it necessary for the 
maintenance of public credit that all engagements should be strictly carried 
out, this institution was formed as a sort of Hanseatic Union under the most 
influential traders, for the mutual safeguarding of their interests. Later 
it acquired the political character of a Vehmgericht or secret tribunal, by 
bringing within its sphere of action the whole police of the Calabars and 
the Kamerun. The kings always sought to secure for themselves the Grand-
mastership of the Order, since otherwise their authority would sink to a 
mere shadow.  European skippers have frequently found it to their advantage 
to be enrolled in the lower grades, in order thereby the more easily to 
recover their debts.  A member of the Egbo has the right to claim as his own 
property the slave of Isis debtor, wherever he may find him, merely by 
fastening a yellow strip to his dress or loincloth.  Even in the interior of 
the continent the standing of an Egbo is still respected and feared, and 
affords one a certain immunity from molestation, such as is absolutely 
needed for the extensive commercial specu-lations in Africa.
     In the Kamerun, as a preliminary to their acceptance into the Free 
Egbos, the young men are sent for a protracted period to the Mokokos, a bush 
tribe in the interior; with these they live naked in the fields, and only 
now and then dart out, clad in green leaves, to have a bath in the river. 
All women, and especially slaves, are prohibited, under heavy penalties, 
from approaching the forest where they reside.  In the Kamerun, it is 
customary to pay particular honour to a visitor, above all if he be a 
European, by in-troducing the Egbo goat, which the people are otherwise 
seldom allowed to set eyes upon.
Holman reports that the whole of the Old Calabar district is subject to the 
rule of the so-called Egbo laws. These are promulgated at a secret Council, 
the Egbo As-sembly, which is held in the ' Palaver-house ' erected for this 
special purpose.  In virtue of his sovereign rights, the head-chief 
presides, under the title of Cyamab, over this assembly. Amongst the members 
of the Egie there are different ranks, which must be acquired in their due 
order, one after the other.  Holman quotes Englishmen who state that 
Europeans have bought themselves into the Egbo, and even into the Yampai, in 
order to be thus better able to get in their money.  He gives the following 
as the names and prices of the different grades of Egbo:
	1	Abungo	..	..	..	..          125 bars
	2	Aboko	.	..	..	..          75 bars
	3	Makairo	..	..	..	..          400 copper bars
	4	Bakimboko	..	..	..          100 bars
	5	Yampaic	..	..	..          850 copper bars
	"To these must be added rum, clothes, membo, etc.
The Yampai is the only grade whose members are allowed to sit in Council. 
The sums paid for the various titles of the Egbo are distributed exclusively 
amongst the Yampai, who, however, are not limited to a single share, since 
every Yampai can multiply his title as often as he can purchase shares, and 
these give him a claim to the receipt of the corresponding quotas from the 
profits of the whole institution."


Egg, Orphean  :  The cosmic doctrine of the Greek sage Orpheus.  He says:  ' 
God, the uncreated and incom-prehensible Being, created all things ; the 
ether proceeded from him; from this the unshapely chaos and the dark night 
arose, which at first covered all things. The un-shapen mass was formed into 
the shape of n egg, from which all things have proceeded."  The whole 
universe has the form of an egg, and everything in it strives to attain the 
same form. The Orphean theory has something in common with the doctrines of 
the magnetic philosophers.


Eglamour of Artoys, Sir : A magical English legend of French origin. The 
poem tells of the winning of Christa-bell by Eglamour.  Christabell's father 
will agree to the union if Eglamour will fulfil three tasks.  He must 
conquer the giant, Sir Maroke; bring from a distant land the head of an 
enormous boar, and kill a powerful dragon which has been devastating the 
country round Rome.  In these adventures he is successful, but is kept in 
Rome by illness. Meantime, Christabell has given birth to a son, and is 
banished by her angry father.  Her son is stolen from her by a griffin, and 
taken to Israel, where he is adopted by the king and named Degrabell.  Many 
years afterwards, Sir Eglamour and Degramour meet in a tournament for the 
hand of Cliristabell. The former is successful, and eventually their 
identities are revealed.  Eglamour and Christabell are married, and return 
to their native country with their son.


Eglinton, Wililam : A well known English medium, who in 1876 succeeded Slade 
as the principal exponent of slate-writing (q.v.)  That Eglinton's 
performances in this direction were very skillfully carried out there is 
abundant evidence, for several practised conjurers, as well as many other 
investigators, were entirely at a loss to explain the modus operandi.  Yet 
on one occasion, at least, Eglinton was seen-by Professor Lewis Cargill-to 
write the" spirit messages himself. This was in 1886, when his slate-writing 
was attracting attention.  Some ten years earlier, when he was giving 
materialisation seances, there were dis-covered in his portmanteau a false 
beard and some muslin draperies, which were found to correspond with 
fragments cut from the hair and garments of the materialised spirit. Nor 
were these the only occasions on which he made use of fraudulent means of 
producing mediumistic phenomena. It may be objected that Eglinton was " 
controlled " to procure draperies and fake hair, but it necessarily casts a 
dark shadow on his mediumship.


Egypt : To the peoples of antiquity as well as to those of the modern world, 
Egypt appeared as the very mother of magic. The reason for this widespread 
belief is not far to seek. In Egypt the peoples of the ancient world found a 
magical system much more highly developed than anything within their native 
knowledge, and again the cult of the dead with which Egyptian religion was 
so deeply imbued, appeared to the stranger to savour strongly of magical 
practice.  It must be borne in mind that, if the matter of the magical 
papyri be omitted, the notices which we possess of Egyptian magic are almost 
wholly foreign, so that it is wiser for a proper understanding of Egyptian 
occultism to derive our facts concerning it from the original native sources 
as far as is possible.  Like all other systems, the magic of the Egyptians 
was of two kinds, that which was supposed to benefit either the living or 
the dead, and that which has been known throughout the ages as  black" magic 
or necromancy.
     The contents of the Westcar Papyrus show that as early as the fourth 
dynasty, the working of magic was a recog-nised art in Egypt, but in reality 
we must place the begin-nings of Egyptian magical practice in neolithic 
times. Throughout the centuries magical practice varied con-siderably, but 
the principal means for its working remained the same. That is to say, the 
Egyptians relied for magical effect upon amulets, magical figures, pictures, 
and formulae, magical names and ceremonies, and the general apparatus of the 
occult sciences.
     The objects for which magic was exercised were numerous. It exorcised 
storms, protected against wild beasts, poison, disease, wounds, and the 
ghosts of the dead.  One of the most potent methods of guarding against 
misfortune of any kind was the use of Amulets.  It must not be assumed that 
all ornaments or objects discovered on the mummy are of magical potency. 
These are frequently the possession of the Ra or double (q.v.), necessary to 
its comfort in a future existence. The small crowns, sceptres, and emblems 
of Osiris, usually executed in faience, are placed inside the dead person in 
order that he may wear them when he becomes one with Osiris, and therefore a 
king. The scarab, fashioned in the likeness of a scarabaeus beetle, 
symbolised resurrection. The dad symbolised the human skeleton, and, 
therefore, perhaps, the dead and dismem-bered Osiris.  It has an influence 
on the restoration of the deceased. The uza, or eye, signifies the health 
necessary to the dead man's soul. The so-called "palettes" at one time 
supposed to have been employed for the mixing of paint, are now known to 
have been amulets inscribed with words of power placed on the breasts of the 
dead in neo-lithic times.  The amulet of the menat was worn, or held, with 
the sistrum by gods, kings, and priests, and was supposed to bring joy and 
health to the wearer.  It repre-sented the vigour of the two sexes.
     Spells.-The simplest type of spell in use in Egypt, was that in which 
the exorcist threatens the evil principle, or assures it that he can injure 
it.  Generally, however, the magician requests the assistance of the gods, 
or he may pretend to that which he desires to exorcise that he is a god.  
Invocations, when written, were usually accom-panied by a note to the effect 
that the formula had once been employed successfully by a god-perhaps by a 
deified priest.  An incomprehensible and mysterious jargon was employed, 
which was supposed to conceal the name of a certain deity who was thus 
compelled to do the will of the sorcerer. These gods were almost always 
those of foreign nations, and the invocations themselves appear to be 
attempts at various foreign idioms, employed, perhaps, as sounding more 
mysterious than the native speech. Great stress was laid upon the proper 
pronunciation of these names, and failure in all cases was held to lie at 
the door of mispronunciation. The Book of the Dead (q.v.) contains many such 
"words of power," and these were intended to assist the journey of the dead 
in the under-world of Amenti.  It was believed that all supernatural beings, 
good and evil, possessed hidden names, which if a man knew, he could compel 
them to do his will. The name, indeed, was as much part of a man as his body 
or soul. The traveller through Amenti must tell not only the divine gods 
their names, but must prove that he knew the names of a number of the 
supposedly inanimate objects in the dreary Egyptian Hades, if he desired to 
make any progress. (See Gnostics and Names Magical.)
     Magical Books.-Many magical books existed in Egypt which contained 
spells and other formulae for exorcism and necromantic practice. Thus 
Medical Papyri in the Leipsic collection contain formulae spoken whilst 
preparing drugs ; the Ebers Papyrus contains such spells; the Harris Magical 
Papyrus, dating from the New Kingdom, and edited by Chabas, contains spells 
against crocodiles. The priestly Caste, who compiled those necromantic 
works, was known as Kerheb, or "scribes of the divine writings," and even 
the sons of Pharaohs did not disdain to enter their ranks.
     The Ritual of Egyptian Magic.  In many instances the ritual of Egyptian 
magic possesses strong similarities to the ceremonial of other systems and 
countries. Wax figures were employed in lieu of the bodies of persons to be 
bewitched or harmed and models of all kinds were utilised in order that the 
physical force directed against them might react upon the persons or animals 
it was de-sired to injure.  But the principal rite in which ceremonial magic 
was employed was the very elaborate one of mum-mification.  As each bandage 
was laid in its exact position certain words of power were uttered which 
were supposed to be efficacious in the preservation of the part swathed. 
After evisceration, the priest uttered an invocation to the deceased, and 
then took a vase of liquid containing ten perfumes, with which he smeared 
the body twice from head to foot, taking especial care to anoint the head 
thoroughly.  The internal organs were then placed on the body, and the 
backbone immersed in holy oil, supposed to be an emanation from the gods Shu 
and Seb. Certain precious stones were then laid on the mummy, each of which 
had its magical significance.  Thus crystal lightened his face, and 
cornelian strengthened his steps.  A priest who personified the jackal-
headed god, Anubis, then  ad-vanced, performed certain symbolical ceremonies 
on the head of the mummy, and laid certain bandages upon it. After a further 
anointing with oil the deceased was declared to have "received his head."  
The mummy's left hand was filled with thirty-six substances used in 
embalming, symbolic of the thirty-six forms of the god Osiris. The body was 
then rubbed with holy oil, the toes wrapped in linen, and after an 
appropriate address the ceremony was completed.
     Dreams. The art of procuring dreams and their inter-pretation was much 
practised in Egypt.  As instances of dreams recorded in Egyptian texts may 
be quoted those of Thothmes IV. (B.C. 1450) and Nut-Amen, King of Egypt 
(B.C. 670).  The Egyptian magician procured dreams for his clients by 
drawing magical pictures and the recita-tion of magical words. The following 
formulae for pr6-ducing a dream is taken from British Museum Papyrus, 
No.122, lines 64 fi. and 359 ff.
     "To obtain a vision from the god Bes : Make a drawing of Besa, as shewn 
below, on your left hand, and envelope your hand in a strip of black cloth 
that has been consecrated to Isis and lie down to sleep without speaking a 
word, even in answer to a question.  Wind the remainder of the cloth round 
your neck.  The ink with which you write must be composed of the blood of a 
cow, the blood of a white dove, fresh frankincense, myrrh, black writing 
ink, cin-nabar, mulberry juice, rain-water, and the juice of worm-wood and 
vetch.  With this write your petition before the setting sun, saying, ' Send 
the truthful seer out of the holy shrine, I beseech thee, Lampsuer, Sumarta, 
Baribas, Dardalam, Iorlex: O Lord send the sacred deity Anuth, Anuth, 
Salbana, Chambre, Breith, now, now, quickly, quickly.  Come in this very 
night.'"
     "To procure dreams: Take a clean linen bag and write upon it the names 
given below.  Fold it up and make it into a lamp-wick, and set it alight, 
pouring pure oil over it.  The word to be written is this : ' Armiuth, 
Lailam-chouch, Arsenophrephren, Phtha, Archentechtha.' Then in the evening, 
when you are going to bed, which you must do without touching food (or, pure 
from all defilement), do thus : Approach the lamp and repeat seven times the 
formula given below: then extinguish it and he down to sleep. The formula is 
this:   Sachmu . . . . epaema Ligotereench: the Aeon, the Thunderer, Thou 
that hast swallowed the snake and dost exhaust the moon, and dost raise up 
the orb of the sun in his season, Chthetho is the name; I require, O lords 
of the gods, Seth, Chreps, give me the information that I desire;'
     Medical Magic. Magic played a great part in Egyptian medicine.  On this 
point Weidemann says: "The Egyp-tians were not great physicians : their 
methods were purely empirical and their remedies of very doubtful value, but 
the riskiness of their practice arose chiefly from their utter inability to 
diagnose because of their ignorance of anatomy. That the popular respect for 
the human body was great we may gather from the fact that the Paraskhistai 
who opened the body for embalmment were persecuted and stoned as having 
committed a sinful although necessary deed. The prescribed operations in 
preparing a body for embalmment were never departed from, and taught but 
little anatomy, so that until Greek times the Egyptians had only the most 
imperfect and inaccurate ideas of the human organism.  They understood 
nothing about most internal diseases, and especially nothing about diseases 
of the brain, never suspecting them to be the result of organic changes, but 
assuming them to be caused by demons who had entered into the sick.  Under 
these circumstances medicines might be used to cause the disappearance of 
the symptoms, but the cure was the expulsion of the demon.  Hence the 
Egyptian physician must also practise magic.
     “According to late accounts, his functions were com-paratively simple, 
for the human body had been divided into thirty-six parts, each presided 
over by a certain demon, and it sufficed to invoke the demon of the part 
affected in order to bring about its cure - a view of matters funda-mentally 
Egyptian.  In the Book of the Dead we find that different divinities were 
responsible for the well-being of the bodies of the blessed; thus Nu had 
charge of the hair, Ra of the face, Hathor of the eyes, Apuat of the ears, 
Anubis of the lips, while Thoth was  guardian of all parts of the body 
together. This doctrine was subsequently applied to the living body. with 
the difference that for the great gods named in the Book of the Dead there 
were substituted as gods of healing the presiding deities of the thirty-six 
decani, the thirty-six divisions of the Egyptian zodiac, as we learn from 
the names given to them by Celsus and preserved by Origen.  In earlier times 
it was not so easy to be determined which god was to be invoked, for the 
selection depended not only on the part affected but also on the illness and 
symptoms and remedies to be used, etc.
     "Several Egyptian medical papyri which have come down to us contain 
formulas to be spoken against the demons of disease as well as prescriptions 
for the remedies to be used in specified cases of illness.  In papyri of 
older date these conjurations are comparatively rare, but the further the 
art of medicine advanced, or rather receded, the more numerous they became."
     “It was not always enough to speak the formulas once even their 
repeated recitation might not be successful, and in that case recourse must 
be had to other expedients: secret passes were made, various rites were 
performed, the formulas were written upon papyrus, which the sick person had 
to swallow, etc., etc.  But amulets were in general found to be most 
efficacious, and the personal intervention of a god called up, if necessary, 
by prayers or sorcery."
     Magical Figures.  As has been said the Egyptians be-lieved that it was 
possible to transmit to the figure of any person or animal the soul of the 
being which it represented. In the Westcar Papyrus we read how a soldier who 
had fallen in love with a governor's wife was swallowed by a crocodile when 
bathing, the saurian being a magical re-plica of a waxen one made by the 
lady's husband.  In the official account of a conspiracy against Rameses 
III. (ca B.C. 1200) the conspirators obtained access to a magical papyrus in 
the royal library and employed its instructions against the king with 
disastrous effects to themselves. These, too, made waxen figures of gods and 
of the king for the purpose of slaying the latter.
Astrology  The Egyptians were fatalists, and believed that a man's destiny 
was decided before he was born. The people therefore had recourse to 
astrologers.  Says Budge
     “In magical papyri we are often told not to perform cer-tain magical 
ceremonies on such apd such days, the idea being that on these days hostile 
powers will make them to be powerless, and that gods mightier than those to 
which the petitioner would appeal will be in the ascendant. There have come 
down to us fortunately, papyri containing copies of the Egyptian calendar, 
in which each third of every day for three hundred and sixty days of the 
year is marked lucky or unlucky, and we know from other papyri why certain 
days were lucky or unlucky, and why others were only partly so."  " From the 
life of Alexander the Great by Pseudo-Callisthenes we learn that the 
Egyptians were skilled in the art of casting nativities, and that knowing 
the exact moment of the birth of a man they proceeded to construct his 
horoscope.  Nectanebus employed for the purpose a tablet made of gold and 
silver and acacia wood, to which were fitted three belts.  Upon the outer 
belt was Zeus with the thirty-six decani surrounding him; upon the second 
the twelve signs of the Zodiac were represented ; and upon the third the sun 
and moon.  He set the tablet upon a tripod, and then emptied out of a small 
box upon it models of the seven stars that were in the belts, and put into 
the middle belt eight precious stones ; these he arranged in the places 
wherein he supposed the planets which they represented would be at the time 
of the birth of Olympias, and then told her fortune from them.  But the use 
of the horoscope is much older than the time of Alexander the Great, for to 
a Greek horoscope in the British Museum is attached 'an introductory letter 
from some master of the art of astrology to his pupil, named Hermon, urging 
him to be very exact and careful in his application of the laws which the 
ancient Egyptians, with their labori-ous devotion to the art, had discovered 
and handed down to posterity.' Thus we have good reason for assigning the 
birthplace of the horoscope to Egypt.  In connection with the horoscope must 
be mentioned the "sphere "or" table " of Democritus as a means of making 
predictions as to life and death.  In a magical papyrus we are told to 
'ascertain in what month the sick man took to his bed, and the name he 
received at his birth.  Calcu-late the course of the moon, and see how many 
periods of thirty days have elapsed; then note in the table the number of 
days left over, and if the number comes in the upper part of the table, he 
will live, but if in the lower part he will die.'
     Ghosts. The conception that the ha or double of man wandered about 
after death, greatly assisted the Egyptian belief in ghosts.
     "According to them a man consisted of a physical body, a shadow, a 
double, a soul, a heart, a spirit called the khu, a power, a name, and a 
spiritual body.  When the body died the shadow departed from it, and could 
only be brought back to it by the performance of a mystical ceremony; the 
double lived in the tomb with the body, and was there visited by the soul 
whose habitation was in heaven. The soul was, from one aspect, a material 
thing, and like the ha, or double, was believed to partake of the funeral 
offer-ings which were brought to the tomb; one of the chief objects of 
sepulchral offerings of meat and drink was to keep the double in the tomb 
and to do away with the ne-cessity of its wandering about outside the tomb 
in search of food.  It is clear from many texts that, unless the double was 
supplied with sufficient food, it would wander forth from the tomb and eat 
any kind of offal and drink any kind of dirty water which it might find in 
its path.  But besides the shadow, and the double, and the soul, the spirit 
of the deceased, which usually had its abode in heaven, was sometimes to be 
found in the tomb.  There is, how-ever, good reason for stating that the 
immortal part of man which lived in the tomb and had its special abode in 
the statue of the deceased was the 'double.' This is proved by the fact that 
a special part of the tomb was reserved for the ha, or double, which was 
called the ' house of the ha,' and that a priest, called the priest of the 
ha, was specially appointed to minister therein."
     Esoteric Knowledge of the' Priesthood. The esoteric know-ledge of the 
Egyptian priesthood is now believed to have been of the description with 
which the Indian medicine man is credited plus a philosophy akin to that of 
ancient India.  Says Davenport Adams:
     "To impose upon the common people, the priesthood professed to lead 
lives of peculiar sanctity. They despised the outer senses, as sources of 
evil and temptation. They kept themselves apart from the profanium vulgus, 
'and,' says lamblicus, 'occupied themselves only with the know-ledge of God, 
of themselves, and of wisdom ; they desired no vain honours in their sacred 
practice, and never yielded to the influence of the imagination.' Therefore 
they formed a world within a world, fenced round by a singular awe and 
wonder, apparently abstracted from the things of earth, and devoted to the 
constant contemplation of divine mysteries.  They admitted few strangers 
into their order, and wrapt up their doctrines in a hieroglyphical language, 
which was only intelligible to the initiated.  To these various precautions 
was added the solemnity of a terrible  oath, whose breach was invariably 
punished with death."
     “The Egyptian priests preserved the remaining relics of the former 
wisdom of nature. These were not imparted as the sciences are, in our age, 
but to all appearances they were neither learned nor taught ; but as a 
reflection of the old revelations of nature, the perception must arise like 
an inspiration in the scholar's mind.  From this cause appear to have arisen 
those numerous preparations and purifications the severity of which deterred 
many from initiation into the Egyptian priesthood  in fact, not in-
frequently resulted in the scholar's death.  Long fasting, and the greatest 
abstinence, appear to have been particu-larly necessary : besides this, the 
body was rendered in-sensible through great exertions, and even through 
voluntarily inflicted pain, and therefore open to the in-fluence of the 
mind. The imagination was excited by representations of the mysteries ; and 
the inner sense was more impressed by the whole' than-as is the case with 
us-instructed by an explanation of simple facts. In this manner the dead 
body of science was not given over to the initiated, and left to chance 
whether it would become animated or not, but the living soul of wisdom was 
breathed into them.
     “From this fact, that the contents of the mysteries were rather 
revealed than taught-were received more from inward inspiration and mental 
intoxication, than outwardly through endless teaching, it was necessary to 
conceal them from the mass of the people. 
     So says Schubert, dealing with the same subject : The way to every 
innovation was closed, and outward know-ledge and science could certainly 
not rise to a high degree of external perfection ; but that rude sensuality, 
inclina-tion for change and variety, was suppressed as the chief source of 
all bodily and spiritual vices. is clear, as well as that here, as in India, 
an ascetic and contemplative life was recommended.
    “They imparted their secret and divine sciences to no one who did not 
belong to their caste, and it was long im-possible for foreigners to learn 
anything; it was only in later times that a few strangers were permitted to 
enter the initiation after many severe preparations and trials. Besides 
this, their functions were hereditary, and the son followed the footsteps of 
his father."
     “Concerning that which passed within the temples, and of the manner in 
which the sick were treated, we have but fragmentary accounts; for to the 
uninitiated the entrance was forbidden, and the initiated kept their vows. 
Even the Greeks, who were admitted to the temples, have been silent 
concerning the secrets, and have only here and there betrayed portions.  
Jablonski says, ' that but few chosen priests were admitted into the 
sanctum, and that admission was scarcely ever permitted to strangers even 
under the severest regulations.'"
    “Dealing with the subject of hypnotism in Egypt, Mont-faucon says..   
Magnetism was daily practised in the temples of Isis, of Osiris, and 
Serapis.  In these temples the priests treated the sick and cured them, 
either by mag-netic manipulation, or by other means producing som-
nambulism." Presenting a painting of a mesmeric scene, he says :  Before a 
bed or table, on which be the sick, stands a person in a brown garment, and 
with open eyes, and the dog's head of Anubis.  His countenance is turned 
towards the sick person ; his left hand is placed on the breast, and the 
right is raised over the head of his patient, quite in the position of a 
magnetiser.

Elder : As an Amulet. Blockwick recommends as a charm against erysipelas an  
“elder on which the sun never shined." “If the piece betwixt the two knots 
be hung about the patient's neck. it is much commended.  Some cut it in 
little pieces, and sew it in a knot, in a piece of. a man's shirt, which 
seems superstitious."


Elder Tree : The elder had wonderful influence as a protection against evil.  
Wherever it grew, witches were powerless.. In this country, gardens were 
protected by having elder trees planted at the entrance, and sometimes 
hedges of this plant were trained round the garden. There are very few old 
gardens in country places in which are not still seen remains of the 
protecting elder tree.  " In my boy-hood" says Napier,  I remember that my 
brothers, sisters, and myself were warned against breaking a twig or branch 
from the elder hedge which surrounded my grandfather's garden.  We were told 
at the time as a reason for this prohibition, that it was poisonous ; but we 
discovered afterwards that there was another reason, viz., that it was 
unlucky to break off even a small twig from a bourtree bush."  In some parts 
of the Continent this superstition feeling is so strong that, before pruning 
it, the gardener says :   Elder, elder, may I cut thy branches ? " If no 
response be heard, it is considered that assent has been given and then, 
after spitting three times, the pruner be-gins his cutting.  According to 
Montanus, elder wood formed a portion of the fuel used ill the burning of 
human bodies as a protection against evil influences ;  and, the drivers of 
hearses had their whip handles made of elder wood for a similar reason.  In 
some parts of Scotland, people would not put a piece of elder wood into the 
fire, and Napier says  Pieces of this wood lying about unused when the 
neighbourhood was in great straits for firewood but none would use it, and 
when asked why ? the answer was:   We don't know, but folks say it is not 
lucky to burn the bourtree."  It was believed that children laid in a cradle 
made wholly or in part of elderwood, would not sleep well, and were in 
danger of falling out of the cradle.  Elder berries gathered on St. John's 
Eve, would prevent the possessor suffering from witchcraft, and often 
bestowed upon him magical powers.  If the elder were planted in the form of 
a cross upon a new-made grave, and if it bloomed, it was a sure sign that 
the soul of the dead person was happy.

Electric Girls : Girls in whose presence certain phenomena occurred, similar 
in nature to the time-honoured phenomena of the poltergeist (q.v.), but 
ascribed to the action of some new physical force, probably electricity. The 
best known of these electric girls was perhaps Angelique Cottin, a Nor-mandy 
peasant girl, whose' phenomena were first observed about 1846.  Finally she 
was taken to Paris and placed under the observation of Dr. Tanchon and 
others, who testified to the actuality of the phenomena. These in-cluded the 
movement of objects without contact, or at a mere touch from Angelique's 
petticoats, the agitation in her presence of the magnetic needle, and the 
blowing of a cold wind.  She was also able to distinguish between the poles 
of a magnet at a touch.  A commission appointed by the Academy of Sciences, 
however, could observe no-thing but the violent movements of her chair, 
which were probably caused by muscular force.  Other electric girls 
practised about the' same time', and even after the' begin-ding of the' 
spiritualistic movement in America they were occasionally heard of. They 
are' worthy of note' as a link between the poltergeist and the 
spiritualistic medium.


Electrobiology : A mode of producing hypnotism by looking steadily at 
metallic discs. The process was discovered about the' middle' of last 
century, and its fame spread by numerous lecturers in England and America.


Electrum : Amber is the' subject of some' curious legends under this name, 
but there' is also a metallic electrum, known to the French in modern time's 
as Orbas.  A cup of this metal, according to Pliny, has the' property of 
discovering poison, by exhibiting certain semi-circle's like' rainbows in 
the liquor, which it also keeps sparkling and hissing as if on the' fire.  A 
black species of electrum or amber is the' proper gargates of Pliny, and 
the' jet of the present day. The' occult virtues of electrum are of the' 
tell-tale character.


Elementary Spirits : The unseen intelligences who inhabit the' four 
elements, of the finest essence of which they are composed. The creatures of 
the air are called sylphs; of the earth gnomes; of fire salamanders; and of 
water, nymphs or undines. The best authority on the subject is the Abbe de' 
Villars, who published early in the' eighteenth century a short treatise' 
entitled Comte de Gabalis, from which a good deal of what follows is drawn.  
According to this work the creatures of the elements were' before' the Fall 
subject to Adam in all things, and we arc led to under-stand that by means 
of certain performances this ancient communication may be' restored, and 
that man may once' more' have at his beck and call the' elementary spirits. 
The' Abbe give's a brief sketch of the nature' of these' peoples. The' air, 
he' says, is filled with a great number of beings of human form, somewhat 
fierce' in appearance, but really of a docile' nature. They are much 
interested in the sciences, and are subtle, officious towards the' sages, 
hostile' toward"' the foolish and the ignorant. Their wives and daughters 
are of a masculine type of beauty, such as is depicted in the Amazons.  The 
seas and rivers are' in-habited as well as the' air, beings dwelling therein 
whom the' sage's designated undine's, or nymphs.  The female' population 
much exceeds the' male', the women being ex-ceedingly beautiful, so that 
among the' daughters of men there' is none to equal them. The earth is 
filled almost to the centre' with gnome's, people' of small stature', the' 
guardians of subterranean treasure, minerals and precious stone's. They are 
ingenious, friendly towards men, and easy to command. They provide' the' 
children of the' sage's with all the money they require, asking no other 
reward for their services than the glory of performing them. The gnomides, 
their wives, are small of stature' but very good-looking, and they dress 
very curiously.  As for the sala-manders, the' inhabitants of the' region of 
fire', they serve' the' philosophers, but are' not over-anxious for their 
com-pany, while their daughters and wives are' rarely seen. Their women are' 
very beautiful, beyond all the other elementals, since they dwell in a purer 
element. Their habits, mode of life, manners and laws are' admirable', and 
the attractions of their minds are greater even than that of their persons. 
The' Supreme Being they know and religiously adore', but have' no hope of 
eternal enjoyment of Him, since their souls are mortal. True' it is that, 
being composed of the' purest parts of the' elements wherein they dwell, and 
having no contrary qualities, they can live' for several centuries; yet are' 
they much troubled because' of their mortal nature.  It was, however, 
revealed to the' philosophers that an elementary spirit could attain to im-
mortality by being united in marriage' with a human being. The' children 
born of such unions are' more' noble' and heroic than the' children of human 
men and women, and some of the greatest figures of antiquity-Zoroaster, 
Alexander, Hercules, Merlin, to mention a few-are' declared to have been the 
children of elementary spirits.
     The salamanders, the Comte de Gabalis goes on to say, are composed of 
the' most subtle' particles of the' sphere of fire, conglobated and 
organised by the action of the' Universal Fire', so called because' it is 
the' principle of all the motions of nature'. The sylphs are' composed of 
the purest atoms of the air; the' nymphs, of the' most delicate particle's 
of water; and the' gnomes, of the' finest essence of earth.  Adam was in 
complete' accord with these' crea-tures because', being composed of that 
which was purest in the' four elements, he' contained in himself the' 
perfections of these' four people's, and was their natural king.  But since 
by reason of his sin he' had been cast into the' excre-ments of the' 
elements, there' no longer existed the' harmony between him, so impure' and 
gross, and these' fine' and ethereal substance's. The' Abbe then gives a 
recipe whereby the' resultant state of things may be' remedied and the' 
ancient correspondence' restored. To attain this end we must purify and 
exalt the element of fire which is within us.  All that is necessary is to 
concentrate' the' fire' of the' world by means of concave' mirrors, in a 
globe' of glass. There' will then be formed within the globe' a solary 
powder, which, having purified itself from the admixture' of other elements, 
becomes in a very short time a sovereign means of exalting the' fire' which 
is in us, and makes us, so to speak, of an igneous nature'. Thenceforward 
these' creatures of the' fire' become' our inferiors, and, delighted at the' 
restora-tion of mutual harmony between themselves and the human race', they 
will show towards man all the' good-will they have' for their own kind.  
Sylphs, gnome's, and nymphs are' more familiar with man than are' the 
salamanders, on account of their shorter term of life', and it is therefore' 
easier to get into touch with them. To accomplish the' restoration of our 
empire' over the sylphs, gnome's, or nymphs, we must close' a glass full of 
air, earth, or water, and expose' it to the sun for a month, at the end of 
which period its various elements must be' separated according to science'. 
This process is most easy in this case of water and earth. "Thus," says the' 
Comte "without characters, without ceremonies, without barbarous words, it 
is possible to rule' absolutely over these peoples."  Other authorities pre-
scribe' other means of obtaining dominion over the' spirits of the' 
elements.  Eliphas Levi, for instance, state's that anyone' desirous of 
subjugating' the elementals must first perform the' four trials of antique' 
initiation; but as the' original trials are no longer known similar ones 
must be' substituted. Thus he who would control the' sylphs must walk 
fearlessly on the' edge of a precipice', he who would win the service' of 
the salamanders must take his stand in a burning building, and so on, the' 
point of the ordeals being that the' man should show himself unafraid of the 
elements whose' inhabitants he' desires to rule'.  In mediae-val times the 
evocation and exorcism of elementary spirits was much practised, the' 
crystal being a favourite means of evoking them. The' exorcism of earth is 
performed by means of breathing, sprinkling of water, and burning of 
incense', and the' repetition of a formula of prayer to the' gnomes. Air is 
exorcised by breathing towards the four cardinal points, and by the' recital 
of prayers to the air-spirits (sylphs). The' casting of salt, incense, 
sulphur, camphor, and white' resin into a fire is declared efficacious in 
the' exorcism of that element.  In the case of water, breathing and laying 
on of hands, repetition of formulae, mixing of salt and ashes of incense', 
and other ceremonials are' to be observed.  In every instance' a special 
consecra-tion of the four elements is a primary and essential part of the 
proceedings.
     As has been said, it is possible' for a human being to confer 
immortality on an elementary spirit by the' ceremony of marriage'.  But this 
doe's not always occur  sometimes the reverse is the case, and the' 
elementals share their mor-tality with their human mate.  In literature, at 
all events, countless stories relate how men have' risked and lost their 
immortality by marrying a sylph or an undine.  According to the Comte de 
Gabalis, however, it would seem to be a matter of choice whether a man 
confers his immortality on his ethereal partner, or whether he partakes of 
her mortal nature; for it is therein suggested that those' who have not been 
predestined to eternal happiness would do we'll to marry with an elemental, 
and spare themselves an eternity of woe.
     Not every authority has painted so attractive a picture of the' 
creatures of the elements as has the Abbe do Villars. By some it is believed 
that there' are numberless degree's among these' beings, the highest 
resembling the' lowest angels, while' the lowest may often be' mistaken for 
demons, which, of course, they are not. Not only do multitudinous variations 
of form and disposition characterise the elemen-tals of our own planet; the 
other planets and the' stars are the' abode' of countless hosts of 
elementary spirits, dif-fering from those' of our world perhaps more' than 
the' latter differ from one' another.  All the' forms of beasts, insects, 
and reptiles may be' taken by the lower elementals, as we'll as strange 
combinations of the shapes of different animals. The inhabitants of each 
element have their peculiar virtues and vices which serve to distinguish 
them. The sylphs are capricious and inconstant, but agile and active; the 
undines, jealous and cold, but observant; the salamanders, hot and hasty, 
but energetic and strong; and the' gnome's, greedy of gold and treasure's, 
but never-theless hard-working, good-tempered and patient. One' who would 
seek dominion over any of these must practise' their virtues; but carefully 
avoid their faults, thus con-quering them, as it were, on their own ground. 
Each species can only dwell in its own proper element. Thus a sylph may not 
invade the sphere of a salamander, or vice versa, while both would be' 
decidedly out of their ele-ment in the' regions of the' nymphs or the' 
gnome's.  Four rulers have' been set over the four species-Gob, ruler of the 
gnome's; Paralda, of the' sylphs; Djin, of the sala-manders; and Necksa, of 
the nymphs. To the' dwellers in each element is assigned a point of the' 
compass, where lie's their special kingdom. To the gnome's is given the' 
north; to the salamanders, the' south; to the sylphs, the' east; and to the 
undine's, the' west. The gnomes influence' those of a melancholic 
disposition, because they dwell in the gloom of subterranean caverns. The 
salamanders have' an effect on those of sanguine temperament, because' their 
home is in the fire. The influence' of the undine's is upon the phlegmatic, 
and of the' sylphs upon those of a bilious temperament. Though as a rule' 
they are' invisible' to human eyes, they may on occasion become visible' to 
those' who invoke them, to the' sages and philosophers, or even to the 
multitude.  In the' reign of king Pepin, Zedekias suggested to the sylphs 
that they should appear to men, whereupon the' air was seen to be full of 
them, sometimes ranged in battle, or in an aerial navy.  It was said by the' 
people that they were' sorcerers-an opinion to which Charlemagne and Louis 
the Debonnair subscribed, the latter at least imposing heavy penalties on 
the' supposed sorcerers.  So that they might behold their admirable in-
stitutions, certain men we're' raised up in the' air, and while' descending 
we're seen by their fellowmen on earth. The latter regarded them as 
stragglers of the aerial army of sorcerers, and thought that they had come' 
to poison the' fruits and fountains. These' unfortunate' persons we're' 
thereupon put to death, along with many others suspected of connection with 
the' sorcerers.
     To return to the' consideration of the nature of these' spirits, we 
find them collated in the Comte de Gabalis with the oracles of antiquity, 
and even with the' classic pantheons of Greece and Rome.  Pan, for example, 
was the first and oldest of the nymphs, and the news of his death, com-
municated by the people of the air to the inhabitants of the waters, was 
proclaimed by them in a voice that was heard sounding over all the rivers of 
Italy-" The great Pan is dead " Mr. A. E. Waite considers that the" angels" 
evoked in medieval magic, as we'll as the' "devils" of the Sabbath, were 
higher or lower elementals.  Others may see in the brownies and domestic 
spirits of folk-lore some resemblance to the subjugated elementary spirit.  
Even the familiar poltergeist, where he does not clearly establish his 
identity as the spirit of a deceased person. may be re-garded with propriety 
as an elemental. The Theosophists use' the word ' elemental" in a different 
sense, tQ denote' the' " astral remains " (See Shell) of one who has lived 
an evil life' on earth, and who is loath to leave' the scene of his 
pleasure's.  With some occultists, again, " ele-mental" really signifies a 
sub-human being, probably identical with an elementary spirit, but of a 
mental and moral status considerably lower than that of a human being.

Eleusis, Mysteries of : (See Mysteries.)


Elf Arrows : The superstitious name given to triangular flints, Belemnites, 
which are found in many countries, but notably in Scotland.  It was believed 
that these stones were arrows shot by the elves, which prove fatal to 
cattle, -the cure being to touch them with the arrow with which they have 
been hit, and give them to drink of water in which the arrow has been 
dipped.  It is even on record that an Irish bishop was thus shot at by an 
evil spirit; and it is said that they are' manufactured by the' Devil with 
the help of attendant imps who roughhew them, while' the' Archfiend finishes 
the' work.  Cases are' on record where' they have' been known to be made' 
and used by the witches of Scotland within historic times.  Similar super-
stitions regarding these' remnants of the stone' age' prevail in Italy, 
Africa, and Turkey.


Elf-Fire: The Ignis fatuus, or "foolish fire'." This is the name given to 
fire' obtained by rubbing two piece's of wood together, and which is used in 
superstitious ways. Amongst the Russian peasantry it is believed that these 
wandering lights are' the souls of still-born children, who do not desire to 
lure' people from the path, but who get no rest until they find their 
bodies.


Elixir of Life : No doubt exists that the medieval alchemists and mystics 
believed that they were' perfectly justified in their search for the Elixir 
of Life, the universal medicine, and the' renewal of youth.  This, with the 
quest for gold, became' the grand aim of alchemy, and although this search 
may have' had a psychical and mystical side', it most certainly had a 
physical one'.  But there does not seem to have been any standard method of 
accomplishing the manufacture' of the elixir. Thus in Petit Albert one' is 
in-structed to take' 8lbs. of sugar of mercury as the' founda-tion of such a 
mixture'; while' Bernard Trevisan believes that the' precipitation of the' 
philosopher's stone into mer-curial water results in the manufacture' of the 
elixir. This he' state's, will when elaborated to the' Red, transmute copper 
and other metals into pure' gold, and if elaborated to the' White', will 
produce' unalloyed silver.
     But the' application of the' elixir to the prolongation of life' was 
undoubtedly the chief reason for its continued search. The retired alchemist 
in his later years, wearied with his quest for gold, craved the boon of 
youth and de-sired renewed health and strength to assist him to carry out 
his great purpose.  As an illustration of the alchemical  conception of the 
elixir of life, we quote the following from a work dealing with the secret 
of rejuvenescence, originally supposed to have been written by Arnold de 
Villanova, and published  by Longueville-Harcour at Paris in 1716:-
     “To renew youth is to enter once more into that felic-itous season 
which imparts to the human frame the pleasures and strength of the morning.  
Here it is to no purpose that we should speak of that problem so much 
discussed by the Wise, whether the art can be carried to such a pitch of 
excellence that old age should itself be made young. We know that Paracelsus 
has vaunted the meta-morphic resources of his Mercury of Life which not 
merely rejuvenates men but converts metals into gold ; He who promised unto 
others the years of the sybils, or at least the 300 winters of Nestor, 
himself perished at the age of thirty-seven.  Let us turn rather to Nature, 
so admirable in her' achievements, and deem her not capable alone of 
destroying what she has produced at the moment she has begotten them.  Is it 
possible that she will refuse unto man, for whom all was created, what she 
accords to the stags, the eagles, and the serpents, who do annually cast 
aside the mournful concomitants of senility, and do assume the most 
brilliant, the most gracious amenities of the most joyous youth ? Art,. it 
is true, has not as yet arrived at that apex of perfection wherefrom it can 
renew our youth; but that which was unachieved in the past may be accom-
plished in the future, a prodigy which may be more con-fidently expected 
from the fact that in isolated cases it has actually already taken place, as 
the facts of history make evident.  By observing and following the manner in 
which nature performs such wonders, we may assuredly hope to execute this 
desirable transformation, and the first condition is an amiable temperament, 
such as that which was possessed by Moses, of whom it is written that for 
one hundred and twenty years his sight never failed him.
     "The stag, eagle, and sparrow-hawk renew their youth. Aldrovandus has 
written on the rejuvenescence of the eagle.  Among the birds of the air, we 
are told by Pliny that the raven and the phoenix live, each of them six hun-
dred years.  No one denies that the stag is renewed by feeding on vipers and 
serpents, while the apes of Caucasus, whose diet is pepper, prove a 
sovereign remedy for the lion, who grows young by devouring their flesh. 
Those who have written of the elephant maintain that his normal life is 
extended through three centuries, while the horse, which alone in creation 
participates in the natures of man, of the lion, of the ox, the sheep, the 
mule, the stag, the wolf, the fox, the serpent, and the hare, from each 
deriving three of its qualities, has occasionally survived with un-
diminished vigour the lapse of a hundred years. The serpent, who is 
instrumental in the rejuvenescence of the stag, himself renews his youth at 
the shedding of his scales, from all which considerations, it follows that 
it is not be-yond belief that a like prodigy may be found in the su-perior 
order of the same productions whence man has been himself derived, for man 
is assuredly not in a worse con-dition than the beasts whom he rules."
     Trithemius (q.v.) on his death-bed dictated a receipt which he said 
would preserve mind, health and memory with perfect sight and hearing, for 
those who made use of it.  It consists of among other things, calomel, 
gentian, cinnamon, aniseed, nard, coral, tartar, mace, and five grammes of 
it were to be taken night and morning in wine or brodium during the whole of 
the first month; during the second month, in the morning only; during the 
third month thrice in the week, and so continuing through life. This is a 
more understandable receipt than that of Eu-genius Philalethes, who says: " 
Ten parts of coelestiall slime; separate the male from the female, and each 
after wards from its own earth, physically, mark you, and with no violence. 
Conjoin after separation in due, harmonic vitall proportion; and 
straightway, the Soul descending from the pyroplastic sphere, shall restore, 
by a mirific embrace, its dead and deserted body.  Prbceed according to the 
Volcanico magica theory, till they are exalted into the Fifth Metaphysical 
Rota. This is that world-renowned medicine, whereof so many have scribbled, 
which, not-withstanding, so few have known."
     In his History of Magic Eliphas Levi gives Cagliostro's great secret of 
rejuvenescence in the following terms:
     “Let us now turn to the secret of physical regeneration to attain which 
- according to the occult prescription of the Grand Copht-a retreat of forty 
days, after the manner of a jubilee, must be made once in every fifty years, 
beginning during the full moon of May in the company of one faithful person 
only.  It must be also a fast of forty days, drinking May-dew-collected from 
sprouting corn with a cloth of pure white linen-and eating new and ten-der 
herbs. The repast should begin with a large glass of dew and end with a 
biscuit or crust of bread.  There should be slight bleeding on the 
seventeenth day.  Balm of Azoth should then be taken morning and evening, 
beginning with a dose of six drops and increasing by two drops daily till 
the end of the thirty-second day.  At the dawn which follows thereafter 
renew the slight bleeding; then take to your bed and remain in it till the 
end of the fortieth day.
     “On the first awakening after the bleeding. take the first grain of 
Universal Medicine.  A swoon of three hours will be followed by convulsions, 
sweats and much purging, necessitating a change both of bed and linen.  At 
this stage a broth of lean beef must be taken, seasoned with rice, sage, 
valerian, vervain and balm.  On the day follow-ing take the second grain of 
Universal Medicine, which is Astral Mercury combined with Sulphur of Gold.  
On the next day have a warm bath.  On the thirty-sixth day drink a glass of 
Egyptian wine, and on the thirty-seventh take the third and last grain of 
Universal Medicine.  A profound sleep will follow, during which the hair, 
teeth, nails and skin will be renewed. The prescription for the thirty-
eighth day is another warm bath, steeping aromatic herbs in the water, of 
the same kind as those specified for the broth.  On the thirty-ninth day 
drink ten drops of Elixir of Acharat in two spoonsful of red wine.  The work 
will be finished on the fortieth day, and the aged man will be renewed in 
youth.
     “By means of this jubilary regimen, Cagliostro claimed to have lived 
for many centuries.  It will be seen that it is a variation of the famous 
Bath of Immortality in use among the Menandrian Gnostics."
     Aristeus is stated to have left to his disciples a secret which 
rendered all metals diaphanous, and man immortal. The process would appear 
to consist in a mystic treatment of the atmosphere, which is to 'be 
congealed and distilled until it develops the divine sparkle, and 
subsequently becomes liquified.  It is then subjected to heat and under-goes 
several other processes, when the elixir emerges.
     There is surprisingly little literature upon the subject of the Elixir 
of Life.  But a more prolonged notice on the subject will be found under the 
article " Philosopher's stone " (q.v.).


Ellide : The dragon-shaped ship of Frithjof of, the hero of an Icelandic 
legend.  It was said to be golden-headed, with open Jaws, its under part 
scaled with blue and gold, its tail twisted and of silver, its sails red-
bordered and black. When its wings were outspread, it could skim the calmest 
seas. This ship had been given to one of Frithjof's fore-fathers as a reward 
for kindness by Aegir, the sea-god.

Elongation : The phenomenon of elongation is a fairly common one' at 
spiritualistic seance's.  It may be described as a stretching out of the 
medium's body, till his height is in-creased by from three inches to nearly 
a foot. The feat is ascribed to spirit agencies. There are accounts by 
witnesses of standing in the social and scientific world of elongations of 
Herne, Home, Morse', and other well-known mediums. These manifestations 
usually made their ap-pearance only when the light was low, but there were 
several exceptions.  In describing an elongation of Home', Lord Lindsay 
says: " Home looked as if he' was pulled up by the' neck, the muscles seemed 
in a state' of tension. He stood firmly upright in the middle' of the' room, 
and before the elongation commenced I placed my foot on his instep." The 
same witness also declares that the' increase in Home's height on this 
occasion was eleven inches. Most accounts describe a violent swaying motion 
on the' part of the medium as preceding the elongation, which some critics 
have regarded a a convenient mode of covering the use of mechanism, which 
might be concealed in the medium's boots.


Elymas, the Sorcerer :  A magician of Paphos, in Cyprus, who openly defied 
the apostle Paul before' the Roman governor.  The latter, wh6 did not know 
whether to credit Paul or Elymas, summoned them both before' him, when the 
apostle suffered the indignity referred to.  " Oh, full of all subtlety and 
mischief," said Paul, in righteous anger, child of the devil, enemy of all 
righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord ? 
And, now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be 
blind, not seeing the' sun for a season."  It is not related in what manner 
Elymas exercised his talents, or what were the characteristics of his 
sorceries, but we' are told that the sentence of Paul immediately took 
effect, and “there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he' went about, 
seeking some to lead him by the hand."


Emanations : Variously defined as subtle fluid, astral in-fluence, psychic 
force, physical effluence, magnetism, ra-diations and vibrations. They are 
said to proceed from and surround all bodies and objects in nature, and when 
brought into contact through this medium, influencing and re-acting on each 
other, the' result being either inter-penetration or repulsion. The 
attractive properties of the magnet were known to the ancients, some 
authorities claiming that it was used in their religious rites and 
mysteries, in Egypt, Greece and Rome. They adduced as evidence the' iron 
rings and wings used in the Samothracian mysteries, the iron wings worn by 
the priests of Jupiter to increase their magical power, and in the' various 
symbols ascribed to the' pagan gods.  It is said too that meteoric stones, 
because' of their supposed radiation of force', were also made use of in 
the' religious rites, either being worshipped, or employed for purposes of 
divination and soothsaying. Small one's were worn by the priests and Pliny 
tells of the temple of Arsinoe which was vaulted with magnetic stone in 
order to receive a hovering statue of its patron.  Cedrenus gives an account 
of an ancient image in the Serapium at Alexandria being suspended by 
magnetic force.
     The most ancient writing extant in which this theory of emanations may 
be traced is ascribed to Timaeus of Locris in which he' ascribes the' 
creation of the' universe to the' divine emanations of God, an imparting of 
His being to unformed matter.  By this union a world-soul was created which 
vitalises and regulates all things.  Claudian in his Idyl of the Magnet uses 
it as a symbol of the informative' spirit of things, the laws of nature, 
creative and existent.
     The mysticism of the' seventeenth and eighteenth cen-turies mainly 
depends on these ideas of radiations eman-ating from all things but 
especially the' stars, magnets and human beings, of a force which would act 
on all things and was controlled by the indwelling spirit. The writings of 
Paracelsus abound with instances of the theory.  He' asserts that every 
substance in itself contains something of the nature of the loadstone; that 
the astral light, which is one of the finer media of nature, finer than the 
lurm-iniferous ether, exists throughout planetary space especially around 
the' brain and spinal cords of human beings; (See article Aura) that we' 
are' all but organised magnets having each our pole's which attract and 
repel; that our thoughts are magnetic emanations escaping from our brains.  
His theory of the universe was that it emanated from a great first Being and 
there was a reciprocity in all things.  In man too there' exists an astral 
quality, emanating from the stars, which, whether physical or not, when 
compared with the physical body may be considered a spirit. This life stands 
in connection with the stars from which it sprang and draws to it their 
power like a magnet.  He calls this Sidereal life the magnes microcosmi and 
makes use' of it to explain the manifestations of nature - it glows in the 
flower, glides in the stream, moves in the ocean and shines in the' sky. Van 
Helmont speaks of an ethereal spirit, pure' and living, which pervades all 
things.  Robert Fludd explained sympathy and antipathy by the' action of the 
emanatory spheres surrounding man-in sympathy the emanations proceeding from 
the centre', in antipathy the' opposite movement taking place.  He 
maintained that these sensitive emanations are to be found also amongst 
animals and plants, drawing an argument from the fact that if dead and inert 
substance's, such as the' earth and magnet seem to be, should have their 
emanations and their poles, their living forms must needs have them 
likewise. In the writings of Maxwell, a Scotch physician, is to be' found 
the statement: "There' is a linking together of spirits, an incessant 
outpouring of the rays of our body into another."  Athanasius Kircher 
elaborated the theory deriving all natural phenomena from the action of 
magnetic radiation ; the arts and sciences being also emanations. Wirdig, 
Bartholin and many more pursued 'and developed their philosophical 
investigations along these line's.
     Descartes asserted that all space is filled with a fluid matter which 
he held to be elementary, the foundation and fountain of all life', 
enclosing all globes and keeping them in motion. In Newton's doctrine of 
attraction, which he called the Divine' Sensorium, the idea of emanation and 
magnetism is found. The following quotation is from his Fundamen-tal 
Principles of Natural Philosophy: " Here' the question is of a very subtle' 
spirit which penetrates through all, even the' hardest bodies and which is 
concealed in their substance'. Through the strength and activity of this 
spirit, bodies attract each other and adhere' together when brought into 
contact. Through it electrical bodies operate at the' re-motest distances as 
we'll as near at hand, attracting and repelling; through this spirit the 
light also flows and is refracted and reflected and warms bodies."  Mesmer 
enunciated the' following propositions :  " Between the' heavenly bodies, 
the earth and human beings, there exists a mutual or interchangeable 
influence. The medium of this influence is an universally distributed fluid 
which suffers no vacuum, is of a rarity with which nothing can compare and 
has the' property of receiving and transmit-ting all impressions of 
movement. Animal bodies ex-perience the mutual effect of this agent, because 
it penetrates the nerves and affects them directly.  In the' human body 
particularly are observed properties analagous to those' of the' magnet.  It 
is shown by experiment that a matter flows out so fine that it penetrates 
all bodies without apparently losing any of its activity. This may be' 
communicated to other bodies, animate or inanimate, such as mirrors; it is 
communicated, propagated, aug-mented by sound.  Its virtues may be 
accumulated, con-centrated and transported."  On this theory he' based his 
famous "Animal Magnetism" (q.v.) and its practice for the' cure of disease', 
in fact all human ailments.  Baron von Reichenbach, a man of scientific 
attainments, a chemist and metallurgist of some' repute, conducted a series 
of experiments to investigate this theory.  He' procured the aid of a large 
number of sensitives, clairvoyants and mediums. These' persons he' placed in 
dark rooms, and then submitted to their spiritual sight magnets, shells, 
crystals, minerals, animals, human hands and a great variety of animate' and 
inanimate' objects, known only to himself but detected by the sensitive's 
through the lu-minous emanations given forth by each substance'. These' 
emanations or flames differed in colour, size and intensity according to the 
nature of the' object examined. The' sensations experienced seemed mainly of 
two kinds-temperature and perceptions of light and colour. The poles of the 
magnet emitted flames, reddish yellow from the' south pole', bluish green 
from the north; a similar polarity was observed in the' luminous emanations 
from crystals. The human fingers radiated light.  Elementary substances each 
had their distinctive light and colour, the' metals giving the most vivid 
impressions.  Iron, cop-per, bismuth, mercury and others gave off a red 
glow, each differing from the others; the flames emitted by lead, cobalt and 
palladium were blue'; those' of silver, gold, cadmium, diamond we're white. 
The' clairvoyants also perceived the luminous matter over the bodies of the' 
sick in hospitals; and a column of misty vapour hovering over a newly made 
grave'. This radiance emitted by the' various substances, was capable of 
illuminating other objects.  It could be concentrated by a lens, reflected 
by a mirror but produced no effect on a thermometer and was liable' to be 
absorbed by the glass of the percipient's spectacle's.  A large number of 
the' sensitive's fully cor-roborated each other's statements and 
observations, two artists amongst them sketching their clairvoyant visions. 
These' experiments of the' Baron's were conducted for years with the' most 
persevering attention and he arrived at the' conclusion that from every 
object in the' human, animal, vegetable' and mineral kingdom there emanated 
a force' which could be detected under favourable' conditions as flame's or 
luminous radiations.  Some observers defined these as the' universal life of 
things.  Reichenbach in his writings and descriptions of the experiments 
called them the " Od Force" or "Odyle'." Modern Spiritualism claims that all 
physical phenomena such as materialisa-tions, (q.v.) levitation, (q.v.) 
apports, (q.v.) table-rapping etc. are' produced by the' spirits' 
manipulations of the medium's more' physical emanations in such a way as to 
give them power to manifest materially and control matter. The finer phases 
of mediumship are traced to a similar use of the' psychic aura or force' 
emitted from the medium's personality. Theosophy has elaborated the theory 
of emanations into grandiose conceptions of astral light, in-fluences, 
auras, etc.  In Paris, in 1901, a peculiar phenom-enon produced through the' 
agency of a young Roumanian gentleman was investigated by Dr. Rozier.  
Broussay could occasion a gaseous bubbling of water when this was enclosed 
in a bottle and over this ebullition he had more or less control.  In Dr. 
Rozier's presence this was carried out by the following process. A white 
glass bottle was taken, a quarter filled with water, and the neck of this 
was firmly closed up by Broussay's hand.  It was then
turned upside down and held tightly so that no moisture could possibly 
escape.  On watching the water thus brought into touch with the hand minute 
air bubble's formed rap-idly and rose in threadlike line's to the' surface.  
After lapse of a minute' or two the' appearance intensified and the bubbles 
rose in greater number until the effect resembled soda water in 
effervesence.  When the experiment was at its height the bubbles seemed to 
fly from every part of the hand which was exposed to the' water and gathered 
round the neck of the' bottle' while' a crackling sound was audible.  Light 
had no effect on the experiment and the' temperature of M. Broussay was 
normal, 37deg. to 38deg. at most. This experiment is similar to a favourite 
per-formance' given by Indian jugglers, who will boil an egg in from five to 
ten minutes at most without fire to heat the' water.  An explanation of this 
phenomenon is given as being due to the electric vibrations passing along 
the' surface of the skin and raising the' temperature' of the water above 
boiling point-the' definition of electricity in this case being that as it 
is neither matter nor energy, though energy may be expended in moving or 
creating it' it is quite probably generated by the brain cells, a 
manifestation of cerebral force' and will vibrations.  Later investigations 
in the' subject of emanations were set in motion by certain results detected 
in connection with a study of the' famous X " rays, when it was found that a 
new specie's of radia-tions was emitted by the' focus tube, which traversed 
al-uminium, black paper, wood, etc.  These new rays we're plane-polarized 
from the' moment of their emission ; were. susceptible of rotatory and 
elliptic polarization and could be refracted, reflected and diffused. The 
wave-lengths of the “N" rays are much smaller than those of light and they 
also appear to be' without heat. They can be obtained from various sources 
other than the Rontgen tube, and certain bodies seem to have the property of 
retaining or storing the rays for a considerable time.  The human body is 
said to emit them unceasingly. Though non-luminous in themselves the rays 
will, if allowed to fall upon a phosphorescent body, increase its glow.  A 
small spark or flame is similarly influenced.  In photography the existence 
of the " N " rays is we'll demonstrated, those' pictures taken without the 
rays being very faint while' those obtained while the' " N" rays we're in 
action were much stronger. Pebble's exposed to sunlight spontaneously emit " 
N" rays and bodies such as Rupert's drops, hard-ened steel, hammered brass, 
etc, are permanent sources of the' rays. These rays we're named after the' 
initial letter of the town of Nancy where' the' researches were made that 
led to their discovery by Professor Blondlot.  Further experiments proved 
that all matter possesses the' power of radiation and those potentialities 
can be' seen and regis-tered by a fluorescent screen just as those' of the 
animal and human organism.  Whenever muscular and nerve energies are 
manifesting rays are emitted, and it was found that they would pass through 
certain substance's whereas others would intercept and store' them.  For 
example, they passed through an oak board three or four centimetre's thick, 
black paper, aluminium, etc, but water stopped them or even a cigarette 
paper if wet.  Fresh water inter-cepted them but if the liquid were salt 
the' rays passed through.  Dr. Baraduc for many years pursued his studies in 
the emission of human fluidic force's and used the bio-metre for registering 
vibrations emitted from human bodies. This instrument consists of a needle 
suspended by a fine' thread and covered with a glass shade'.  When the' hand 
approaches this shade, without touching it the needle is deflected. As the 
result of long observation he' formed the opinion that the' variations in 
the' movements of the' needle were' caused by various conditions, physical, 
mental and moral in the' persons who approached it and that by
these' means he was able to estimate' those conditions. Dr. Baraduc also 
experimented in photography on these' lines. He took photographs of the 
emanations given off from the hands of persons in varied, mental, moral and 
physical states.  In these' the lines of radiation varied considerably. In 
one, described by him as a psychic hand, the luminosity seemed to radiate 
from the lower base' of the palm; an-other, where' all the' lines we're' 
confused. was a photograph taken from the hand of a man in mental distress.  
Dr. Baraduc also photographed some stone's which were said to have' been 
used in the initiation rite's of pre-Christian religions and the' stream of 
rays emanating from these' Stones was distinctly visible' on the plates ; 
also some holy water at Lourdes just after a miraculous cure had been 
effected, and there' again the influence was strong.  He' photographed with 
similar result the' sacred wafer during the moment of elevation in a Roman 
Catholic Church. He also photographed both his son and his wife', the one' 
four minute's after death and the' other twenty-four hours after death, and 
in each instance there' was seen stretching from the lifeless body a great 
stream of force' which ex-tended right up to the ceiling of the room and 
then turned down again.  In the' one case the face of the' son could be' 
recognised by anyone who had known him and could be seen close to the' body.  
In the' other case the profile of Dr. Baraduc's wife' was to be seen halfway 
up the room. (See article Thought Photography.)

Enchiridion of Pope Leo, The : Is a collection of charms, cast in the' form 
of prayers, which have nothing in common with those' of the Church.  It is 
concerned chiefly with worldly, rather than spiritual advantages.  It was 
per-haps printed at Rome in 1523, and again in 1606.  Its magical virtue 
rests on a supposed letter from Charlemagne' to Pope Leo, in which he states 
that since receiving the En-chiridion he' has never ceased to be' fortunate. 
The charms it contains are' supposed to be' effectual against all the' 
dangers to which human flesh is heir-poison, fire, wild beasts and tempests.  
When a copy of the' book has been secured, it must be placed in a small bag 
of leather, carried on the person, and one page at least read daily. The' 
reading must be done' upon the knees with the face turned to the' east, and 
works of piety must be performed in honour of the' celestial spirits, whose 
influence it is desired to at-tract. The first chapter of the Gospel 
according to St. John is declared to be the most potent in the book.  As for 
the symbols, they are mostly of oriental origin.  It also includes the 
mysterious prayers of Pope' Leo, and certain conjurations of a semi-magical 
character, including the seven mysterious onions, which are merely clumsy 
imitations of the Roman ritual.

Endless Cord, Tying Knots in : About the years 1877-88 Professor Zollner of 
Leipsic investigated the phenomena of the medium Slade, and particularly 
anything which might prove a fourth dimension of space, in which hypoth-esis 
Professor Zollner was at that time greatly interested. The tying in an 
endless cord of such knots as could or-dinarily only be made if the' ends of 
the' cord were free' provided such a test.  In December, 1877, Zollne'r 
visited Slade with two pieces of hempen cord, the' free ends of each
being sealed to a piece of cardboard. To ensure the' cord always being in 
sight Zollne'r hung it round his neck, and kept Slade's hands continually in 
view.  Under these cir-cumstances four knots were produced, apparently on 
the original sealed cord.


England  : (For the pre-Saxon inhabitants of England, See Celts.)  The 
Anglo-Saxon system of magic was of course' Teutonic.  Their pretenders to 
witchcraft we're called wicca, scin-laeca, galdor-craeftig, wiglaer, and 
morthwyrtha. Wiglaer is a combination from wig, an idol or a temple', and 
laer, learning.  He' was the wizard, as wicca was the witch.  Scinlaeca was 
a species of phantom or apparition, and was also used as a name' of the 
person who had the' power of producing such things: it is, literally, "a 
shining dead body."  Galdor-craeftig im-plies one skilled in incantations ; 
and morth-wyrtha is, literally, “a worshipper .of the dead."
     Another general appellation for such personages was dry, a magician.
     The laws visited these practices with penal severity. The best account 
that can be given of them will be found in the passages proscribing them.
     “If any wicca, or wiglaer, or false swearer, or morth-wyrtha, or any 
foul, contaminated, manifest horcwenan (whore, quean or strumpet), he any 
where in the' land, man shall drive them out."   We teach that every priest 
shall extinguish all heathendom, and forbid wilweorthunga (fountain-
worship), and licwiglunga (incantations of the dead), and hwata (omens), and 
galdra (magic), and man-worship, and the abominations that men exercise in 
various sorts of witchcraft, and in frithspottum, and with elms and other 
tree's, and with stones, and with many phantoms."
     From subsequent regulations, we find that these prac-tice's we're made' 
the instruments of the' most fatal mis-chief; for penitentiary penalties are 
enjoined if any one should destroy another by wicce craefte; or if any 
should "drive' sickness on a man"; or if death should follow from the' 
attempt.
     They seem to have' used philtres ; for it is also made punishable' if 
any should use' witchcraft for another's love', or should give him to eat or 
to drink with magic. They were also forbid to wiglian (or to divine) by the 
moon. Canute renewed the' prohibitions.  He enjoined them not to worship the 
sun or the moon, fire or floods, wells or stones, or any sort of tree; not 
to love wiccecraeft, or frame death-spells, either by lot or by torch ; nor 
to effect any thing by phantoms.  From the Poenitentiale of Theodore' we 
also learn, that the' power of letting loose' tempests was also pretended 
to.
     Another name for magical arts among the Anglo-Saxons was unlybban 
wyrce, destructive of life."  The penitence' is prescribed for a woman who 
kills a man by unlybban.  One instance' of philtre using is detailed to us.  
A woman re-solving on the' death of her step-son, or to alienate from him 
his father's affection, sought a witch, who knew how to change minds by arts 
and enchantments. Addressing such a one with promises and rewards, the' 
enquired how the mind of the father might be' turned from the child, and be 
fixed on herself. The magical medicament was immediately made, and mixed 
with the husband's meat and drink. The catastrophe of the' whole was the 
murder of the child and the discovery of the crime' by the as-sistant, to 
revenge the step-mother's ill-treatment.
     The charms used by the Anglo-Saxons were' innumerable'. They trusted in 
their magical incantations for the cure of disease', for the success of 
their tillage, for the' discovery of lost property, and for the prevention 
of casualties. Specimens of their charms for these' purposes still remain to 
us.  Bede' tells us, that ' many, in times of disease' (neglecting the 
sacraments) went to the erring medicaments of idolatry, as if to restrain 
God's chastisements by incan-tations, phylacteries, or any other secret of 
the' demoniacal arts."
     Their prognostications, from the sun, from thunder, and from dreams, 
were 50 numerous, as to display and to perpetuate superstition.  Every day 
of every month was catalogued as a propitious or unpropitious season for 
cer-tain transactions.  We have' Anglo-Saxon treatise's which contain rules 
for discovering the' future and disposition of a child, from the' day of its 
nativity.  One' day was useful - or all things; another, though good to 
tame' animals was baleful to sow seeds.  One' day was favourable to the' 
commencement of business; another to let blood ; and others wore a 
forbidding aspect to these and other things. On this day one must buy, on a 
second sell, on a third hunt, on a fourth do nothing.  If a child was born 
on such a day, it would live'; if on another, Its life' would be' sickly; if 
on another, he would perish early.  In a word, the' most alarming fears, and 
the most extravagant hope's, were perpetually raised by these foolish 
superstitions, which tended to keep the mind in the' dreary bondage of 
ignorance and absurdity, which prevented the' growth of knowledge, by the' 
incessant war of prejudice', and the' slavish effects of the' most imbecile 
apprehensions.
     The same anticipations of futurity were' made' by no-ticing on what day 
of the week or month it first thundered, or the new moon appeared, or the 
new-year's day occurred. Dreams likewise' had regular interpretations and 
applica-tions; and thus life, instead of being governed by counsels of 
wisdom, was directed by those' solemn lessons of gross superstition, which 
the most ignorant peasant of our days would be ashamed to avow.
     Although witchcraft was of early origin in England, we do not find many 
notices of it in the literature of the coun-try, nor does it seem to have' 
been systematically punished until past Reformation time's. That is not to 
say, that no prosecution ever took place' against witchcraft in Plan-tagenet 
and early Tudor time's, but that in all probability the vogue of sorcery was 
so widespread, and so powerful was supposed to be the' protection of a 
Church that nothing like' a crusade was directed against it.  Again it was 
re-garded as a political offence' to employ sorcery against the ruling 
powers, and a's such it was punished severely enough, as 45 witnessed by the 
execution of the' Duchess of Gloucester in Henry VI.'s reign, and the Duke 
of Buck-ingham in 1521.  In Henry VI.'s time Lord Hungerford was beheaded 
for consulting certain soothsayers concerning the duration of the' King's 
life.                        L.	S.

     According to Sir William Blackstone, "To deny the' possibility, nay, 
the' actual existence of witchcraft and sorcery is at once flatly to 
contradict the' revealed Word of God in various passage's of the Old and New 
Testaments, and the thing itself is a truth to which every nation in the' 
world hath in its turn borne testimony."
     At very early periods the Church fulminated against those' who 
practised it.  In 696 a Canon of Council held at Berkhampstead condemned to 
corporal punishment those' who made sacrifices to evil spirits, and at 
subsequent dates Statutes against Witchcraft were enacted by the Parliaments 
of Henry VIII., Elizabeth and James I.  Mr. Inderwick says, " For centuries 
in this country strange as it may now appear, a denial of the' existence of 
such demoniacal agency was deemed equal to a confession of Atheism and to a 
disbelief in the Holy Scriptures them-selves.  But not only did Lord 
Chancellors, Lord Keepers, benches of Bishops and Parliament attest the 
truth and the existence of witchcraft, but Addison writing as late as 1711, 
in the pages of the Spectator, after describing him-self as hardly pressed 
by the' arguments on both side's of
this question expresses his own belief that there' is and has been, 
witchcraft in the' land."
     It is in the twelfth Century that a first distinct glimpse is obtained 
of the' bond between the Evil One and his vic-tim. The' tale of the old 
woman of Berkeley which Southey's Ballad has familiarised, is related by 
William of Malmesbury on the' authority of a professed eye-witness. When the 
devil informed the witch of the near expiry of her contract, she' summoned 
the' neighbouring monks and her children; and after confessing her criminal 
compact displayed great anxiety lest Satan should secure her body as well as 
her soul.  She gave' directions to be' sewn in a stag's hide' and placed in 
a stone' coffin, shut in with lead and iron, to be loaded with heavy stones 
and the' whole' fastened down with three iron chains.  In order to baffle 
the power of the demons, she further directed fifty psalms to be sung by 
night, and fifty masses to be sung by day, and that at the end of three 
nights, if her body was still secure, she said that it might be buried with 
safety.  All these' precautions however, proved of no avail. The monks 
bravely resisted the' efforts of the fiends on the first and second nights, 
but on the third night in the middle of a ter-rific uproar an immense demon 
burst into the' monastery and in a voice of thunder commanded the' dead 
witch to rise.  She' replied that she was bound with chains, which however 
the demon snapped like' thread, the' coffin lid fell aside, and on the' 
witch arising the demon bore her off on a huge black horse' and galloped 
into the darkness, while' her shrieks resounded through the air. The first 
trial for witchcraft in England occurred during the tenth year of the reign 
of King John, when according to the Abbreviato--Placitorum, the wife of Ado 
the merchant, accused one Gideon of the crime.  He proved his innocence 
however, by the ordeal of the red-hot iron.  A trial was reported with more 
detail in the year 1324.  Certain citizens of Coventry had suffered at the 
hands of the' prior whose extortions were approved of and supported by two 
of Edward II.'s favourites.  Byway of revenge they plotted the' death of the 
prior, the favourites, and the King.
     In order to carry this into effect they consulted John of Nottingham, a 
famous Magician of the time and his Servant Robert Marshall of Leicester. 
Marshall however, betrayed the plot and stated that together with his master 
they fashioned images of wax to represent the King, his two favourites, the' 
prior, his caterer and steward, and one Richard de Lowe-the latter being 
brought in merely as an experimental lay-figure in which to test the' effect 
of the' charm.  At an old ruined house near Coventry, on the Friday 
following Holy Cross Day, John gave his man a sharp pointed leaden branch 
and commanded him to plunge it into the forehead of the figure representing 
Rich-ard de Lowe. This being done John dispatched his servant to Lowe's 
house' to find out the' result of the experiment. Lowe it seems had lost his 
senses and went about screaming “Harrow."  On the Sunday before Ascension 
John with-drew the branch from the' image's forehead, and thrust it into the 
heart, where it remained till the following Wed-nesday when the unfortunate 
victim died.  Such was the' evidence of Marshall, but the judges gave it 
little' belief, and after several adjournments the trial was aban-doned.
     The first enactment against witchcraft in England was by the Parliament 
of 1541.  In 1551 further enactments were levelled at it, but it was not 
until 1562 that Parlia-ment defined witchcraft as a Capital Crime. 
Thenceforth followed the regular persecution of Witches.  Many burnings 
occurred during the latter years of Elizabeth's reign.
     At the village of Worboise, (q.v.) in the County of Hunt-ingdon in 1589 
dwelt two country gentlemen, Robert Throgmorton and Sir Samuel Cromwell. Mr. 
Throg-morton's family consisted of his wife and five daughters of whom the 
eldest Joan, a girl of fifteen was possessed with a mind and imagination 
well stocked with ghost-and witch-lore.  On one occasion she had to pass the 
cot-tage of a labouring family of the name of Samuel. This family consisted 
of a man, his wife, and their grown-up daughter. Mother Samuel was sitting 
at the door wearing a black cap, and busily engaged in knitting.  Joan 
declared that she was a witch, ran home and fell into strange con-vulsive 
fits, stating that Mother Samuel had bewitched her.  In doe course the other 
daughters respectively were attacked with similar fits, and attributed the 
blame to Mother Samuel. The parents now began to suspect that their children 
were really bewitched and reported the matter to Lady Cromwell, who, as an 
intimate friend of the family took the matter up and along with Sir Samuel 
ordered that the alleged witch should be put to ordeal. Meanwhile the 
children let loose their imagination and invented all sorts of weird and 
grotesque tales about the old woman.  Eventually Throgmorton had the poor 
old woman dragged to his grounds where she was subjected to torture, pins 
being thrust into her body to see if blood could be drawn.  Lady Cromwell 
tore out a handful of the old crone's hair which she gave to Mrs. 
Throgmorton requesting her to burn it as an antidote against witchcraft, 
Suffering under these injuries the old woman invoked a curse against her 
torturers which was afterwards remem-bered, though she was allowed her 
liberty.  She thereafter suffered much persecution at the hands of the two 
families, all ills and misfortunes occurring amongst their cattle and stock 
being laid to her charge.  Eventually Lady Crom-well was seized with an 
illness that caused her death, and upon old Mother Samuel was laid the 
responsibility.  Re-peated efforts were made to persuade her to confess and 
amend what she had done.  At last, tormented beyond endurance, she let 
herself be persuaded to pronounce an exorcism against the spirits and 
confessed that her husband and daughter were also associates with her and 
had sold themselves to the devil.  On the strength of this confession the 
whole family were imprisoned in Huntingdon Gaol. At the following Session 
the three Samuels were put upon trial indicted with various offences and " 
bewitching unto death" the Lady Cromwell,  In the agony of torture the old 
woman confessed all that was required, but her husband and daughter strongly 
asserted their innocence.  All were sentenced to be hanged and burned. The 
executions were carried out in April 1595.
     It is related that in 1594 the Earl of Derby attributed the cause of 
his death to witchery, though he had no idea of the person who had bewitched 
him,
     The Accession of James I. himself a great expert in witchcraft and the 
author of the famous treatise on de-monology (q.v.) gave a great impetus to 
the persecution of witches in England.  " Poor old women and girls of tender 
age were walked, sworn, shaved, and tortured, the gallows creaked and the 
fires blazed."
     In 1606 there were tried at King's Lynn the wife of one Henry Smith a 
grocer, for cursing a sailor who had struck a boy, and for cursing her 
neighbours because they were more prosperous in their trades than she was.
     After hearing the most absurd evidence she was con-victed and sentenced 
to death.  Upon the scaffold she confessed to various acts of witchcraft.
     In 1633 arose the famous case of the Lancashire Witches (q.v.).  On the 
assertion of a boy called Robinson, that he had been carried off and 
witnessed a witches' Sabbath at the Hoare Stones, some eighteen women were 
brought to trial at Lancaster Assizes.
     As the result of the severe legislation against witchcraft, there arose 
a class of self-constituted impugners or witch-finders who to their personal 
advantage were the means of the sacrifice of many innocent lives.
     The most famous of these witch-finders was Matthew Hopkins of 
Manningtree, in Essex.  He assumed the title of "Witch-finder General," and 
with an assistant, and a woman whose duty was to examine female suspects for 
devil's marks, he travelled about the Counties of Essex, Sussex, Huntingdon, 
and-Norfolk.  In one year this mur-derer-for want of a better name-caused 
the death of sixty people.  His general test was that of swimming. The hands 
and feet of accused were tied together crosswise. She was wrapped in a sheet 
and thrown into a pond.  If she sank as frequently happened, she was deemed 
inno-cent, but at the cost of her life, if she floated she was pro-nounced 
guilty and forthwith executed. Another test was to repeat the Lord's Prayer 
without a single falter or stumble, a thing accredited impossible of a 
witch.  On one occasion she was weighed against the Church Bible, obtaining 
her freedom if she outweighed it,  It is alleged but without certainty, that 
on his impostures being found out an angry crowd subjected him to his own 
test by swim-ming, but whether he was drowned or executed authorities fail 
to agree.
In his Witch, Warlock and Magician Mr. Adams says, “I think there can be 
little doubt that many 
evil-disposed persons availed themselves to the prevalent belief in witch-
craft as a cover for their depredations on the property of their neighbours, 
diverting suspicion from themselves to the poor witches, who through 
accidental circumstances had acquired notoriety as the devil's accomplices.  
It would also seem probable that not a few of the reputed witches similarly 
turned to account their bad reputa-tion."
     It was not till the close of the seventeenth Century that convictions 
began to be discouraged by the Courts. But an old superstition dies hard, 
and in the early part of the eighteenth Century witchcraft was generally 
believed in, in England, even among the educated classes.
     Probably the revolution of opinion was effected between the Restoration 
and the Revolution.  According to Dr. Parr, the last execution of witches in 
England took place at Northampton where two were hung in 1705, and at the 
same place five others suffered a like fate in 1712.  Hutch-ison commenting 
on this in his Historical Essay says, " This is the more shameful as I shall 
hereafter prove from the literature of that time, a disbelief in the 
existence of witches had become almost universal among educated men, though 
the old superstition was still defended in the Judgment Seat, and in the 
pulpit."  Wesley who had more influence than all the Bishops put together 
says, " It is true likewise that the English in general, and, indeed, most 
of the men of learning in Europe, have given up all accounts of witches and 
apparitions as mere old wives' fables.  I am sorry for it. The giving up of 
witchcraft, is in effect giving up the Bible.  But I cannot give up to all 
the Deists in Great Britain the existence of witchcraft, till I give up the 
credit of all history sacred and profane."
    Every year however, diminished the old belief, and in 1736, a generation 
before Wesley stated the above opinions, the laws against witchcraft were 
repeated, but as illus-trative of the long lived prevalence of the 
superstition in 1759 Susannah Hannaker of Wengrove, in Wiltshire, was put to 
the ordeal of weighing, but she fortunately out-weighed the Bible,  Cases of 
ducking supposed witches occurred in 1760 at Leicester, in 1785 at 
Northampton, and in 1829 at Monmouth, while as recently as 1863 a Frenchman 
died as the result of an illness caused by his having been ducked as a 
Wizard, at Castle Hedingham in Essex, and on September 17th, 1875, an old 
woman named Ann Turner. a reputed witch, was killed by a feeble-minded man 
at Long Compton in Warwickshire.                A. J. B. G.

     Magic. Magic in England in early times is of course one' with 
witchcraft, and it is only when we' discern the stupendous figure of Roger 
Bacon (q.v.) that we' find any thing like separation between the two.  Of 
course, the' popular traditions concerning Bacon are merely legendary. but 
they assist to crystallise for us the idea of an English magician of 
medieval times. The Elizabethan History of Friar Bacon was probably the 
first which placed these' traditions on record.  Here we have no concern 
with the Bacon of science', for the Bacon of magic is a magician who cheated 
the' Devil, who made a brazen head that spoke, and who engaged in all manner 
of black magic.
     In England the' popular belief in magic was strengthened by the' 
extraordinary effects of natural processes then known only to a small number 
of individuals who concealed their knowledge with the most profound secrecy.  
In England, as we approach the age of the Reformation, we find that the 
study of magic and alchemy have' become extremely common among the Romish 
clergy. The rapid rise to power of men like Wolsey and Cromwell led people 
to think that they had gained their high positions through diabolical 
assistance, The' number of Magicians in the reign of Henry VIII. was 
exceedingly great, as is witnessed by documents in the Record Office.  At 
the' height of Wolsey's greatness, a magician who is described as  one' 
Wood, gent." was dragged before the Privy-council, charged with some 
misdemeanour which was connected with the' intrigues of the day.  In a paper 
addressed to the lords of the council, Wood states that William Nevill had 
sent for him to his house at Oxford, it being the first commu-nication he 
had ever had with that "person." After he' had been at Weke a short time, 
Neville took him by the' arm and led him privately into the garden, and, to 
use the quaint language of the original, "ther demawndyd of me many 
questyons, amowog all other askyd (if it) we're not possible to have a rynge 
made that should brynge man in favor with hys prynce, saying my lord 
cardinale had suche a rynge that whatsomevere he askyd of the kynges grace 
that he hadd yt, ' and master Cromwell, when he and I were servauntys in my 
lord cardynales housse, dyd hawnt to the' company of one that was seyne in 
your faculti, and shortly after no man so grett with my lord cardynale as 
master Cromwell was.'"  Neville added, that he had spoken "with all those 
who have any name in this realm, " who had assured him that in the same way 
he' might become " great with his prince," and he' ended by asking of the 
reputed magician what books he had studied on the subject. The latter 
continued, "and I, at the harti desire of hym showyd that I had rede many 
bokes, and specyally the boke of Salamon, and how his rynges be made and 
what mettell, and what vertues they had after the canon of Salamon."  He 
added, that he had also studied the magical work of Hermes.  William 
Neville' then requested him to undertake the making of a ring, which he says 
that he declined, and so went away for that time.  But Neville' sent for him 
again, and entered into further communication with him on the old subject, 
telling him that he had with him another conjurer, named Wade, who could 
show him more than he should; and, among other things, had showed him that 
"he should be' a great lord," This was an effective' attempt to move' Wood's 
jealousy; and it appears that Neville now pre-vailed upon him to make " 
moldes," probably images, to the entent that he showid we'd mastre's 
Elezebeth Gare," on whom he seemed to have set his love'.  Perhaps she was a 
rich heiress.  Wood then enters into excuses for himself, declaring that, 
although at the' desire' of" some of his friends," he had "called to a 
stone' for things stolen," he had not undertaken to find treasures, and he 
concluded with the naive boast, "but to make the phylosofer's stone, I will 
chehard (i.e, jeopard) my lyffe to dohyt, yf hyt plesse the kynge's good 
grace to command me do hyt." This was the' pride of science' above the' low 
practitioner's.  He even offered to remain in prison until be' had performed 
his boast, and only asked " twelve' months upon silver, and twelve' and a 
half upon gold."
     The search for treasures, which the conjurer Wood so earnestly 
disclaims, was, however, one' of the' most usual occupations of our 
magicians of this period. The frequent discoveries of Roman or Saxon, or 
medieval deposits, in the' course' of accidental digging - then probably 
more common than at present-was enough to whet the appetite of the needy or 
the miserly, and the belief that the' sepul-chral barrow, or the long 
deserted ruin, or even the' wild and haunted glen, concealed treasures of 
gold and silver of great amount has been carried down to our own days in a 
variety of local legends.  Hidden treasures were under the particular 
charge' of some of the spirits who obeyed the magician's call, and we still 
trace his operations in many a barrow that has been disturbed, and ruined 
floor that has been broken up. That these searches were not always 
successful will be evident from the' following narrative
     In the reign of Henry VIII. a priest named William Stapleton was placed 
under arrest as a conjurer, and as having been mixed up in some court 
intrigues, and at the request of Cardinal Wolsey he wrote an account of his 
adventures, still preserved in the Roll's House' records (for it is 
certainly addressed to Wolsey, and not, as has been supposed, to Cromwell).  
Stapleton says that he had been a monk of the mitred abbey of St. Benet in 
the Holm, in Norfolk, where he was resident in the' nineteenth year of Henry 
VIII. i.e. in 1527 or 1528, at which time he' borrowed of one Dennys, of 
Hofton, who had procured them of the vicar of Watton, a, book called 
Thesaurus Spirituum, and after that another, called Secreta Secretorum a 
little' ring, a plate, a circle, and also a sword for the' art of digging, 
in studying the use of which he spent six months. Now it appears that 
Stapleton had small taste' for early rising, and after having been 
frequently punished for being absent from matins and negligent of his duty 
in church he' obtained a licence of six months from the' abbot to go into 
the world, and try and raise money to buy a dispensation from an order which 
seemed so little agreeable to his taste. The first person he' consulted with 
was his friend Dennys, who recommended him to try his skill in finding 
treasure, and introduced him to two "knowing men," who had "placards" or 
licences from the king to search for treasure' trove, which were not 
unfrequently bought from the' crown at this period. These' men lent him 
other books and instruments belonging to the "art of digging," and they went 
together to a place named Sidestrand in Norfolk, to search and mark out the' 
ground where they thought treasure should lie'.  It happened, however, that 
the lady Tyrry, to whom the estate' belonged, received intelligence of their 
movements, and after sending for them and subjecting them to a close 
examination, ordered them to leave her grounds.
     After this rebuff, the treasure-seekers went to Norwich, where they 
became acquainted with another conjurer named Godfrey, who had a "shower" of 
spirit, " which spirit," Stapleton says, ' I had after myself," and they 
went together to Felmingham, and there Godfrey's boy did "scry" unto the 
spirit, but after opening the' ground they found nothing there.  There are 
Roman barrows 
at Felmingham, which, when examined recently, appeared to have been opened 
at a former period in search of treasure. The disappointed conjurers 
returned to Norwich, and there met with a stranger, who brought them to a 
house in which it was supposed that treasure lay concealed, and Stapleton 
again applied himself to his incantations, and called the spirit of the 
treasure to appear, hut he turned a deaf ear to their charms, " for I 
suppose of a truth," is the pithy observation of the operator, " that there 
was none."
     Disappointed and disgusted, Stapleton now gave up the pursuit.  In 
Norfolk, however, he soon met with some of his old treasure-seeking 
acquaintances, who urged him to go to work again, which he refused to do 
unless his books were better. They told him of a man of the name of Leech, 
who had a book, to which the parson of Lesingham had bound a spirit called " 
Andrea Malchus;" and to this man he went.  Leech let him have all his 
instruments, and told him further that the parson of Lesingham and Sir John 
of Leiston (another ecclesiastic) with others, had called up of late by the 
means of the book in question three spirits, Andrea Malchus (before 
mentioned), Oberion and Inchubus.  ' When these spirits," he said,  were all 
raised, Oberion would in nowise speak. And then the parson of Lesiogham did 
demand of Andrea Malchus, and so did Sir John of Leiston also, why Oberion 
would not speak to them.  And Andrea Malchus made answer,  For because he 
was bound unto the lord cardinal."  And that also they did entreat the said 
parson of Lesingham, and the said Sir John of Leiston, that they might 
depart as at that time ; and whensoever it might please them to call them up 
again, they would gladly do them any service they could."
     When Stapleton had made this important acquisition, he repaired again 
to Norwich, where he had not long been, when he was found by a messenger 
from the personage whom he calls the lord Leonard Marquees, who lived at 
Calkett Hall," and who wanted a person expert in the art of digging.  He met 
lord Leonard at Walsingham, who promised him that if he would take pains in 
exercising the said art he would sue out a dispensation for him to be a 
secular priest, and to make him his chaplain. The lord Leonard proceeded 
rather shrewdly to make trial of the searcher's talents  for he directed one 
of his servants to hide a sum of money in the garden, and Stapleton  hewed" 
for it, and one, Jackson "scryed," but he was unable to find the money.  
Yet, without being daunted at this slip Stapleton went directly with two 
other priests, Sir John Shepe and Sir Robert Porter, to a place beside Creke 
Abbey, where treasure was supposed t9 be, and Sir John Shepe called the 
spirit of the treasure, and I shewed to him, but all came to no purpose.
     Stapleton now went to hide his disappointment in Lon-don, and remained 
there some weeks, till the lord Leonard, who had sued out his dispensation 
as he promised, sent for him to pass the winter with him in Leicestershire, 
and towards spring he returned to Norfolk. And there he was informed that 
there was  much money" hidden in the neighbourhood of Calkett Hall, and 
especially in the Bell Hill (probably an ancient tumulus or barrow), and 
after some delay, he obtained his instruments, and went to work with the 
parish priest of Gorleston, but " of truth we could bring nothing to 
effect."  On this he again re-paired to London, carrying his instruments 
with him, and on his arrival he was thrown into prison at the suit of the 
lord Leonard, who accused him of leaving his service with-out permission, 
and all his instruments were seized. These he never recovered, but he was 
soon liberated from prison, and obtained temporary employment in the church.
     But his conjuring propensities seem still to have lingered about him, 
and we find this ex-monk and hermit, and now secular priest, soon afterwards 
engaged in an intrigue which led him eventually into a much more serious 
danger. It appears by Stapleton's statements, that one Wright, a servant of 
the Duke of Norfolk, came to him, and "at a certain season shewed me that 
the duke's grace, his master was soore vexed with a spyrytt by the 
enchantment of your grace" (he is addressing Wolsey).  Stapleton says, that 
he refused to interfere, but that Wright went to the duke and told him that 
he, Stapleton, knew of his being enchanted by Cardinal Wolsey, and that he 
could help him; upon which the duke sent for Stapleton, and had an interview 
with him.  It had previously been arranged by Wright and Stapleton (who says 
that he had been urged into the plot by the persuasion of Wright, and by the 
hope of gain and prospect of obtaining the duke's favour) that he should say 
he knew that the duke was persecuted by a spirit. and that he had "forged" 
an image of wax in his similitude, which he had enchanted, in order to 
relieve him. The Duke of Norfolk appears at first to have placed implicit 
belief in all that Stapleton told him ; he inquired of him if he had certain 
knowledge that the Lord Cardinal had a spirit at his command, to which he 
replied in the negative.  He then questioned him as to his having heard 
anyone assert that the cardinal had a spirit; on which Stapleton told him of 
the raising of Oberion by the parson of Lesingham and Sir John of Leiston, 
and how Oberion refused to speak, because he was the lord cardinal's spirit. 
The duke, however, soon after this, became either sus-picious or fearful, 
and he eventually sent Stapleton to the cardinal himself, who appears to 
have committed him to prison, and at whose order he drew up the account here 
abridged.
     The foregoing is the history of a man who, after having been a victim 
to his implicit belief in the efficiency of mag-ical operations was himself 
driven at last t(. have recourse to intentional deception. The number of 
such treasure-hunters appears to have been far greater among his con-
temporaries, of almost all the classes of society, than we should at first 
glance be led to suppose.  A few years before the date of these events, in 
the 12th year of Henry VIII., or A.D. 552, the king had granted to Robert, 
Lord Curzon, the monopoly of treasure-seeking in the counties of Norfolk and 
Suffolk, and Lord Curzon immediately delegated to a man, named William 
Smith, of Clopton, and a servant or retainer of his own, named Amylyon, not 
only the right of search thus given to him, but the power to arrest and 
proceed against any other person they found seeking treasures within the two 
counties.  It appears that Smith and Amylyon had in some eases used this 
delegated au-thority for purposes of extortion; and in the summer of the 
same year, Smith was brought up before the court of the city of Nonvich, at 
the suit of William Goodred, of Great Melton, the minutes of the proceedings 
against him still remaining on the records. We here again find priests 
concerned in these singular operations.
     It appears that the treasure-diggers, who had received their" placard" 
of Lord Curzon in March, went to Norwich about Easter, and paid a visit to 
the schoolmaster, named George Dowsing, dwelling in the parish of St. Faith, 
who, they had heard, was "seen in astronymye.  They shewed him their license 
for treasure-seeking, which authorised him to press into their service any 
persons they might find who had skill in the science; so that it would 
appear that they were not capable of raising spirits themselves. without the 
assistance of "scholars." The schoolmaster entered willingly into their 
project, and they went, about two or three o'clock in the morning, with one 
or two other persons who were admitted into their confidence, and dug in 
ground beside " Butter Rules," within the walls of the city, but " found 
nothing there." These " hilles," also, were probably tumuli. They next 
proceeded to a place called "Seynt William in the Wood by Norwich," where 
they excavated two days (or rather two nights), but with no better success.
     They now held a meeting at the house of one Saunders, in the market of 
Norwich, and called to their assistance two ecelesiastics, one named Sir 
William, the other Sir Robert Cromer, the former being the parish priest of 
St. Gregory's. At this meeting. George Dowsing raised "a spirit or two," in 
a glass; but one of the priests, Sir Robert Cromer, "began and raised a 
spirit first." This spirit, according to the depositions, was seen by two or 
three persons. Amylyon deposed that "he was at Saunders's where Sir Robert 
Cromer held up a stone, but he could not perceive anything in it; but that 
George Dowsing caused to rise in a glass a little thing of the length of an 
inch or thereabout, but whether it was a spirit or a shadow he cannot tell, 
but the said George said it was a spirit." However, spirit or no spirit, 
they seem to have had as little success as ever in discovering the treasure.
     Unable after so many attempts, to find the treasure themselves, they 
seem now to have resolved on laying a general contribution on everybody who 
followed the same equivocal calling. They went first and accused a person of 
the name of Wikman, of Morley Swanton, in the county of Norfolk, of "digging 
of hilles," and, by threatening to take him before Lord Curzon, they 
obtained from him ten shillings.  Under the same pretext, they took from a 
lime-burner of Norwich, named White, a " christal-stone," and twelvepenca in 
money in order that he" should not be put to further trouble." They took 
both books 
(prob-ably conjuring books) and money from John Wellys, of Hunworth, near 
Holt Market, whom, similarly, they ac-cused of "digging of hilles."  And of 
another person, labouring under the same charge', they took "a christal 
stone and certain money."
     With the era of Dr. Dee (q.v.) Edward Kelly, (q.v.) their school, a 
much more definite system of magico--astrology was evolved on English soil.  
Although Dee was credulous and Kelly was a rogue of the first water, there 
is little doubt that the former possessed psychic gifts of no mean 
character.  His most celebrated followers were William Lilly (q.v) and Elias 
Ashmole (q.v) not to speak of Simon Forman (q.v.) and Evans (q.v.).  Lilly 
gathered about him quite a band of magicians, Ramsey, Scott, Hodges, and 
others, not to speak of his "skryers" Sarah Skelhorm and Ellen Evans.  But 
these may be said to be the last of the practical magicians of England. 
Their methods were those of divination by crystal-gazing and evocation of 
spirits, combined with practical astrol-ogy.
     Spiritualism. For the beginnings of spiritualism in England we must go 
back to the middle of the seventeenth century when Maxwell and Robert Fludd 
(q.v.) flourished and wrote concerning the secrets of mysticism and mag-
netism.  Fludd was a Paracelsian pure and simple and regarded man as the 
microcosm of the universe iii minia-ture.  He was an ardent defender of the 
Rosicrucians, concerning whom he wrote two spirited works, as well as his 
great Tractalus Apologetic us and many other alchemi-cal and philosophical 
treatises. The part of the Tractates which deals with natural magic is one 
of the most authori-tative ever penned 9n the subject, and divides the 
subject most minutely into its several parts. Thomas Vaughan (q.v.) is 
likewise a figure of intense interest about this period.  He was a supreme 
adept of spiritual alchemy and his many works written under the Pseudonym of 
Eugenius Philalethes show him to have possessed an ex-alted mind. It is to 
men of this type, magi, perhaps, butnone the less spiritualists, that the 
whole superstructure of English spiritualism is indebted.

Ennemoser, Joseph (1787-1854) : A doctor and philosopher of Germany, who 
devoted himself largely to the study of magnetism.  He was made a professor 
at Bonn in 1819, and at Munich in 1841.  Among his works may be men-tioned 
his Histoire du magnetisme (1844); le Magnatisme dens ses rapports avec la

Enoch : Seventh master of the world after Adam, and author of the Kabala and 
Book of the Tarot.  He is identical with the Thoth of the Egyptians, the 
Cadmus of the Phoenicians, and the Palamedes of the Greeks. According to 
tradition he did not die, but was carried up to heaven, whence he will 
return at the end of time.


Enoch, Book of : An Apochryphal book of the Old Testa-ment, written in 
Hebrew about a century before Christ. The original version was lost about 
the end of the fourth century, and only fragments remained, but Bruce the 
trav-eller brought back a copy from Abyssinia, in 1773 in Ethiopia, probably 
made from the version known to the early Greek fathers.  In this work the 
spiritual world is minutely described, as is the region of Sheol (q.v.) the 
place of the wicked. The book also deals with the history of the fallen 
angels, their relations with the human species and the foundations of magic. 
The book says  "that there were angels who consented to fall from heaven 
that they might have intercourse with the daughters of earth. For in those 
days the sons of men having multiplied, there were born to them daughters of 
great beauty. And when the angels, or sons of heaven, beheld them, they were 
filled with desire; wherefore they said to one another: Come let us choose 
wives from among the race of man, and let us beget children’. Their leader 
Samyasa, answered there-upon and said: ' Perchance you will be wanting in 
the courage needed to fulfil this resolution, and then I alone shall be 
answerable for your fall.'  But they swore that they would in no wise repent 
and that they would achieve their whole design.  Now there were two hundred 
who de-scended on Mount Armon, and it was from this time that the mountain 
received its designation, which signifies Mount of the Oath.  Hereinafter 
follow the names of those angelic leaders who descended with this object: 
Sam-yasa, chief among all, Urakabarameel, Azibeel, Tamiel, Ramuel, Danel, 
Azkeel, Sarakuyal, Asael, Armers, 
Batraal, Anane, Zavebe, Sameveel, Ertrael, Turel, Jomiael, Arizial. They 
took wives with whom they had intercourse, to whom also they taught Magic, 
the art of enchantment and the diverse properties of roots and trees.  
Amazarac gave instruction in all secrets of sorcerers ; Barkaial was the 
mister of those who study the stars ; Akibeel mani-fested signs; and 
Azaradel taught the motions of the moon."  In this account we see a 
description of the pro-fanation of mysteries.  The fallen angels exposed 
their occult and heaven-born wisdom to earthly women, whereby it was 
profaned, and brute force taking advantage of the profanation of divine law, 
reigned supreme.  Only a deluge could wipe out the stain of the enormity, 
and pave the way for a restitution of the balance between the human and the 
divine, which had been disturbed by these unlawful revelations.  A 
translation of the Book of Enoch was pub-lished by Archbishop Lawrence in 
1821, the Etheopic text in 1838, and there is a good edition by Diliman 
(1851). Philippi and Ewald have also written special works on the subject.


Epworth, Poltergeist, The : In December, 1716, a disturbance of a 
poltergestic character broke out in the Parsonage of Epworth, the home of 
John Wesley. The evidence con-sists in contemporary letters written to 
Samuel Wesley by his mother and two of his sisters ; letters written nine 
years after the events to John Wesley by his mother and four of his sisters, 
and a copy of an account by Samuel Wesley the elder. The disturbances, 
consisting of rappings, loud and varied noises, were heard by every member 
of the household. Mrs. Wesley says in a letter, " Just as we (Mr. and Mrs. 
Wesley) came to the bottom of the broad stairs, having hold of each other, 
on my side there seemed as if somebody had emptied a bag of money at my 
feet, and on his as if all the bottles under the stairs (which were many) 
had been dashed in a thousand pieces." The dis-turbances lasted for about 
two months, though occasional manifestations were heard after that period.  
Hetty, one of the five daughters of the Wesley household, is the only one 
who has not left a record of her experiences, although it would seem that 
the poltergeist was most active in her neighbourhood.


Equilibrium : Magical harmony depends upon equilibrium. In occult operations 
if the will of the operator be always at the same tension and directed along 
the same line, moral impotence will ensue.   (See Levi-Ceremonial Magic.)


Eric of the Windy Hat : According Hector of Boece, the king of Sweden, Eric 
or Henry, surnamed the Windy Hat, could change the wind merely by turning 
his hat or cap on his head, to show the demon with whom he was in league 
which way he wished the wind to blow.  The demon obeyed the signal so 
promptly that the king's hat might have served the people for a weather-
cock.


Eromanty : One of six kinds of divination practised among the Persians by 
means of air. They enveloped their heads in a napkin and exposed to the air 
a vase filled with water, over which they mutter in a low voice the objects 
of their desires.  If the surface of the air shows bubbles it is re-garded 
as a happy prognostication.


Esdaile : (See Hypnotism.)


Eskimos : The religion of the Eskimos is still to a great extent in the 
magical stage. Their shamans or medicine-men, whom they call Angekok partake 
more of the character of magicians than that of priests and they invariably 
consult them before starting on a hunting expedition, or when prostrated by 
illness. The nature of the ceremonies em-ployed on those occasions may be 
inferred from the account of Captain Lyon, who on one occasion employed an 
angekok named Toolemak, to summon a Tomga or familiar spirit in the cabin of 
a ship.
     All light having been carefully excluded from the scene of operations, 
the sorcerer began by vehemently chanting to his wife, who, in her turn, 
responded with the Amna-aya, the favourite song of the Eskimo. This lasted 
throughout the ceremony.  Afterwards, Toolemak began to turn him-self round 
very rapidly, vociferating for Tomga, in a loud powerful voice and with 
great impatience, at the same time blowing and snorting like a walrus.  His 
noise, agitation, and impatience increased every moment, and at length he 
seated himself on the deck, varying his tones, and making a rustling with 
his clothes.
     Suddenly the voice seemed smothered, and was so man-aged as to give the 
idea that it was retreating beneath the deck, each moment becoming more 
distant, and ultimately sounding as if it were many feet below the cabin, 
when it ceased entirely.  In answer to Captain Lyon's queries, the 
sorcerer's wife seriously declared that he had dived and would send up 
Tomga.
     And, in about half a minute, a distant blowing was heard
approaching very slowly, and a voice differing from that which had first 
been audible was mixed with the blowing, until eventually both sounds became 
distinct, and the old beldame said that Tomga had come to answer the 
stranger's questions. Captain Lyon thereupon put several queries to the 
sagacious spirit, receiving what was under-stood to be an affirmative or a 
favourable answer by two loud slaps on the deck.
     A very hollow yet powerful voice, certainly differing greatly from that 
of Toolemak, then chanted for some time, and a singular medley of hisses, 
groans, and shouts, and gobblings like a turkey's followed in swift 
succession. The old woman sang with increased energy, and as Captain Lyon 
conjectured that the exhibition was intended to astonish " the Kabloona," he 
said repeatedly that he was greatly terrified.  As he expected, this 
admission added fuel to the flame, until the form immortal, exhausted by its 
own might, asked leave to retire. The voice gradually died away out of 
hearing, as at first, and a very indistinct hissing succeeded.  In its 
advance it sounded like the tone produced by the wind upon the bass cord of 
an AEolian harp; this was soon changed to a rapid hiss, like that of a 
rocket, and Toolemak with a yell, announced the spirit's return.
     At the first distant sibilation Captain Lyon held his breath, and twice 
exhausted himself; but the Eskimo conjurer did not once respire, and even 
his returning and powerful yell was uttered without previous pause or in-
spiration of air.
     When light was admitted, the wizard, as might be ex-pected, was in a 
state of profuse perspiration, and greatly exhausted by his exertions, which 
had continued for at least half an hour.  Captain Lyon then observed a 
couple of bunches, each consisting of two strips of white deerskin and a 
long piece of sinew, attached to the back of his coat. These he had not seen 
before, and he was gravely told that they had been sewn on by Tomga while he 
was below.
     The angekoks profess to visit the dwelling-place of the spirits they 
invoke and give circumstantial descriptions of these habitations. They have 
a firm belief in their own powers.
     Dr. Kane considers it a fact of psychological interest, as it shows 
that civilised or savage wonder-workers form a single family, that the 
angekoks have a firm belief in their own powers.   “I have known, he says”, 
“ several of them personally, and can speak with confidence on this point.  
I could not detect them in any resort to jugglery or natural magic; their 
deceptions are simply vocal, a change of voice, and perhaps a limited 
profession of ven-triloquism, made more imposing by the darkness." They 
have, however, like the members of the learned professions everywhere else, 
a certain language or jargon of their own, in which they communicate with 
each other.
     While the angekoks are the dispensers of good, the iss-intok, or evil 
men, are the workers of injurious spells, en-chantments, and metamorphoses.  
Like the witches of both Englands, the Old and the New, these malignant 
creatures are rarely submitted to trial until they have suffered punishment-
the old ' Jeddart justice "castigat auditque. Two of them, in 1818, suffered 
the penalty of their crime on the same day, one at Kannonak, the other at 
Upernavik. The latter was laudably killed in accor-dance with the "old 
custom"      custom being every-where the apology for any act revolting to 
moral sense. He was first harpooned, then disembowelled; a flap let down 
from his forehead to cover his eyes and prevent his seeing again-he had, it 
appears, the repute of an evil eye;-and then small portions of his heart 
were eaten, to ensure that he should not come back to earth un-changed."


Esoteric Languages : Artificial languages invented by certain castes for the 
better preservation of secrets, or for the purpose of impressing the vulgar 
with the mysteries and superior nature of those who employed the tongues in 
question. "They conversed with one another in eager undertones in a language 
I did not understand."  This is one of the stock phrases of the mystery 
novel of the nineteenth century, and has probably given rise to a great deal 
of misconception as to the true character and multi-pliticy of esoteric 
tongues.  As a matter of fact, these are particularly rare.  It is stated by 
several ancient authors that the Egyptian priests possessed a secret 
language of their own; but what its nature was we are unable to state, as no 
fragments of it are now extant,-probably because it was not reduced to 
writing. At the same time many 
Egyptian magical formulae are in existence (See Egypt) which teem with words 
and expressions of secret meaning; but examination of these shows that they 
are merely foreign, usually Syrian, words slightly changed. We know, for 
example, that the secret dialects of the medicine-men among the North-
American Indians are chiefly composed either of archaic expressions or the 
idioms of other tribes.  But there are examples of the de-liberate 
manufacture of a secret tongue, such as the Shelta Than (q.v) or language of 
the ancient caste of bronze--workers, still spoken by the tinkler classes of 
Great Britain, and the secret language of the Ndembo caste (q.v.) of the 
Lower Congo.  It is probable that the Jewish priesthood cast a veil of 
secrecy over the sacred names of the Deity, and the higher ranks of their 
heavenly hierarchy, by sub-stituting other names for them, such as " Adonai" 
for "Jahveh." This of course arose from the Egyptian con-ception that the 
name of the god must be concealed from the vulgar, as to know it was to 
possess magical power over the deity.  The spells and incantations of 
medieval magic are full of oriental names and idioms, but much jargon also 
found its way into these.  It was considered in the middle ages that the 
primitive language of the world was lost to man, and it was thought that 
this might only be recovered through magical agency, or the reversion to a 
state of complete innocence. Others believed it to be Hebrew ; and it is on 
record that James IV. of Scotland isolated two infants on the island of 
Inchkcith, in the Firth of Forth along with a dumb woman who cared for them 
and that in course of time they ' spak gude Ebrew."  A similar tradition 
acquaints us with the circumstance that a certain Egyptian king isolated two 
children in a like manner, who on coming to the period of speech met the 
first persons they beheld after their time of solitude with the word beccos, 
the Greek for bread.  But these instances, it is unnecessary to say, are 
purely legendary.  In many savage tribes, secret jargons or dialects are in 
use among the priesthood or the initiated of secret societies ; and in 
several brotherhoods of modern origin, symbolic words are constantly in use 
for the purpose of veiling veritable meaning. The Rosicrucians (q.v.) are 
said to have con-stituted and employed an arcane tongue.


Esplanadian : A medieval Spanish legend. It tells how Ama-die of Gaul and 
his wife Oriana of the Firm Island had the wicked enchanter Archelous in 
their keeping, but set him free in answer to his wife's entreaties.  Certain 
calamities happen which are attributed to Archelous, and Amadis' son 
Esplandian is carried off by the enchantress Urganda. The legend goes on to 
relate Esplandian's adventures, how he is given a magic sword, and kills a 
dragon.  With this sword he succeeds in killing Archelous himself, and his 
nephew, and he then sets free a kinsman.  His next oppo-nent is Matroed, son 
of Arcobone, whom he also vanquishes; and finally the stronghold of 
Archelous is utterly destroyed, and the land freed from the pagan influence 
of Matroed.

Essenes, The : A mystical Jewish sect, the tenets of which are only partly 
known.  They first appeared in history about 150 years B.C. They were very 
exclusive and pos-sessed an organisation peculiar to themselves. They ex-
ercised strict asceticism, and great benevolence. They had fixed rules for 
initiation, and a succession of strictly separate grades. Their system of 
thought deviated greatly from the normal development of Judaism, and was 
more in sympathy with Greek philosophy and oriental ideas. The tendency of 
the society was practical, and they re-garded speculation on the universe as 
too lofty for the human intellect.  So far as can be judged there was 
nothing occult in their beliefs.


Etain : The second wife of Midir the Proud, of Irish fame. Fuamnach, Midir's 
first wife, became jealous of her beauty and turned her into a butterfly, 
and she was blown out of the palace by a magic storm.  For seven years she 
was tossed hither and thither through Ireland, but then was blown into the 
fairy palace of Angus on the Boyne.  He could not release her from the 
spell, but during the day she fed on honey-laden flowers, and by night in 
her natural form gave Angus her love.  Fuamnach discovered her hiding-place, 
and sent a dreadful tempest which blew Etain into the drinking-cup of Etar, 
wife of an Ulster chief.  Etar swallowed her, but she was born her daughter, 
and as such married Eochy, High King of Ireland.


Ether : sometimes spoken of as koilon is in theosophic as in scientific 
teaching, all pervading. filling all space and inter-penetrating all matter.  
Despite this, it is of very great density, 10,000 times more dense than 
water and with a pressure of 750 tons per square inch.  It is capable of 
being known only by clairvoyants of the most highly developed powers. This 
ether is filled with an infinitude of small bubbles pretty much like the 
air-bubbles in treacle or some such viscid substance, and these were formed 
at some vastly remote period by the infusion of the breath of the Logos into 
the ether, or, as Madame Blavatsky phrased it, they are the holes which 
Fohat, the Logos, dug in space. Of these bubbles-not of the ether-matter is 
built up in its degree of density varying with the number of bubbles com-
bined together to form each degree.  
(See Solar System, Theosophy.)


Etheric Double : is, in Theosophy, the invisible part of the ordinary, 
visible, physical body which it interpenetrates and beyond which it extends 
for a little, forming with other finer bodies the " aura " (q.v.) The term 
etheric is used because it is composed of that tenuous matter by the vi-
brations of which the sensation of light is conveyed to the eye.  This 
matter, it must however be noted is not the omnipresent ether of space, hut 
is composed of physical matter known as etheric, super-etheric, sub-atomic, 
and atomic. The term double is used because it is an exact replica of the 
denser physical body. The sense organs of the etheric double are the 
chaksams (q.v.) and it is through these chaksams (q.v.) that the physical 
body is supplied with the vitality necessary for its existence and its well-
being during life. The etheric double thus plays the part of a conductor, 
and it also plays the part of a bridge between. the physical and astral 
bodies, for without it man could have no communication with the astral world 
and hence neither thoughts nor feelings.  Anaesthetics for instance drive 
out the greater part of the double, and the subject is then impervious to 
pain.  During sleep it does not leave the physical body, and, indeed, in 
dreams the etheric part of the brain is extremely active, especially when, 
as is often the case, the dreams are caused by attendant physical 
circumstances, such as noise. Shortly after death, the etheric double 
finally quits the physical body  though it does not move far away from that 
body, but is composeed of the four subdivisions of physical matter above 
alluded to. With the decay of the latter, the double also decays and thus to 
a clairvoyant, a, burying ground presents a most unpleasant sight.  (See 
also Vitality, Etheric Vision, Theosophy, Shell.)


Etheric Vision : is in Theosophy, the power of sight peculiar to the Etheric 
Double (q.v.). It is of considerably greater power than physical vision, and 
by its aid many of the phenomena of the physical world may be examined as 
may also many creatures of a non-human nature which are ordinarily just 
outside the range of physical vision. It responds readily to stimuli of 
various kinds and be-comes active under their influence.


Ethlinn : Daughter of Balor, King of the Fomorians of Irish magical legend. 
She was Balor's only child, and as he had been informed by a druid that he 
would be killed by his grandson, he had Ethlinn imprisoned in a tower and 
guarded by twelve women, who were forbidden to tell her that such beings as 
men existed.  Balor stole a magic cow from Kian, who in revenge obtained 
access to Ethlinn dis-guised as a woman. They had three children whom Balor 
ordered to be drowned; but one of them fell from the nap-kin in which they 
were being taken to their doom, and was carried off by the Druidess Birog to 
its father Kian. This child became Lugh, the great sun-god, who eventually 
fulfilled the prophecy and killed his grandfather. Balor.



Etteilla :  An eighteenth century student of the Tarot.  By profession he 
was a barber, his true name being Alliette; but on entering upon his occult 
labours he read it backwards, after the Hebrew fashion-Eteilla. He had but 
little education, and was ill acquainted with the philosophy of the 
initiates. Nevertheless he possessed a profound in-tuition, and, if we 
believe Eliphas Levi, came very near to unveiling the secrets of the Tarot.  
Of his writings Levi 'says that they are "obscure, wearisome, and in style 
bar-barous."  He claimed to have revised the Book of Thot, 'but in reality 
he spoilt it, regarding as blunders certain cards whose meaning he had 
failed to grasp. It is com-monly admitted that he failed in his attempt to 
elucidate the Tarot, and ended by transposing the keys, thus destroy-ing the 
correspondence between the numbers and the signs. It has also been said of 
him that he had degraded the science of the Tarot into the cartomancy, or 
fortune-telling by cards, of the vulgar.


Evergreens : The custom of decorating houses at Christmas-tide with 
evergreen plants-holly, ivy, box, laurel, mistletoe - is sometimes said to 
have originated when Christianity was introduced into this country, to 
typify the first British church, built of evergreen boughs. More probably it 
ex-tends back into antiquity.  In Druidic times people dec-orated their 
houses with evergreen plants so that the sylvan spirits might repair thither 
to shelter from the severity of winter, till their leafy bowers should be 
renewed.


Everitt, Mrs. : An English medium who gave private seances so early as 1855. 
To these sessions were admitted her private friends, and enquirers 
introduced by them. when a prayer had been said and the lights turned out 
the spirits manifested themselves by raps, table-tiltings, lights and spirit 
voices. Mr. Morell Theobald, a prominent spiritu-alist, was neighbour and 
friend to Mr. and Mrs. Everiti, and was first attracted to the subject 
through their in-strumentality.


Evocations : (See Necromancy.)


Evolution of Life : according to theosophlsts, began when the Logos, in his 
second aspect, sent forth the second life wave. This life wave descends from 
above through the various worlds causing an increasing heterogeneity and 
thereafter ascends, causing a return to its original homo-geneity. Our 
present state of knowledge of life in these worlds extends no farther than 
the mental world.  In the higher division of that world it has ensouled the 
relatively fine matter appropriate thereto-if that matter is atomic it is 
known as "monadic essence" if non-atomic, as "ele-mental essence," and this 
is known as the first elemental kingdom. What we may call the inhabitants of 
this king-dom are the higher order of angels. The life wave having 
functioned sufficiently long in the higher mental world, now presses down to 
the lower level of that world, where it appears as the second elemental 
kingdom, the inhab-itants of which are some of the lower orders of angels, 
the Form Devas. Again pressing down, the life wave manifests itself in the 
astral world, forming the third elemental king-dom, the inhabitants of which 
are the lowest orders of angels, the Passion Devas.  It now enters the 
physical world and, in the fourth elemental kingdom, ensouls the etheric 
part of minerals with the elementary type of life which these possess. The 
middle of this kingdom repre-sents the farthest descent of 'the life wave, 
and thereafter its course is reversed and it commences to ascend. The next 
kingdom into which it passes is the fifth elemental kingdom, the vegetable 
world, whence it passes to the sixth elemental kingdom, the animal world, 
and lastly to the seventh elemental kingdom, man.  During its stay in each 
kingdom, the life wave progresses gradually from elementary to highly 
specialised types and when it has attained these latter, it passes to the 
next kingdom. This, of course, of necessity means that successive currents 
of this great second life wave have come forth from the Logos, since, if it 
were otherwise, there would be only one kingdom in existence at a time.  In 
each kingdom, also, the souls of the bodies which inhabit it differ from 
those of the other kingdoms. Thus, in the seventh kingdom, that of man, each 
individual has a soul.  In the animal kingdom on the contrary, one soul is 
distributed among diff-erent bodies, the number of which varies with the 
state of evolution.  To one soul may be allotted countless bodies of a low 
type of development, but, as the development increases, the soul comes to 
have fewer bodies allotted to it until in the kingdom of man there is but 
one.


Exorcism : To exorcise, according to the received definitions, says Smedley, 
is to bind upon oath, to charge upon oath, and thus, by the use of certain 
words, and performance of certain ceremonies, to subject the devil and other 
evil spirits to command and exact obedience. Minshew calls an "exorcist" a 
"conjuror;" and it is so used by Shakespeare; and exorcism, "conjuration."  
It is in the general sense of casting out evil spirits, however, that the 
word is now understood.
     The trade of exorcism has probably existed at all times In Greece, 
Epicurus and AEschines, were sons of women who lived by this art, and each 
was bitterly reproached, the one by the Stoics, theother by Demosthenes, for 
having assisted his parent in her dishonourable practices.
     We read in the Acts of the Apostles (XIX. 13) of the failure and 
disgrace of" certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists," who, like the 
Apostles. "took upon them to call over them that had evil spirits the Name 
of the Lord Jesus." " God," says Josephus, " enabled Solomon to learn that 
skill which expels demons, which is a science useful and sanative to men.  
He composed such incantations also, by which distempers are alleviated, and 
he left behind him the man-ner of using exorcisims, by which they drive away 
demons, so that they never return.  And this method of cure is of great 
force unto this day; for I have seen a certain man of my own country, whose 
name was Eleazar, releasing people that were demoniacal, in the presence of 
Vespasian and his sons, and his captains, and the whole multitude of his 
soldiers. The manner of the cure was this.  He put a ring that had a root of 
one of those sorts mentioned by Solomon to the nostrils of the demoniac, 
after which he drew out the demon through his nostrils; and when the man 
fell down immediately, he adjured him to return unto him no more, making 
still mention of Solomon, and reciting the incantation which he composed.  
And when Eleazar would persuade and demonstrate to the spectators that he 
had such a power, he set, a little way off, a cup or basin full of water, 
and commanded the demon as he went out of the man to overturn it. and 
thereby to let the spectators know that he had left the man."  Some pre-
tended fragments of these conjuring books of Solomon are noticed in the 
Codex Pseudepigraphus of Fabricus; and Josephus himself has described one of 
the antidemo-niacal roots, in a measure reminiscent of the perils attendant 
on gathering the  mandrake." Another frag-ment of antiquity bearing on this 
subject is the exorcism practised by Tobit, upon which it is by no means 
easy to pronounce judgment. Grotius, in a note on that history, states that 
the Hebrews attributed all diseases arising from natural causes to the 
influence of demons; and this opinion it is well known, has been pushed much 
farther than Grotius intended, by Hugh Farmer and others of his school. 
These facts are derived in great measure from Bekker's most ingenious, 
though forgotten volumes Le Monde Enchonte, to which the reader may be 
referred for almost all that can be written on the necessity of exorcism.
      Bekker relates an instance of exorcism practised by the modern Jews, 
to avert the evil influence of the demon Lilis, whom the Rabbis esteem to be 
the wife of Satan.  During the hundred and thirty years, says Rabbi Elias, 
in his Thisbi which elapsed before Adam was married to Eve, he was visited 
by certain she devils, of whom the four principal were Lilis, Naome, Ogere, 
and Machalas; these, from their commerce with him, produced a fruitful 
progeny of spirits.  Lilis still continues to visit the chambers of women 
recently delivered, and endeavours to kill their babes, if boys on the 
eighth day, if girls, on the twenty-first, after their birth.  In order to 
chase her away, the attendants describes circles on the walls of the 
chamber, with charcoal, and within each they write,  Adam, Eve, Lilis, 
avaunt!" On the door also of the chamber they write the names of the three 
angels who preside over medicine, Senoi, San-senoi, and Sanmangelof,-a 
secret which it appears was taught them, somewhat unwittingly, by Lilis 
herself.
     A particular ecclesiastical order of exorcists does not appear to have 
existed in the Christian church till the close of the third century; and 
Mosheim attributes its intro-duction to the prevalent fancies of the 
Gnostics.  In the Xth. Canon of the Council of Antioch, held A.D. 34' ex-
orcists are expressly mentioned in conjunction with subdeacons and readers, 
and their ordination is described by the IVth. Council of Carthage, 7.  It 
consisted, without any imposition of hands, in the delivery, by the Bishop 
of a book containing forms of exorcism, and directions that they should 
exercise the office upon " Energumens," whether baptized or only 
catechumens. The fire of exor-cism, as St. Augustine terms it, always 
preceded baptism. Catechumens were exorcised for twenty days previous to the 
administration of this sacrament.  It should be ex-pressly remarked, 
however, that in the case of such cate-chumens as were not at the same time 
energumens, these exorcisms were not directed against any supposed demoni-
acal possession. They were, as Cyril describes them, no more than prayers 
collected and composed out of the words of Holy Writ, to beseech God to 
break the dominion and power of Satan in new converts, and to deliver them 
from his slavery by expelling the spirit of wickedness and error.
     Thus in the Greek Church, as Rycaut mentions, before baptism, the 
priest blows three times upon the child to dispossess the devil of his seat; 
and this may be under-stood as symbolical of the power of sin over the 
unbap-tized, not as an assertion of their real or absolute possession.
     The exorcists form one of the minor orders of the Romish Church.  At 
their ordination the bishop addresses them as to their duties, and concludes 
with these words :-Take now the power of laying hands upon the energumens, 
and by the imposition of your hands, by the grace of the Holy Spirit, and 
the words of exorcism, the unclean spirits are driven from obsessed bodies.  
One of the completest man-uals for a Romish exorcist which ever was 
compiled, is a volume of nearly 1300 pages, entitled, Thesaurus Exor-
cismorum et Conjurationum terribilium, potentissimorum, efficacissimorumque, 
cum Practica probatissima, quibus, Spiritus matigni, Damones, malecifiaque 
omnia de corpori-bus humanis tanquam Flagellis Fustigusque fugantur, ex-
peltuntur.  Doctrinis refertissimus atque uberrimus ;  ad maximam 
Exorcistarum commodi-Tatem in lucem editus et recusus, Coloniae, 1608.  It 
contains the following Tracts F. Valerii Polydori Patavini, Ordinis Minor, 
etc. " Practica Exorcistarum,' ' two parts; F. Hieronymi Mengi Vitel-
lianensis,   Flagellum Daemonum;"  Ejusdem "Fustis Daemonium;" F. Zachariae 
Vicecomitis, " Complementum Artis Exorcistiae;"  Petri Antonii Stampae,  
"Fuga Satanae."
     From the first of these treatises, it appears that the en-ergumens were 
subjected to a very severe corporal as well as spiritual discipline.  They 
were first exercised in Prie-xorcizationes " which consist of confessions, 
postulations, protestations, concitations, and interrogations.  The ex-
orcisms themselves are nine in number : I. " ex Sanctis-nominibus Dci," 
which are thus enumerated, " Schem-hamphoras, Eloha, Ab, Bar, Ruachaccocies 
Jehovah, Tetragrammaton, Heheje, Haja hove vejhege, El Sabaoth, Agla, 
Adonai, Cados, Sciadai, Alpha and Omega, Agios and Yschiros. 0 Theos and 
Athanatos;  2. cx omnium Sanctorum ordine;  3.  ax priecipuis animadversione 
dignis Sanctorum Angelorum; 4.  ex actibus vitie glor-iosie Virg. Mariie ; 
5. ex gestis, Domini Nostri Jesu Christi; 6.	cx institutis venerabilium 
Sacramentorum;  7.  cx priecipuis S. Eceleslie Dogmatibus;  8.  
Apocacalypsis (Apocalypsews) Beati Joannis Apostoli."  All these are 
accompanied with appropriate psalms, lessons, litanies, prayers, and 
adjurations.  Then follow eight " Postexor-cizationes." The three first are 
to be used according as the demon is more or less obstinately bent on 
retaining possession.  If he is very sturdy, a picture of him is to be 
drawn, " effigie horribili ac turpi," with his name inscribed under it, and 
to be thrown into the flames, after having been signed with the cross, 
sprinkled with holy water and fumigated. The fourth and fifth are forms of 
thanksgiving and benediction after liberation. The sixth refers to  "In-
cubi" and " Succubi." The seventh is for a haunted house, in which the 
service varies during every day of the week. The eighth is to drive away 
demoniacal storms and tempests-for which purpose are to be thrown into a 
huge fire large quantities of Sabinae, Hupericonis, Palmae Christi, 
Arthemesize, Verbenae, Aristolochiae rotundae, Rutae, Aster, Attici, 
Sulphuris et Assae fetidae. The second part of the treatise " Dispersio 
Daemonum" contains many recipes for charms and amulets against possession.  
Be-sides these, there are directions for the diet and medicine of the 
possessed, as bread provided "contra Diaboli ne-quitiam at maleficiorum 
turbinem." Mutton " pro obsessi nutrimento atque Maleflcii at Diemonis 
detrimento." Wine pro maleficiatis nutriendis et maleficiis Diabolicisque 
quibuscunque infestationibus destruendis."  Holy water for the same purpose, 
whenever wine is forbidden.  A draught "ad omne maleficium indifferenter 
solvendum et Diabolum conterendum."  Four separate lavements and a night 
draught for the delirious; two emetics "pro ma-terialibus instrumentis 
maleficialibus emittendis." And finally, there is a conserve " virtuosius 
corroborativa ven-triculi  a  maleficialium  instrumentorum  materialium 
vomitione fessi."
     In the" Flagellum Daemonum "are contained numerous cautions to the 
exorcist himself, not to be deceived by the arts of the demon, particularly 
when he is employed with possessed women.  If the devil refuses to tell his 
name, the demoniac is to be fumigated.  If it be necessary to break off the 
exorcism before the evil spirits be wholly ex-pelled, they are to be adjured 
to quit the head, heart, and stomach of the energumen, and to abscond 
themselves in the lower parts of his body, "puta in ungues mortuos pedum?'
     In the " Fustis Daemonum  the exorcist is directed, whenever the evil 
spirit persists in staying, to load him with vituperative addresses.  After 
this railing latinity, redoubled precaution is necessary, and if the demons 
still refuse to tell their names, the knowledge of which is always great 
gain, the worst names that can be thought of are to be attributed to them, 
and fumigations resorted to. The seventh exorcism in this treatise is 
“mirabilis efficaciae pro his qui in matrimonis a Daemonibus vel maleficis 
diabolica arte impediuntur seu maleficiantur." Among other things, they are 
to be largely anointed with holy oil; and if all adjurations fail, they are 
to be strenuously exhorted to patience.  In the last form, dumbness is 
attacked, and a very effectual remedy against this infirmity is a draught of 
holy water with three drops of holy wax, swallowed on an empty stomach.
     Father Vicecomes, in his Complementum Artis Exor-cistiae, explains the 
several signs of possession or bewitch-ment ; also, in how many separate 
ways the evil spirit notifies his departure, sometimes by putting out the 
light, now and then by issuing like a flame, or a very cold blast, through 
the mouth, nose, or ears.  He then writes many prescriptions for emetics, 
perfumes, and fumigations, cal-culated to promote these results.  The writer 
concludes with a catalogue of the names of some of the devils of com-monest 
occurrence, which is of very narrow dimensions Astaroth, Baal, Cozbi, Dagon, 
Aseroth, Baalimm, Chamo, Beelphegor, Astarte, Bethage, Phogor, Moloch, 
Asmodaeus, Bele, Nergel, Melchon, Asima, Bel, Nexroth, Tartach, Acharon, 
Belial, Neabaz, Merodach, Adonides, Beaemot, Jerobaal, Socothbenoth, 
Beelzebub, Leviathan, Lucifer, Satan, Mahomet.
     The Fuga Satanae of Stampa is very brief, and does not contain any 
matter which deserves to be added to the much fuller instructions given by 
Mengs and, Vicecomes.  Several of the forms used by Mengs are translated and 
satirized, in the coarse ridicule which characterized those times, in a 
little tract entitled A Whip for the Devil, or the Roman Conjuror, 1683.  A 
century and a half before this, Erasmus had directed his more polished and 
delicate wit to the same object ; and his pleasant dialogue Exorcismus seu 
Spectrum is an agreeable and assuredly an unexaggerated picture of these 
practices.
     Those who desire to peruse a treatise on practical exor-cism should 
consult the Histoire admirable de la possession et conversion d'une 
Penitente, seduite par Un Magicien, Ia faisant Sorciere et Princesse des 
Sorciers, au pais de Provence, conduite a Ia Scte. Baume, pour y estre 
exorcizee, l'an MDCX. au mois de Novembre, soubs l'authorite de R.P.F. 
Sebastien Michaelis, Prieur de Convente Royale de la Scte. Magdalene' a S. 
Maximin et dudict lieu de la Scte. Baume, Paris, 1613. The possessed in this 
case, Magdelaine de Palha, was exorcised during -four months ; she was under 
the power of five princes of the devils, Beelzebub, Leviathan, Baalberith, 
Asmodeus and Astaroth, "avec plusieurs autres inferieurs." Beelzebub abode 
in her forehead, Leviathan in the middle of her head, Astaroth in the hinder 
part of it ; " la partie de la tete ou ils estoient faisoit, centre nature, 
un perpetual mouvement et battement ; estans sortis la partie ne bouge-oit 
point."
     A second sister of the same convent, Loyse, was also possessed by three 
devils of the highest degree, Verin, Gresil, and Soneillon ; and of these, 
Verin, through the proceedings of the exorcists, appears to have turned 
king's evidence, as it were ; for, in spite of the remonstrances and rage of 
Beelzebub, " qui commenca a rugir et a jetter des cris comme feroit un 
taureau echauffe," he gave important information and instruction to his 
enemies, and appeared grievously to repent that he was a devil.  The daily 
Acts and Examinations, from the 27th of November to the following 23rd of 
April, are specially recorded by the exorcist himself, and all the 
conversations of the devils are noted down verbatim.  The whole business 
ended in a tragedy, and Louis Gaufridi, a priest of Marseilles, who was 
accused of witchcraft on the occasion was burned alive at Aix.
    Michaelis is eminently distinguished in his line.  We find him three 
years afterwards engaged in exorcising three nuns in the convent of St. 
Brigette, at Lisle.  Whether the two unhappy women, Marie de Sains and her 
accom-plice, Simone Dourlet, who were supposed to have been the causes of 
this possession, were put to death or not, does not appear.  The proceedings 
may be found in a Histoire veritable et memorable de ce qui c'est passe sous 
l'Exorcisme de trois filles possedees an pais de Flandre, Paris 1623 ; and 
they are in some 'respects an appendix to those against Louis Gaufridi, 
whose imputed enormities are again related in a second volume of this work.
     This transaction appears to have been the work of super-stition alone; 
but one of far deeper dye, and of -almost unparalleled atrocity, occurred at 
Loudun (q.v.) in 1634, when Grandier (q.v.), cure and canon of that town, 
was mercilessly brought to the stake partly by the jealousy of some monks, 
partly to gratify the personal vengeance of Richelieu, who had been 
persuaded that this ecclesiest had lampooned him, an offence which he never 
forgave. Some Ursline nuns were tortured to feign themselves possessed, and 
Grandier was the person accused of having tenanted them with devils. 
Tranquille, one of the exor-cists, published a Veritable relation des juste 
procedures observees au fait de la possession des Ursulines de Loudun, et au 
proces de Grandier, Paris 1634; and by a' singular fatality, this reverend 
personage himself died within four years of the iniquitous execution of his 
victim, ill a state of reputed possession, probably distracted by the self-
accusations of remorse.
     The last acknowledgment of exorcism in the Anglican Church, during the 
progress of the Reformation, occurs in the first Liturgy of Edward VI. in 
which is given the following form at baptism  " Then let the priest, looking 
upon the children, say. ' I command thee, unclean spirit, in the name of the 
Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, that thou come out and depart 
from these infants, whey our Lord Jesus Christ has vouchsafed to call to His 
holy baptism, to be made members of His Body and of His Holy congregation. 
Therefore, thou cursed spirit, re-member thy sentence, remember thy 
judgment, remember the day to be at hand wherein thou shalt burn in fire 
ever-lasting prepared for thee and thy angels.  And presume not hereafter to 
exercise any tyranny towards these infants whom Christ hath bought with His 
precious blood, and by this His holy baptism calleth to be of His flock.' " 
On the remonstrance of Bucer, in his censure of the liturgy, that that 
exorcism was not originally used to any but de-moniacs, and that it was 
uncharitable to imagine that all were demoniacs who came to baptism, it was 
thought pru-dent by our reformers to omit it altogether, in their review of 
the liturgy in the 5th and 6th of Edward VI.
     The LXXIId canon thus expresses itself on exorcism, No minister shall, 
without the license of the bishop of the diocese, first obtained and had 
under his hand and seal,
-attempt upon any pretence whatever, either of obsession or possession, by 
fasting or prayer, to cast out any devil or devils: under pain of the 
imputation of imposture or cosenage, and deposition from the ministry."


Extispley, or Extispicium : so named from exta and spicere, to view, 
consider, was applied to the inspection of entrails chiefly. The officers 
were Extispices or Aruspices, and one of the instruments they used was 
called by the same name as the craft, an extispicium. The Erturians were the 
first and also the most learned, who practised extispicy, and Romulus is 
said to have chosen his first Aruspices from among them. The art was also 
practised throughout Greece, where it had a consecrated priesthood confined 
to two families.  The Roman Aruspices had four distinct duties, to examine 
the victims before they were opened, to examine the entrails, to observe the 
flame as the sacrifice was burnt, and also to examine the meat and drink-
offering which accompanied it.  It was a fatal sign when the heart was 
wanting, and this is said to have been the case with two oxen that were 
immolated on the day when Caesar was killed.  If the priest let the entrails 
fall, or there was more bloodiness than usual, or if they were livid in 
colour, it was understood to be a portent of instant disaster.  Itru-vius 
has attempted to account for the origin of extispicy by the custom of 
examining the viscera of animals, before settling an encampment, to 
ascertain if the neighbourhood was healthy, an explanation to which little 
value can be attached.


Eye-biters : In the time of Queen Elizabeth there came among the cattle of 
Ireland a disease whereby they grew blind. The witches to whose malevolence 
this evil was attributed were called eye-biters, and many of them were 
executed.



F


Fabre, Pierre Charles :  (French Alchemist - Fl. 1630.) Hardly any 
biographical details concerning this French alchemist are forthcoming. Mr. 
Waite, in his Lives of the Alchemystical Philosophers, declares that Fabre 
was a native of Montpellier; but we do not find any evidence to support this 
statement, and it is possible that he has confounded Fabre the alchemist 
with a painter of the same name, who was born at Montpellier, and after whom 
the Musee Fabre at that town is called. Pierre Jean Fabre appears to have 
been a doctor of medicine, and to have been renowned in his own day as a 
scholar of chemistry, a subject on which he compiled several treatises ; 
while, though it is not re-corded that he ever won any marked successes in 
the field of alchemy, he certainly wrote numerous things dealing wholly or 
partly with that topic. Of these the most im-portant are Alchimista 
Christianus and Hercules Pischy-micus, both published at Toulouse, the first 
in 1632, the second two years afterwards; and in the latter he maintains 
that the mythological" labours of Hercules " are allegories, embodying the 
arcana of hermetic philosophy. The phil-osopher's stone, he declares 
complacently, may be found in all compounded circumstances, and is formed of 
salt, mercury and sulphur.


Fagail : The  parting gift,, of the fairies, of Gaelic origin. This may be 
of a pleasant or unpleasant nature-it may be death, or the conversion of a 
man who worked badly, was ugly, and of rude speech, into the best workman, 
the best looking man, and the best speaker in the place.-Camp-bell's 
Superstitions of the Scottish Highlands.


Fairies: A species of supernatural beings, and one of the most beautiful and 
important of mythological conceptions. The belief in fairies is very ancient 
and widespread, and the same ideas concerning them are to be found among 
rude and uncultivated races as in the poesy of more civilised peoples.  Of 
British fairies there are several distinct kinds, and these differ 
considerably in their characteristics.  In Ireland, where the belief is 
strongest, the fairies are called good people," and are of a benevolent but 
capricious and mischievous disposition. The pixies of England are very 
similar. The industrious domestic spirit known as Puck, or Robin Goodfellow, 
is of the fairy kind ; so also are the brownies of Scotland.  It is supposed 
that the hard work of the latter has given them the swarthiness from which 
they take their name, the other being called fairies from their fairness.
     Scottish fairy mythology resembles that of Ireland, though of a more 
sombre cast.  In Highland Scotland fairies are called daoine sithe or " men 
of peace," and it is believed that every year the devil carries off a tenth 
part of them. They steal human children, and leave in their places fairy 
changelings, fretful, wizened, unchildish things. Flint arrow-heads are 
believed, both in Ireland and Scot-land, to be fairy weapons, and the water 
in which they are dipped is a cure for many ills.  Fairy music may often be 
heard in certain spots, and like the fairies themselves it is of exquisite 
beauty.  As in the myth of Persephone, mor-tals who eat or drink in 
fairyland are doomed to remain there for ever.  If a fairy marry with a 
human being, there is generally some condition imposed on the latter which, 
being broken, leads to his undoing. Many fairy legends are found all over 
Europe, varying a little with the locality but identical in their essential 
points.  The conception of fairies is probably animistic.  (See Animism.)


Fairfax, Edward: An English poet of the sixteenth century, author of a work 
on Demonology, wherein he treats some-what credulously of sorcery.


Faleonet, Noel  A physician who died in 1734.  Among his works was one

Familiars : Spirits attendant upon a magician, sorcerer, or witch. The idea 
probably arose out of that of fetishism (q.v.) especially as many familiars 
were supposed to reside in rings, lockets, or other trinkets worn by the 
wizard or sorcerer. From Delrio we learn that these spirits were called by 
the Greeks ' Paredrii," as being ever assiduously at hand; and by the 
Latins, beside " Familiares," ' Martinelli," or “Magistelli," for which 
names he does not assign any reason. The black dog of Cornelius Agrippa is 
among the best known familiars of modern times.  His story rests on the 
authority of Paulus Jovius, (" Elogia" ci.) and it has been copied by 
Thevet, among others, in his Hist. des Hommes plus Illustres et Scavans, 
XVIII.  Jovius relates that Agrippa was always accompanied by the devil in 
the shape of a black dog, and that, perceiving the approach of death, he 
took a collar ornamented with nails, disposed in magical inscriptions from 
the neck of the animal, and dismissed him with these memorable words, " Abi 
perdita Bestia quae me totum perdidisti."  (Away, accursed beast, through 
whose agency I must now sink into perdition.) The dog thus addressed, it is 
said, ran hastily to the banks of the Saone, into which he plunged headlong, 
and was never afterwards seen.  Le Loyer says :-" With regard to the demons 
whom they imprisoned in rings and charms, the magicians of the school of 
Salamanca and Toledo, and their master Picatrix, together with those in 
Italy who made traffic of this kind of ware, knew better than to say whether 
or not they had appeared to those who had been in possession or bought them.  
And truly I cannot speak without horror of those who pretend to such vulgar 
famili-arity with them, even to speaking of the nature of each particular 
demon shut up in a ring ; whether he be a Mer-curial, Jovial, Saturnine, 
Martial, or Aphrodisiac spirit in what form he is wont to appear when 
required ; how many times in the night he awakes his possessor ; whether 
benign or cruel in disposition ; whether he can be trans-ferred to another ; 
and if, once possessed, he can alter the natural temperament, so as to 
render men of Saturnine complexion Jovial, or the Jovials Saturnine, and so 
on. There is no end of the stories which might be collected under this head, 
to which if I gave faith, as some of the learned of our time have done, it 
would be filling my paper to little purpose.  I will not speak therefore of 
the crystal ring mentioned by Joalium of Cambray, in which a young child 
could see all that they demanded of him, and which eventu-ally was broken by 
the possessor, as the occasion by which the devil too much tormented him. 
Still less will I stay say pen to tell of the sorcerer of Courtray, whose 
ring had a demon enclosed in it, to whom it behoved him to speak every five 
days.  In fine, the briefest allusion must suffice to what they relate of a 
gentleman of Poiton, who had playfully taken from the bosom of a young lady 
a certain charm in which a devil was shut up.   Having thrown it into the 
fire," the story goes.," he was incessantly tor-mented with visions of the 
devil till the latter granted him another charm, similar to the one he had 
destroyed, for the purpose of returning to the lady and renewing her 
interest in him." Heywood writes, if not much more fully on the subject than 
Le Loyer does, and evidently attaches a far greater degree of credibility to 
the narratives which he brings forward.   “Grillandus is of opinion, that 
everie Magition and Witch, after they have done their homage to the devell, 
have a familiar spirit given to attend them, whom they call ' Magistellus,' 
' Magister,' ' Martinettus or Martinellus' " and these are sometimes visible 
to men in the shape of a dog, a rat, an aethiope, etc.  So it is re-ported 
of one Magdalena Crucia, that she had one of these paredni to attend her 
like a blackemore. Glycas tells us, that Simon Magus had a great black dog 
tyed in a chaine, who, if any man came to speak with him whom he had no 
desire to see was ready to devoure him.  His shadow like-wise he caused 
still to go before him ; making the people beleeve that it was the soule of 
a dead man who still at-tended him.
     These kindes of familiar spirits are such as they include or keepe in 
rings hallowed, in viols, boxes, and caskets not that spirits, having no 
bodies, can be imprisoned there against their wills, but that they seem to 
be confined of their own free-will and voluntarie action.
     “Johannes Leo writeth, that such are frequent in Africke, shut in 
caves, and bear the figure of birds called Aves Hano-latrices, by which the 
Magitions raise great summes of money, by predicting by them of things 
future. For being demanded of anv difficulty, they bring an answer written 
in a small scroll of paper, and deliver it to the magition in their bills. 
Martinus Anthonius Deirius, of the Society of Jesus, a ma of profound 
learning and judgment, writeth, that in Burdegell there was an advocate who 
in a viol kept one of these Paradrii inclosed.  Hee dying, his heires know-
mg thereof, were neither willing to keepe it, nor durst they break it  and 
demanding counsell, they were persuaded to go to thc Jesuit's Colledge, and 
to be directed by them. The fathers commanded it to be brought before them 
and broken; but the executors humbly besought them that it might not be done 
in their presence, being fearfull least some great disaster might succeed 
thereof.  At which they smiling, flung it against the wall, at the breaking 
thereof there was nothing seen or heard, save a small noise, as if the two 
elements of water and fire had nearly met together, and as soone parted.
     Philostratus tells us, that Apollonius Tyaneus was never without such 
rings ; and Alexander Neapolitanius affirmeth, that he received them of 
Jarcha, the great prince of the Gymnosophists, which he took of him as a 
rich pres-ent, for by them he could be acquainted with any deep secret 
whatsoever.  Such a ring had Johannes Jodocus Rosa, a citizen of 
Cortacensia, who every fifth day had conference with the spirit enclosed 
using it as a counsellor and director in all his affairs and interprises 
whatsoever. By it he was not only acquainted with all newes as well forrein 
as domesticke, but learned the cure and remedy for all griefs and diseases ; 
insomuch that he had the repu-tation of a learned and excellent physition. 
At length, being accused of sortilege or enchantment, at Ambam, in 
Guelderland, he was proscribed, and in the year 1548 the chancellor caused 
his ring, in the public market, to be layd upon an anvil, and with an iron 
hammer beaten to pieces.
     “Mengius reporteth from the relation of a deare friend of his (a man of 
approved fame and honestie) this historie. In a certain town under the 
jurisdiction of the Venetians, one of their praestigious artists (whom some 
call Python-ickes), having one of these rings, in which he had two fa-miliar 
spirits exorcised and bound, came to a predicant or preaching friar, a man 
of sincere life and conversation; and confessed unto him that bee was 
possessed of such an enchanted ring, with such spirits charmed, with whom he 
had conference at his pleasure. But since he considered with himselfe, that 
it was a thing dangerous to his soule, and abhominable both to God and man, 
he desired to be cleanly acquit of it, and to that purpose he came to 
receive of him some godly counsell.  But by no persuasion would the 
religious man be induced to have any speech at all with these evil spirits 
(to which motion the other had before earnestly solicited him), but 
admonished him to cause the magicke ring to be broken, and th4t to be done 
with all speed possible. At which words the familiars were heard (as it 
were) to mourne and lament in the ring, and to desire that no such violence 
might be offered unto them; but rather than so, that it would please him to 
accept the ring, and keepe it, promising to do him all service and 
vassallage of which, if he pleased to accept, they would in a short time 
make him to be the most famous and admired predicant in all Italy.  But he 
perceiving the devils cunning, under this colour of courtesie, made absolute 
refusall of their offer and withall conjured them to know the reason why 
they would so willingly submit themselves to his patronage ? After many 
evasive lies and deceptious answers, they plainly confessed unto him, that 
they had of purpose persuaded the magition to heare him preach ; that by 
that sermon, his conscience being pricked and galled, he might be weary of 
the ring, and being refused of the one, be accepted of the other ; by which 
they hoped in short time so to have puft him up with pride and heresie, to 
have percipitated his soule into certaine and never ending destruction.  At 
which the churchman being zealously inraged, with a great hammer broke the 
ring almost to dust, and in the name of God sent them thence to their own 
habitation of darkness, or whither it pleased the highest powers to dispose 
them.
     Of this kinde doubtlesse was the ring of Ggyes (of whom Herodotus doth 
make mention), by vertue of which he had power to walke invisible; who, by 
the murder of his sovereign Candaules, married his queene, and so became 
King of Lydia.  Such, likewise, had the Phocensian tyrant, who, as Clemens 
Stromaeus speaketh, by a sound which came of itselfe, was warned of all 
times, seasonable and unseasonable, in which to manage his affairs; who, 
not-withstanding, could not be forewarned of his pretended death, but his 
familiar left him in the end, suffering him to be slain, by the 
conspirators.  Such a ring, likewise, had one Hieronimus, Chancellor of 
Mediolanum, which after-wards proved to be his untimely ruine." (Hierarchie 
of the Blessed Angels, vii.; The Principats, p. 475 etc.)
     Sometimes the familiar annexed himself voluntarily to a master, without 
any exercise of magic skill or invocation on his part, nor could such a 
spirit be disposed of without exorcism, as we learn from the following story 
cited by Delrio (vi., c. ii., s. 3., q. 3.) :- " A certain man (pater 
familias-head of a family), lived at Trapani, in Sicily, in whose house it 
is said, in the year 1585, mysterious voices had been heard for a period of 
some months.  This familiar was a daemon, who, in various ways, endeavoured 
to annoy man.  He had cast huge stones, though as yet he had broken ho 
mortal head ; and he had even thrown the domestic vessels about, but without 
fracturing any of them. When a young man in the house played and sung, the 
demon, hearing all, accompanied the sound of the lute with lascivious songs, 
and this distinctly.  He vaunted himself to be a daemon; and when the master 
of the house, together with his wife, went away on business to a certain 
town, the daemon volunteered his company.  When he returned, however, soaked 
through with rain, the spirit went forward in advance, crying aloud as he 
came, and warning the servants to make up a good fire," etc.  In spite of 
these essential services, the paterfamilias called in the aid of a priest 
and expelled the familiar, though not without some difficulty.
     A learned German physician has given an instance in which the devil of 
his own accord enclosed himself in a ring as a familiar, thereby proving how 
dangerous it is to trifle with him.
     Paracelsus was believed to carry about with him a familiar in the hilt 
of his sword.  Naude assures us, that he never laid this weapon aside even 
when he went to bed, that he often got up in the night and struck it 
violently against the floor, and that frequently when overnight he was 
without a penny, he would show a purseful of gold in the morning.  (Apologie 
pour les Grands Hommes soup-coonez de Magie, xiv., p. 281.)  After this, we 
are not a little disconcerted with the ignoble explanation which he gives of 
this reputed demon, namely, that although the alchemists maintain that it 
was no other than the philo-sopher's stone, he (Naude) thinks it more 
rational to believe, if indeed there was anything at all in it, that it was 
two or three doses of laudanum, which Paracelsus never went without, and 
with which he effected many strange cures.
     The feats of Kelly, " Speculator" to Dr. Dee, may be read in the life 
of the last-named writer.  Of Dr. Dee him-self and the spirits Ash, Il, Po, 
Va, and many others, who used to appear to him, by Kelly's ministry, in a 
beryl, much may be found in Merie Casaubon's Relation of what passed for 
many years between Dr. John Dee and some spirits.  This narrative comprises 
the transactions of four-and-twenty years, from 1583 to 1607.  Familiars 
partook of that jealousy which is always a characteristic of spiritual 
beings, from the time of Psyche's Cupid down-wards, in their intercourse 
with mortals.  This feeling is strongly exemplified in a narrative given by 
Froissart, and translated by Lord Berners, which relates : - " How a 
spyrite, called Orthone, served the lorde of Corasse a long time, and 
brought euer tidynges from all parts of the worlde."

Fascination : From Latin fascinare, to enchant.  The word in its general 
acceptation signifies charm, enchant, to bewitch, by the eyes, the looks ; 
generally, to charm or enchant; to hold or keep in thraldom by charms, by 
powers of pleasing.
     A belief in Fascination (strictly so called) appears to have been very 
generally prevalent in most ages and countries. For its existence in Greece 
and Rome we may quote the wish of Theocritus that an old woman might be with 
him to avert this ill by spitting, or the complaint of Menalcas, in Virgil, 
that some evil eye has fascinated his lambs. The Romans, indeed, with their 
usual passion for increasing the host of heaven, deified this power of ill, 
and enrolled a god fascinus " among their objects of worship.  Although he 
was a" numen," the celebration of his rites was intrusted by a singular 
incongruity, to the care of the vestal virgins and his phallic attribute was 
suspended round the necks of children and from the triumphal chariots.  
Lucretius, writing Of Natural Witchcraft for Love, etc., says :  “But as 
there is fascination and witchcraft by malicious and angry eyes unto 
displeasure, so are there witching aspects tending contrariwise to love, or, 
at the least, to the procur-ing of good will and liking.  For if the 
fascination or witch-craft be brought to pass or provoked by the desire, by 
the wishing or coveting any beautiful shape or favour, the venom is strained 
through the eyes, though it be from afar, and the imagination of a beautiful 
form resteth in the heart of the lover, and kindleth the fire where it is 
afflicted. And because the most delicate, sweet and tender blood of the 
beloved doth there wander, his countenance is there represented, shining in 
his own blood, and cannot there be quiet, and is so haled from thence, that 
the blood of him that is wounded, reboundeth, and slippeth into the 
wounder."
     Vairus, Prior of the Benedictine Convent of Sta. Sophia in Benevento, 
published a Treatise, Dc Fascino, in 1589. He first points to whole nations 
which have been reported to possess the power of fascination. Thus the 
idolatrous  “Biar-bi" and " Hamaxobii," on the authority of Olaus Magnus, 
are represented to be " most deeply versed in the art of fascinating men, so 
that by witchcraft of the eyes, or words, or of aught else (a very useful 
latitude of expression) they so compel men that they are no longer free, nor 
of sane understanding, and often are reduced to extreme emaci-ation, and 
perish by a wasting disease."  He then proceeds to similar marvels 
concerning animals.  Wolves, if they see a man first, deprive him of all 
power of speech ; a fact yet earlier from Theocritus.  The shadow of the 
hyaena produces the same effect upon a dog; and this sagacious wild beast is 
so well acquainted with its own virtue, that whenever it finds dog or man 
sleeping, its first care is to stretch its length by the side of the 
slumberer, and thus ascertain his comparative magnitude with its own. If 
itself be larger of the two, then it is able to afflict its prey with 
madness, and it fearlessly begins to nibble his hands or paws (whichever 
they may be) to prevent resistance ; if it be smaller, it quietly runs away.  
It may be as well to know, (though not immediately bearing on fascination), 
that an attack from an hyaena, if it approaches on the right hand, is 
peculiarly dangerous; if from the left, it may be beaten off without much 
trouble.  Lastly, tortoises lay  their eggs and afterwards hatch them, as is 
very credibly affirmed, by virtue of their eyes alone.     
     The tenth chapter of the First Book of Vairus inquires : “An aliqui se 
fascinare possint ? " a question which is decided in the affirmative, by the 
example of the Basilisk of Narcissus, and of one less known, though equally 
un-fortunate, Eutelis.  In the twelfth chapter he affirms. that the more 
wicked any person is, the better is he adapted to exercise evil fascination.  
From this book we may extract two useful cautions :   Let no servant ever 
hire himself to a squinting master, and let jewellers be cautious to whose 
hands, or rather eyes, they intrust their choicest wares.   A friend of 
Vairus told him, that he had seen a person who was gifted with an eye of 
such fascinating power, that once while he was looking attentively on a 
precious stone of fine water, exquisite cutting, and admirable polish, in 
the hands of a lapidary, the jewel of its own accord split into two parts.
     In his Second Book, after disputing against "natural" fascination, 
which he treats as visionary, Vairus determines that all fascination is an 
evil power, attained by tacit or open compact with the devil.
     A second writer on this matter is John Lazarus Gutierrez, a Spanish 
physician, who may be believed to be equally well qualified for the 
consideration of mystery.  His Opusculum de Fascino appeared in 1653.  On 
his own experience he does not state much, but in his Dubium (III.) he cites 
Mendoza for an account of a servant of a Tyrolese nobleman, who could bring 
down a falcon from her very highest flight by steadily looking at her.  From 
Antonius Carthaginensis, also, he produces two other wonders. The first, of 
a man in Guadalazara, who was in the habit of breaking mirrors into minute 
fragments solely by looking at them ; the second, of another in Ocana, who 
used. to kill his own children, as well as those of other folks, by the 
contagion of his eyes; nay, still more, occasionally, in like manner, to be 
the cause of death to many valuable horses.
     From Cardan, Gutierrez extracts the following symptoms by which a 
physician may determine that his patient is fascinated :-Loss of colour, 
heavy and melancholy eyes, either overflowing with tears or unnaturally dry, 
frequent sighs. and lowness of spirits. watchfulness, bad dreams, falling 
away of flesh.  Also, if a coral or jacinth worn by him loses its colour, or 
if a ring, made of the hoof of an ass, put on his finger, grows too big for 
him after a few days' wearing.  According to the same writer, the Persians 
used to determine the sort of fascination under which the patient laboured, 
by binding a clean linen cloth round his head, letting it dry there, and 
remarking whether any and what spots arose on it.
     But the most curious fact which we learn from Gut-ierrez is that the 
Spanish children in his time wore amulets against fascination, somewhat 
resembling those in use among the Romans.  The son of Gutierrez himself wore 
one of these ; it was a cross of jet, (" agavache") and it was believed that 
it would split if regarded by evil eyes, thus transferring their venom from 
the child upon itself. In point. of fact, the amulet worn by young Gutierrez 
did so split one day, while a person was steadfastly looking at him; and, in 
justice to the learned physician, we must add, that he attributes the 
occurrence to some accidental cause, and expresses his conviction that the 
same thing would have happened under any other circumstances.  Through-out 
his volume, indeed, all his reasoning is brought forward to explode the 
superstition.
     A third similar work is that of John Christian Frommann, a physician of 
Saxe-Coburg, who published his Tractatus de Fascinatione in 1675.
     We have already learned from Vairus, that all those who are 
immoderately praised, especially behind their backs, persons of fair 
complexion, and of handsome face or figure, particularly children, are most 
exposed to fascination, and this notion probably arose from such children 
attracting from strangers more attention than others less indebted to 
nature.  It was an impression of his own personal beauty which induced 
Polyphemus to put in practice the spitting charm which Cotattaris had taught 
him. So we read in The-ocritus, Frommann adds, that children in unwashed 
baby linen are easily subject to fascination, and so also is any fair one 
who employs two lady's maids to dress her hair; moreover, that all those who 
lie in bed very late in the morning, especially if they wear nightcaps, all 
who break their fast on cheese or peas, and all children who, having been 
once weaned, are brought back to the breast, will, even against their 
inclination, be gifted with the power of fascinating both men and beasts.
     In order to ascertain whether a child be fascinated, three oak apples 
may be dropped into a basin of water under its cradle, the person who drops 
them observing the strictest silence ; if they swim the child is free, if 
they sink it is affected; or a slice of bread may be cut with a knife marked 
with three crosses, and both the bread and the knife left on the child's 
pillow for a night; if marks of rust appear in the morning the child is 
fascinated.  If on licking the child's forehead with your tongue a salt 
taste is perceived, this also is an infallible. proof of fascination.
     The following remedies against fascination rest upon the authorities 
either of Vairus or Frommann, or both of them ; several of them may be 
traced to Pliny :-An invo-cation of Nemesis ; the root of the " Satyrios 
Orchis the skin of a hyaena's forehead; the kernel of the fruit of a palm 
tree; " Alyssum" (madwort) hung up anywhere in the house ; the stone " 
Catochites ;" spitting on the right 'shoe before it be put on ; hyssop ; 
lilies ; fumiga-tions; sprinklings;  necklaces Qf jacinth, sapphire, or 
carbuncle ; washings in river water, provided silence be kept; licking a 
child's forehead, first upward, next across, and lastly up again, and then 
spitting behind its back; sweeping its face with the bough of a pine tree; 
laying it on the ground, covered up in a linen cloth, and then sprink-ling 
it in the form of a cross, with three handfuls of earth, dug where the eaves 
drop, and brought thence at three separate times within an hour; laying turf 
from a boy's grave under a boy's pillow, from a girl's under a girl's 
silently placing near a child the clothes in which 'it was baptized ; if, as 
is sometimes the case. a child appears to derive no benefit from washing, 
taking three scrapings from the plaster of each of the four walls of its 
bedroom, and sprinkling them on its linen; three " lavemeats" of three 
spoonfuls of milk; giving in a drink the ashes of a rope in which a man has 
been hanged; drawing water silently, and throwing a lighted candle into it 
in the name of the Holy Trinity, then washing the patient's legs in this 
water, and throwing the remainder behind its back in the form of a cross; 
hanging up the key of the house over the child's cradle; laying on it crumbs 
of bread, a lock with the bolt shut, a looking-glass, or some coral washed 
in the font in which it was baptized; hanging round its neck fennel seeds, 
or bread and cheese.
     Vairus states, that huntsmen, as a protection against fascination, were 
used to split an oak plant, and pass them-selves and their dogs between it.  
As amulets against love fascination, he recommends sprinkling with the dust 
in which a mule has rolled itself; a bone which may be found in the right 
side of a toad ; or the liver of a chameleon. Vida has given a highly 
elaborate description of one who possessed this destructive power in his 
eye, after enjoining especial caution respecting those who are permitted to 
look at the silkworms.  Some instances of yet more modern belief in 
fascination than those to which we have referred  above, may be found 
collected in Brand's Popular An-tiquities.  It appears even in our own days 
to be prevalent among the inhabitants of the western islands of Scotland, 
who use nuts, called Molluca beans, as amulets against it. Dallaway, in his 
Account of Constantinople remarks, that  Nothing can exceed the superstition 
of the Turks respecting the evil eye of an enemy or infidel.  Passages from 
the Koran are painted on the outside of the houses, globes of glass are 
suspended from the ceiling, and a part of the superfluous caparison of their 
horses is designed to attract attention and divert a sinister influence."
     Delrio has a very short notice of fascination; he divides it into  
Poetica seu Vulgaris," that resulting from obscure physical causes, which he 
treats as fabulous ; " Philoso-phica," which lie considers to be contagion; 
and" Magica," to which he heartily assents.


Fat of the Sorcerers  It was said at one time that the devil made use of 
human fat for his sorceries.  The witches anointed themselves with this fat 
in order to go to the Sabbath by way of the chimney.

Faust : A magician of the sixteenth century, famous in legend and 
literature.  There is sound proof that such a person existed.  Trithemius 
(q.v.) mentions him in a letter written in 1507, in which he speaks of him 
in terms of contempt, as a fool and a mountebank who pretended that he could 
restore the writings of the ancients were they wiped out of human memory, 
and blasphemed concerning the miracles of Christ.  Mudt, a canon of the 
German Church also alludes to him in a letter as a charlatan.  Johann Gast, 
a Protestant pastor of Basel, appears to have known Faust, and considers a 
horse and dog belonging to him to have been familiar spirits.  Wier (q.v.), 
the great protector of witches, mentions Faust in a work of his, as a 
drunkard who had studied magic at Cracow.  He also mentions that in the end 
Satan strangled him after his house had been shaken by a terrific din.  From 
other evidence it is pretty clear that Faust was a wandering magician or 
necromancer, whose picturesque character won him wide publicity or 
notoriety.  By the end of the century in which he flour-ished he had become 
the model of the medieval magician. and his name was for ever linked with 
those of Virgil, Bacon, Pope Silvester and others.
     The origins of the Faust legend are of very great an-tiquity. The 
essentials underlying the story are the pact with Satan, and the supposed 
vicious character of purely human learning. The idea of the pact with Satan 
belongs to both Jewish and Christian magico-religious belief, but is 
probably more truly Kabalistic than anything else, and can scarcely be 
traced further back ; unless it resides in the savage idea that a sacrificed 
person takes the place of the deity, to which he is immolated during the 
period of life remaining to him before his execution, and afterwards becomes 
one with the god. The wickedness of believing in the all-sufficiency of 
human knowledge is a favourite theme with the early Lutherans, whose beliefs 
strongly coloured the Faust legend; but vivid hues and wondrously carven 
outlines were also afforded its edifice by the thought of the age in which 
it finally took shape; and in the ancient Faust- books we find tortuous 
passages of thought and quaintnesses of conception which recall to our minds 
the artistry of the Renaissance.
     The Faust-book soon spread over Europe; but to Eng-land is due the 
honour of the first dramatic representation of the story by Christopher 
Marlowe, who in the Tragicall History of Dr. Faustus produced a wondrous, if 
unequal drama,-the outstanding passages of which contained most of his best 
work.  Lessing wrote a Faust play daring the German revival of the 
eighteenth century, but it remained to Goethe to crown the legend with the 
creation of the
greatest psychological drama the world has ever seen. The manner in which 
Goethe differed from his predecessors in his treatment of the story lies in 
the circumstance that he gives a different character to the pact between 
Faust and Mephistopheles, whose nature again is totally at vari-ance with 
the devils of the old Faust-books.  From Lessing Goethe received the idea of 
Faust's final salvation.  It may be said that though in some respects Goethe 
adopted the letter of the-old legend he did not adopt its spirit.  Prob-ably 
the story of Faust has given to thousands their only idea of medieval magic, 
and this idea has lost nothing in the hands of Goethe, who has cast about 
the subject a much greater halo of mystery than it perhaps really contains.

Fetch : According to Irish belief, the apparition of a living, person ; the 
Irish form of the wraith (q.v.)  It resembles in every particular the 
individual whose death it is sup posed to foretell, but it is generally of a 
shadowy or ghostly appearance. The fetch may be seen by more than one person 
at the same time and, like the wraith of England and Scotland, may appear to 
the person it represents. There is a belief, too, that if the fetch be seen 
in the morning, it indicates long life for the original : but if it be seen 
at night, his speedy demise may be expected.  The Fetch enters largely into 
the folk-tales of Ireland ; and it is hardly surprising that so many tales 
have been woven around it, for there is something gruesome in the idea of 
being haunted by one's own "double" which has frequently been turned to 
account by more sophisticated writers than the inventors of folk-tales.
     Patrick Kennedy, in his Legendary Fiction of the Irish Celt, speaking 
of the Irish fetch, gives the following tale of The Doctor's Fetch, based, 
it is stated, on the most authentic sources : " In one of our Irish cities, 
and in a room where the mild moonbeams were resting on the carpet and on a 
table near the window, Mrs. B., wife of a doctor in good practice and 
general esteem, looking towards the window from her pillow, was startled by 
the appearance of her husband standing near the table just mentioned, and 
seeming to look with attention on the book which was lying open on it.  Now, 
the living and breathing man was by her side apparently asleep, and, greatly 
as she was sur-prised and affected, she had sufficient command of herself to 
remain without moving, lest she should expose him to the terror which she 
herself at the moment experienced. After gazing on the apparition for a few 
seconds, she bent her eyes upon her husband to ascertain if his looks were 
turned in the direction of the window, but his eyes were closed.  She turned 
round again, although now dreading the sight of what she believed to be her 
husband's fetch, but it was no longer there.  She remained sleepless 
through-out the remainder of the night, but still bravely refrained from 
disturbing her partner.
     Next morning, Mr. B., seeing signs of disquiet on his wife's 
countenance while at breakfast, made some affec-tionate inquiries, but she 
concealed her trouble, and at his ordinary hour he sallied forth to make his 
calls.  Meeting Dr. C, in the street, and falling into conversation with 
him, he asked his opinion on the subject of fetches.  ' I think,' was the 
answer, ' and so I am sure do you, that they are mere illusions produced by 
a disturbed stomach acting upon the excited brain of a highly imaginative or 
super-stitious person.'   Then,' said Mr. B.,  I am highly im-aginative or 
superstitious, for I distinctly saw my own outward man last night standing 
at the table in the bed-room, and clearly distinguishable in the moonlight.  
I am afraid my wife saw it too, but I have been afraid to speak to her on 
the subject.'
     About the same hour on the ensuing night the poor lady was again 
roused, but by a more painful circumstance. She felt her husband moving 
convulsively, and immediately afterwards he cried to her in low, interrupted 
accents, Elleo, my dear, I am suffocating; send for Dr. C.'  She sprang up, 
huddled on some clothes, and ran to his house. He came with all speed, but 
his efforts for his friend were useless.  He had burst a large blood-vessel 
in the lungs, and was soon beyond human aid.  In her lamentations the 
bereaved wife frequently cried out, ' Oh  the fetch, the fetch !' and at a 
later period told the doctor of the appearance the night before her 
husband's death.


Fetishism : The term fetishism is employed in more than one sense.  Thus it 
may mean in some cases pure idolatry or the worship of inanimate objects.  
Again in older works of travel, it is even used to signify African religion.  
But taken in its general and more modern sense, it signifies any inanimate 
object which appears to the savage as the resi-dence of a spirit.  Thus a 
carved doll, a necklace of teeth, a flint stone into which a shaman or 
medicine-man has succeeded in coaxing a spirit to reside, is regarded by the 
savage as a fetish.  But larger objects are occasionally adopted as 
fetishes, and in the adoption of these in contra-distinction to the smaller 
fetishes we can trace the evolution of the idol.  As a general rule the 
fetish is an object peculiar in shape or material, for such is considered by 
the shaman as being more likely to attract a wandering spirit than any more 
ordinary substance.  Thus we find as fetishes pecu-liarly shaped stones, 
tufts of human hair and bones, parts of animals and birds, and so forth.  
Fossils are not uncommonly employed as fetishes, possibly because of their 
freakish formation.
     The origin of fetishism is undoubtedly animistic (See Animism). The 
savage intelligence regards everything that surrounds it as possessing the 
property of life-water, the earth, trees, stones and so forth.  But this is 
modified by the idea that many of these objects are under the power of some 
spell or potent enchantment.  Thus the rocks and trees are the living tombs 
of imprisoned spirits, resembling the dryads of folk-lore ; so that it is 
not at all strange to the savage mind to perceive an imprisoned intelligence 
more or less powerful, in any object, no matter how un-common its form.  In 
fact, according to the savage mind, spirit was dependent to a great extent 
upon material body. The wandering spirit, according to the barbarian; could 
not fare much better, materially speaking, than a wander-ing savage  it 
would suffer the rigours of hunger and cold, and would be only too agreeable 
to be at rest for a while where it would be treated with every deference and 
properly attended to.  For this purpose a shaman will either manu-facture or 
search for a fitting residence for this spirit, and he will proceed by 
various rites to attempt to coax some wandering intelligence to take up its 
home therein.
     There is of course a point at which the fetish commences to develop 
into a god.  This happens when fetishes survive the test of experience and 
achieve a more than personal or tribal popularity.  Thus amongst the Zuni 
Indians a fetish called " The Knife-feathered Monster " has prac-tically 
become the tribal god of war, and a pony and sheep fetish are at present in 
course of evolving as deities in the pantheon of this people.  Amongst the 
Zuni there appears to have been the conception that their fetishes were 
totemistic.  Fetishism and totemism are not incompatible with one another, 
but often flourish side by side ; but the basic difference between a fetish 
and a totem is that the fetish spirit is the bond slave of the person who 
owns its abode, whereas the totem is his patron spirit, personal or tribal.  
Nevertheless the fetish partakes more of the nature of those spirits which 
are subservient to man, as for example the Arabian Jinn, than of those which 
subsequently develop into gods.  They are more of the race of faery, of the 
little folk who dwelt in the crevices of rocks and trees, the smaller swarm 
of the supernatural, than of the strain of Olympus. A capital example of a 
fetish, which will be familiar to all, is that which occurs in the story of 
Aladdin and his lamp. Here we have the subservient nature-spirit-the 
original conception of which must have been that it dwelt in the lamp or the 
ring, and was only freed therefrom on the sum-mons of its temporary master 
to perform some special piece of work.  But a fetish is not necessarily a 
piece of personal property : it may belong collectively to an entire 
community or family, and it is usually an heirloom.
     The savage naturally attaches great importance to those fetishes which 
assist him in the chase.  Thus the Zuni Indians, who possess perhaps the 
most complete fetishistic system of any barbarous people, have a special 
temple-house set apart for their tribal fetishes of the hunt, which they 
call the Prey-gods.  On setting out for the hunt, the Zuni Indian will visit 
the fetish-house, and sprinkle a little maize meal on a platter placed 
before that fetish which he wishes to employ in his expedition.  In this 
office he is usually assisted by a medicine-man set aside for the purpose, 
whose special duty it is to see that the fetishes are properly placated and 
returned when their services are no more required.  Let us suppose that he 
selects the fetish of the mountain-lion.  This is a stone object, shaped in 
the likeness of that animal.  Once in the open country, the hunter places 
the mouth of the fetish to his own and suspires deeply, imagining that by so 
doing he is breathing in the hunting instinct of the mountain-lion.  He then 
forcibly emits his breath.  The Indian idea is that beasts of prey are able 
by the emission of breath to render the game helpless over a wide area, and 
this the bunter believes he has successfully and magically imitated.  When 
he meets with his game, after slaying it, his first act is to excise the 
liver, which he smears upon the lips of the fetish, which is then duly 
returned to the fetish-house.  Most of the objects belonging to a medicine-
man or shaman are believed to be fetishes,-that is, they possess a certain 
quality of life that other, and more ordinary, objects do not have.
     The word fetish is derived from the Portuguese feitico which implies " 
something made,"  and was applied by early voyagers in West Africa to the 
wooden figures, stones and so forth, regarded as the residence of spirits.  
Fetishism in Africa appears t6 be generally confined to the coasts, but in 
America it is prevalent more or less over the whole hemisphere.  That it was 
once prevalent in Europe is practically certain from the nature of many 
objects found in prehistoric and early historic graves, and in certain parts 
of Asia, it is by no means extinct.  The material conception of fetishism 
survives in the charm, amulet or mascot, which is regarded as a luck-
bringer, although the spiritual sig-nificance connected with it has quite 
vanished.   (See Charms and Amulets, Familiar).

Fiction, English Occult : English literature, as it is known today, really 
begins with the Elizabethan age  for the writers prior to that time, 
excellent as many of them are, elicit comparatively little interest nowadays 
save among experts.  And, by the time of Elizabeth's advent, the old miracle 
plays " had gone out of fashion  yet tales about the miraculous doings of 
mythical heroes continued to find favour, and many new things of this kind 
were written.
     A few of the Restoration dramatists dealt in magic and the like, but 
throughout the Georgian age people were mostly too prosaic, too matter-of-
fact, to care for things of that sort, and they were eschewed by the 
majority of prominent writers of the day.  However, after the great artistic 
movement commonly styled the Renaissance of Wonder, the old interest in the 
occult began to revive apace, and, ere the nineteenth century was very far 
advanced, a literature suitable to this budding taste was being purveyed on 
a voluminous scale.  Among the first to enter the lists, soi disant, was 
William Godwin, with his novel of St. Truyne the Rosicrucian  while Godwin's 
daughter, Mary, chiefly remembered nowadays as the second wife of Shelley, 
merits notice as a mystical writer by virtue of her story of Frankenstein.  
A little before the advent of this authoress, numerous occult tales had been 
written by Matthew Lewis, notably Tales of Terror and the drama of Castle 
Spectre, staged successfully at Drury Lane in 1798 while not long after 
Lewis a further novelist came to swell the muster-roll, Bulwer Lytton, whose 
taste for the mystic is seen especially in Zanoni, A Strange Story, and 
Haunters and the Haunted.  His essays of this kind, nevertheless, were never 
very satisfactory in the real literary sense and as Leslie Stephen once 
discovered, they too often smacked of the theatrical.  But Sir Walter Scott, 
on the other hand, writing just before Lytton's time, not only showed a keen 
fondness for occult matter, but frequently utilised it to genuine artistic 
purpose.  In The Monastery a mysterious sylph rises from a fountain  as-
trology is introduced into The Mannering, The Fortunes of Nigel, and Quentin 
Durward; while a splendid ghost story is told in Redgauntlet, and ghosts 
figure also in Wood-stock.  In The Bride of Lammermoor, besides, the author 
deals incidentally with that firm belief in prophecy which was long a 
prominent part of Scottish life ; while in Waver-ley, again, he depicts a 
Highland chief as awestruck and unmanned by the sight of a peculiar omen.  
Highland superstitions, indeed, appealed with particular potency to Sir 
Walter's romantic temper ; while he was not the only writer of his time who 
dealt ably with this branch of the occult, another being Susan Ferrier in 
her novels of Destiny and The Chief's Daughter.  Nor should we fail ere 
leaving this period, to mention Ann Radcliffe, for in almost all her novels 
the supernatural figures promi-nently.
     While the last-named trio were at work thus in Britain, some good 
stories in which magic occurs were being written in America by Washington 
Irving ; and, not very long after his day, a second American arose to treat 
brilliantly of weirdness and wizardry, Edgar Allan Poe.  Then,  re-verting 
to England, ghosts appear in a few of Dickens' novels, and Charles Reade 
manifests here and there a love of the occult ; while coming to slightly 
later times, a writer who manifested this predilection abundantly is Robert 
Louis Stevenson.  His Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is among the best of all 
modern novels in which the supernatural plays a salient role, and many of 
his short stories pertain also to the category of occult, for example, the 
tale of the magic bottle in Island Nights Entertainments; while, about the 
date these were being composed, Oscar Wilde was writing what is one of the 
most beautiful things dealing with invisible powers, The Picture of Dorian 
Gray.  Much inferior to this masterpiece, yet possessing considerable 
excellence, are George du Maurier's Peter Ibbetson, Trilby and The Martian, 
in each of which the supernatural is prominent  while a further work which 
should certainly be cited is Lafcadio Hearn's Dead Love, a tiny tale of 
magic which the author thought lightly of, but which future generations are 
almost sure to prize on account of its lovely wording, at some places worthy 
of Theophile Gautier him-self, who was Hearn's acknowledged master.
     These recent authors do not by any means conclude the list, for a 
wealth of occult fiction has been written since their day.  Among its most 
remarkable items is The Ghost Ship of Richard Middleton, a singularly 
promising story-teller and poet who died by his own hand lately at the early 
age of twenty-nine; while many contemporary novelists have introduced magic 
into their books, for instance; Mr. Rider Haggard in She, the late Mr. Bram 
Stoker in Dracula, and Mr. F. A. Anstey in Vice Versa and The Brass Bottle. 
In fact, were one to cite all the living wont to trade in the occult, an 
article of formidable size would be the result, and accordingly the attempt 
must be eschewed ; but at least it is essential to mention Mr. Theodore 
Watts-Dunton's Aylwin, this reflecting really fine treatment of mystic mat-
ter, and being couched throughout in a style of exceptional beauty.  Mr. 
Arthur Symons is another great writer of to-day who loves the borderland 
between dreams and realities, as witness many pages in his Spiritual 
Adventures while the invisible world has always appealed powerfully to Mr. 
W. B. Yeats, and is employed to good purpose here and there in his stories 
of the Irish peasantry.  It is less the ghost than the fairy which he 
delights in, true Celt that he is ; and his predilection herein sets one 
dreaming of fairy-tales in general, and summons a curious medley of names.  
William Morris wrote a host of beautiful fairy-stories, some of them 
concerned with the promulgation of socialistic ideas, but others innocent of 
anything of that sort; while the voluminous works of Ruskin include what can 
only be defined as a fairy tale, The King of the Golden River.  Numerous 
contemporary writers have likewise done good work in this field-Lord 
Dunsany, Mr. J. M. Barrie, and more especially Mr. Laurence Housman-while a 
remarkable fairy play has been written lately by Mr. Graham Robertson, and 
has been staged with surprising triumph.  Then, reverting for a moment to 
defunct authors, fairies occur in that charming volume by H. D. Lowry, Make 
Believe, and in Richard Middleton's book, The Day Before Yesterday ; while 
no account of this particular domain of literature would be complete without 
mention of the work of Lewis Carrol, and also of Jean Ingelow's lovely 
story, Mopsa the Fairy.  This last is possibly the best of all fairy 
stories, and one which has been most widely and wisely cherished ; and it 
stands out very clearly in the memory of nearly every man of imaginative 
temperament, reminding him of his own childhood.


Figuier, Guillaume Louis   A French writer and chemist, born at Montpellier 
in 1819.  His uncle, Pierre Figuier, was professor of chemistry at the 
School of Pharmacy, Montpellier, and Louis, having taken his degree of 
doctor of medicine, and studied chemistry at the laboratory of Balard in 
Paris, was made professor of chemistry at the School of Pharmacy, 
Montpellier.  He  later- 1853 - exchanged this post for a similar one in the 
School of Phar-macy of Paris. Thereafter many honorary degrees in science 
and medicine were conferred upon him by various faculties. In 1857 he 
finally left off teaching and devoted himself to the popularising of 
science, mainly physiology and medical chemistry.  He published from time to 
time many notable works, and was not more distinguished for his prodigious 
output than for its literary quality.  Of those works having a bearing on 
occult matters the principal are  le Lendemein de la mort ou La Vie future 
selon Ia science (1872) dealing with the transmigration of souls ; 1' 
Atchimie et les Al-chimistes (1854); histoire du merveilleux dens les temps 
modernes (1859-60 ); les Bonheurs d' outre tombe (1892.) He tried to 
popularize science by introducing on the stage plays whose heroes were 
savants and inventors.  His at-tempt however, met with but a cold reception.  
In r889 he published a volume of dramas and comedies, la Science au Theatre.  
He died at Paris in 1894.


Fingitas : The tradition concerning this stone is remarkable. It is 
described as quite transparent and hard like marble. It is related that a 
certain king built a temple of it which needed no windows, the light being 
admitted into it as if it had been all open to the day.


Finias : One of the four great cities whence the Irish mythical Danaans were 
said to have sprung.



Finn Mac Cummal  In Irish romance, Captain of the Fianna and the centre of 
the Ossianic tales.  His father Cumhal, chief of the clan Basena, was slain 
at Castle Knock by the rival clan Morna, but his mother succeeded in saving 
him from the enemy.  He was brought up in hiding and given the name of Finn 
from the clearness of his skin.  He learned science and poetry from the 
druid Finegas who dwelt on the river Boyne.  The druid had been unable to 
catch the salmon of knowledge until Finn became his pupil, and when he did 
succeed in catching it, he told Finn to watch it while it was cooking but 
not to partake of it. Finn, however, burned his fingers as he turned the 
spit and put one of them in his mouth.  Seeing this, Finegas bade him eat 
the salmon and he became filled with the wisdom of all ages.  Afterwards he 
took service with King Cormac to whom he revealed his name and lineage.  
Cor-mac promised him the leadership of the Fianna if he suc-ceeded in 
killing the fire-blowing demon that came yearly to set Tara in flames.  Finn 
slew the demon and bore his head back to Tara.  The Fianna were therefore 
ordered to swear allegiance to Finn as their captain, which, led by Goll mac 
Morna, their former captain, they all did. Under Finn, the Fianna rose to 
great eminence, an eminence which at length became tyrannical and from which 
they were thrown at the battle of Bowra.  Finn's end  is shrouded in 
mystery.  According to popular tradition he and his great companions he 
sleeping in an enchanted cave whence they shall arise in the hour of their 
country's need, like Arthur, Barbarossa and Charlemagne.


Fioravanti, Leonardi   An Italian alchemist doctor and surgeon of the 
sixteenth century.  He was a voluminous writer whose best known work is a 
Summary of the Arcana of Medicine, Surgery and Alchemy, published in Venice 
in 1571.  It embraces an application of the principles and methods of Hermes 
to the Science of Medicine.  The au-thor's account of the petra 
philosophorum shews its desig-nation to be purely arbitrary.  It is a 
mixture of mercury, nitre and other ingredients intended as a stomachic and 
has no connection with the transmuting lapis of the al-chemists.


Fire : Many nations have adored this element.  In Persia a chimneyless 
enclosure was made, and into it fire was introduced.  Essences and perfumes 
were cast into the fire by the great persons of the nation.  When a Persian 
king was at the point of death all the fires in the principal towns of the 
kingdom were extinguished, and were not rekindled until the crowning of his 
successor.  Certain Tartars never accost foreigners who have not purified 
them-selves by passing between two fires ; they are also careful to drink 
with their faces turned to the south, in honour of the element of fire.  In 
some parts of Siberia it is be-lieved that fire is inhabited by a being who 
dispenses good and evil; they offer him perpetual sacrifices.  According to 
the kabalists, this was the element of the Salamanders. (See also Fire 
Ordeal.)

Fire-ordeal: The fire-ordeal is of great antiquity, and prob-ably arose from 
the conception of the purifying influence of fire.  Among the Hindoos, from 
the earliest times until comparatively recently, those who were suspected of 
wrong-doing were required to prove their guilt or innocence by walking over 
red-hot iron.  If they escaped unharmed their innocence was placed  beyond a 
doubt.  The priestesses of a Cappodocian goddess, Diana Parasya, walked 
barefooted on red-hot coals, attributing their in-vulnerability to the 
powers of the divinity.  In Europe trial by fire was of two kinds-traversing 
the flames, or undergoing the ordeal of hot iron.  The latter form com-
prised the carrying in the hand of red-hot irons, the walking over iron bars 
or glowing ploughshares, and the thrusting of the hand into a red-hot 
gauntlet.  An early instance of the former mode in European history is that 
of Pierre Barthelemy, who in 1097 declared to the Crusaders that heaven had 
revealed to him the place where was concealed the spear that had pierced the 
Saviour's body.  To prove his assertion he offered-to undergo the ordeal by 
fire, and was duly required to walk a path about a foot in width and some 
fourteen feet in length, on either side of which were piled blazing olive-
branches.  The judgment of the fire was unfavourable, and twelve days later 
the rash ad-venturer expired in agony.  Books also were sometimes submitted 
to the trial by fire.  This method was adopted to decide the claims of the 
Roman and Mozaratian liturgies, the former emerging victorious from the 
flames.  Among savage people the fire-ordeal is also to be met with, and 
especially in New Zealand, India, Fiji, and Japan. It may be suspected that 
the issue of these ordeals was not always left on the knees of the gods.  
There is no doubt that the an-cient Egyptians were acquainted with 
substances which rendered the body partly immune.  Albertus Magnus gives a 
recipe for this purpose.  It is made up of powdered lime, made into a paste 
with the white of an egg, the juice of the radish, the juice of the marsh 
mallow, and the seeds of the fleabane.  A first coat of this mixture is 
applied to the body and allowed to dry, when a second coat is applied. If 
the feet he constantly oiled, or moistened with sulphuric acid, they may be 
rendered impervious.  Possibly the ancients were not unaware of the fire-
resisting properties of asbestos.  The fire-ordeal has remained to this day 
as one of the phenomena of spiritualism.  D. D. Home fre-quently handled 
live coals, and laid them on a handkerchief without damaging the material in 
the least.  On one occa-sion he enclosed a glowing coal in his hands and 
blew upon it until it became white hot.  A well known instance is that 
related by Mrs. S. C. Hall, when Home placed a burn-ing coal on the head of 
Mr. Hall, whose white hair was then drawn over the still glowing coal.  In 
an account given by Mrs. Homewood and Lord Lindsay of a seance with the same 
medium we are told that Home took a chimney from a lighted lamp and thrust 
it into the fire, making it so hot that a match applied to it ignited 
instantly, and then thrust it into his mouth, touching it with his tongue, 
without any apparent ill effects.  Another account states that Home placed 
his face right in the fire among the burn-ing coals" moving it about as 
though bathing it in water." Other mediums, both in England and America, 
emulated this feat with some measure of success.  It has been suggested that 
the state of trance generally accompanying such exploits, and corresponding 
to the ecstasy of the shaman performing a similar feat, may produce 
anaesthesia, or insensibility to the pain of burning.  But how it comes that 
the skin is not scorched, nor the material of the hand-kerchief marked by 
the burning coal, it is not easy to say.


Flamel, Nicholas, was born at Pontoise, of a poor but respect-able family, 
about the beginning of the fourteenth century. He received a good education, 
of which his natural abilities enabled him to make the best use.  Repairing 
to Paris, he obtained employment as a public scrivener,-sitting at the 
corner of the Rue de Marivaux, copying or inditing letters and other 
documents.  The occupation brought with it little profit, and Flame? tried 
in succession poetry and painting with an equally unsatisfactory result.  
His quick wits suggested that as he could make no money by teaching mankind, 
it might be more profitable to cheat them, and he took up the pursuit of 
Astrology, casting horoscopes and telling fortunes.  He was right in his 
con-jectures, and soon throve so vigorously that he was enabled to take unto 
himself a wife named Petronella.  But those who begin to study the magic art 
for profit or amusement generally finish by addicting themselves to it with 
a blindly passionate love.  Nicholas devoted himself both day and night to 
his fascinating but deceptive pursuits; and soon acquired a thorough 
knowledge of all that previous adepts had written upon the elixir vita', the 
universal Alkahest, and the Philosopher's Stone.  In 1297 he lighted upon a 
manual of the art which would have been invaluable if it had been 
intelligible.  He bought it for two florins.  It contained three times seven 
leaves written with a steel instrument upon the bark of trees.  The 
caligraphy was as admirable as the Latin was cryptical.  Each seventh leaf 
was free from writing, but emblazoned with a picture the first, representing 
a serpent swallowing rods ; the second, a serpent crucified on a cross ; and 
the third, the arid expanse of a treeless desert, in whose depths a fountain 
bubbled, with serpents trailing their slimy folds from side to side.  The 
author of this mysterious book purported to be " Abraham, the patriarch, 
Jew, prince, philosopher, Levite, priest, and astrologer," (q.v.) who added 
to his other claims upon the wonder of mankind a knowledge of Latin.  He had 
included within these precious pages a complete exposition of the art of 
transmuting metals; describing every process, explaining the different 
vessels, and pointing out the proper seasons for making experiments. In 
fact, the book would have been perfect, hut for one deficiency; it was 
addressed not so much to the tyro as to an adept, and took it for granted 
that its student was already in possession of the Philosopher's Stone.  This 
was a terrible obstacle to the inquiring Flame?  The more he studied the 
book the less he understood it  He studied the letterpress, and he studied 
the illustrations he invited the wise men of France to come and study them 
but no light was thrown upon the darkness  For thrice seven years he pored 
over these perplexing pages until at length his wife suggested that a Jewish 
Rabbi might be able to interpret them.  As the chiefs of the Jews uere 
principally located in Spain, to Spain went Flamel and there he re-mained 
for two years.  Prom one of the Hebrew sages he obtained some hints which 
afforded a key to the patriarchal mysteries, and returning to Paris he 
recommenced his studies with a new vigour.  They were rewarded with success.  
On the 13th of February, 1382, o.s., Flanzel made a projection on Mercury, 
and produced some virgin silver. On the 25th of the following April he 
converted some Mer-cury into gold, and found himself the fortunate possessor 
of an inexhaustible treasure.  But his good fortune did not end here.  
Flamel continuing his researches discovered the elixir of life, which 
enabled him to prolong his life and accumulate gold-to the venerable age of 
116.  He further administered the life-giving potion to his wife, who 
reached nearly as great a longevity as himself, dying in the year preceding 
his own death, A.D. 1414.  As they had no children, they spent their wealth 
upon churches and hospitals, and several of the religious and charitable 
institutions of France still attest their well-directed benevo-lence.  There 
is no doubt that Flamel practised alchemy, and one of his works on the 
fascinating science -  poem entitled The Philosophic Summary-was printed as 
late as 1735.  in Salmon's valuable and very curious Biblio-theque des 
Philosophes Chimiques are preserved same speci-mens of the drawings in 
Abraham's treatise on metallurgy and of his own handwriting.  But Flamel was 
neither an enthusiast nor a dupe.  His alchemical studies were but the 
disguises of his usurious practices. To account for the immense wealth he 
acquired by money-lending to the young French nobles, and by transacting 
business between the Jews of France and those of Spain, he invented the 
fiction of his discovery of the Philosopher's Stone.  He nevertheless 
obtained great repute as a magician, and his followers believed that he was 
still alive though retired from the world, and would live for six centuries.

Fludd, or Flud, Robert : This Rosicrucian and alchemist was born in 1574 at 
Milgate House, in the parish of Bear-sted, Kent, his father being one Sir 
Thomas Fludd, a knight who enjoyed the patronage of Queen Elizabeth, and 
served her for several years as  Treasurer of War in the Low Countries."  At 
the age of seventeen Robert entered St. John's College, Oxford, and five 
years later he took Isis degree as Bachelor of Arts ; while shortly 
afterwards, on his deciding to take up medical science, he left England and 
went to prosecute his studies on the Continent.  Going first to Spain, he 
travelled thence to Italy, and subsequently stayed for some time in Germany, 
where he is said to have supported himself by acting as pedagogue in various 
noble households; but soon he was home again, and in 1605 his alma mater of 
Oxford conferred on him the degrees of Bach-elor of Medicine and Doctor of 
Medians, while five years later he became a Fellow of the College of 
Physicians. Having thus equipped himself thoroughly for the medical 
profession, Fludd went to London and took a house in Fenchurch Street, a 
quiet place in those days, though now a noisy centre of commerce; and here 
he soon gained an extensive practice, his success being due not merely to 
his genuine skill, but to his having an attractive and even magnetic 
personality.  But busy though he was in this way, he found leisure to write 
at length on medicine; while anon he became an important and influential 
member of the Fraternity of the Rosy Cross, and at the same time he 
commenced alchemistic experiments.  He preached the great efficacy of the 
magnet, of sympathetic cures, of the weapon-salve ; he declared his belief 
in the Philoso-pher's Stone, the universal alkahest or solvent, the elixir 
vita'; he maintained that all things were animated by two principles-
condensation, the Boreal, or northern virtue; and rarefaction, the Austral, 
or southern virtue.  He asserted that the human body was controlled by a 
number of demons, that each disease had its peculiar demon, each demon his 
particular place in the frame of humanity, and that to conquer a disease-say 
in the right leg-you must call in the aid of the demon who ruled the left, 
always proceeding by this rule of contraries.  As soon as the doc-trines of 
the Rosy Cross Brotherhood were promulgated Fludd embraced them with all the 
eagerness of which his dreamy intellect was capable; and several German 
writers having made an attack upon them, he published a defence in 1616, 
under the title of Apologia Compendiaria Fratern-itatem de Rosea-Cruce 
Suspicionis et Infamia Maculis Asper-sam Abluens, which procured him a wide-
spread reputation as one of the apostles of the new fraternity.  He met with 
the usual fate of prophets, and was lustily belaboured by a host of enemies-
by Mersenne, Gassendi, and Kepler. Fludd was by no means discomfited, and 
retorted upon his opponents in an elaborate treatise, Summum Bonum, quod est 
Magiae, Cabalae, Alchimiae, Fratrum Rosea-Crucis Verorum, et adversus 
Mersenium Columniatorem.  He made at a later period and aventurous attempt 
to identify the doctrines of the Rosicrucians with what he was pleased to 
call the Philosophy of Moses (Philosophia Mosaica, in qua sapientia et 
scientia Creationis explicantur), published at Ghent, 1638, and wrote 
numerous treatises on alchemy and medical science.  He founded an English 
school of Rosi-crucians.  Fludd is one of the high priests of the Magnetic 
Philosophy, and learnedly expounds the laws of astral medicine, the 
doctrines of sympathies, and the fine powers and marvellous effects of the 
magnet.  When two men approach each other-such was his theory-their mag-
netism is either active or passive ; that is, positive or negative.  If the 
emanations which they send out are broken or thrown back, there arises 
antipathy, or Mag-netismus negativus  but when the emanations pass through 
each other, the positive magnetism is produced, for the magnetic rays 
proceed from the centre to the circumference. Man, like the earth, has his 
poles, or two main streams of magnetic influence.  Like a little world, he 
is endowed with a magnetic virtue which, however, is subjected to the same 
laws as, on a larger scale, the magnetic power of the universe.  How these 
principles may be developed in the cure or prevention of disease, the reader 
must learn from the mystic pages of Robertus a Fluctibus himself.
     Fludd died in 1637 at a house in Coleman Street, to which he had 
removed a few years before ; but ere his demise he had won a fairly wide 
reputation by his chymical ability, and had also issued a considerable 
number of books, promi-nent among them being Tractatus Apologeticus 
integrita-tem Societatis de Rusae Cruce defendans, Leyden 1617, Veri-tatis 
Proscenium, Frankfort  1621, Med,cina Catholica, Frankfort  1629, 
Monochordum Mundi Syhiphoniacum, Frankfort, 1622.


Flute, Charm of the : The flute is often mentioned in history as being used 
for the purpose of charming animals, and the serpent seems to have been 
peculiarly delighted with its music.  It is Slid that adders will swell at 
the sound of the flute, raising themselves up, twisting about and keeping 
proper time.  A Spanish writer says that in India he had often seen the 
Gentiles leading about enchanted serpents, making them dance to the sound of 
a flute, put-ting them round their necks, and touching them without harm ; 
and to this day a musical instrument of this nature is used by the snake-
charmers of that country.  In oppo-sition to this, Hippocrates mentions a 
man, Nicanor, who fainted whenever he heard the sound of a flute.


Flying Dutchman, The : Sailors in Holland long believed that a certain Dutch 
skipper, van Straaten by name, was condemned as a penalty for his sins to 
sail for year after year through the seas beating around the Cape of Storms, 
this being the old name for the Cape of Good Hope; and crews returning to 
the Zudyer Zee after voyaging in the region aforesaid, use to declared that 
they had seen van Straaten's mysterious craft, and had fled from it in 
terror. This legend is probably a very old one, albeit the exact date at 
which it became current is indeterminate; and it should be added that the 
story is found in the folklore of various countries besides Holland, notably 
Germany. Several German versions call the ill-starred seaman von Falkenberg. 
and maintain that it was not near South Africa, but in the North Sea that 
his spectral barque commonly hovered; while some of them contend further 
that the devil was wont to pay periodic visits to the captain on board his 
ship, and that frequently the two were seen playing dice on deck, the stakes 
at issue being von Falkenberg's soul.  The tale soon found its way from 
folk-lore into actual literature, among the greatest of those writers util-
ising it being Heinrich Heine, and in his rendering the sailor has a chance 
of salvation.  That is to say, the fates allow him to put foot on terra 
firma once every seven years and if, during his brief period of respite, he 
contrives to win the affection of an unsullied maiden, liberation from 
perennial sea-wandering will be granted him as reward. Heine's form o the 
story appealed keenly to Wagner, who was always prone to regard woman 
devoutly as before all else a regenerating force ; and accordingly the great 
com-poser wrote a music-drama on the subject of The Flying Dutchman, or as 
he calls it in German, Der Fliegende Hol-lander, in which the scene is 
mostly laid in the North Sea, while the sailor himself is called van 
Derdecken. and the maiden to whom he makes advances is Senta.  This opera 
was first staged at Dresden in 1843, and, though it can hardly be said that 
it won speedy appreciation, at least it did not elicit quite the scorn meted 
out originally to the majority of Wagner's works.  Marryat has also a novel 
on the subject.

Fong-Chur: A mysterious operation practised in China, in the disposition of 
buildings, and particularly of tombs. If someone should chance to build in a 
position contrary to his neighbours, so that the corner of his house faced 
the side of a house belonging to someone else, the latter believes that the 
worst of misfortune will befall him.  Long-standing feuds may result from 
the unfortunate action. The remedy consists in placing in a chamber a dragon 
or other monster in terra-cotta, facing the corner of the fatal edifice.  
The terrible gaze of the monster will repulse the evil influence.  Incense 
is burned before the dragon. and he is treated with much respect.

Fontaine, John : This Flemish alchemist and poet appears to have lived at 
Valenciennes towards the close of the thirteenth century.  Two books are 
ascribed to him, La Fontaine des Amoureux de Science and La Fontaine 
Perilleuse. both of which are written in French and were pub-lished at 
Paris, the first-named in 1561 and the second eleven years later.  His 
claims to the authorship of the latter work have frequently been disputed, 
but the former is almost certainly his, and a curious production it is.  At 
the outset the author professes himself an adept in hermetic philosophy, and 
thereafter he proceeds, in poetry of an allegorical style which recalls The 
Romaunt of the Rose, to describe the different processes to be gone through 
ere achieving a transmutation. There is little in this metrical treatise 
which indicates that the writer was an alchemist of any great ability. but 
he certainly possessed a distinct gift for making pleasant if hardly 
powerful verses.


Fontenettes, Charles. : Author of a Dissertation sur une fille de Grenoble,

attributed to the devil, but
Fontenettes explained that it was due to a less sinister cause.

Fortune-telling :  Fortune-telling in Britain, was formerly included under 
the crime of Witchcraft, and was made punishable by death under the Statute 
of 1563 C. 73.  This Act was repealed by 9 George II. C. 5, which ordained 
that no prosecution should thereafter be made on charge of Witchcraft, also 
by the said Act all persons professing to occult skill or undertaking ?o 
tell fortunes might be sen-tenced to imprisonment for one year, and to stand 
pillory and find surety for their future good behaviour.
     Punishment by pillory is now abolished.  By Act 5 George IV. c. 83 
fortune-tellers were included along with other vagrants under the general 
category of rogues and vagabonds, and were liable to imprisonment for three 
months.  This Act was made applicable to Scotland by 34 and 35 Vict. C. 24.
      No prosecution occurred under it until the case of Smith (23 R (I.C.) 
77).  The old Act extended to Scotland as afore-said enacted that "every 
person pretending or professing to tell fortunes or using any subtle craft, 
means, or device, by palmistry or otherwise to deceive, and impose on any of 
His Majesty's Subjects" shall be deemed a vagabond and rogue within the 
meaning of tile Act and shall be pun-ishable as therein provided.  In the 
case above referred to the complainer, a woman named Jone Lee or Smith, was 
charged in the Police Court at Glasgow, with a contra-vention of the above 
enactment in respect that at a time and place specified, did pretend to tell 
the fortunes of " a person named" who was thereby induced to pay the ac-
cused the sum of sixpence.  The accused was convicted of the contravention 
“as libelled" and brought a suspen-sion. The Court quashed the conviction, 
holding that the complaint was irrelevant in that it did not set forth that 
the accused had pretended to tell fortunes with intent to deceive and impose 
on any one.  Lord Young, one of the judges, in the course of his opinion 
says  It has never been imagined, so far as I have ever heard, or thought, 
that writing, publishing, or selling books on the lines of the hand, or even 
on astrology-the position of the stars at birth and the rules upon which 
astrologers proceed in telling fortunes therefrom.  I say that I have never 
heard of publishing, or selling such books is an offence, or that reading 
such books, and telling fortunes therefrom is an offence.  Roguery and 
knavery might be committed that way. but it would be a special case.  I am 
not in any way suggesting that a spae wife or anyone else may not through 
that means commit knavery and deception, and so be liable to punishment."
     It would thus appear that fortune-telling is of itself no offence, 
unless it is accompanied by fraud impositions, or intent to deceive.  While 
it might be an offence for the palmist or fortune-teller knowingly to accept 
payment from a half witted or obviously apparent ignorant person, it can 
hardly be pretended that the ordinary person who consults a professional 
fortune teller or chrystal gazer and tenders payment in return for their 
skill at delineations of character or forecasting of the future, feels that 
he has been imposed upon should the delineations be at fault, or the 
forecast turn Out inaccurate.          A.J.B.G


Fountain Spirits of Behmen  According to Jacob Behmen, there were in nature 
seven active principles, the " Fountain Spirits, or " Mothers of Existence."  
These were-the astringent quality; the sweet quality ; the bitter quality 
the quality of fire; the quality of love ; the quality of sound ; and the 
quality of essential substance.  The re-ciprocal action of these 
antipathetic qualities resulted in Supreme Unity.  Each is at once the 
parent and the child of all the rest, for they generate and are generated by 
each other.  They are typified by the seven golden candlesticks of the 
Apocalypse.


Fourth Dimension of Space : There are three known dimen-sions in space 
typified in the three geometric figures-a line, having length, a surface, 
length and breadth, a cube, length, breadth and thickness.  It has been 
conjectured that a fourth dimension may exist in addition to length, 
breadth, and thickness.  Spiritualists have claimed to find proof of a 
fourth dimension in certain of the physical phenomena of the seance-room 
such as the tying of knots in endless cords, and the passage of matter 
through matter.

Fragarach (The Answerer) : In Irish legend a sword that could pierce any 
mail.  It was one of the magical gifts brought by Lugh from the Land of the 
Living.


France : Magical practice in pre-Roman France was vested in the druidic 
cast, and was practically identical with that of the same body in Britain, 
from which, indeed, it drew its inspiration.  It is not likely that Roman 
magic gained any footing in Gaul, but we have little evidence to show 
whether this was or was not the case.  In the early Frankish period of the 
Merovingian dynasty, we find the baleful personality of Fredegonda, wife of 
Hilperic, king of Soissons, " a woman whose glance was witchcraft." She 
destroyed many people on the pretext of sorcery, but there is no doubt that 
she herself experimented in black magic, and protected many practitioners of 
the art.  Thus she saved a sorceress who had been arrested by Ageric, bishop 
of Verdun, by hiding her in the palace.  (See Frede-gonda.)  The practice of 
magic was not punished under the rule of the early French kings, except in 
those in high places, with whom it was regarded as a political offence, as 
in the case of the military leader Mummol, who was tortured by command of 
Hilperic for sorcery.  One of the Salic laws attributed to Pharamond by 
Sigebert states that;   If any one shall testify that another has acted as 
hireburge or strioporte-titles applied to those who carry the copper vessel 
to the spot where the vampires perform their enchantments-and if he fail to 
convict him, he shall be condemned hereby to a forfeit of 7,500 deniers, 
being 180 ½ sous. . . .  If a vampire shall devour a man and be found 
guilty, she shall forfeit 8,000 deniers, being 200 sous."
     The Church legislated also against sorcerers and vam-pires, and the 
Council of Agde, in Languedoc, held in A.D, 506, pronounced excommunication 
against them.  The first Council of Orleans, convened in 541, condemned 
divi-nation and augury, and that of Narbonne, in 589, besides 
excommunicating all sorcerers, ordained that they should be sold as slaves 
for the benefit of the poor.  Those who had dealings with the Devil were 
also condemned to be whipped by the same Council.  Some extraordinary 
phenomena are alleged to have occurred in France during the reign of Pepin 
le Bref.  The air seemed to be alive with human shapes, mirages filled the 
heavens, and sorcerers were seen among the clouds, scattering unwholesome 
pow-ders and poisons with open hands ; crops failed, cattle died, and many 
human beings perished.  It is perhaps possible that such visions were 
stimulated by the teachings of the famous Kabalist, Zedekias, who presided 
over a school of occult science, where he refrained indeed from unveiling 
the hidden secrets of his art, and contented him-self by spreading the 
theory of elemental spirits, who, he stated, bad before the fall of man been 
subservient to him.
It was thought that the visions alluded to above signified the descent of 
sylphs and salamanders in search of their former masters.  Says Eliphas 
Levi:
     “Voyages to the land of sylphs were talked of on all sides as we talk 
at the present day of animated tables and fluidic manifestations.  The folly 
took possession even of strong minds, and it was time for an intervention on 
the part of the Church, which does not relish the super-natural being hawked 
in the public streets, seeing that such disclosures, by imperilling the 
respect due to au-thority and to the hierarchic chain of instruction, cannot 
be attributed to the spirit of order and light.  The cloud-phantoms were 
therefore arraigned and accused of being hell-born illusions, while the 
people-anxious to get something into their hands-began a crusade against 
sorcerers.  The public folly turned into a paroxysm of mania  strangers in 
country places were accused of descending from heaven and were killed 
without mercy; imbeciles confessed that they had been abducted by sylphs or 
demons ; others who had boasted like this previously either would not or 
could not unsay it; they were burned or drowned, and, according to Gannet, 
the number who perished throughout the kingdom almost exceeds belief. It is 
the common catastrophe of dramas in which the first parts are played by 
ignorance or fear.
    “Such visionary epidemics recurred in the reigns following, and all the 
power of Charlemagne was put in action to calm the public agitation.  An 
edict, afterwards re-newed by Louis the Pious, forbade sylphs to manifest 
under the heaviest penalties.  It will be understood that in the absence of 
the aerial beings the judgments fell upon those who had made a boast of 
having seen them, and hence they ceased to be seen.  The ships in air sailed 
back to the port of oblivion, and no one claimed any longer to have 
journeyed through the blue distance.  Other popular frenzies replaced the 
previous mania, while the romantic splendours of the great reign of 
Charlemagne furnished the makers of legends with new prodigies to believe 
and new marvels to relate."
     Around the figure of Charlemagne (q.v.) clusters such an immense amount 
of the matter of faery that it is re-served for treatment in a special 
article, and it will suffice to state here that it almost partakes of the 
nature of true myth.  It is stated that the Enchiridion (q.v.) (which may 
well be stigmatised as an early text-book of occult absurdity having no 
claim to figure in the true genealogy of occult literature)  was presented 
to Charlemagne by  Pope Leo III.
     Eliphas Levi presents a picturesque condition of affairs in the France 
of Charlemagne in the 
following passage: 
     “We know that superstitions die hard and that degen-erated Druidism had 
struck its roots deeply in the savage lands of the North.  The recurring 
insurrections of Saxons testified to a fanaticism which was (a) always 
turbulent, and (b) incapable of repression by moral force alone.  All 
defeated forms of worship-Roman paganism, Germanic idolatry, Jewish rancour 
conspired against victorious Chris-tianity.  Nocturnal assemblies took place  
thereat the conspirators cemented their alliance with the blood of human 
victims; and a pantheistic idol of monstrous form, with the horns of a goat, 
presided over festivals which might be called agapae of hatred.  In a word, 
the Sabbath was still celebrated in every forest and wild if yet 
unre-claimed provinces.  The adepts who attended them were masked and 
otherwise unrecognisable;  the assemblies extinguished their lights and 
broke up before daybreak, the guilty were to be found everywhere, and they 
could be brought to book nowhere.  It came about therefore that Charlemagne 
determined to fight them with their own weapons.
     “In those days, moreover, feudal tyrants were in league with sectarians 
against lawful authority ; female sorcerers were attached to castles as 
courtesans; bandits who fre-quented the Sabbaths divided with nobles the 
blood-stained loot of rapine ; feudal courts were at the command of the 
highest bidder; and the public burdens weighed with all their force only on 
the weak and poor.  The evil was at its height in Westphalia, and faithful 
agents were despatched thither by Charlemagne entrusted with a secret 
mission. Whatsoever energy remained among the oppressed, who-soever still 
loved justice, whether among the people or among the nobility, were drawn by 
these emissaries to-gether, bound by pledges and vigilance in common. To the 
initiates thus incorporated they made known the full powers which they 
carried from the emperor himself, and they proceeded to institute the 
Tribunal of Free Judges.
     A great deal of this, of course, is only what might be expected from 
the French magus.  It is not likely that the Sabbath was yet celebrated in 
such an extreme manner as in later times, nor was the Vehmgericht founded by 
Charlemagne. or indeed, founded at all, for four and a half centuries after 
his day.
     From the reign of Robert the Pious to that of St. Louis, there is not 
much to relate that can strike the imagination of the student of occult 
history.  In the time of the latter monarch flourished the famous Rabbi 
Jachiel, the cele-brated Kabalist.  There is some reason to believe that be 
had glimmerings of the uses of electricity, for on the approach of night a 
radiant star appeared in his lodging, the light being so brilliant that no 
eye could gaze thereon without being dazzled, while it darted rainbow 
colours. It appeared to be inexhaustible, and was never replenished with oil 
or other combustible substance.  When the Rabbi was annoyed by intruders at 
his door he struck a nail fixed in his cabinet, producing simultaneously a 
blue spark on the head of the nail and the door-knocker, to which, if the 
intruder clung, he received a severe shock.  Albertus Magnus (q.v.) lived at 
the same period.
     The next circumstance of interest which falls to be noted is the 
prosecutions of the Templars (q.v.) who were brought to trial by Philip the 
Fair.  Other prosecutions for sorcery were those of Joan of Arc, Gilles de 
Laval (q.v.), lord of Raiz, the prototype of Bluebeard, a renowned sorcerer, 
who with two assistants, Prelati and Sille, practised dia-bolical rites at 
his castle of Machecoul, celebrating the black mass in the most revolting 
manner.  He had been in the habit of slaughtering children to assist him in 
his search for the philosopher's stone.  We now near the period of those 
astounding prosecutions for sorcery which are fully noted under the article 
" Witchcraft" and elsewhere. As early as the thirteenth century the charge 
of sorcery had been made as one of the means of branding with in-famy the 
heretical Waldenses (q.v.), who were accused of selling themselves to the 
Devil, and of holding sabbatical orgies where they did homage to the enemy 
of mankind. About the middle of the fifteenth century France became the 
theatre of wholesale oppression against suspected sor-cerers, but one finds 
leading up to this a series of events which prove that the outburst in 
question was by no means a novelty in that country.  In i 3 i 5 Enguerraud 
de Marigny, who had conducted the execution of the Templars a minister of 
Philip the Fair, was hanged along with an adventurer named Paviot, for 
attempting to compass the deaths of the Counts of Valois and St. Paul.  In 
1134 the Countess of Artois and her son were thrown into prison on a 
suspicion of sorcery.  In i393, in the reign of Charles VI., it was 
considered that his sister-in-law, the Duchess of Orleans, who was a 
viscomte and the daughter of the Duke of Milan, had rendered the King mad by 
sorcery. The ministers of the court resolved to pit a magician against her, 
and one Arnaud Guillaume (q.v.) was brought from Guienne as a suitable 
adversary to the noble lady.  He possessed a book to which he gave the 
strange title of Smagorad, the original of which, he said, was given by God 
to Adam, to console him for the loss of his son Abel, and he asserted that 
the possessor of this volume would hold the stars in subjection, and command 
the four elements. He assured the King's advisers that Charles was suffering 
from the malignity of a sorcerer, but in the meantime the young monarch 
recovered, and the possessor of the patri-archal volume fell back into his 
original obscurity.  Five years later the King had another attack, and two 
Augus-tine friars were sent from Guienne for the purpose of effect-ing a 
cure.  But their conduct was so outrageous that they were executed.  A third 
attack in 1403 was combated by two sorcerers of Dijon, Poinson and Briquet.  
For this purpose they established themselves in a thick wood not far from 
the gates of Dijon, where they made a magic circle of iron of immense 
weight, which was supported by iron columns of the height of a middle-sized 
man, and to which twelve chains of iron were attached.  So great was the 
popular anxiety for the King's recovery, that the two sorcerers succeeded in 
persuading twelve of the principal persons of the town to enter the circle, 
and allow them-selves to be fastened by the chains.  The sorcerers then 
proceeded with their incantations, but they were altogether without result.  
The bailiff of Dijon, who was one of the twelve, and had averred his 
incredulity from the first, caused the sorcerers to be arrested, and they 
were burnt for their pretences.
     The Duke of Orleans appears to have fallen under the same suspicion of 
sorcery as his Italian consort.  After his murder by order of the Duke of 
Burgundy-the com-mencement of those troubles which led to the desolation of 
France-the latter drew up various heads of accusation against his victim as 
justifications of the crime, and one of these was, that the Duke of Orleans 
had attempted to compass his death by means of sorcery.  According to this 
statement, he had received a magician-another apos-tate friar- into his 
castle of Mountjoie, where he was employed in these sinister designs.  He 
performed his magical ceremonies before sunrise on a neighbouring mountain, 
where two demons, named Herman and Astra-mon, appeared to him  and these 
became his active in-struments in the prosecution of his design.
     About the year 1400 the belief in the nightly meetings of the witches' 
Sabbath had become almost universal.  It would indeed be difficult to 
attempt to trace the origin of this practice, which does not seem altogether 
referable to the survival of pagan belief.  (See Witchcraft.)  The wholesale 
nature of the prosecutions against sorcerers and witches prove that there 
must have been an extraordinary number of them in the country.  In Paris 
alone, in the time of Charles IX, there were no less than thirty thousand 
sorcerers, and it is computed that France contained more than three times 
that number in the reign of Henry III., not a town or village being exempt 
from their presence. They belonged to all classes, and generally met the 
same fate, regardless of rank, age or sex.  Children of the ten-derest years 
and nonagenarians were alike committed to the flames, and the terror of 
being publicly accused as a sorcerer hung like a black cloud over the life 
of every successful man, as the charge was one which envy readily seized 
upon for the destruction of its object.  No elaborate or perfect creed 
regarding witchcraft had at this epoch been evolved in England, but in 
France and other conti-nental countries it had been assuming a form 
systematic and complete.  There were probably two reasons for this, the 
decrees of ecclesiastical councils and the numerous treatises of scholars 
who professed to illustrate their various theories regarding sorcery by 
alleged statements from the mouths of its innumerable victims.  Indeed the 
writings of these men served to standardise the sorcery creed of all 
continental countries.  During the earlier part of the six-teenth century, 
trials for witchcraft in France are of rare occurrence, and there are no 
cases of great importance recorded till after the year 5560.  In 1561 a 
number of persons were brought to trial at Vernon, accused of having held 
their Sabbath as witches in an old ruined castle in the shape of cats; and 
witnesses deposed to having seen the assembly, and to having suffered from 
the attacks of the pseudo-feline conspirators.  But the court threw out the 
charge. as worthy only of ridicule.  In 1564, three men and a woman were 
executed at Poitiers, after having been made to confess to various acts of 
sorcery; among other things, they said that they had regularly attended the 
witches' Sabbath, which was held three times a year, and that the demon who 
presided at it ended by burning him-self to make powder for the use of his 
agents in mischief. In 1571, a mere conjurer, who played tricks upon cards, 
was thrown into prison in Paris, forced to confess that he was an attendant 
on the Sabbath, and then executed.  In 1573, a man was burnt at Drole, on 
the charge of having changed himself into a wolf, and in that form devoured 
several children.  Several witches, who all confessed to having been at the 
Sabbaths, were in the same year con-demned to be burnt in different parts of 
France.  In 1578, another man was tried and condemned in Paris for changing 
himself into a wolf; and a man was condemned at Orleans for the same 
supposed crime in 1583.  As France was often infested by these rapacious 
animals, it is not difficult to conceive how popular credulity was led to 
connect their ravages with the crime of witchcraft.  The belief in what were 
in England called wer-wolves (men-wolves), and hi France loups-garous, was a 
very ancient superstition throughout Europe.  It is asserted by a serious 
and in-telligent writer of the time that, in 1588, a gentleman, looking out 
of the window of his chateau in a village two leagues from Apchon, in the 
mountains of Auvergne, saw one of his acquaintances going a-hunting, and 
begged he would bring him home some game.  The hunter, while occupied in the 
chase, was attacked by a fierce she-wolf, and after having fired at it 
without effect, struck it with his hunting-knife, and cut off the paw of his 
right fore-leg, on which it immediately took to flight.  The hunter took up 
the paw, threw it into his bag with the rest of his game, and soon 
afterwards returned to his friend's chateau, and told him of his adventure, 
at the same time putting his hand into the bag to bring forth the wolf's paw 
in confirma-tion of his story.  What was his surprise at drawing out a 
lady's hand, with a gold ring on one finger  His friend's astonishment was 
still greater when he recognised the ring as one which he had given to his 
own wife; and, descending hastily into the kitchen, he found the lady 
warming herself by the fire, with her right arm wrapped in her apron.  This 
he at once seized, and found to his horror that the hand was cut off.  The 
lady confessed that it was she who, in the form of a wolf, had attacked the 
hunter; she was, in due course of time, brought to her trial and condemned, 
and was immediately afterwards burnt at Rioms.
     In 1578, a witch was burnt at Compiegne ; she confessed that she had 
given herself to the devil, who appeared to her as a great black man, on 
horseback, booted and spurred. Another avowed witch was burnt the same year, 
who also stated that the evil one came to her in the shape of a black man.  
In 1582 and 1583, several witches were burnt, all frequenters of the 
Sabbaths.  Several local councils at this date passed severe laws against 
witchcraft, and from that time to the end of the century, the number of 
miser-able persons put to death in France under the accusation
was very great.  In the course only of fifteen years, from 1580 to 1595, and 
only in one province, that of Lorraine, the president Remigius burnt nine 
hundred witches, and as many more fled out of the country to save their 
lives and about the close of the century, one of the French judges tells us 
that the crime of witchcraft had become so common that there were not jails 
enough to hold the prisoners, or judges to hear their causes.  A trial which 
he had wit-nessed in 1568, induced Jean Bodin, a learned physician, to 
compose his book De la Demonomanie des Sorciers, which was ever afterwards 
the text-book on this subject.
     Among the English witches, the evil one generally came in person to 
seduce his victims, but in France and other countries, this seems to have 
been unnecessary, as each person, when once initiated, became seized with an 
uncon-trollable desire of making converts, whom he or she carried to the 
Sabbath to be duly enrolled.  Bodin says, that one witch was enough to 
corrupt five hundred honest persons. The infection quickly ran through a 
family, and was gen-erally carried down from generation to generation, which 
explained satisfactorily, according to the learned commen-tator on 
demonology just mentioned, the extent to which the evil had spread itself in 
his days.  The novice, at his or her reception, after having performed the 
preliminaries, and in general received a new and burlesque rite of baptism, 
was marked with the sign of the demon in some part of the body least exposed 
to observation, and performed the first criminal act of compliance which was 
afterwards to be so frequently repeated, the evil one presenting himself on 
these occasions in the form of either sex, the reverse to that of the 
victim.
     Towards the end of the sixteenth century, the witchcraft infatuation 
had risen to its greatest height in France, and not only the lower classes, 
but persons of the highest rank in society were liable to suspicions of 
dealing in sorcery. We need only mention that such charges were publicly 
made against King Henry III. and Queen Catherine de Medicis, and that, early 
in the following century, they became the ground of state trials which had a 
fatal con-clusion.
     In 1610, during the reign of Louis XIII., occurred the cause celebre of 
the marechale d'Ancre.   Among the ser-vants attached to the train of Marie 
de Medici was a certain Eleanora Don, who married one, Concini, a prodigal 
spend-thrift.  Marie de Medici, as guardian to her son, was virtually ruler 
of France, and considerable power was exercised by these favourites of hers.  
The result was that the peers of France leagued themselves together against 
the upstarts, but with little result at first, as Concini was created 
Marechal of France, with the title of Marquis d'Ancre.  His wife, who was 
very superstitious, fell sick, and attributed her ill-health to the effects 
of sorcery. The upshot was that d'Ancre was assassinated by the nobles 
during a hunting expedition. The mob dragged the corpse of d'Ancre from its 
grave and hanged it on the Pont Neuf. His wretched widow was accused of 
sorcery, and of having bewitched the Queen Mother. The exorcists who had 
assisted her to free herself from illness had advised the sacrifice of a 
cock, and this was now represented as a sacri-fice to the infernal powers.  
Added to this, the astrological nativities of the royal family were found in 
her possession, as were, it is said; a quantity of magical books, and a 
great number of magical characters.  After being tortured with-Out result 
she was beheaded and burnt, and strangely enough the anger of the Parisian 
mob turned to general commiseration.  Many other interesting cases occurred 
in France in the seventeenth century, among others that of the Ursulines at 
Aix (q.v.), for the enchantment of whom Louis Gaufridi was burnt, the Nuns 
of Louviais, and the auns of Assonne. The case of the Ursulines of Loudon 
(q.v.), is fully dealt with elsewhere.  (See Urban Grandler). 
     The eighteenth century in France was fairly prolific in occult history.  
At a time when Europe was credulous about nothing but magic, France did not 
escape the pre-vailing craze.  Perhaps the most striking personality of this 
age in the occult connection was the Comte de Saint Germain (q.v.), who was 
credited with possessing the secrets of alchemy and magic.  His family 
connections were un-known, and his conversation suggested that he had lived 
for many centuries.  Another mysterious adept was an alchemist calling 
himself Lascaris (q.v.) who literally sowed his path through Europe with 
gold. Then followed Cag-liostro (q.v.), who attained a fame unrivalled in 
the history of French occultism.  He founded many masonic lodges throughout 
the country, and assisted in many ways to bring about the French Revolution.  
A school of initiates was founded by Martines de Pasqually, which appears in 
some measure to have incorporated the teachings of the later European 
adepts.  One of the most important figures at this time is Louis Claude de 
Saint-Martin, known as “Le Philosophe Inconnu" who came under the influence 
of Pasqually (q.v.), and later, under that of the writings of Boehme, whose 
works he translated.  Cazotte (q.v.) was the first of these names who were 
associated with both magic and the Revolution, which, indeed, owed much in 
its inception to those mysterious brotherhoods of France and Germany, who 
during the eighteenth century sowed the seeds of equality and Illuminism 
throughout Europe. Another was Loiseaut (q.v.), who formed a mystical 
society, which met in great secrecy, awaiting a vision of John the Baptist, 
who came to them to foretell the Revolution. The spiritual director of this 
circle was a monk named Dom Gerle (q.v.) one of the first mesmerists in 
Paris, who is said to have foretold the dreadful fame of Robespierre by 
means of Catherine Theot, his medium.  He was ex-pelled by the members of 
the circle, acting on the advice of one of their number, Sister Francoise 
Andre, who cher-ished a notion to preserve the crown for the future reign of 
Louis XVII., and thus gave rise to that multitude of stories connected with 
the so-called "Saviours" of the youth-ful" Capet." This sect, or a portion 
of it, became notorious under the leadership of Vintras (q.v.), when its 
meetings degenerated into the most dreadful debauchery.  The appearance of 
Mlle. Lenormand as a prophetess at the end of the eighteenth century may be 
said to close the occult history of that age.  With the beginning of the 
nineteenth century we find the craze for magnetism ram-pant.  In his works 
The Reform of Philosophy and Yes or No, Wronski pretended to have discovered 
the first theorems of the Kabala, and later beguiled rich persons of weak 
intellect into paying him large sums in return for knowledge of the 
Absolute. The Saviours of Louis XVII. were formally condemned in 5853 by the 
Pope as prac-titioners of black magic, but they in turn condemned the Pope, 
and their leader, Vintras, constituted himself Sovereign Pontiff, but he was 
arrested on the charge of roguery and after five years' imprisonment, found 
an asy-lum in England.
     The Baron du Potet did much to advance the science of Mesmer and by 
this time was being seriously followed by Cahagnet and others (See 
Mesmerism). In the middle of the nineteenth century all sorts of absurdities 
swayed occult Paris. The tale of Alphonse Esquiros (q.v.) entitled The 
Magician founded a school of magic phantasy, which was assiduously nursed by 
Henri Delaage (q.v.), who was said to have the gift of ubiquity, and who 
made a collection of processes from the old magicians for acquiring physical 
beauty.
     Spiritualism.  The Comte d'Ourches was the first to introduce into 
France automatic writing and table-writing. Baron Guldenstubbe, in his 
Practical Experimental Pneu-matology  or, the Reality of Spirits and the 
Marvellous Phenomena of their Direct Writing, gives an account of his 
discovery as follows:
    “It was in the course of the year 1850, or about three years prior to 
the epidemic of table-rapping, that the author sought to introduce into 
France the circles of American spiritualism, the mysterious Rochester 
knockings and the purely automatic writings of mediums.  Unfortunately he 
met with many obstacles raised by other mesmerists. Those who were committed 
to the hypothesis of a magnetic fluid, and even those who styled themselves 
Spiritual Mes-merists, but who were really inferior inducers of somnam-
bulism, treated the mysterious knockings of American spiritualism as 
visionary follies.  It was therefore only after more than six months that 
the author was able to form his first circle on the American plan, and then 
thanks to the zealous concurrence of M. Rousaan, a former mem-ber of the 
Societe des Magnetiseurs Spiritualistes, a simple man who was full of 
enthusiasm for the holy cause of spirit-ualism.  We were joined by a number 
of other persons, amongst whom was the Abbe Chatel, founder of the Eglise 
Francaise, who, despite his rationalistic tendencies, ended by admitting the 
reality of objective and supernatural revelation, as an indispensable 
condition of spiritualism and all practical religions. Setting aside the 
moral conditions which are equally requisite, it is known that American 
circles are based on the distinction of positive and electric or negative 
magnetic currents.
     “The circles consist of twelve persons, representing in equal 
proportions the positive and negative or sensitive elements. This 
distinction does not follow the sex of the members, though generally women 
are negative and sensi-tive, while men are positive and magnetic.  The 
mental and physical constitution of each individual must be studied before 
forming the circles, for some delicate women have masculine qualities, while 
some strong men are, morally speaking, women.  A table is placed in a clear 
and ven-tilated spot  the medium is seated at one end and entirely isolated; 
by his calm and contemplative quietude he serves as a conductor for the 
electricity, and it may be noted that a good somnambulist is usually an 
excellent medium.  The six electrical or negative dispositions, which are 
generally recognised by their emotional qualities and their sensibilty, are 
placed at the right of the medium, the most sensitive of all being next him. 
The same role is followed with the positive personalities, who are at the 
left of the medium, with the most positive next to him.  In order to form a 
chain, the twelve persons each place their right hand on the table.  Observe 
that the medium or mediums, if there be more than one, are entirely isolated 
from those who form the chain.
     "After a number of seances, certain remarkable phen-omena have been 
obtained, such as simultaneous shocks, felt by all present at the moment of 
mental evocation on the part of the most intelligent persons.  It is the 
same with mysterious knockings and other strange sounds many people, 
including those least sensitive, have had simultaneous visions, though 
remaining in the ordinary waking state.  Sensitive persons have acquired 
that most wonderful gift of mediumship, namely, automatic writing, as the 
result of an invisible attraction which uses the non-intelligent instrument 
of a human arm to express its ideas. For the rest, non-sensitive persons 
experience the mys-terious influence of an external wind, but the effect is 
not strong enough to put their limbs in motion.  All these phenomena, 
obtained according to the mode of American spiritualism, have the defect of 
being more or less indirect, because it is impossible in these experiments 
to dispense with the mediation of a human being or medium.  It is
the same with the table-turning which invaded Europe in the middle of the 
year 1853.
     “The author has had many table experiences with his honourable friend, 
the Comte d'Ourches, one of the most instructed persons in Magic and the 
Occult Sciences.  We attained by degrees the point when tables moved, apart 
from any contact whatever, while the Comte d'Ourches has caused them to 
rise, also without contact. The author has made tables rush across a room 
with great rapidity, and not only without contact but without the magnetic 
aid of a circle of sitters. The vibrations of piano-chords under similar 
circumstances took place on January 20, 1856, in the presence of the Comte 
de Szapary and Comte d'Ourches. Now all such phenomena are proof positive of 
certain occult forces, but they do not demonstrate ade-quately the real and 
substantial existence of unseen intel-ligences, independent of our will and 
imagination, though the limits of these have been vastly extended in respect 
of their possibilities.  Hence the reproach made against American 
spiritualists, because their communications with the world of spirits are so 
insignificant in character, being confined to mysterious knockings and other 
sound vibra-tions.  As a fact, there is no direct phenomenon at once 
intelligent and material, independent of our will and im-agination, to 
compare with the direct writing of spirits, who have neither been invoked or 
evoked, and it is this only which offers irrefutable proof as to the reality 
of the supernatural world.
     “The author, being always in search of such proof at once intelligent 
and palpable, concerning the substantial reality of the supernatural world, 
in order to demonstrate by certain facts the immortality of the soul, has 
never wearied of addressing fervent prayers to the Eternal, that He might 
vouchsafe to indicate an infallible means for strengthening that faith in 
immortality which is the eternal basis of religion. The Eternal, Whose mercy 
is infinite, has abundantly answered this feeble prayer.  On August 1st, 
1856, the idea came to the author of trying whether spirits could write 
directly, that is, apart from the presence of a medium.  Remembering the 
marvellous direct writing of the Decalogue, communicated to Moses, and that 
other writing, equally direct and mysterious, at the feast of Belshazzar, 
recorded by Daniel ; having further heard about those modern mysteries of 
Stratford in America, where certain strange and illegible characters were 
found upon strips of paper, apparently apart from mediumship, the author 
sought to establish the actuality of such im-portant phenomena, if indeed 
within the limits of possi-bility.
      “He therefore placed a sheet of blank letter paper and a sharply 
pointed pencil in a box, which he then locked, and carried the key about 
him, imparting his design to no one. Twelve days he waited in vain, but what 
was his astonishment on August 13th, 1856. when he found certain mysterious 
characters traced on the paper.  He repeated the experiment ten times on 
that day, placing a new sheet of paper each time in the box, with the same 
result invari-ably.  On the following day he made twenty experiments but 
left the box open, without losing sight of it.  He wit-nessed the formation 
of characters and words in the Es-thonian language with no motion of the 
pencil.  The latter being obviously useless he decided to dispense with it 
and placed blank paper sometimes on a table of his own, some-times on the 
pedestals of old statues, on sarcophagi, on urns, etc., in the Louvre, at 
St. Denis, at the Church of St. Etienne du Mont, etc.,  Similar experiments 
were made in different cemetries of Paris, but the author has no liking for 
cemetries, while most saints prefer the localities where they have lived on 
earth to those in which their mortal remains are laid to rest."
     We are now launched upon the sea of modern spiritualism in France, 
which occupied the entire activities of occultists in that country for 
several decades, and which it will be better to trace from the period of its 
importation into the country.
     Very soon after public attention had been drawn to the subject of 
magnetism in France by Mesmer and d'Eslon, several men distinguished for 
learning and scientific at-tainments, followed up their experiments with 
great success. Amongst these was the Baron Dupotet, whose deep interest in 
the subject of magnetism induced him to publish a peri-odical which, under 
the title of Journal de Magnitisme-still forms a complete treasury of well 
collated facts, and curious experiments in occult force.  From this work we 
learn that the Baron's investigations commenced in the year 1836, since 
which period up to 1848, he chronicled the production of the following 
remarkable phases of phen-omena, the occurrence of which is testified to by 
numerous scientific and eminent witnesses.  Through the Baron's magnetized 
subjects was evolved, clairvoyance, trance-speaking, and healing ; stigmata 
or raised letters and figures on the subject's body; elevation of 
somnambulists into the air ; insensibility to fire, injury or touch.  In the 
presence of the magnetized objects also, heavy bodies were moved without 
human contact, and objects were brought from distant places through walls 
and closed doors.  Some-times the  Lucides " described scenes in the spirit 
world, found lost property, prophesied and spoke in foreign languages.
     In 1840, Baron Dupotet writes that he had 'rediscovered in magnetism 
the magic of antiquity."  " Let the savants," he says, " reject the doctrine 
of spiritual appearances the enquirer of to-day is compelled to believe it ; 
from an examination of undeniable facts." If the know-ledge of ancient magic 
is lost, all the facts remain on which to reconstruct it."
     But of all the revealers to whom French Spiritualism is indebted for 
indubitable proof of super-mundane inter-course, none stands more prominent 
in truthfulness and worth, than M. Cahagnet, the well-known author of 'The 
Celestial Telegraph," a work translated into English in
1848.
     M. Cahagnet was an unlearned mechanic, a man of the people and though a 
sensible and interesting writer, was neither well read, nor highly educated.  
He affirms that he was a  materialist " when first his attention was at-
tracted to the subject of animal magnetism, but being of a thoughtful 
nature, he determined to devote all the leisure he could spare to a thorough 
examination of its possibilities. When he found that he possessed the power 
to induce the magnetic sleep in others, he proceeded on the plan then 
generally adopted by mesmerists, namely, to try how far he could succeed in 
biologizing his subjects, that is to say, to substitute his own senses, 
mind, and will, for those of the sleeper.
     In the course of these experiments M. Cahagnet dis-covered that he 
could effect remarkable cures of disease, and being naturally of a 
benevolent disposition, he deter-mined to bend all his energies in this 
desirable direction. He soon found, however, that he was destined to realize 
the aphorism,  “he builded wiser than he knew."  A new and most perplexing 
obstacle arose to confound his phil-osophy and scatter his theories to the 
winds; this was the fact, that some of his subjects, instead of representing 
what simply he willed, or manifesting-in accordance with his views of 
biology-merely the influence of his mind, began to transcend both will and 
mind, and wander off in space, to regions they persisted in calling the  
land of spirits," and to describe people, whom they emphatically affirmed to 
be the souls of those whom the world called dead.
     For a long time M. Cahagnet strove vehemently to com-bat what he termed 
these "wild hallucinations," but when he found them constantly recurring, 
and vast numbers of those who had come to witness the experiments in mag-
netism recognising in the descriptions given by the somnam-bulists the 
spirits of those whom they had known on earth, and mourned as dead, 
conviction became inevitable, and the magnetizer, like his visitors, was 
compelled to admit a new and wonderful phase of lucidity, and one which 
carried the vision of the clairvoyant from earth to heaven, and pierced the 
veil which separated the mortal from the realms of immortality.  It was 
after a long series of care-fully conducted experiments of the above 
description, that M. Cahagnet was finally persuaded to give the results of 
his wonderful seances to the world, under the name and style of The 
Celestial Telegraph, or, Secrets of the Life to Come.
     The author of Art Magic says: " The narrow conser-vatism of the age, 
and the pitiful jealousy of the Medical Faculty, rendered it difficult and 
harassing to conduct magnetic experiments openly in Europe within several 
years of Mesmer's decease.  Still such experiments were not wanting, and to 
show their results, we give a few excerpts from the correspondence between 
the famous French Magnetists, MM. Deleuze and Billot, from the years 1829 to 
1840.  By these letters, published in 1836, it ap-pears that M. Billot 
commenced his experiments in mag-netizing as early as 1789, and that during 
forty years, he had an opportunity of witnessing facts in clairvoyance, 
ecstasy, and somnambulism, which at the time of their publication 
transcended the belief of the general mass of readers.  On many occasions in 
the presence of entranced subjects, spirits recognised as having once lived 
on earth in mortal form-would come in bodily presence before the eyes of an 
assembled multitude and at request bring flowers, fruits, and objects, 
removed by distance from the scene of the experiments.
     "M. Deleuze frankly admits that his experience was more limited to 
those phases of somnambulism in which his subjects submitted to amputations 
and severe surgical operations without experiencing the slightest pain. In a 
letter dated 1831 M. Billot writing to Deleuze says: -
     “’I repeat, I have seen and known all that is permitted to man.  I have 
seen the stigmata arise on magnetized subjects ; I have dispelled obsessions 
of evil spirits with a single word.  I have seen spirits bring those 
material objects I told you of, and when requested. make them so light that 
they would float, and, again, a small boiteau de bonbons was rendered so 
heavy that I failed to move it an inch until the power was removed.
     “’To those who enjoyed the unspeakable privilege of listening to the  
somnambules" of Billot, Deleuze, and Cahagnet, another and yet more striking 
feature of unani-mous revelation was poured forth.  Spirits of those who had 
passed away from earth strong in the faith of Roman Catholicism-often 
priests and dignitaries of that conser-vative Church, addressing prejudiced 
believers in their former doctrine, asserted that there was no creed in 
Heaven
-no sectarian worship, or ecclesiastical dogmatism there prevailing.
     “’They taught that God was a grand Spiritual Sun-life on earth a 
probation-the spheres, different degrees of comprehensive happiness or 
states of retributive suffer-ing-each appropriate to the good or evil deeds 
done on earth. They described the ascending changes open to every soul in 
proportion to his own efforts to improve.
     “’They all insisted that man was his own judge, in-curred a penalty or 
reward for which there was no sub-stitution. They taught nothing of Christ, 
absolutely denied the idea of vicarious atonement-and represented man as his 
own Saviour or destroyer.
     “’They spoke of arts, sciences, and continued activities, as if the 
life beyond was but an extension of the present on a greatly improved scale.  
Descriptions of the radiant beauty, supernal happiness, and ecstatic 
sublimity mani-fested by the blest spirits who had risen to the spheres of 
Paradise, Heaven, and the glory of angelic companionships melts the heart, 
and fills the soul with irresistible yearning, to lay down life's weary 
burdens and be at rest with them.'
     Having shown that Spiritualism arose in France as in Germany from the 
awakening of psychic powers evolved by magnetism, and traced the footprints 
of the great temple builders who have laid the foundation stones of the 
spiritual edifice in the human system and steadily worked upwards from 
matter to force, and from thence to spirit in every gradation of sphere, 
life and progress, we recall the pithy words of the Baron de Potet, who, in 
addressing the would-be leaders of public opinion in his essay on the 
Philosophical Teaching of Magnetism," says:
     “You savants of our country; you have not shown yourselves better 
informed than the Siamese.
     “For these sixty years it has been shouted in your ears:
The Magnetisers march to the discovery of a moral wand; all the phenomena 
they produce indisputably proves its existence.
     “You have declared that they were impostors, imbeciles, and the most 
illustrious amongst you have only pronounced a verdict which will attest to 
future ages your ignorance or, your insincerity.
     “Before the soul is disengaged from matter, it can, and does, converse 
with pure spirits.  Already it can gaze prophetically on its own future 
destiny, by regarding the condition of those who have gone before - but a 
step - yet one which the eye of spirit alone can measure, and if men are 
spirits already, who can stay the eagle glance of the soul into the land of 
its own inheritance ?
     In following up the history of Spiritualism in France, although we find 
it has gained an immense foothold, and exerted a wide-spread influence upon 
the popular mind, it is nevertheless evident, that one of the chief 
obstacles to its general acceptance has been its lack of internal unity, and 
the antagonistic sentiments which have prevailed amongst its acknowledged 
leaders.
     Two of those who have figured most prominently in the grand drama of 
French Spiritualism, and in all probability exerted more influence upon 
public opinion than any other members of its dramatis personae, were MM. 
Allan Kardec and Pierart, the respective editors of the two leading 
Spiritual journals, entitled La Revue Spirite and La Revue Spiritualiste. 
These may also be regarded as the repre-sentatives of the two opposing 
factions known as Spiritual-ists and Spiritists, the former teaching that 
the soul of man undergoes but one mortal birth, and continues its progress 
through eternity in spiritual states, the latter affirming the doctrine of 
lie-incarnation, and alleging that the one spirit in man can and does 
undergo many incarnations in different mortal forms.
     M. Kardec and his followers represented the "Spiritists" or Re-
incarnationists-M. Pierart leading the ranks of the opposing faction most 
commonly called Spiritualists.
     In respect to the question of testimony, it must be re-membered that M. 
Kardec derived his communications chiefly from those writing and trance 
mediums who might have proved the most susceptible to his influence, and is 
said to have persistently banished from his circles, not only Mr. Home, M. 
Bredif and other physical mediums, but all those who did not endorse his 
favourite dogma through their communications.
     Says the author of Nineteenth Century Miracles: It must not be supposed 
that the schism which divided the two leaders of French Spiritualism was 
confined to the immediate sphere of action in which they moved.  Scat-tered 
sympathisers with the writings of Allan Kardec, may be found all over the 
Continent of Europe, and in small numbers in America also.  Few people who 
read works put forward with authoritative pretentions have the faculty of 
thoroughly digesting what they read, hence, when M. Kardec's books were 
translated into the English language, and it became the publisher's interest 
to aid in their circulation, they found more readers than thinkers, and 
their plausible style attracted more admiration than sincere conviction.  In 
France, no doubt M. Kardec's personal influence, and strong psychological 
power, admir-ably fitted him for a propagandist, and when we remember how 
readily any doctrines eloquently advocated will command adherents, 
especially among restless and excitable natures, we need be at no 1055 to 
discover why M. Kardec's writings have become so popular and his opinions so 
generally accepted by his readers.  Little or no spiritual literature was 
disseminated in the French language when Allan Kardec's works were first 
published.  He possessed that indomitable energy and psychological influence 
in which his much harassed rival Pierart was wanting.  Thus in a measure, 
the field of Continental spiritual propagandism was his own, nor did he fail 
to make use of his opportunities.
     "The successes achieved by Kardec's journal, La Revue Spirite, 
communicated a wave of influence also, which propagated journals of a 
similar character all over the country. Thus in 1864, there were no less 
than ten spirit-ualistic periodicals published in France, under the 
following titles : La Revue Spirite, La Revue Spiritualiste, and L'Ave-nir, 
Paris; four Spiritist journals published in Bordeaux, which, in 1865, became 
merged into L' Union Spirite  Borde-lalse; La Medium Evangelique, Toulouse ; 
L'Echo d'autre Tombe, Marseilles; and La Verite, Lyons. The editors of these 
journals are said to have been all followers of Allan Kardec, with the 
exception of M. Pierart, editor of La Revue Spiritualiste."
     It must be remarked that the doctrines of the Re-incar-nationists, 
although defended with great ability by their propagandists, who included 
many of the most capable minds of France, were not suffered to pass without 
severe castigation on the part of their English neighbours; and it becomes 
necessary to note how the French spiritual schism was received on the other 
side of the Channel.  In the London Spiritual Magazine of 1865, the editor, 
in com-menting on the ominous silence of the Spirite journals concerning Dr. 
Maldigny's opera of Swedenborg says :-
     “It is worthy of note that the journals of the Kardec school, so far as 
we have seen them, do not take the least notice of this opera. The Avenir of 
Paris, which appears weekly, but greatly wants facts, has not a word to say 
about it. It is greatly to be regretted that the main object of the 
Kardecian journals seems to be, not the demon-stration of the constantly 
recurring facts of Spiritualism, but the deification of Kardec's doctrine of 
Re-incarnation.
     “To this doctrine - which has nothing to do with Spirit-ualism, even if 
it had a leg of reason or fact to stand on-all the strength, and almost all 
the space of these journals is devoted.
     These are the things which give the enemies of Spirit-ualism a real 
handle against it, and bring it into contempt with sober minds.  Re-
incarnation is a doctrine which Cuts up by the roots all individual identity 
in the future existence.  It desolates utterly that dearest yearning of the 
human heart for reunion with its loved ones in a per-manent world.  If some 
are to go back into fresh physical bodies, and bear new names, and new 
natures, if they are to become respectively Tom Styles, Ned Snooks, and a 
score of other people, who shall ever hope to meet again with his friends, 
wife, children, brothers and sisters ? When he enters the spirit-world and 
enquires for them, lie will have to learn that they are already gone back to 
earth, and are somebody else, the sons and daughters of other people, and 
will have to become over and over the kindred of a dozen other families in 
succession  Surely, no such most cheerless crochet could bewitch the 
intellects of any people, except under the most especial bedevilment of the 
most sarcastic and mischievous of devils."
     In the January number for 1866, a still stronger article on this 
subject appears from the pen of Wm. Howitt, who writes the following 
fearless words of protest against the doctrine of Re-incarnation
     “In the Avenir of November 2nd, M. Pezzani thinks he has silenced M. 
Pierart, by asserting that without Re-incarnation all is chaos and injustice 
in God's creation. ‘In this world there are rich and poor, oppressed and 
oppressors, and without Re-incarnation, God's justice could not be 
vindicated.'  That is to say, in M. Pezzani's conception, God has not room 
in the infinite future to punish and redress every wrong, without sending 
back souls again and again into the flesh. M. Pezzani's idea, and that of 
his brother Re-incarnationists is, that the best way to get from Paris to 
London is to travel any number of times from Paris to Calais and back again. 
We English, that the only way is to go on to London at once. .    As to M. 
Pezzani's notions of God's injustice without Re-incarnation, if souls were 
re-incarnated a score of times, injustice between man and man, riches and 
poverty, oppression and wrong, all the enigmas of social inequality would 
remain just then as now.
     “In noticing these movements in the Spiritist camp in France, we should 
be doing a great injustice if we did not refer to the zealous, eloquent, and 
unremitting exertions of M. Pierart in the Revue Spiritualists, to expose 
and resist the errors of the Spirits to which we have alluded. The doctrine 
of Re-incarnation, M. Pierart has persistently resisted and denounced as at 
once false, unfounded on any evidence, and most pernicious to the character 
of Spirit-ualism."
     Allan Kardec died on March 31st, 1869.
     Notwithstanding the fact that the experimental method of receiving 
communications through physical mediumship was not in favour with M. Allan 
Kardec and his followers, there as an abundant amount of phenomena of all 
kinds recorded in M. Pierart's excellent journal, La Revue Spirit-ualiste, 
also in many other European journals devoted to the subject.  From this we 
are about to select such facts of a representative character as will give a 
general view of French Spiritualism in the nineteenth century.
     The celebrated  “Cure D'Ars," the founder of the D'Ars Providence," and 
many other noble works of charity, Jean Baptiste Vianney, was born in the 
vicinity of Lyons, in 1786, in a humble sphere of life.  His natural 
capacity was by no means remarkable, and at school he was only remembered as 
a somewhat dull scholar. Circumstances having opened up the way for his 
becoming a priest, al-though he had only Latin enough to say mass, and no 
learning beyond the routine of his profession, yet his amiable nature and 
unaffected piety won him friends wherever lie went.  After some changes of 
fortune and the rejection of two good offers of rich positions, which in his 
extreme humility he did not deem himself fit for, he accepted the pastoral 
charge of tile little agricultural village of D'Ars, now in the 
arrondisement of Trevoux.
     Very soon his reputation for beneficence drew round him a much larger 
circle of poor dependents than he could provide for, and then it was that he 
commenced his  extraordinary life of faith, supplicating in fervent prayer 
for whatever means were necessary to carry out his divine mission of 
blessing to his unfortunate fellow creatures. In this way the sphere of his 
benevolence, and the wonder-ful results of the means he employed to maintain 
it, reached proportions that could scarcely he credited
     But now a still more wonderful thing was to happen in the enchanted 
region of D'Ars. Persons afflicted with disease began to experience sudden 
cures whilst praying before the altar, or making confessions to the Cure. 
The fame of this new miracle soon spread abroad, until the Abbe Monnin 
declares that upwards of 20,000 persons an-nually came from Germany, Italy, 
Belgium, and all parts of France, and even from England, and thar in less 
than six years this number increased to an average of 80,000. Diseases of 
every kind that had been pronounced incurable, were dissipated at once. The 
indefatibagle Cure gave himself up to the work, heart and soul.  His church 
stood open day and night, and the immense crowds that sur-rounded it, were 
obliged to wait for hours and sometimes days, to reach the good healer. No 
one was allowed to take precedence of the rest, except in cases of extreme 
poverty or extreme suffering.  Princes, nobles, and great ladies, often 
drove up as near as they could to the church ill grand carriages, and 
manifested the utmost astonishment when informed that notwithstanding their 
rank, they could not be admitted except in turn. The Cure only permitted 
himself to take four hours sleep, namely from eleven to three, and when he 
came to the confessional again, the church and all the approaches to it were 
crowded with those who had waited all night to secure their places. 
Omnibuses were established to convey patients from Lyons to D'Ars, and the 
Saone was covered with boats full of anxious pilgrims.
     There can be no doubt that the first well marked impulse which 
experimental spiritualism received through the invocatory processes of the 
circle, in France, as in many other countries of Europe, was due to the 
visits of Mr. D.D. Home, the celebrated non-professional physical medium, 
and subsequently to the large influx of profes-sional mediums, who found in 
France an excellent field for the demonstration of their peculiar gifts.
     Of Mr. Home's seances it would be superfluous to write, he himself 
having related them in two volumes published at different periods of his 
career, and his many admiring friends having sufficiently described the 
marvels of which they were witnesses in numerous magazines and newspaper 
articles.
     Mr. Home's manifestations were given in France almost exclusively to 
personages of rank, or those distinguished by literary fame.  He was a guest 
of royalty, the nobility, and persons of the highest position.  During his 
residence in Paris, under the Imperial regime, he was a frequent and ever-
welcome visitor at the court of the late Emperor Louis Napoleon.  A record 
of the manifestations produced through his mediumship was kept by command of 
the Empress, and frequently read to her favoured friends. Amongst these 
memoranda is one which went the round of the papers at the time of its 
occurrence, hence there can be no impropriety in alluding to it now.  It 
stated that on one occasion a seance was held at the Tuileries, when none 
were present save the Emperor, the Empress, the Duchess de Montebello, and 
Mr. D. D. Home.
     On the table were placed pen, ink, and paper, and presently a spirit 
band was seen, which dipped the pen in the ink and deliberately wrote the 
name of the first Napol-eon, in a perfect facsimile of that monarch's 
handwriting. The Emperor asked if he might be permitted to kiss this 
wonderful hand, when it instantly rose to his lips, subse-quently passing to 
those of the Empress, and Mr. Home.  The Emperor carefully preserved this 
precious autograph, and inscribed with it a memorandum to the effect that 
the hand was warm, soft, and resembled exactly that of his great predecessor 
and uncle.
     As an evidence of the wide popularity to which the subject of 
Spiritualism had attained in 1869, M. Pierart quotes in one of his numbers 
of that year, an article from the Siecle, a leading paper, but one which has 
hitherto contained many notices inimical to Spiritualism. The writer, M. 
Eugene Bonnemere, says
     “Although somnambulism has been a hundred times annihilated by the 
Academy of Medicine, it is more alive than ever in Paris; in the midst of 
all the lights of the age, it continues, right or wrong, to excite the 
multitude. Protean in its forms, infinite in its manifestations, if you put 
it out of the door, it knocks at the window; if that be not opened, it 
knocks on the ceiling, on the walls; it raps on the table at which you 
innocently seat yourselves to dine or for a game of whist.  If you close 
your ears to its sounds, it grows excited, strikes the table, whirls it 
about in a giddy maze, lifts up its feet, and proceeds to talk through 
mediumship, as the dumb talk with their fingers.
     “You have all known the rage for table-turning.  At one time we ceased 
to ask after each other's health, but asked how your table was.  Thank you, 
mine turns beautifully; and how goes yours on?  Everything turned; hats and 
the heads in them. One was led almost to believe that a circle of passengers 
being formed round the main-mast of a ship of great tonnage, and a magnetic 
chain thus established, they might make the vessel spin round till it 
disappeared in the depth of the ocean, as a gimlet dis-appears in a deal 
board. The Church interfered; it caused its thunders to roar, declaring that 
it was Satan himself who thus raised the devil in the tables, and having 
formally forbade the world to turn, it now forbade the faithful to turn 
tables, hats, brains, or ships of huge size. But Satan held his own. The 
sovereign of the nether world passed into a new 0110, and that is the reason 
that America sends us mediums, beginning so gloriously with the famous Home, 
and ending with the Brothers Davenport.  One remembers with what a frenzy 
everyone precipitated him-sell in pursuit of mediums.  Everyone wished to 
have one of his own; and when you introduced a young man into society, you 
did not say, He is a good waltzer,' but, He is a medium.'  Official science 
has killed and buried this Somnambulism a score of times; but it must have 
done it very badly. for there it is as alive as afresh with a new 
name."	ever, only christened 
afresh with a new name.
     Amongst the many distinguished adherents of Spiritual-ism in the 
department of French literature, none have more bravely asserted and 
defended their belief than Camille Flammarion, the celebrated astronomer; 
Victor Hugo, Alexandre Dumas, and Victorien Sardou, the renowned writer of 
French comedy. M. Sardou was himself a medium of singularly happy 
endowments.  He executed a number of curious drawings, purporting to 
represent scenes in the spirit world, amongst which was an exquisite and 
complex work of art entitled,  “The House of Mozart."

Flank, Christian : A visionary, who died in 1590; he fre-quently changed his 
religion, which fact gained for him the surname of Weathercock.  He believed 
the religion of Japan to be the best, because he had read that its ministers 
were ecstatics.

Frank, Sebastian : A visionary of the sixteenth century, of whose life 
little is known.  In 1531, he published a treatise on l'Arbu de la science 
du bien et du mal, dont Adam a mange la mort, et dont encore aujourd'hui 
tous les hommes la mangent. According to him, the sin of Adam is but an 
allegory, and the tree only the person, will, knowledge, and life of Adam. 
Frank died in 1545.

Fraud : A very large part is played by fraud in spiritualistic practices, 
both in the physical and psychical, or automatic, phenomena, but especially 
in the former. The frequency with which mediums have been convicted of fraud 
has, indeed, induced many people to abandon the study of psy-chical 
research, judging the whole bulk of the phenomena to be fraudulently 
produced.  Yet the question of fraud is itself an interesting and 
complicated one, not unworthy of the attention of the student, for we find 
in connection with spiritualism not only simple deception practised with a 
view to gaining pecuniary advantages, but also many instances of systematic 
and apparently deliberate trickery where there is no evident reward to be 
obtained. and even cases where the medium is, so far as can be judged, 
entirely innocent and ignorant of the fraud he obviously practises. And it 
may be added that after all precautions have been taken which science and 
commonsense can suggest, there remains a portion of the phenomena which 
still continues to be inexplicable, and which justifies the interest now so 
widely shown in psychic science..
     In considering the important factor of fraud, we must distinguish 
between conscious and unconscious fraud, though, as will be shown hereafter, 
it is at times possible for the one to shade imperceptibly into the other. 
Con-scious fraud most often appears in connection with the physical 
phenomena.  Almost at the outset of the spirit-ualistic movement, i.e., in 
1851, three doctors, professors of the University of Buffalo, N.Y., 
demonstrated that the rappings which attended the Sisters Fox were produced 
by the manipulation of the knee and toe joints, a fact which was shortly 
afterwards corroborated by Mrs. Cluver, a relative of the Fox family.  Since 
that time many mediums have at one time or another been convicted of fraud, 
and every phase of physical mediumship been dis-credited. Slate-writing, 
spirit photography, materialisation, have all in turn been exposed, though 
the latter, at least, seems able to survive any number of exposures. Time 
and again, sitters have beheld the form and features of the medium in the 
materialised spirit; shadowy figures in filmy draperies, have been shown to 
be mannikins wrapped in muslin, and false beards and white draperies have 
been found about the person of the medium. Apports have been smuggled into 
the seance-room-jewels, flowers, perfumes, objets d'art-in order to be 
showered upon the sitters by generously-disposed "spirits." Threads and 
human hairs have been used to move furniture and other objects.  Sometimes 
more elaborate and complicated machinery is provided, but more often the 
medium depends upon sleight of hand and skilful suggestion to accomplish his 
ends. Conjurers have frequently been admitted to seances, and have failed to 
discover the modus operandi of the various feats, but this fact, though a 
great deal has been made of it by spiritualists, cannot be taken to have any 
significance, since conjurers are often quite mystified by each other's 
performances.
     Another phase of fraud is that illustrated by many instances of soi-
disant clairvoyance, where the medium acquires her information by muscle-
reading, or by judicious enquiry previous to the seance. Fraud of this kind 
may be either conscious or unconscious.
     Under the heading of unconscious fraud must be classed a large group of 
automatic phenomena.  In many of the more pronounced cases of automatism, 
the normal con-sciousness of the agent is not responsible for his acts, 
while, on the other hand, there is a slighter degree of automatism, where 
the agent may be partly conscious of, and respon-sible for, his productions. 
This latter state, if it be fre-quently induced, and if the wilt power of 
the automatist be somewhat relaxed, may pass into the more profound stage; 
so that fraud which is at first conscious and voluntary may in time become 
unconscious and spontaneous. And thus it is extremely difficult to know just 
when aft accusa-tion of fraud may with justice be brought against a medium. 
There is evidence that many trance mediums reproduce in their discourses 
information subconsciously acquired at some more or less remote period ; the 
trance utterances of Mrs. Piper, Mrs. Thomson, and others, reveal this 
peculiar-ity.  It is true that extensive and apparently fraudulent 
arrangements are sometimes made before a seance, but may it not be possible 
that, previous to a "physical" or psychical" dance, such preparations may be 
made automatically in a state approximating to the mediumistic trance ? If 
the hypnotic subject is not responsible or is only partly so-for the 
fulfillment of a post-hypnotic promise, would it not be within reason to 
suppose that the medium, in gaining information concerning possible sitters, 
in secreting apports about the person, is the victim of a similar 
dissociation of consciousness? There are facts not a few which would support 
such a conclusion.
     Spiritualists themselves are, from time to time, called upon to face 
exposures of undoubted fraud, and on these occasions various apologies of a 
morn or less ingenious nature, are offered for the erring medium.  Sometimes 
it is said that the medium is controlled by mischievous spirits (diakka), 
who make use of his physical organism to perform tricks and deceptions.  
Again, it is stated that the medium feels an irresistible impulse to perform 
the action which he knows is in the mind of the control. Thus Eusapia Palla-
dino would extend her hand involuntarily in the direction in which movement 
of furniture was to take place, though without actual contact-that is, 
perceiving that the spirits desired to move the object, she herself was 
impelled to attempt a physical (and fraudulent) forestalling of the action. 
Certain of the investigators who examined the phenomena in connection with 
the latter medium have also declared that their production costs Eusapia a 
great deal of pain and fatigue, and that she therefore seizes readily upon 
an opportunity of producing them easily and without trouble.  Such an 
opportunity, they held, only presented itself when their rigorous 
precautions were relaxed. The same has also been stated in connection with 
other mediums. In the case of a materialisation seance, when the spirit form 
is grasped and found to be the medium herself, these apologists offer an 
explanation, as follows: A certain amount of the medium's physical energy is 
imparted to the spirit.  If the latter be roughly handled, spirit and medium 
will unite for their joint benefit, either within or without the cabinet-if 
the medium possesses most energy, she will draw the spirit to her, if the 
most of the energy is with the materialised spirit, it is the medium who 
will instantly be attracted to the spirit.  That it is the latter 
alternative which invariably takes place is a fact which has no signifi-
cance for good spiritualists.  Or they may insist, as did Sergeant Cox, on 
one occasion, that the medium is con-trolled to impersonate a spirit.  But 
whatever be the reason for fraud, it is clear that not the most ingenuous 
medium is to be trusted for a moment, though his character in normal life be 
blameless, and no object in committing fraud be apparent; and that 
investigators must rely only on the strictest vigilance and the most up-to-
date scientific methods and apparatus.

Freemasonry-History and Origin:  Though it would not be exactly correct to 
say that the history of Freemasonry was lost in the mists of antiquity, it 
is competent to remark that although to a certain degree traceable, its 
records are of a scanty nature, and so crossed by the trails of other 
mystical brotherhoods, that disentanglement is an ex-tremely difficult 
process. The ancient legend of its founda-tion at the time of the building 
of the Temple at Jerusalem is manifestly traditional.  If one might hazard 
an opinion, it would seem that at a very early epoch in the history of 
civilization, a caste of builders in stone arose, who jealously guarded the 
secret of their craft. In all probability this caste was prehistoric.  It is 
not unreasonable to assume this when we possess plenty of proof that an 
ancient caste of bronze-workers flourished in every country in Europe and 
Asia; and if this be admitted, and it cannot well be refuted in the light of 
recent researches,-(see Journal of the Gypsy Lore Society for 1913)-there is 
nothing absurd or impossible in the contention that a similar school of 
workers in stone should have arisen at a like early period. We know that it 
is probable that the old caste of bronze-workers had an esoteric language of 
their own, which has come down to us as the Shelta Than (q.v.) spoken 
generally by the tinkler people of Great Britain and Ireland.  If such a 
caste can elaborate a secret language and cling jealously to the " 
mysteries" of metal-working, there is no reason to doubt the existence of a 
similar caste of masons. We tender this theory for what it is worth, as it 
is unsupported by any great authority on the subject.  Where such, a caste 
of operative masons arose is altogether a separate question, and cannot be 
dealt with here; but it must ob-viously have been in a country where working 
in stone was one of the principal arts.  It is also almost certain that this 
early brotherhood must have been hierophantic. Its principal work to begin 
with would undoubtedly consist in the raising of temples and similar 
structures, and as such it would come into very close contact with the 
priesthood, if indeed it was not wholly directed by it.  In early civil-
ization but two classes of dwelling receive the attention of the architect,-
the temple and the palace.  For example, among the ruins of Egypt and 
Babylon, remains of the private house are rare, but the temple and the royal 
resi-dence are everywhere conspicuous, and we know that among the ruins of 
Central America temples and palaces alone remain-the huts of the surrounding 
dwellers having long ago disappeared. The temple is the nucleus of the early 
city. Around the worship of the gods crystallises com-merce, agriculture, 
and all the affairs of life.  All roads lead to the temple.  Striding for a 
moment over the gap of years between early Babylon and Egypt and medieval 
Britain, we find the priesthood in close touch with the masons. A medieval 
cathedral took more than one gen-eration to erect, and in that time many 
masons came and went around the fane. The lodge was invariably founded hard 
by the rising cathedral or abbey, and apprentices and others were entered as 
opportunity offered : indeed a man might serve his apprenticeship and labour 
all through his life upon the one building, without ever seeing any work 
else-where. The evidence as to whether the master-masons were also 
architects is very conflicting, and it has been held that the priests were 
the architects of the British cathe-drals,-the master-masons and operatives 
merely carrying out their designs. There is good evidence however that this 
is not wholly true. Authorities are at one in declaring that of all arts 
architecture is by far the most intricate. It is undoubtedly the one which 
requires a long and specific training.  Questions of stress and strain of 
the most difficult description arise, and it seems incredible that anyone 
with the most superficial knowledge of the subject should believe that 
ecclesiastics, who had not undergone any special training should be 
qualified to compose plans of the most perfect and intricate description for 
the most noble and remarkable edifices ever raised in this country.
We know that professional architects existed at a very early period; and why 
the priesthood should be credited with their work, it is difficult to 
understand; but instances are on record where the priests of a Certain 
locality have taken to themselves the credit of planning the cathedral of 
the diocese.  Be this as it may, the  “mystery " of build-ing was 
sufficiently deep to require extensive knowledge and experience and to a 
great extent this justifies the jealousy with which the early masons 
regarded its secrets. Again, this jealousy with which it was kept from the 
vulgar gaze may have been racial in its origin, and may have arisen from 
such considerations as the following  ' Let no stranger understand this 
craft of ours.  Why should we make it free to the heathen and the foreigner 
? "  This also smacks of priest-craft, but if masonry originated  hiero-
phantically, it certainly did not continue a preserve of any religion, and 
is nowadays probably the chiefest abomination of the Roman Catholic 
hierarchy, which has not hesitated to publish and disseminate the grossest 
libels regarding it.  It is to Britain that we must look for evidence as to 
the evolutionary line of masonry.  Before the founding of the Grand Lodge, 
we find that York and the North of England in general was regarded as the 
most ancient seat of the fraternity in this island.  Indeed without 
stretching prob-abilities too far, the line oi evolution so far as York is 
con-cerned is quite remarkable.  We know for example that in the early days 
of that city a temple of Serapis existed there, which was afterwards a 
monastery of the Begging Friars, and the mysteries of this god existed 
beside the Roman Collegia or Craftsmen's Society,.  it is also Considered 
that the crypt of York Minster affords evidence of the progress of masonry 
from Roman to Saxon times.. It is stated that it has a mosaic pavement of 
blue and white tables laid in the form employed in the first degree of 
masonry, and is said to show the sites of three seats used by the master and 
his wardens during the construction of the building.  It is also an 
undoubted fact that the craft occasionally met in this crypt during last 
century. There is thus reason to believe even though the evidence be of a 
scanty nature (but the foregoing does not embrace ah of it) that the early 
masons of Britain were probably influ-enced by Romano-Egyptian mystical 
societies, and that their own craft societies drew some of their practices 
and constitutions from these alien schools.  Masonic tradition goes to show 
that even in the beginning of the fourteenth Century masonry in Britain was 
then regarded as a thing of great antiquity.  Lodge records for the most 
part only date back to the sixteenth century in the oldest instances, but 
ancient manuscripts are extant which undoubtedly relate to masonry. Thus the 
old charges embodied in the Regius MS. which was unearthed in 1839 by Mr. 
Halliwell Phillips are dated at 1390. and contain a curious legend of the 
craft, which tells how the necessity of finding work of some description 
drove men to consult Euclid, who recom-mended masonry as a craft to them.  
It goes on to tell how masonry was founded in Egypt, and how it entered 
England in the time of Athelstan.  The necessity for keep-ing close counsel 
as regards the secrets of the craft is insisted upon in rude verse.  The 
Cooke MS. dates from the first part of the fifteenth century, and likewise 
contains versions of the old charges.  Egypt is also regarded here as the 
mother-land of masonry, and Athelstan is the medium for' the introduction of 
the craft into the island of Britain.  But that this manuscript was used 
among masons at a later date was proved by the discovery of a more modern 
version dated about 1687, in 1890, and known as the William Wat-son MS.  In 
all about seventy of these old charges and pseudo-histories have been 
discovered since 186o. They have all much in common and are of English 
origin.
      A great deal has been written to attempt to prove that British 
freemasonry borrowed extensively from continental secret societies, such as 
the Steinmetzin of Germany, the Rosicrucians (q.v.) and similar fellowships.  
The truth probably lies however in the circumstance that the coming and 
going of students of occultism throughout Europe was so constant, and so 
frequent were their communications that practically all those societies were 
in touch with one another.  Again many persons belonged to several of them 
at once, and imported the rules and constitution of one body into another.  
No student of occultism can fail to be struck with the close resemblance of 
the constitutions of nearly all the mystical fellowships of the middle ages, 
and the resemblance of the verbiage employed by their founders and 
protagonists.  It must also ho insisted that the speculative or mystic part 
of masonry was in the middle ages merely a tradition with the brotherhood, 
whatever it may have been in earlier times, and whatever close con-nection 
the craft may have had with hierophantic or mystic philosophy.  The 
speculative element, we repeat, was merely traditional and symbolical as at 
present, and not practical ; but this tradition was to serve to keep alight 
the flame of speculative mysticism which was to be aroused again at the end 
of the medieval period.  When political freedom awoke in Europe, the 
necessity for the existence of secret Societies vanished, but the persons 
who delighted in their formation and management still remained.  The raison 
d'etre of these fellowships had disappeared, but the love of mysticism, not 
to say the mysterious, was per-haps stronger than ever.  that then occurred 
? Simply this: that all those persons who found the occupation of floating 
and managing real secret societies gone, cast about for anything in the 
shape of a mystical fellowship that they could find. They soon discovered 
the craft of masonry which although operative possessed mystical traditions. 
The attraction was mutual, and astrologers, alchemists and others soon 
crowded the lodges, to such purpose that at the lodges held in 1646 in 
London, there was not an oper-ative mason present, and at that held in 1682, 
the specu-lative branch was overwhelming in its numbers.  Harking back a 
little it is noteworthy that the freemasons in  me-dieval times formed a 
fellowship or guild closely resembling in its Constitution that of similar 
trade guilds both in Britain and the continent  such as the Weavers, 
Tailors, Fish-mongers, and so forth.  But although these guilds preserved 
their mysteries," where they possessed them, with con-siderable jealousy, 
they do not appear to have embedded in their constitutions the same ancient 
practices and ritual which go to show so strongly that masonry is 
undoubtedly an institution of great antiquity.
     It has also been suggested that freemasonry as intro-duced into Europe 
by the Knights Templar.  It would be difficult to discover a similar 
institution which in the opinion of some authorities had not been founded by 
that order and it is difficult to believe that the haughty chivalry of 
Norman times would have claimed any connection what-soever with an operative 
craft.  There are, however, many connections between alchemy and masonry.  
For example in the Ordinall of Alchymy compiled by Thomas Norton, (q.v.), 
the freemasons are alluded to as workers in it.  In 1630, we find Fludd 
(q.v.) using language which smacks strongly of freemasonry.  His society was 
divided into degrees, and the Masons' Company of London had a copy of the 
masonic charges presented by him.  Vaughan also appears to have been a 
freemason, and many masons of the middle of the seventeenth century, such as 
Robert Moray and Elias Ashmole, were diligent students of occult science. 
and Sir Christopher Wren was a student of hermetic art.
     It has often been put forward that Scotland was the original home of 
freemasonry in these islands, but although the craft was undoubtedly ancient 
in that country, there does not appear to be any adequate proof that it was 
older than in England.  Some of the Scottish lodges, such as No. I 
Edinburgh, Kilwinning, and Aberdeen, possess very ancient records, and it is 
probable that this has led to the assump-tion that the brotherhood was of 
greater antiquity in North Britain than in England.  But the circumstance 
that the craft was probably introduced into England in Roman times, where it 
has in all likelihood flourished ever since, tends to dispose of such a 
theory.  The history of modern freemasonry begins with the formation of the 
Grand Lodge of England, which was inaugurated on St. John the Bap-tist's Day 
1717 by several old lodges.  This represented the first central governing 
body of the fraternity, and before this time each lodge had been self-
governing. Many lodges speedily came under its aegis, and Ireland formed a 
Grand lodge of her own in 1725 but Scotland did not follow till 1736, and 
even then many lodges held aloof from the cen-tral body, only 33 out of Ion 
falling into line.  From one or other of these three governing bodies all 
the regular lodges throughout the world have arisen, so that modern masonry 
may truthfully be said to be of entirely British origin. This is not the 
place to enter into an elaborate discussion of the history and affairs of 
modern masonry, and we are chiefly exercised regarding its mystical position 
and ten-dencies.  Regarding these we must be brief.  As regards the lower 
ranks of the craft, it consists almost entirely in these islands at least of 
persons who have in great measure treated it as a mere friendly society, and 
it is only in the higher ranks that any real idea of the true significance 
of the mystical tenets preserved and taught is retained.  The ordinary 
mason, who preserves a cryptic and mysterious silence when the affairs of 
his craft are alluded to, merely serves as a laughing-stock to the modern 
well-equipped mystic.  Certain signs and handgrips are in use amongst 
masons, and the possession of these, and of a ritual the  significance  of  
which  he rarely  comprehends, the  average  brother fondly imagines  
renders him somewhat superior to the layman  It is extremely doubt-ful if 
among even the higher ranks of masonry, the deepest significance of the 
tradition of the craft is thoroughly real-ised, and if the absurd works 
which every now and then emanate from eminent masons reading the history of 
their craft be accepted as criteria of their higher knowledge, it must 
indeed be of slight proportions  Regarding the grand secret, or secrets, of 
masonry the layman may rest comfortably assured that if he has failed to 
join the brother-hood, he has missed no fact of supreme importance by so 
doing. There is no " secret" at all. The original secrets in connection with 
the craft were those of operative masons, who were jealous of their position 
as workmen, and who rightly enough did not believe in giving away business 
secrets to all and sundry  but the so-called  “secrets " of modern 
speculative masonry are merely such as have brought alchemy, astrology, and 
the kindred sciences into unthinking disrepute among those who do not 
recognise their significance in the history of human thought  This is not to 
say that masonry as a whole consists of mere clap-trap. The trend of its 
entire constitution is nowadays frankly mystical, but it is a mysticism 
which is only half understood by the lower ranks of the craft, and which is 
imperfectly recognised by its higher officers.  Its tenets are 
unquestionably mystic  and  lofty, but masonic transcendentalism has 
scarcely kept in line with the more modern forms of mysticism.  From time to 
time new de-grees have been formed which have in some measure recti-fied 
this, but the number of masons qualified to understand the nature of the 
vast and mighty truths conveyed in these, is naturally extremely small, and 
it is as a friendly society that the brotherhood effects its greatest good.
     As has been said, continental masonry is undoubtedly the offspring of 
British systems. This is not to say that in France and Germany there were no 
masonic lodges in existence before the formation of the English Grand Lodge; 
but all modern lodges in these countries undoubtedly date from the inception 
of the English central body. French masonry possessed and possesses many 
rites which differ entirely from those accepted by the British craft. We 
find the beginnings of modern French masonry in the labours of Martinez 
Pasqually (q.v.), St. Martin (q.v.), and perhaps to a great extent in those 
of Cagliostro (q.v.) who toiled greatly to found his Egyptian rite in 
France.  It is notice-able, however, that he had become a member of a London 
lodge before attempting this.  In France, masonry has always had more or 
less a political complexion, and nowadays the extreme enmity existing 
between it and the Roman Catholic church in that country favours the inclu-
sion in its ranks of persons possessing ideals by no means in consonance 
with the very upright standard of British masonry.  In Germany, it has been 
said that the Stein-metzin approximated very strongly in mediaeval times to 
the British masons, if they were not originally one and the same; but the 
later lodges in Germany all date from that founded in 1733.
     The entrance of masons into the various degrees involves an elaborate 
system of symbolic ritual, of which the essence is uniform throughout all 
lodges.  The members are classi-fied in numerous degrees, of which the first 
three are entered apprentice, fellow-craft, and master-mason.  Each lodge 
possesses its own bye-laws, subject to the Book of Constitu-tion of the 
Grand Lodge.
     Wild stories have been circulated, chiefly by the Roman Catholic 
enemies of masonry, regarding the practice of diabolic occultism in the 
higher ranks of the craft.  To begin with, it is extremely unlikely that 
more than three or four persons connected with it possess the requisite 
knowledge to thus offend against the Christian proprieties, and the childish 
asseverations of French writers on the subject may be dismissed with a 
smile.  The " occultism and  transcendentalism" of the majority of zealous 
breth-ren are usually of the mildest character possible, and are in some 
measure related to the mysterious attitude of the average mason, when dark 
hints as to lodge doings are whispered of among his admiring relatives.

Friar Rush (German Rausch)  A house-spirit supposed to have been sent from 
the infernal regions to keep the monks and friars of the seventeenth century 
in the same state of wickedness that they then existed in.  He gained 
admittance to monastic houses as a scullion; is probably representa-tive of 
the spirit of inebriety.  A German myth.


Frends of God : A mystical society founded in Germany in the fourteenth 
century, for the purpose of ministering to the poor by preaching and 
sacrament.  Its members in-cluded men and women of every rank and station; 
not only monks and nuns, but knights, farmers, artisans, merchants. Their 
law was : " That universal love, commanded by Christ, and not to be gainsaid 
by his vicar." Their prophecies and warnings roused the ire of certain of 
the clergy, and they were charged with sectarianism.


Frltzlar, Martin Von : German alchemist.  (Circa, 1750.) The dates of the 
birth and death of this alchemist have never been ascertained, but he is 
known to have lived in the first half of the eighteenth century, while he 
appears to have been a Hessian, resident chiefly at the village of Firtzlat. 
While a young man, he studied pharmacy, intending to make it his profession; 
but he soon grew inter-ested in the quest of gold-making, and, when the 
celebrated alchemist, Lascaris, came to Germany, Martin hastened to his 
presence with a view to gleaning his secrets.  Along with several other 
young men, the Hessian was allowed to witness numerous experiments, and 
while he watched them, it seemed to him that the great secret lay open 
before him; but afterwards, when he made attempts on his own account, he 
found that Lascaris had duped him shamefully, and had even taken advantage 
of his ignorance.  Thereupon, in contradistinction to the majority of 
thwarted alchemists, he renounced the futile search altogether, vowed fealty 
to his original calling, and devoted the rest of his life thereto.

Fumigation in Exorcism : One of the most important rites during the exorcism 
of an evil spirit, appears to have been the fumigation of the victim; and 
for this, various pre-scriptions are given throughout occult history.  If it 
is found difficult to dislodge the demon, a picture of him is sometimes 
drawn, which is to be thrown into the fire after having  been signed with 
the cross, sprinkled with holy water, and fumigated."  At other times, if 
the evil spirit refuses to give his name, the exorcist will fumigate the
possessed one.


Futhore  (See Teutons ).



G

Galactides or Galaricides : Perhaps a species of emerald. It is greatly 
valued by magicians, its property being to make magical writings heard, and 
ghosts appear, to return answers.  It promotes love and friendship.


Galeotti, Martius : Italian Astrologer.  (1442-1494). Born in 1442, this 
Italian astrologer and theologian, appears to have been a native of Narni, 
in Umbria; but it would seem that he left italy while a young man, and 
settled for a while at Boulogne.  Here, he gave grave offence to the Church 
of Rome by promulgating the doctrine that good works are not the road to 
salvation, and that this is only to be ob-tained by faith in Christ; and, 
finding the priests around him growing daily more and more hostile, Galeotti 
saw fit to leave France for Hungary, where he became secretary to the king, 
Matthias Covirnus, and also tutor to the latter's son, Prince John.  His 
secretarial and tutorial duties, however, did not occupy the whole of his 
time; and, besides making himself an expert astrologer, he wrote a book 
called, De jocose Dictis et Foctis Regis Matchiae Covirni. Some of the 
tenets contained therein were the means of his incurring fresh ill-will from 
the clergy ; and eventually, their rancour became so great, indeed, that the 
writer was seized and taken to Venice, where he was imprisoned for a while.  
He was released anon, chiefly owing to the influence of the Pope, Sixtus IV, 
whose tutor he is said to have been at an earlier and indeterminate date; 
and, thereupon, Galeotti returned to France, where he came under the notice 
of the king, Louis XI., who appointed him his state-astrol-oger.  
Thenceforth, for many years, the Italian acted in this onerous capacity, 
sometimes living within the precincts of the royal castle of Plessis-les-
Tours, sometimes at the town of Lyons ; and once, in 1478, while staying at 
the latter place, and being informed that Louis was approaching, he rode out 
to meet him, fell from his horse, and died shortly afterwards as a result of 
injuries sustained in the fall.
     An especial interest attaches to Galeotti in that lie appears in Sir 
Walter Scott's inimitable story of mediaeval France, Quentin Durward.  Early 
in the tale, soon after Quentin has entered the Scots Guard of Louis XI., 
the latter and his new guardsman are depicted as visiting the astrologer, 
the King being anxious for a prophecy regarding Quentin's immediate future.  
The scene is a very memorable and a     one, among the best in the whole 
book; and it is historically valuable, moreover, containing, as it does, 
what is probably a fairly accurate description of the kind of study used 
generally by an astrologer in the middle ages. Galeotti is represented,  
curiously examining a specimen, just issued from the Frankfurt Press, of the 
newly invented art of printing" ; and the King questions him about this 
novel process, whereupon the seer speaks of the vast changes it is destined 
to bring about throughout the whole world. Now, it was by no means 
thoughtlessly or carelessly, that Sir Walter introduced this passage, for, 
though the novelist himself does not refer to the matter in his notes, and 
though Andrew Lang says nothing thereon in those annotations which he 
furnished for the  “Border Waverley," it is a fact that Louis was keenly 
interested in printing; and, soon after the craft first made its appearance, 
the King com-missioned the director of his mint, one Nicholas Janson or 
Jenson, to give up his present post in favour of studying typography, with a 
view to its being carried on in France. 

Galigai, Leonora: Wife of the -Marechal d'Ancre Concino Concini, who was 
killed by the populace, in 1617.  She was believed to be a sorceress, and 
was said to have be-witched the Queen.  In her possession were found three 
volumes full of magic characters, besides charms and amulets.  At her trial, 
it was established that the Marechal and his wife had consulted magicians, 
astrologers, and sorcerers, and had made use of waxen images, and that they 
had brought sorcerers from Nancy to sacrifice cocks, besides working many 
other sorceries and deeds of dark-ness.  It is said that on. her own 
confession, she was con-demned, and was beheaded and burnt in 1617.  But 
when President Courtin asked her by what charm she had be-witched the Queen, 
she replied, proudly : My spell was the power of a strong mind over a weak 
one." 


Galitzin, Prince   (See St Martin),


Garatronicus :  A red-coloured stone, which Achilles is believed to have 
carried with him in battle.  It renders its possessor invincible.


Garden or Pomegranates : A tract reflecting the later spirit of Kabalism 
(q.v.).


Gardner, Dr, : (See Spirit-Photography),


Gargates  A black species of electrum or amber, now called jet.  To electrum 
are attributed many occult virtues of a tell-tale character, and according 
to Pliny, a cup of this substance had the property of discovering poison, by 
showing certain half-circles, like rainbows, in the liquor, which also 
sparkles and hisses as if on fire.


Garinet, Jules : Author of a History of Magic in France, Paris, 1818.  In 
this curious work will be found a description of the Sabbath, a dissertation 
on demons, a discourse on the superstitions connected with magic among the 
ancients and the moderns.


Garlic  A species of onion, cultivated throughout Europe, to which is 
attributed certain occult properties.  It is believed by the Greeks and the 
Turks that the use of this vegetable, or even the mention of its name, is a 
sure charm against the evil eye," and against vampires (q.v.). New-built 
houses and the sterns of boats belonging to Greece and Turkey, have long 
bunches of garlic hanging from them as a pre-ventive against the fatal envy 
of any ill-disposed person.


Garnet: Preserves the health and promotes joy, but in the case of lovers, 
discord.


Garnier, Gilles :  A werwolf, condemned at Dole, under Louis XIII., for 
having devoured a number of children. He was burned alive, and his body, 
after being reduced to ashes, was scattered to the winds.


Gassner   (See Hypnotism)


Gastromancy, or Divination from the Belly, is now generally explained by 
ventriloquism, the voice in both cases sound-ing low and hollow, as if 
issuing from the ground. Salverte enforces this opinion, and adds:   “The 
name of En-gastrimythes, given by the Greeks to the Pythiae (priestesses of 
Apollo) indicates that they made use of this artifice." The explanation is 
only partial, and the text of Isaiah: “Thy voice shall die as one that hath 
a familiar spirit," is inapplicable in such an argument. Those who are 
experienced in clairvoyance are aware that the voice is often reduced very 
low, in consequence of a change in the respiration. This was the case with 
some of the ancient Pythonesses, though instances may have occurred when 
ventriloquism was resorted to, as by the wizards of Green-land in our own 
time.
     Another method of practising the ancient gastromancy connects it with 
crystal-seeing, as vessels of glass, round, and full of clear water, were 
used, which were placed before several lighted candles.  In this case, a 
young boy or girl was generally the seer, and the demon was summoned in a 
low voice by the magician. Replies were then obtained from the magical 
appearances seen in the illuminated glass vessels.


Gaudlllon, Pierre: A sorcerer, who was burned in 1610, for going about at 
night in the form of a hare.

Gaufridi, Louis : A French ecclesiastic, burned as a sorcerer at Aix, in 
1611.  He was a cure at Marseilles, where his attractive person and manners 
gained for him a footing in high society, but for all his priestly garb, he 
led an evil life. A girl whom he had seduced was sent by her parents to a 
convent of Ursulines, and here Gaufridi followed her, mak-ing the credulous 
nuns believe that a legion of demons possessed the convent. At the instance 
of the exorcist, who relieved the "possessed" nuns Gaufridi was tried at 
Aix, and condemned to be burned alive.

Gauher-Abad : Meaning the Abode of Jewels. This was the name given to one of 
the capitals of the peris of Persian romance. These were beings of an 
angelic or well-disposed nature, who inhabited the earth, along with the 
divs or evil-disposed, before the creation of man.  After this event, the 
peris became inhabitants of the aerial regions, and had three capitals: 
Shad-u-kam (pleasure and desire), Gauher-abad, and Amber-abad (city of 
Ambergris).


Gauthier, Jean : An alchemist. Charles IX. of France, deceived by his 
promises, had him provided with a hundred and twenty thousand pounds, with 
which to make gold, and the adept set to work.  But after he had worked for 
a week, he ran away with the King's money.  He was pur-sued, captured, and 
hanged.


Gauthier of Bruges  It is related that a Franciscan monk, made a bishop by 
Pope Nicholas III., and deposed by Clement V., appealed to God against his 
deposition, and asked that he should be buried with his act of appeal in his 
hand.  Some time after his death, Pope Clement V., visited Poitiers, and, 
finding himself one day in a Franciscan monastery, asked to see the remains 
of him whom he had deposed.  He caused the tomb to be opened, and was 
horrified to see Gauthier of Bruges presenting his act of appeal, with a 
withered hand.


Gbalo: An order of priests among the Ga people of the Gold Coast, west of 
Togoland.


Geber, otherwise Abou Moussah Djafar al Sofi, was a native of Haman, in 
Mesopotamia, or, according to other accounts, a Spanish Moor, born at 
Savile, somewhere about the end of the eighth century, though all dates 
concerning him are extremely doubtful.  Practically nothing is known of his 
life.  He undertook wide experiments in metallurgy and chemistry, with the 
object of discovering the constituent elements of metals, in the course of 
which he stumbled upon nitric acid and red oxide of mercury.  It is, indeed, 
upon actual discoveries that his reputation is based, and not upon the many 
spurious treatises which have been attributed to him, and which embrace the 
entire gamut of the sciences. His alleged extant works, which are in Latin, 
cannot but be regarded with suspicion, especially as several mediaeval 
writers adopted his name.  It is believed, however, that the library at 
Leyden, and the Imperial Library at Paris, contain Arabic manuscripts, which 
might be referred to his authorship.  His Sum of Perfection, and his 
Investigation into the Perfection of Metals are his most important works, a 
complete edition of which was published at Dantzic, in 1682, and again in 
the Bibliotheca Chemica Curiosa, of Mangetus, published at Cologne, in 1702. 
The Sum of Perfection professes to draw its inspiration from alchemical 
authors, who lived previous to Geber, but as alchemy was then not very far 
advanced, the derivation is an un-likely one. We are told in its pages that 
success in the great art is only to be achieved by rigid adherence to 
natural law.  A spirit of great strength and a dry water are spoken of as 
the elements of the natural principle. The philosophical furnace and its 
arrangement is dealt with in detail, as is the philosopher's vessel, a vase 
of glass with several intricate details difficult of comprehension. There is 
no dubiety, however, regarding the absolutely physical basis of metallurgy, 
upon which the work is composed, and it contains no hint of allegory or the 
achievement of success through supernatural agency.


Gehenna (otherwise Hell) : The word is derived from the Hebrew ge and 
Hinnom, the Valley of Hinnom-originally a valley in Palestine where the Jews 
passed their children through the fire to Moloch, the god of the Ammonites. 
Gehenna is popularly regarded as a place of torment to which the wicked are 
consigned when they leave this earth: it is pictured as a bottomless pit, 
lit only by the fire which is never quenched.  In Dante and Milton, we have 
diverse descriptions of Hell-the one of unutterable anguish, horror and 
despair; the other more sublimely imaginative, and pierced with rays of 
faith and love.  The locality of Hell, and the duration of its torments, 
have for centuries been the subject of much questioning.  By some, it is 
believed, that there is a purgatorial region-a kind of upper Gehenna, "in 
which the souls of just men are cleansed by a tem-porary punishment" before 
they are admitted to Heaven. It was believed that during this period the 
soul could re-visit the places and persons whom it had loved. By the 
Persians, Geheisna was understood as the place inhabited by the divs, or 
rebellious angels, and to which they had been confined when they refused to 
bow down before the first man.  Gehenna is used in the New Testament for 
Hell, and is practically synonymous with the Greek " Hades."

Gematria  along with temurah, was the science of the dual interpretation of 
the Kabalistic alphabet, which composed the notary art, which is 
fundamentally the complete science of the tarot (q.v.) signs and their 
complex and varied appli-cation to the definition of all secrets.

Genealum Dierum: (See Avicenna.)


Genius : Is generally used as the name of a superior class of aerial beings, 
holding an intermediate rank between mortals and immortals.  That, at least, 
appears to be the signification of  Daemon," the corresponding term in 
Greek.  It is probable, that the whole system of  Demono-logy was invented 
by the Platonic philosophers, and engrafted by degrees on the popular 
mythology. The Platonists professed, however, to derive their doctrines from 
the  theology of the ancients," so that this system may have come originally 
from the East, where it formed a part of the tenets of Zoroaster. This sage 
ascribed all the operations of nature to the agency of celestial beings, the 
ministers of one supreme first cause, to whose most visible and brilliant 
image, Fire, homage was paid as his representative.  Some Roman writers 
speak of " the Genius" as " the God of Nature," or " Nature" itself but 
their notions seem to have been modified by, if not formed from, 
etymological considerations, more likely to mislead than to afford a certain 
clue to the real meaning of the term.  At a later period, they supposed 
almost every created thing, animate or inanimate, to be protected by its 
guardian genius, a sort of demi-god. who presided over its birth, and was 
its constant companion till its death.  Thus, Censorinus, who lived about 
the middle of the third cen-tury, wrote as follows: " The genius is a god 
supposed to be attendant on everyone from the time of his birth.
     Many think the genius to be the same as the lars of the ancients. We 
may well believe that its power over us is great, yea, absolute. Some 
ascribe two genii at least to those who live in the houses of married 
persons." Euclid, the Socratic philosopher, gives two to every one, a point 
on which Lucilius, in his " Satires," insists we can-not be informed. To the 
genius, therefore, so powerful through the whole course of one's life, they 
offered yearly sacrifices.  As the birth of every mortal was a peculiar 
object of his guardian genius's solicitude, the marriage bed was called the 
genial bed,  “lectus genialis"  the same invisible patron was supposed also 
to be the author of joy and hilarity, whence a joyous was called a genial 
life, “genialis vita."  There is a curious passage relating to the functions 
of the Greek demons in the Symposium of Plato, in which he says : (Speech of 
Socrates)   from it (i.e., the agency of genii) proceed all the arts of 
divination, and all the science of priests, with respect to sacrifices, 
initiations, incantations, and everything, in short, which relates to 
oracles and enchantments.  The deity holds no direct intercourse with man ; 
but, by this means, all the converse and communications between the gods and 
men, whether asleep or awake, take place ; and he who is wise in these 
things is a man peculiarly guided by his genius." We here see the origin of 
the connection between demono-logy and magic; an association perpetually 
occurring in the romances of the East, if the Jinns of the Mussulmans can be 
identified with the genii of the Platonists. (See also Jinn,)


Germany  For early German magic, see Teutons.
     Magic as formulated and believed in by the Germans in the Middle Ages, 
bears, along with traces of its unmis-takable derivation from the ancient 
Teutonic religion, the impress of the influence wrought by the natural 
character-istics of the country upon the mind of its inhabitants Deep 
forests, gloomy mountains,  limitless morasses, caverned rocks, mysterious 
springs, all these helped to shape the weird and terrible imagination which 
may be traced in Teutonic mythology, and later in the darker and more 
repulsive aspects of magic and witchcraft, which first arose in Germany, and 
there obtained ready credence.
     As the clash and strife of Teuton and Roman, of Christian and Heathen 
have left indelible records in folk-lore and history, so we may find them as 
surely in the magical belief of the Middle Ages.  The earlier monkish 
legends are replete with accounts of magic and sorcery, indicating plainly 
the process by which the ancient deities had become evil and degraded upon 
the introduction of the newer religion.  Miracles are recounted, where these 
evil ones are robbed of all power at the name of Christ, or before some 
blessed relic, then chained and prisoned beneath mountain, river and sea in 
eternal darkness, whilst it was told how misfortune and death were the 
unvarying rewards for those who still might follow the outcast gods.
     Again, the sites and periods of the great religious festivals of the 
Teutons are perpetuated in those said to be the place and time of the 
Witches' Sabbath and other myster-ious  meetings  and  conclaves,  Mountains  
especially retained this character-as the Venusberg, the Horselberg, and 
Blocksberg, now become the Devil's realm and abode of the damned.  Chapels 
and cathedrals were full of relics, whose chief virtue was to exorcise the 
spirits of evil, while the bells must be blessed, as ordained by the Council 
of Cologne, in order that "demons might be affrighted by their sound, 
calling Christians to prayers; and when they fled, the persons of the 
faithful would be secure; that the destruction of lightnings and whirlwinds 
would be averted, and the spirits of the storm defeated."
     Storms were always held to be the work of the Devil, or the conjuration 
of his followers.  In their fury might be heard the trampling of his 
infernal train above the tossing forests or holy spires, and here is seen 
the transformation Odin and his hosts had undergone. Another instance of 
this is found when the Valkyries, the Choosers of the Slain, riding to 
places of battle, have become the mediaeval witches riding astride broom-
sticks, on their missions of evil. Castles of flames, where the Devil holds 
wild revel ; con-claves of corpses revivified by evil knowledge; unearthly 
growths, vitalized by hanged men's souls, springing to life beneath gallows 
and gibbets ; little men of the hills, malicious spirits, with their caps of 
mist and cloaks of invisibility ; in these may be seen the meeting of the 
Heathen and Christian stories, and the origins of that terrible belief in 
magic, and its train of terror and death, which is one of the darkest 
mysteries of the Middle Ages.
     Witchcraft was at first derided as a delusion by men of sense and 
education, and belief in it was actually forbidden by some of the earlier 
councils,  It was in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries that it attained 
prominence, helped greatly thereto by the fact that magic, sorcery and 
witchcraft had now become a crime in the eyes of the Church -a crime 
punishable by confiscation and death.  It may be truly said that the Holy 
Fathers and Inquisitors first systematised and formulated Black Magic.  
Under such authority, belief in it flourished, filling the people with 
either an abject fear or unholy curiosity.
     The motives for laying the charge of sorcery and witch-craft at a 
person's door were, of course, many besides that of care for the soul ; for 
personal feuds, political enmities, religious differences and treasury needs 
found in this an unfailing and sure means of achieving their infamous ends. 
However this might be, the charges were hurled at high and low, and death 
thereby reaped a plentiful harvest.
     The famous Council of Constance began the years of terror with its 
proscription of the doctrines of Wyclif and the burniug of John Huss and 
Jerome of Prague. At this time, too, a work was published by one of the 
Inquisitors, called the Formicarium, a comprehensive list of the sins 
against religion and in the fifth volume an exhaustive ac-count was given of 
that of sorcery.  The list of crimes accomplished by witches is detailed, 
such as second sight, ability to read secrets and foretell events ; power to 
cause diseases, death by lightning and destructive storms ; to transform 
themselves into beasts and birds; to bring about illicit love, barrenness of 
living beings and crops their emnity against children and practice of 
devouring them.
     Papal bulls appeared for the appointment of Inquisitors, who must not 
be interfered with by the civil authorities, and the Emperor and reigning 
princes took such under their protection.  The persecutions rose to a 
ferocity unparal-lelled in other countries, till the following century, and 
hundreds were burned in the space of a few years.  Two Inquisitors of this 
time, Jacob Sprenger, and Henricus Institor, compiled the famous Malleus 
Maleficarum, a complete system of witchcraft, also a perfect method of 
proving the innocent capable and guilty of any and every crime.  Yet it was 
meant partly as an apology-a pointing out of the necessity for the 
extermination of such a horde of evil-doers.  At this time, too, appeared 
the bull of Pope Innocent VIII., another comprehensive method and process 
for trials and tortures.
     These persecutions were intermittent throughout the fifteenth and 
sixteenth centuries, breaking out again with renewed vigour in the 
seventeenth century.  It was stimu-lated in this by the increasing strife 
between Catholics and Protestants and the condition of the country, 
devasta-ted by wars, plague and famine, was an ever-ready and fruitful 
source of charges that might be brought against sorcery.  Two cities, 
Bamberg and Wurzburg attained an unenviable fame for sanguinary trials and 
number of victims.
     In the first-named city, Prince-Bishop George II., and his suffragan, 
Frederic Forner, prosecuted the holy in-quisition with such energy that 
between the years 1625 and 1630 nine hundred trials took place. six hundred 
people being burned. Confessions of whatever the holy fathers wished, were 
wrung from the victims under extreme and merciless torture.  Rich and poor, 
learned and ignorant, were gathered into the toils, the number often being 
so great that names were never taken and written down, the prisoners being 
cited as No. 1, 2, 3, and so on.
     At Wurzburg, Lutheranism was gaining ground, and here again the charge 
of sorcery was brought against its followers.  The bishop, Philip Adolph, 
who came to the see in 1623, did not dare to openly prosecute them, so took 
this means of punishing those unfaithful to the Church. In Hauber's 
Bibliotheca Magica may be found a list of twenty-nine burnings, covering a 
short period prior to 1629.  Each burning consisted of several victims, the 
numbers ranging from two up to ten or more.  It is a strange procession we 
see here, winding their way to death through the flames and bitter smoke, a 
procession pathetic and terrible.  Old men and Women, little girls and boys 
and infants, all emissaries of the Evil One ; noble ladies and washerwomen ; 
vicars, canons, singers and minstrels; Bannach, a senator, “the fattest 
citizen in Wurzburg
a very rich man, a keeper. of the pot-house, the bishop's own nephew and 
page,  the most beautiful girl in Wurz-burg," a huckster, a blind girl, 
living beings beside the decapitated dead-the procession is endless as the 
conditions were various.
     Strangely, it was at Wurzburg, in 1749, that the last trial for 
witchcraft took place, that of Malia Renata, of the Convent of Unterzell.  
She was condemned on all the old charges, of consorting with the Devil, 
bewitchments and other infernal practices, and burned there in the month of 
June, the last victim of cruel superstition.
     Towards the end of the seventeenth century, disbelief in the troth of 
witchcraft and criticism of the wholesale burnings began to be heard, though 
earlier than this, souse had dared to lift their voices against the 
injustice and ignorance of it all. Cornelius Saos, a priest in Mainz, had, 
before 1593, stated his doubt of the whole proceedings, but suffered for his 
temerity.  Johannes Wier, physician to the Duke of Cleves, Thomas Erast, 
another physician, Adam Tanner, a Bavarian Jesuit, and last, but not least, 
Frederick Spree, also a Jesuit, who, more than all helped to end the reign 
of terror and superstition.
     Alchemy, the forerunner of modern chemistry, belonged in those days to 
the realm of magic, and was therefore Satanic in its derivation, and its 
follower' liable to the charge of sorcery and the penalty of death.  In this 
fratern-ity we find emperors and princes, often devoted to the study 
themselves, or taking into their service well-known practisers of the art, 
as when Joachim I. had Johannes Trithemius as teacher of astrology and  
“defender of magic,”  and the Emperor Rudolph employing Michael Maier as his 
physician.
     Germany supplies a long roll of names famous for their discoveries made 
in the name of magic, men who by their search for knowledge and truth laid 
themselves open to much terrible Suspicion.  Here we find Paracelsus,-that 
inexplicable figure who in his search for the Elixir of Life discovered 
laudanum, perhaps in some magical distillation of black poppies at midnight 
hour ; the great Cornelius Agrippa;  Basil Valentine, prior and chemist;  
Henry
Kuhnrath, physician and philosopher, and a train of stu-dents, all 
tirelessly searching for the elusive mysteries of life, the innermost 
secrets of nature.
     These men were awesome figures to the ignorant mind. Popular 
imagination was ever busy weaving strange tales about their doings, such as 
infernal dealings and pacts with the Devil.  Such knowledge as thc 
alchemists gained could only be acquired by infernal means, and the soul of 
the magician was often the price promised and inexorably demanded by the 
Evil One. These myths and imaginings centred themselves about one magician 
especially, and in the Faust legend we may find embalmed the general 
attitude and belief of the Middle Ages towards learning and any attempt to 
extend the realm of knowledge.
     The Alchemists were also mystics as their writings abun-dantly testify, 
but most notable of all in this department of occultism was Jacob Bohme, the 
son of peasants, the inspired shoemaker.
     During the Thirty Years’ War many wild preachers, seers and fanatics 
appeared, exhorting and prophesying. No doubt the condition of the country 
contributed towards producing these states of hallucination and hysteria, 
and in contrast to the terror, misfortune and sorrow on all sides we have 
accounts of ecstatics absorbed in supernatural visions.  Anna Fleischer of 
Freiburg was such an one, as was Christiana Poniatowitzsch, who journeying 
throughout Bohemia and Gcruiavy related her visions and prophesied.
     At the end of the seventeenth century the old tenets of magic were 
undergoing a gradual change.  Alchemy began to separate itself from them, 
and became merged in the science of chemistry. The residue of the magical 
beliefs formed their protagonists in members of all kinds of secret 
Societies, many of which were founded on those of the Middle Ages.  
Freemasonry-whose beginnings are at-tributed by some to a certain guild of 
masons banded to-gether for the building of Strasburg Cathedral, but by 
other authorities to Rosicrucianism - formed the basis and pattern for many 
other secret societies.
     In the eighteenth century these flourished exceedingly. Occultism 
became rampant  We hear of Frederick William working with Steinert in a 
house specially built for evocations; of Schroepfer proprietor of a cafe 
with his magic punch and circles for raising the  spirits of the dead; of 
Lavater with two spirits at his command; of the Mopses, a society whose 
rites initiation were those of the Tem-plars and Witches' Sabbath in a mild 
and civilized form; and of Carl Sand,  the mystical fanatic who killed 
Kotzebue..
     The Illuminati, whose teachings, spreading to France, did so much 
towards bringing about the many violent changes there, were banded together 
as a society by Adam Weishaupt and fostered by Baron von Knigge, a student 
of occultism. The object of this society is said to have originally been 
that of circumventing the Jesuits, but in its development it absorbed 
mysticism and supernaturalism. finally becoming political and revolutionary 
as it applied its philosophies to Civil and religious life. Though it was 
disbanded and broken up in 1784 its influence was 
incal-culable and widespread in its effects for long afterwards.
     Many other names occur, coming under the category of mysticism: Jung 
Stilling, seer, prophet and healer; Anton Mesmer, the discoverer and apostle 
of animal magnetism the Marquis de Puysegur, magnetist and spiritualist; 
Madame von Krudener, preacher of peace and clemency to monarchs and princes; 
Zschokke the mystical seer, and Dr. Justinus Kerner, believer in magnetism 
and historian of those two famous cases of possession and mediumship, the  
Maid of Orlach " and the ' Seeress of Prevorst."
     Early in the nineteenth century occurred the remarkable cures said to 
be affected by Prince Hohenlohe, a dignitary of the Church.  He was led to 
believe in the power of heal-ing through the influence of a peasant named 
Martin Michel. Most of these cures took place at Wurzburg, the scenes of 
former sanguinary witch-burnings, and it is said that up-wards of four 
hundred people, deaf, dumb, blind and para-lytic were cured by the power of 
fervent prayer.
     About this time also occurred the famous case of  stig-mata " in the 
person of the ecstatic, Katherine Emerick, the nun of Dulmen. The remarkable 
features were the appearance of a bloody cross encircling the head  marks of 
wounds in hands, feet and side, and crosses on the breast, with frequent 
bleedings therefrom.  This persisted for many years and the case is 
mentioned by several notable men of the time.
     In nineteenth century Occultism we find, as in the earlier periods, 
stories of hauntings and doings of mischievous sprites existing beside 
learned disquisitions by educated men; as that on the  fourth “dimension in 
space" by Zollner in his Transcendental Physics, and another on the luminous 
emanations from material objects in Baron von Reichenbach's treatise on the 
Od or Odylic Force; thus betraying an unmistakeable likeness to its 
precursor, the magic of the Middle Ages.
     Spiritualism. The movement of modern spiritualism. which left such a 
deep impress on America, France and England, affected Germany in a much less 
degree.  But it would be indeed surprising if the country which gave so 
great attention to magnetism, wherein somnambules and clairvoyants were so 
plentiful, the country of seers and mystics, did not interest itself in the 
wide-spread phenom-ena of spiritualism.  And investigators there were in 
Ger-many, though we have no record of any in the period im-mediately 
following the Rochester Rappings.  Fichte declared for the facts of 
spiritualism.  Hartmann, also, the author of the Philosophy' of the 
Unconscious, desired to give the phenomena a definite place in philosophy.  
Carl du Prel, in his Philosophy of Mysticism, points to spiritu-alistic 
manifestations as evidence of a subconscious region in the human mind.  Du 
Prel also founded a monthly magazine, The Sphinx, devoted to the interests 
of spiritu-alism, and Aksakoff, the well-known Russian spiritualist, 
published the results of his researches in Germany, and in the German 
language, because he was not permitted to publish them in Russian.  Another 
philosophic exponent of the spiritualistic doctrine was Baron Hellenbach, 
who founded on its tenets a distinct hypothesis of his own-namely, that no 
change of world, or ' sphere," occurs at birth or death, but merely a change 
in the mode of percep-tion.  So much for the philosophical attitude towards 
the phenomena. The popular view-point was doubtless more influenced by the 
performances of the mediums who from time to time found their way to 
Germany.  The most im-portant of these was Henry Snide, who sought refuge in 
that country from his English persecutors.  His remarkable manifestations in 
Germany, under the observation of Zollner the astronomer, left nothing to be 
desired from a spiritu-alistic point of view.

Gerson, Jean Charlier de : The learned and pious chancellor of the 
University of Paris, who died in 1429.  He was the author of the Examination 
of Spirits, which contained rules for distinguishing true revelations from 
false ; and of Astrology Reformed, which had a great success.

Gert, Berthomine de : A sorceress of the town of Prechac in Gascogny, who 
confessed about the year 1608 that when a sorceress returning from the 
Sabbath was killed on the way, the devil was in the habit of taking her 
shape and making her reappear and die in her own dwelling so as to preserve 
her good reputation.  But if he who had killed her had a wax candle about 
him, and made with it the sign of the cross on the body of the witch, the 
devil could not with all his strength remove her, and so was forced to leave 
her there.


Gervals : Archbishop of Rheims, died in 1067.  His death was revealed to a 
Norman knight, returning from a pil-grimage to Rome, by a hermit whom he met 
on the way, and who told him that on the previous night he had been 
disturbed by a vision of demons making a great noise. They had, they said, 
been carrying the body of Gervais from Rheims, but because of his good deeds 
he had been taken from them.  On his return to Rheims the knight found that 
Gerveis was dead, and that the time of his death corresponded exactly with 
the time of the hermit's vision.


Ghor-Boud-Des, The : The people of  “Ghor-bund-land." Mr. Pococke in his 
India in Greece maintains that these people are the same as the 
“Corybantes," or ministers of the gods, otherwise known as the Cabiri.


Ghost Seers : Sir William Hamiliton has observed, " however astonishing, it 
is now proved, beyond all rational doubt, that in certain abnormal states of 
the nervous organism, perceptions arc possible through other than the 
ordinary channels of the senses."  But, without entering into this 
metaphysical question, folk-lore holds that persons born at a particular 
time of the day have the power of seeing ghosts.   Thus it is said in 
Lancashire," says Mr. Thisel-ton Dyer,  “that children born during twilight 
are supposed to have this peculiarity, and to know who of their acquain-
tance will next die.  Some say that this property belongs also to those who 
happen to be born exactly at twelve o'clock at night, or, as the peasantry 
say in Somersetshire, a child born in chime-hours will have the power to see 
spirits."  The same belief prevails in Yorkshire, where it is commonly 
supposed that children born during the hour after midnight have the 
privilege through life of seeing the spirits of the departed.  Mr. Henderson 
says that "a Yorkshire lady informed him she was very near being thus 
distinguished, but the clock had not struck twelve when she was born.  When 
a child she mentioned this circum-stance to an old servant, adding that 
Mamma was sure her birthday was the 23rd, not the 24th, for she had in-
quired at the time.'  ' Ay, Ay,' said the old woman, turn-ing to the child's 
nurse,  mistress would be very anxious about that, for bairns born after 
mid-night see more things than other folk.'
    This superstition prevails on the Continent, and, in Denmark, Sunday 
children have prerogatives far from enviable.  Thorpe, tells how  in Fyer 
there was a woman who was born on a Sunday, and, like other Sunday children 
had the faculty of seeing much that was hidden from others. But, because of 
this property, she could not pass by a church at night without seeing a 
hearse or a spectre.  The gift became a perfect burden to her; she therefore 
sought the advice of a man skilled in such matters, who directed her, 
whenever she saw a spectre to say, ' Go to Heaven! but when she met a 
hearse, ' Hang on ! " Happening some-time after to meet a hearse, she, 
through lapse of memory cried out, ' Go to Heaven l " and straightway the 
hearse rose in the air and vanished.  Afterwards, meeting a spectre she said 
to it,  Hang on! " when the spectre clung round her neck, hung on her back, 
and drove her down into the earth before it.  For three days her shrieks 
were heard before the spectre would put an end to her wretched life."
     It is a popular article of faith in Scotland that those who are born on 
Christmas Day or Good Friday have the power of seeing spirits, and even of 
commanding them, a super-stition to which Sir Walter Scott alludes in his 
Marmion (stanza 22).  The Spaniards imputed the haggard and downcast looks 
of their Philip II. to the disagreeable visions to which this privilege 
subjected him.
     Among uncultured tribes it is supposed that spirits are visible to some 
persons and not to others.  The “natives" of the Antilles believed that the 
dead appeared on the road when one went alone, but not when they went 
together; among the Finns the ghosts of the dead were to be seen by the 
Shamans, and not by men generally, unless in dreams. It is, too, a popular 
theory with savage races that the soul appears in dreams to visit the 
sleeper, and hence it has been customary for rude tribes to drink various 
intoxicating substances, under the impression that when thrown into the 
state of ecstasy they would have pleasing visions.  On this account certain 
tribes on the Amazon use certain nar-cotic plants, producing an intoxication 
lasting twenty-four hours.  During this period they are said to be subject 
to extraordinary visions, in the course of which they acquire information on 
any subject they may specially require. For a similar reason the inhabitants 
of North Brazil, when anxious to discover some guilty person, were in the 
habit of administering narcotic drinks to seers, in whose dreams the 
criminal made his appearance.  The Californian In-dians would give children 
certain intoxicants in order to gain from the ensuing vision information 
about their ene-mies.  And the Darien Indians used the seeds of the Datura 
sanguines to produce in children prophetic delirium, during which they 
revealed the whereabouts of hidden treasures.


Gilles de Laval  Lord of Raiz, and Marshal of France, the Blue Beard" of our 
nursery legends. and a famous sorcerer, was born about the year 1420, of one 
of the most famous families of Brittany.  His father died when he was in his 
twentieth year, and the impetuous lad found himself possessed of unlimited 
power and wealth.  By birth, he was connected with the Roceys, the Craons, 
and the Mont-morencys. Through his father's decease he became the lord of 
fifteen princely domains, yielding a revenue of three hundred thousand 
livres.  He was handsome, lithe, well-limbed, but distinguished by the 
appendage of a beard of bluish black.  His address was fascinating, his 
erudition extensive, his courage unimpeachable. Every thing seemed to 
promise a splendid and illustrious career, instead of that dark and 
miserable history which has associated the name of Blue Beard with so many 
traditions of horror and legends of atrocious crimes.
     At the outset he did nothing to justify an evil augury. He served with 
zeal and gallantry in the wars of Charles VI. against the English, and had 
fought under Joan of Arc in the ever memorable Siege of Orleans.  His 
exploits pro-cured him from a grateful king the reward of the high dignity 
of Marshal of France.  From this point his career tended downwards.  He 
retired to his Castle of Champtoce and indulged in the display of the most 
luxurious state. Two hundred horsemen accompanied him on his travels, and 
his train, when he went hunting, exceeded in magni-ficence that of the King 
himself.  His retainers wore the most sumptuous dresses; his horses were 
caparisoned with the richest trappings ; his castle gates were thrown open 
day and night to all comers, for whom an ox was daily roasted whole, and 
sheep, and pigs, and poultry, wine, mead, and hippocras provided in 
sufficient quantities for five hundred persons.  He carried the same love of 
pomp into his devotion.  His principal chaplain, whom he called a bishop, a 
dean, a chanter, two arch-deacons, four vicars, a schoolmaster, twelve 
assistant chaplains, and eight chori-sters, composed his ecclesiastical 
establishment.  Each of these had his horse and his servant; all were 
dressed in robes of scarlet and furs, and had costly appointments. Sacred 
vessels, crucifixes, all of gold and silver, were trans-ported with them 
wherever their lord went, together with many organs, each carried by six 
men.  He was exceed-ingly desirous that all the priests of his chapel should 
be entitled to wear the mitre, and he sent many embassies to Rome to obtain 
this privilege, but without success.  He maintained a choir of twenty-five 
young children of both sexes, and these he caused to be instructed in 
singing by the best masters of the day.  He had also his comedians, his 
morris-dancers, and his jugglers, and every hour was crowned with Some 
sensual gratification or voluptuous pleasure.
     In 1443, this magnificent young seigneur wedded Cath-erine, the heiress 
of the noble House of Thouars, an event which afforded him fresh occasions 
of displaying his insane passion for luxurious pomp.  He gave the most 
splendid banquets ; he figured in the most chivalric tournaments. His 
guests, who came from all parts to share in the revels of Champtoce', knew 
not which to admire the most, his skill in all knightly exercises, or his 
profound erudition.
He had espoused a young woman of high birth," says Eliphas Levi,  and kept 
her practically shut up in his castle at Machecoul. which had a tower with 
the entrance walled up."  A report was spread by the Marshal that it was in 
a ruinous state, and no one sought to penetrate therein. This, 
notwithstanding, Madame de Raiz, who was frequently alone during the dark 
hours, saw red lights moving to and fro in this tower; but she did not 
venture to question her husband, whose bizarre and sombre char-acter filled 
her with extreme terror.
     The legal state maintained by the Lord of Retz was ordered on so 
extensive a scale that it even exhausted his apparently inexhaustible 
revenues, and to procure the funds for his pleasures and his extravagance, 
he was com-pelled to sell several of his baronies. Then the Marshal 
attempted to dispose of his seignory of Ingrande. But his heirs-at-law, 
indisposed to see their valuable inheri-tance gradually pared away into 
nothing, solicited the interference of the King, and a royal edict 
prohibited him from selling his paternal estates.  In this predicament, most 
men would have curtailed their profusion, and en-deavoured to economize 
their income, but Gilles de Retz was unable to live in diminished splendour. 
The luxuries that surrounded him were all that for him made life. To have 
shorn him of his magnificence would have been to strike a death-blow at his 
heart. Money, therefore, became the principal object of his desires, and to 
obtain money it seemed to his excited imagination only necessary that he 
should turn alchemist.
     He sent accordingly into Italy, Spain, and Germany, and invited the 
adopts in the great science to repair from every land to the splendours of 
Champtoce. Amongst those who obtained the summonses, and continued attached 
to him during the remainder of his career, were Prelati, an alchemist of 
Padua, and a physician of Poitou, whose name is not given.  At their 
instigation he built a stately laboratory, and joined by other adepts, 
eagerly began the search for the Philosophers' Stone.  For a twelve month 
the furnaces blazed away right merrily, and a thousand chemical combinations 
disposed of the Marshal's gold and silver. Meanwhile, the alchemists feasted 
on the most luxurious viands, and quaffed the rarest wines; and so admirable 
were their quarters that, as far as they were concerned, they would have 
prosecuted the quest of the elixir vitae, or the Philosophers' Stone, until 
death cut short their labours.
     The impetuosity of the Lord of Retz could not abide such lingering 
processes.  He wanted wealth, and he wanted it immediately.  If the grand 
secret could not be discovered by any quicker method, he would have none of 
it, nor, indeed, as his resources were fast melting away, would it avail him 
much if the search occupied several years. At this junction the Poitousan 
physician and the Paduan alchemist whispered to him of quicker and bolder 
methods of attaining the desired alkehest. if he had the courage to adopt 
them.  Gilles de Retz immediately dismissed the inferior adepts. and put 
himself in the hands of the two abler and subtler masters. These persuaded 
him that the Evil One could at once reveal to them the secret, and offered 
to Summons him 
ex tenebris, for the Marshal to conclude with him whatever arrangement he 
thought best. As long as he saved his soul, the Lord of Retz professed 
himself willing to do anything the devil might command.
     In this frame of mind he went to the physician at mid-night to a 
solitary recess in the neighbouring wood, where the physician drew the magic 
circle and made the custom-ary conjurations.  Gilles listened to the 
invocation with wonder, and expectant that every moment the Spirit of 
Darkness would burst upon the startled silence.  After a lapse of thirty 
minutes, the physician manifested signs of the greatest alarm; his hair 
seemed to stand on end, his eyes glared with unutterable horror; he talked 
wildly, his knees shook, a deadly pallor overspread his countenance, and he 
sank to the ground.  Gilles was a man of dauntless bravery, and gazed upon 
the strange scene unmoved. After awhile the physician pretended to recover 
conscious-ness.  He arose, and turning to his master, inquired if he had not 
remarked the wrathful countenance of the devil.  De Retz replied that he had 
seen no devil. Where-upon the physician declared he had appeared in the 
fashion of a wild leopard, and had growled at him horribly. "You
he said to his lord, "would have been the same, and hoard the same, but for 
your want of faith.  You could not determine to give yourself up wholly to 
his service, and therefore he thrust a mist before your eyes.”  De Retz 
acknowledged that his resolution had somewhat faltered, but that now his 
choice was made, if indeed the Evil One could be coerced into speaking, and 
revealing the secret of the universal alkahest. The physician said that 
there grew certain herbs in Spain and Africa which possessed the necessary 
power, and offered to go in search of them him-self if the Lord of Laval 
would supply the funds.  As no one else would be able to detect the herbs so 
miraculously gifted, De Retz thanked the physician for his voluntary self-
denial, and loaded him with all the gold he could spare. The physician then 
took leave of his credulous patron, who never saw him again.
     De Retz, as soon as the physician had quitted Champtoce, was once more 
seized with the fever of unrest.  His days and nights were consumed in 
ceaseless visions of gold; gold, without which he must abandon his gilded 
pomp and unholy pleasures; gold, without which he could not hope to bravo 
his enemies or procure exemption from the just punishment of his crimes.  He 
now turned for help to the alchemist Prelati, who agreed to undertake the 
enterprise.  De Retz furnished him with the charms and talismans necessary 
in so troublesome a work.  He was to sign with his blood a contract that he 
would obey the devil in all things, and to offer up a sacrifice of the 
hands, eyes, blood, heart and lungs of a young child.  The madman having 
willingly consented to those terms, Prelati went out alone on the following 
night, and after an absence of three hours, returned to his impatient lord.  
His tale was a monstrously extravagant one, but Do Retz swallowed it 
greedily.  The devil had appeared in the shape of a comely young man of 
twenty, who desired to be called Barron, and had pointed out to him a store 
of ingots of pure gold, buried under an oak in the neighbouring wood, which 
was to become the property of the Lord of Laval if he fulfilled the 
conditions of his Contract.  But this bright prospect was  over-clouded by 
the devil's injunction that the gold was not to be searched for until a 
period of seven times seven weeks had elapsed, or it would turn to slates 
and dust. Do Retz was by no means willing to wait so many months for the 
realisation of his wishes, and desired Prelati to intimate to the devil that 
he should decline any further correspondence with him if matters could not 
be expedited.  Prelati persuaded him to wait for seven times seven days, and 
then, the two repaired with pick-axe and shovel to dig up the treasure. 
After Some hard work they lighted upon a load of slates inscribed with 
hieroglyphical characters. Prelati broke out into a fit of rage, and 
culuminated the Evil One as a liar, a knave, a rogue-De Retz heartily 
joining in his fierce denunciations.  He persuaded his master, however, to 
give the devil a further trial, and led him on from day to day with dark 
oracular hints and pretended demoniac intimations, until he had obtained 
nearly all the valuables remaining to his unhappy dupe.  He was then 
preparing to escape with his plunder, when a catastrophe occurred, which 
involved him in his lord's ruin.
     On Easter Day, in the year 1440, having communicated solemnly in his 
chapel, and bade farewell to the lady of Machecoul, telling her that he was 
departing to the Holy Land, the poor creature was even then afraid to 
question, so much did she tremble at his presence; she was also Several 
months in her pregnancy. The Marshal permitted her sister to come on a visit 
as a companion during his absence. Madame de Raiz took advantage of this 
indul-gence, after which Gilles de Laval mounted his horse, and departed. To 
her Sister, Madame de Raiz communicated her fears and anxieties. What went 
on in the castle ? Why was her lord so gloomy ? What signified his repeated 
absences ? What became of the children who disappeared day by day ? What 
were those nocturnal lights in the walled up tower ? These and the other 
problems excited the curiosity of both women to the utmost degree. What, all 
the Same, could be done ? The Marshal had forbidden them expressly even to 
approach the tower, and before leaving he had expressed this injunction. It 
must assuredly have a secret entrance, for which Madame do Raiz and her 
sister Anne proceeded to search through the lower rooms of the castle, 
corner by corner, stone after stone.  At last, in the chapel, behind the 
altar, they came upon a copper button, hidden in a mass of sculpture.  It 
yielded under pressure, a stone slid back, and the two curiosity-seekers, 
now all in a tremble, distinguished the lowermost steps of a staircase, 
which led them to the condemned tower.
     At the top of the first flight there was a kind of chapel, with a cross 
upside down and black candles; on the altar stood a hideous figure, no doubt 
representing the demon. On the second floor, they came upon furnaces, 
retorts, alembics, charcoal-in a word, all the apparatus of alchemy. The 
third flight led to a dark chamber where the heavy and fetid atmosphere 
compelled the young women to retreat. Madame do Raiz came into collision 
with a vase, which fell over, and she was conscious that her robe and foot 
were soaked by some thick and unknown liquid.  On returning to the light at 
the head of the Stairs, she found that she was bathed in blood.
     Sister Anne would have fled from the place, but in Madame do Raiz 
curiosity was even stronger than disgust or fear.  She descended the stairs, 
took a lamp from the infernal chapel and returned to the third floor, where 
a frightful spectacle awaited her. Copper vessels filled with blood were 
ranged the whole length of the walls, bearing labels with a date on each, 
and in the middle of the room there was a black marble table, on which lay 
the body of a child, murdered quite recently.  It was one of those basins 
which had fallen, and black blood had spread far and wide over the grimy and 
worm-eaten wooden floor. The two women were now half-dead with terror. 
Madame de Raiz endeavoured at all costs to efface the evidence of her 
indiscretion.  She went in search of a sponge and water, to wash the boards, 
but she only extended the stain, and that which at first seemed black, 
became all scarlet in hue. Suddenly a loud commotion echoed through the 
castle, mixed with the cries of people calling to Madame de Raiz.
She distinguished the awe-stricken words :	" Here is Monseigneur come 
back."  The two women made for the staircase, but at the same moment they 
were aware of the trampling of steps and the sound of other voices in the 
devil's chapel.  Sister Anne fled upwards to the battlement of the tower  
Madame de Raiz went down trembling, and found herself face to face with her 
husband, in the act of ascending, accompanied  by the apostate priest and 
Prelati.
     Gilles de Laval seized his wife by the arm, and without speaking, 
dragged her into the infernal chapel.  It was then that Prelati observed to 
the Marshal : ' It is needs must, as you see, and the victim has come of her 
own accord...."" Be it so," answered his master. " Begin the Black Mass”        
The apostate priest went to the altar, while Gilles de Level opened a little 
cupboard fixed therein, and drew out a large knife, after which he sat down 
close to his spouse, who was now almost in a swoon, and lying in a heap on a 
bench against the wall.  The sacrilegious ceremonies began.  It must be 
explained that the Marshal, so far from taking the road to Jerusalem had 
proceeded only to Nantes, where Prelati lived ; he attacked this miserable 
wretch with the uttermost fury and threatened to slay him if he did not 
furnish the means of extracting from the devil that which he had been 
demanding for so long a time.  With the object of obtaining delay Prelati 
declared that terrible conditions were required by the infernal master, 
first among which would be the sacrifice of the Marshal's unborn child, 
after tearing it forcibly from the mother's womb.  Gilles de Laval made no 
reply, but returned at once to Machecoul, the Florentine sorcerer and his 
accomplice, the priest, being in his train.  With the rest we are 
acquainted.
     Meanwhile, Sister Anne, left to her own devices on the roof of the 
tower, and not daring to come down, had re-moved her veil, to make signs of 
distress at chance.  They were answered by two cavaliers, accompanied by a 
posse of armed men, who were riding towards the castle  they proved to be 
her two brothers, who, on learning the spurious departure of the Marshal for 
Palestine, had come to visit and console Madame de Raiz.  Soon after they 
arrived with a clatter in the court of the castle, whereupon Gilles de Level 
suspended the hideous ceremony, and said to his wife : " 'Madame, I forgive 
you, and the matter is at an end between us if you do now as I tell you.  
Return to your apartment, change your garments, and join me in the guest-
room, whither I am going to receive your brothers, But if you say one word, 
or cause them the slightest sus-picion, I will bring you hither on their 
departure; we shall proceed with the Black Mass at the point where it is now 
broken off, and at the consecration you will die.  Mark where I place this 
knife.
     He rose up and led his wife to the door of her chamber, and 
subsequently received her relations and their Suite, saying that this lady 
was preparing herself to come and salute her brothers. Madame de Raiz 
appeared almost immediately, pale as a spectre.  Gilles de Level never took 
eyes off her, seeking to control her by his glance.  When her brother 
suggested that she was ill, she answered that it was the fatigue of 
pregnancy, but added in an undertone:
Save me, he seeks to kill me."  At the same moment, Sister Anne rushed into 
the hall, crying:  Take us away; save us, my brothers, this man is an 
assassin," and she pointed to Gilles de Level. While the Marshal summoned 
his people, the escort of the two visitors surrounded the women with drawn 
swords, and the Marshal's people disarmed instead of obeying him. Madame de 
Raiz, with her sister and brothers, gained the drawbridge, and left the 
castle.
     Terrible rumours were now bruited through all the country-side.  It was 
noticed that many young girls and boys had disappeared.  Some had been 
traced to the Castle of Champtoce, and not beyond.  The public voice accused 
him of murder; and of crimes even worse than murder-of lust in its foulest 
and most disgusting shapes. It was true that no one dared openly accuse a 
baron so powerful as the Lord of Retz.  It was true that whenever the 
circumstances of the disappearance of so many children were alluded to in 
his presence, he always manifested the greatest astonishment.  But the 
suspicions of the people once aroused are not easily allayed ; and the 
Castle of Champtoce and its lord soon acquired a fearful reputation, and 
were surrounded with an appalling mystery.
     The continued disappearance of young boys and girls had caused so 
bitter a feeling in the neighbourhood that the Church had felt constrained 
to intervene, and on the earnest representations of the Bishop of Nantes, 
the Duke of Brittany ordered De Retz and his accomplice to be ar-rested. 
Their trial took place before a commission com-posed of the Bishop of 
Nantes, Chancellor of Brittany, the Vicar of the Inquisition, and Pierre 
l'Hopital, the President of the Provincial Parliament.  De Retz was accused 
of sorcery, sodomy, and murder.  At first he displayed the most consummate 
coolness, denounced his judges as worthless and impure, and declared that 
rather than plead before such shameless knaves he would be hung like a dog, 
without trial.  But the overwhelming evidence brought against him-the 
terrible revelations made by Prelati and his servants of his abandoned lust, 
of his sacrifices of young children for the supposed gratifi-cation of the 
devil, and the ferocious pleasure with which he gloated over the throbbing 
limbs and glazing eyes of those who were equally the victims of his 
sensuality and his cruelty-this horrible tale, as it unfolded day by day the 
black record of his enormities, shook even his imper-turable courage, and he 
confessed everything. The blood-stained chronicle showed that nearly one 
hundred children had fallen victims to this madman and his insane greed of 
the Philosophers' Stone.  Both De Retz and Prelati were doomed to be burned 
alive, but in consideration of his rank the punishment of the Marshal was 
somewhat mitigated. He was strangled before he was given over to the flames. 
On the scaffold, he exclaimed to Peralti, with a hideous assumption of 
religious confidence :  " Farewell, friend Francis.  In this world we shall 
never meet again, but let us rest our hopes in God-we shall see each other 
in Para-dise."  The sentence was executed at Nantes, on the 23rd of 
February, 1440.  " Notwithstanding his many and atrocious cruelties," says 
the old chronicler, Monstrelet, "he made a very devout end, full of 
penitence, most humbly imploring his Creator to have mercy on his manifold 
sins and wickedness.  When his body was partly burned, some ladles and 
damsels of his family requested his remains of the Duke of Brittany, that 
they might be interred in holy ground, which was granted.  The greater part 
of the nobles of Brittany, more especially those of his kindred, were hi the 
utmost grief and confusion at his shameful death."
     The Castle of Champtoce still stands in its beautiful valley, and many 
a romantic legend flowers about its gray old walls.  “The hideous, half-
burnt body of the monster himself," says Trollope, " circled in flames, 
pale, indeed, and faint in colour, but more lasting than those the hang-man 
kindled around his mortal form in the meadow under the walls of Nantes - is 
seen on bright moonlight nights, standing now on one topmost point of craggy 
wall, now on another, and is heard mingling his moan with the sough of the 
night-wind.  Pale, bloodless forms, too, of youthful growth and mien, the 
restless, unsepulchred ghosts of the unfortunates who perished in these 
dungeons unassoiled, may at similar times be seen flitting backwards and 
for-wards in numerous groups across the space enclosed by the ruined walls, 
with more than mortal speed, or glancing hurriedly from window to window of 
the fabric, as still seeking to escape from its hateful confinement."

Glamourie : The state of mind in which witches beheld ap-paritions and 
visions of many kinds.  Of the same nature as phantasy.


Glanyil, Joseph : (1636-1680) An English philosopher who wrote several works 
dealing with occult affairs, was born at Plymouth, and became a Church of 
England clergyman with charges at Frome Selwood and Streat and Walton. In 
1666 he was appointed to the Abbey Church, Bath, was made a prebendary of 
Worcester Cathedral, and was chap-lain in ordinary to Charles II. from 1672.  
In his scepsis Scientifica (1665) his Sorcerers and Sorcery (1666) and his 
S.adducismus Triumphatus (printed 1681) he undertook the defence of the 
belief in the supernatural, and supplied many illustrations in support of 
his theory.


Glas Ghairm : A rhyme or spell of Scottish origin, by the use of which one 
could keep a dog from barking, and open a lock, and supposed to be of 
special value to young men in their courtship days. About twenty years ago a 
well-known character in Skye, named Archibald the Light-headed, was believed 
to know this incantation; hut he repeated it so quickly that no one could 
understand what he said. This poor man was insane; but the fear which dogs 
had of him was ascribed to his knowledge of the Glas Ghairm. It was believed 
that this rhyme had some reference to the safety of the Children of Israel 
on the night before the Exodus: "against any of the children of Israel shall 
not a dog move his tongue, against man or beast."


Glauber, Johann Rudolph : German mediciner and alchemist, born at Carlstadt, 
in 1603. No authentic records concern-ing his life appear to exist, although 
he was a profuse writer and left many treatises on medicine and alchemy. He 
discovered and prepared many medicines of great value to pharmacy, some of 
which are in common use, for example the familiar preparation known as 
Glauber's Salts.  He was a firm believer in the Philosophers' Stone and 
elixir vitis. Concerning the former, he states: " Let the be-nevolent reader 
take with him my final judgment concerning the great Stone of the Wise; let 
every man believe what he will and is able to comprehend. Such a work is 
purely the gift of God, and cannot be learned by the most acute power of 
human mind, if it be not assisted by the benign help of a Divine 
Inspiration. And of this I assure myself that in the last times, God will 
raise up some to whom He will open the Cabinet of Nature's Secrets, that 
they shall be able to do wonderful things in the World to His Glory, the 
which, I indeed, heartily wish to posterity that they may enjoy and use to 
the praise and honour of God."
     Some of Glauber's principal works are, Philosophical Furnaces, 
Commentary on Paracelsus, Heaven of the Philo-sophers, or Book of Vexation, 
Miraculum Mundi, The Prosperity of Germany, Book of Fires.


Gloriana : (See Dee.)


Glosopetra, or Gulosus  This stone is said to fall from Heaven in the wane 
of the moon.  It is shaped like the human tongue, and was used by magicians 
to excite the lunar motions.


Gloucester, Eleanor Cobham, Duchess of : Wife of Humphrey of Gloucester, 
uncle of Henry VI., and Lord Protector of England during the King's 
minority. Though Humphrey was very popular in England, he was not without 
enemies, and one of the most bitter of these was Henry Beaufort, Cardinal of 
Winchester, great-uncle to the King.  He it was who brought a charge of 
witchcraft against the Duchess of Gloucester, hoping thus to destroy her 
husband's power as the actual head of the realm and heir to the throne in 
the event of the King's death.  It was Supposed that the Duchess had first 
resorted to witchcraft in order to gain the affections of Humphrey, whose 
second wife she was. Then, when she had married him, and the death of the 
Duke of Bedford had removed the last barrier but one between her and a 
crown, she set about the secret removal of that barrier, which was, of 
course, the unfortunate King. To assist her in her evil designs, she sought 
the advice of Margery Jourdain (the Witch of Eye), Roger Bolingbroke, Thomas 
Southwel, and John Hume, or Hun, a priest.  All five were accused of 
summoning evil spirits, and plotting to destroy the King. They were also 
suspected of making a waxen image, which was slowly melted before a fire, in 
the expectation that as the image was consumed, the life of the King would 
also waste away.  For the supposed practice of this common device of 
witches, they were put upon trial. The priest, Hun, turned informer, and 
Bolingbroke, having abjured his evil works, was called upon to give 
evidence. Margery Jourdain was burned as a witch, and the Duchess of 
Gloucester was sentenced to walk through the streets of London on three 
separate occasions bearing a lighted taper in her hand, and attended by the 
Lord Mayor, sheriffs, and others. Afterwards, she was banished to the Isle 
of Man.


Gnosticism : Under the designation " Gnostics," several widely-differing 
sects were included, the term, derived from the Greek, meaning, "to know" in 
opposition to mere theory, and sharing this significance with the words, 
wizard," " witch," which also indicate in their original meaning: "those who 
know."
     Simultaneously with Christianity, these sects assumed a definite form, 
the eastern provinces of the Roman Empire being their sphere of operations 
at first. Their doctrines were an admixture of Indian, Egyptian, Babylonian, 
and Christian creeds, astrology and magic, with much of the Jewish Kabbala 
also. From Alexandria, that centre of mystic learning, much of their 
distinctive beliefs and ritual were derived, while it seems certain that to 
a certain extent they became affiliated with Mithraism (q.v.), to whose 
sheltering kindness Occidental Christianity also owed much. Most of the 
sects had a priesthood of the mysteries, and. these initiated priests 
practised magic arts astrology, incantations, exorcisms, the fashioning of 
charms talismans and amulets, of which many are extant at the present day.  
It is said that the Grecian mysteries, the Eleusinian and Cabiric, for 
instance, were celebrated by the Gnostic sects down to a late date.  They 
were looked upon as heretics and sorcerers by the Church, and were the 
victims of relentless 
persecution. In Persia also they were put to death, but some embraced 
Islamism, and trans-mitted their doctrines to the Dervish sects (q.v.). 
Mani-cheism, a later sect was founded by Manes, who belonged to the Order of 
the Magi, and was famous for his skill in astrology, medicines and magic.  
This sect was anathema to the Church, and its later variants, Paulicians, 
Cathari, Albigensis, Lollards, and later still the Carbonari, never failed 
to arouse the persecuting fervour of the Church.
     Apollonius of Tyana (q.v.), a Pagan, was supposed to have some 
connection with the Gnostics. The first Gnostic of eminence was Simon Magus 
(q.v.) contemporary with the Christian apostles. The Simonians are said to 
have inter-preted the Creation in Genesis as symbolic of the gestation of 
the foetus, the temptation of Eve and the Garden of Eden having a like 
character. The Carpocratians, one of the Gnostic sects, derived their 
mysteries and rites from Isis worship. They used Theurgic incantations, 
symbols and signs. The Ophites also adopted Egyptian rites, and, as their 
name indicates, these included much of serpent symbolism, an actual serpent 
being the central object of their mysteries. Marcos, disciple of Valentinus, 
and founder of the Marcian sect, celebrated Mass with two chalices, pouring 
wine from the larger into a smaller, and on pronouncing a magical formula, 
the vessel was fi]led with a liquor like blood, which swelled up seething. 
Other sects practised divination and prophecy by means of female 
somnambules.  Some of the sects became degraded in doctrine and ritual, this 
often being of an orgiastic character.
     The Gnostic talismans were mostly engraved on gems, the colour and 
traditional qualities of the jewel being part of its magical efficacy. They 
used spells and charms and mystic formulae, said to  loose fetters, to cause 
blind-ness in one's enemies, to procure dreams, to gain favour, to encompass 
any desire whatsoever."  In a Greek Gnostic Papyrus is to be found the 
following spell of Agathocles, for producing dreams  "Take a cat, black all 
over, and which has been killed  prepare a writing tablet, and write the 
following with a solution of myrrh, and the dream which thou desirest to be 
sent, and put in the mouth of the cat. The text to be transcribed runs : ' 
Keimi, Keimi, I am the Great One, in whose mouth rests Mommom, Thoth, 
Nauumbre, Karikha, Kenyro, Paarmiathon, the sacred Ian ice ieu aeoi, who is 
above the heaven, Amekheumen, Neunana, Seunana, Ablanathanalba,' (here 
follow further names, then,) 'Put thyself in connection with N.N. in this 
matter (as to the substance of the dream named,) but if it is necessary then 
bring for me N.N. hither by thy power lord of the whole world, fiery god, 
put thyself in connexion with N.N.'  Again, there follows a list of 
meaningless names, the formula ending : ' Hear me, for I shall speak the 
great name, Thoth l whom each god honours, and each demon fears, by whose 
command every messenger performs his mission. Thy name answers to the seven 
(vowels) a, e, e, i, o, u, o, iauoeaao ouee oia.  I named thy glorious name, 
the name for all needs. Put thyself in connection with N.N., Hidden One, 
God, with respect to this name, which Apollobex also used." The repetition 
of apparently meaningless syllables was always held to be of great efficacy 
in magical rites, either as holding the secret name of the powers invoked, 
or of actual power in themselves. In Atanasi's Magic Papyrus, Spell VII., 
directs you to lay the link of a chain upon a leaden plate, and having 
traced its outline, to write thereon, round the circumference, the common 
Gnostic legend in Greek characters (reading both ways) continuously. Within 
the circle was written the nature of the thing which it was desired to 
prevent.  The operation was called  The Ring of Hermes."  The link was then 
to be folded up on the leaden plate, and thrown into the grave of one dead 
before his time, or else into a disused well. After the formula above given, 
was to follow in Greek:   Prevent thou such and such a person from doing 
such and such a thing "-a proof that the long string of epithets all 
referred to the same power. These
instances might be multiplied, although much of the more valuable parts of 
the Gnostic doctrines were destroyed by every persecutor who arose, and this 
was easily done, for the sacred and mystic teachings, the prayers and spells 
were inscribed on perishable parchments. That much of the evil was imputed 
to them by the Church because of their more philosophic habit of thought in 
opposition to faith and dogma, is beyond doubt.

Goat : The devil is frequently represented under the shape of a goat, and as 
such presided over the witches' Sabbath. The goat is also the " emblem of 
sinful men at the day of
judgment."  (See Baphomet; Witchcraft.)


Goblin : A spirit formerly supposed to lurk in houses. They were generally 
of a mischievous and grotesque type.  Hob--goblins, according to Junius, 
were so called because they were wont to hop on one leg.


God  According to the ancient magical conception of God in the scheme of the 
universe, evil is the inevitable contrast and complement of good.  God 
permits the existence of the shadow in order that it may intensify the 
purity of the light.  Indeed he has created both and they are inseparable 
the one being necessary to and incomprehensible without the other.
     The very idea of goodness loses its meaning if considered apart from 
that of evil-Gabriel is a foil to Satan and Satan to Gabriel.  The dual 
nature of the spiritual world pene-trates into every department of life 
material and spiritual. It is typified in light and darkness, cold and heat, 
truth and error, in brief, the names of any two opposing forces will serve 
to illustrate the great primary law of nature-viz. the continual conflict 
between the positive or good and the negative or evil.
     For a scriptural illustration of this point, let the story of Cain and 
Abel be taken. The moral superiority of his brother is at first irksome to 
Cain, finally intolerable.  He murders Abel, thus bringing on his own head 
the wrath of God and the self-punishment of the murderer.  For in killing 
Abel he has done himself no good, but harm.  He has not done-away with 
Abel's superiority, but has added to himself a burden of guilt that can be 
expiated only by much suffering.
     Suffering is shewn in the Scriptures to be the only means by which evil 
is overcome by good.  Cain re-appears in the story of the prodigal son, who 
after privation and suffer-ing is restored to his father who forgives him 
fully and freely.
     The possibility of sin and error is therefore entirely con-sistent with 
and even inseparable from life, and the great sinner a more vital being than 
the colourless character, because having greater capacity for evil he has 
also greater capacity for good, and in proportion to his faults so wilt his 
virtues be when he turns to God.  " There is more joy in heaven over one 
sinner that repenteth than over ninety and nine just persons," because more 
force of character, more power for good or evil is displayed by the sinner 
than by the feebly correct.  And that power is the most precious thing in 
life.
     This great dual law, right and wrong, two antagonistic forces, call 
them what we will, is designated by the term duad.  It is the secret of life 
and the revelation of that secret means death. This secret is embodied in 
the myth of the Tree of Knowledge in Genesis.  At death the discord will be 
resolved, but not till then.
     From the duad is derived the triad on which is based the doctrine of 
the Trinity. Two forces producing equili-brium, the secret of nature, are 
designated by the duad, and these Three, call them life, good. evil, 
constitute one law.  By adding the conception of unity to that of the triad 
we arrive at the tetrad. the perfect number of four, the source of all 
numerical combinations. According to the-ology there arc three persons in 
God, and these three form one Deity. Three and one make four because unity 
is-required to explain the Three.  Hence, in almost all lang-uages, the name 
of God consists of four letters. Again, two affirmations mike two negations 
either possible or necessary. According to the Kabalists the name of the 
Evil one consisted of the same four letters spelled back-ward, signifying 
that evil is merely the reflection or shadow of good- The last reflection or 
imperfect mirage of light in shadow."
     All which exists in light or darkness, good or evil, exists through the 
tetrad. The triad or trinity, then, is explained by the duad and resolved by 
the tetrad.


Godfrey : A priest of Provence, who had seduced several wo-men.  One of 
them, a nun, to save herself, asserted that Godirey had bewitched her.
     Arrested and imprisoned, he was tortured until he con-fessed that he 
was a magician, and that he had, by means of his breathing and other 
enchantments, corrupted this woman and several others.  He was even induced, 
in his extreme agony, to speak of his presence at the Witches' Sabbath, and 
to give a long description of it.  After these confessions had been cruelly 
extorted from the anguish of failing nature, the Parliament of Aix condemned 
him, on the 30th of April, 1611, to be burnt alive, as guilty of magic, 
sorcery. impiety, and abominable lust-a sentence which was carried into 
execution without delay.
     This horrible affair gave rise to an adventure which has been related 
by the Abbe of Papon.
     “The process," said he,  contained many depositions upon the power of 
the demons.  Several witnesses pro-tested that after being anointed with a 
magic oil, Godfrey transported himself to the Sabbath, and afterwards re-
turned to his chamber down the shaft of the chimney.  One day, when these 
depositions had been read to the Parlia-ment, and the imagination of the 
judges excited by a long recital of supernatural events, there was heard in 
the chim-ney an extraordinary noise, which suddenly terminated with the 
apparition of a tall black man.  The judges thought it was the devil come to 
the rescue of his disciple, and fled away swiftly, with the exception of a 
councillor Thorton, their reporter, who, finding himself entangled in his 
desk, could not follow them. Terrified by what he saw, with trembling body 
and staring eyes, and repeatedly making the sign of the cross, he in his 
turn affrighted the pretended demon, who was at a loss to understand the 
magistrate's perturbation.  Recovering from the embar-rassment he made 
himself known, and proved to be a chim-ney sweeper who, after having swept 
the chimney of the Messieurs des Comptes, whose chimneys joined those of the 
Tournelle, had by mistake descended into the chamber of the Parliament."


Goethe, Johann Wolfgang : German Author, (1749-1832) Johann Wolfgang Goeth, 
probably the most celebrated of all German writers, was born at Frankfurt-
on-the-Main in 1749, his father being a lawyer of some eminence. At an early 
age the boy showed a persistent fondness for draw-ing, and assimilated the 
rudiments of learning with sur-prising ease; while in 1759, on a French 
nobleman of aesthetic tastes coming to stay with the Goethes, a warm 
friendship between him and the future author sprang up, and proved the means 
of accelerating the latter's intellectual development. Shortly after this a 
French theatre was founded at Frankfurt, and here young Goethe became 
conversant with Racine; while simultaneously he made some early attempts at 
original writing, and began to learn Italian, Latin and Greek, English and 
even Hebrew. Very soon, however, a little cloud came to darken his horizon-
just the cloud which has dimmed the blue skies for so many youths-for at the 
age of fifteen he became des-perately enamoured of a young girl, and as his 
parents disapproved of the match the pair were separated straight-way.  At 
first Goethe declared himself broken-hearted, and being intensely virile, as 
all men of might are, he sought consolation in loose-living.  But a broken 
heart seldom proves a fatal malady, and the disappointed lover's restora-
tion to mental health was facilitated betimes by his removal from his native 
town to Leipsic, where he entered the uni-versity, intending to become a 
lawyer.
     At Leipsic Goethe showed slender affection for the actual curriculum, 
and instead he continued in essay writing and drawing, while he even took 
lessons in etching.  He also found time for another love-affair, but this 
was cut short in 1768 by his undergoing a serious illness; and, on his 
recovering therefrom, he decided to leave his present alma meter in favour 
of that of Strasburg. Arrived there, he became intimate with Jung Stilling, 
while his taste for letters was strengthened, Homer and Ossian being the 
masters for whom he chiefly avowed affection; while, though lie con-tinued 
to show himself callous as regards law, he succeeded in becoming an advocate 
in 1771, whereupon he returned to Frankfurt.
     Goethe had already written a quantity of verse and prose, and now, in 
his native town, he began to do critiques for some of the newspapers there, 
while simultaneously he commenced writing Goetz von Berlichingen and 
Werther. These were followed shortly by Prometheus, and in 1774 the author 
started working at Faust, while the following year witnessed the production 
of some of his best love poems, these being addressed to Lilli Schonemann, 
daugh-ter of a Frankfurt banker. Nothing more than poetry, however, was 
destined to result from this new devotion; and scarcely had it come and gone 
ere Goethe's whole life was changed, for meanwhile his writings had become 
fa-mous, and now the young Duke Carl August of Weimar, anxious for a trusty 
henchman, invited the rising author to come to his court. The invitation was 
accepted, Goethe became a member of the privy-council, while subsequently he 
was raised to the rank of Geheimrath and then ennobled.
     Goethe's life at Weimar was a very busy one. Trusted implicitly by the 
Duke, he directed public roads and build-ings, he attended to military and 
academic affairs, and he founded a court theatre.  But though having all 
these outlets for his energy he continued to write voluminously, among the 
most important works he produced during his first years at the Duke's court 
being Iphigenia and Wilhelm Meister; while in 1787 he made a lengthy stay in 
Italy, visiting Naples, Pompei, Rome and Milan.  Returning to Weimir, he 
began writing Egmont; while in 1795 he made the acquaintance of Schiller, 
with whom he speedily became very intimate, and along with whom he worked on 
the Horen, a journal designed to elevate the literary tastes of the masses.  
About this period, too, Goethe wrote his play of Hermann und Dorothea, and 
likewise did sundry translations from Voltaire, Diderot and Benvenuto 
Cellini; while the year 1806 is a significant one in his history, marked as 
it is alike by his marriage and by the entry of Napoleon into Weimar. The 
conquering general and the German poet each found much in the other to 
admire, and the latter was decorated with the cross of the Legion of Honour; 
nor did his literary activities show any signs of flagging as yet, for in 
1811 he wrote Dichtung end Wahrheit, in 1821 Wilhelm Meister's Wanderjahre, 
and a little later he commenced working at a second part of Faust,  During 
the time he was engaged thus he had two famous visitors, Beethoven coming 
from Vienna and Thackeray from London; and, though the composer imagined 
himself coldly received, the novelist on the contrary spoke with enthusiasm 
of the welcome accorded him.  But Goethe was now well-stricken in years, his 
health was beginning to fail, and he died early in 1832.
     Few great writers, not even Disraeli or Sir Walter Scott, had fuller 
lives than Goethe.  His love-affairs, besides those cited above, were 
countless, and his early taste for the graphic arts continued to the end of 
his days, resulting in his making a vast collection of treasures ; while his 
interest in mysticism, by virtue of which he is included in this volume, 
manifested itself in divers forms besides the writing of Faust.  For, 
something of a nympholept as he was, Goethe's mind was essentially an 
aspirational and speculative one, and during his childhood at Frankfurt he 
used to do symbolical drawings of the soul's aspirations to the deity, while 
subsequently he became immersed in the study of the Christian religion.  
Anon he grew sceptical on this subject, his ideas being altered not only by 
his own ruminations but by his readings in various iconoclastic 
philosophers, especially Rousseau; and it would seem that latterly his 
intellect was less engaged by Christianity than by those other and probably 
more ancient Eastern faiths, his leanings in this direction being 
demonstrated by sundry works from his pen, notably his 
West-ostliche Divan. One of his note-books, moreover, shows that while a 
young man at Strassburg he made a close study of Giordano Bruno and other 
early scientists; while as a boy he was a keen student of alchemy, reading 
deeply in Welling and van Helmont, Basil Valentine and Paracelsus, and even 
fitting up a laboratory where he spent long hours in arduous experiments.  
No doubt it was while engaged in this way that he first conceived the idea 
of writing a drama on the subject of Dr. Faustus, but be that as it may, his 
alchemis-tic and other scientific researches certainly stood him in good 
stead when ultimately composing this work. The story's main outlines are so 
well known already-not only by reason of Calderon's and Marlowe's versions, 
but by the operas of Gounod, Schumann and Berlioz-that it were superfluous. 
if not impertinent to offer anything of the nature of a paraphrase or 
synopsis here; but it should be said, in drawing to a conclusion, that after 
all it is mainly on account of Faust that Goethe takes rank as a mystic, and 
a great mystic, for his rendering of the immor-tal theme is acknowledged as 
among the finest things in the whole of mystical literature.


Goetia  (See Key of Solomon the King.)


Golden Key  Under this title have been published many volumes purporting to 
reveal an infallible method of attaining success in a lottery. La Clef d' 
or, or La Veritable tresor de la fortune, reprinted from time to time at 
Lille, is based on the doctrine of sympathetic numbers, which the author 
claims to have discovered. Each number drawn, he declares, has five 
sympathetic numbers which directly follow it. Thus the number 4 has for its 
sympathetic numbers 30, 40, 50, 20, and 76.  Knowing this, of course, it is 
an easy matter to win fortune at a lottery.

Gormogons  A Jacobite Masonic Society, perhaps related to the Lodges of 
Harodim (q.v.) They employed pseudonyms like the latter, and had an 
ambassador at Rome.  Their history is sketched in a pamphlet dated 1724, 
entitled Two Letters to a Friend," and in the work of Prichard (1730). The 
Duke of Wharton and the Chevalier Ramsay who were well-known Jacobites, were 
members of the Order. They had a cipher and secret reception of their own, 
and used a jargon in which the names of places and individuals were hidden 
and transposed.  A plate of Hogarth's is extant in which the Order is 
lampooned under the title of  The Mystery of Masonry brought to light by ye 
Gormogons."


Graal, The Lost Book of the : The origin of the Graal legend, which is of 
course speculative. Seven ancient books are cited as being the possible 
cradle of the story, but none of
them quits meet the case.  In the Roth Merlin, a " Book of the Sanctuary " 
is referred to, but this is a book of records, not containing any special 
spiritual allusion.
     If, and it is very doubtful if, such a book ever existed, it was most 
probably a. Mass hook, extant about 1100. Its contents would relate to a 
Mass following the Last Supper, in which Christ gave Himself, the Priest 
serving. The mystery is threefold.  (I) of Origin, which is part of the 
mystery of the Incarnation.  (2) of Manifestation, which would have taken 
place had the world been worthy. (3) of Removal: this world being unworthy, 
the Graal was said to be removed, yet not hidden, for it is always 
discernible by anyone worthy, or qualified to see it.  As has been said, it 
is not probable that such a Mass-book ever existed.


Grail, Holy : A portion of the Arthurian cycle of romance, of late origin 
embodying a number of tales dealing with the search for a certain vessel of 
great sanctity, called the grail" or  graal."  
Versions of the story are numerous the most celebrated of them being the 
Conte del Graal, the Grand St. Graal, Sir Percyvalle, Quete del St. Graal, 
and Guyot; but there are many others. These overlap in many respects, but 
the standard form of the story may perhaps be found in the Grand St. Graal-
one of the latest versions, which dates from the thirteenth century.  It 
tells how Joseph of Arimathea employed a dish used at the last supper to 
catch the blood of the Redeemer which flowed from his body before his 
burial. The wanderings of Joseph are then described.  He leads a band to 
Britain, where he is cast into prison, but is delivered by Evelach or 
Mordrains, who is instructed by Christ to assist him. This Mordrains builds 
a monastery where the Grail is housed. Brons, Joseph's brother-in-law, has a 
son Alain, who is appointed guardian of the Grail; and this Alain having 
caught a great fish, with which he feeds the entire house-hold, is called 
the Rich Fisher, which title becomes that of the Grail keepers in 
perpetuity. Alain placed the Grail in the castle of Corbenic, and thence in 
due time come various knights of King Arthur's court in quest of the holy 
vessel, but only the purest of the pure can approach its vicinity; and in 
due time Percival attains to sight of the marvel.
     It is probable that the Grail idea was originated by early medieval 
legends of the quest for talismans which conferred great boons upon the 
finder: as for example, the Shoes of Swiftness, the Cloak of Invisibility, 
the Ring of Gyges, and so forth ; and that these stories were interpreted in 
the light and spirit of medieval Christianity and mysticism. They may be 
divided into two classes: those which are connected with the quest for 
certain talismans, of which the Grail is only one, and which deal with the 
personality of the hero who achieved the quest; and secondly those which 
deal with the nature and history of the talismans.
     A great deal of controversy has raged around the probable Eastern 
origin of the Grail Legend, and much erudition has been employed to show 
that Guyot, a Provencal poet who flourished in the middle of the twelfth 
century, found at Toledo in Spain an Arabian book by an astrologer, 
Flegitanis, which contained the Grail story. But the name  “Flegitanis" can 
by no means be an Arabian proper name; and it might perhaps be the Persian 
feleke-daneh, a Persian combined word which signifies" astrology," and in 
this ease it would be the title of an astrological work. Professor Bergmann 
and others believed that the Holy Legend originated in the mind of Guyot 
himself; but this conclusion was strongly combated by the late Alfred Nutt. 
There is, however, good reason to believe that the story may have been 
brought from the East by the Knights Templar.
     The Grail Legend has often been held by certain writers to buttress the 
theory that the Church of England or the Catholic Church has existed since 
the foundation of the world.  From early Christian times the genealogy of 
these churches is traced back through the patriarchs to numerous apocryphal 
persons; but we are not informed as to whether it possessed hierophants in 
neolithic and paleolithic times, or how it originated. This mischievous and 
absurd theory, which in reality would identify Christianity with the 
grossest forms of paganism, is luckily confined to a small band of pseudo-
mystics, comprising for the most part persons of small erudition and less 
liberality of outlook. The Grail Legend was readily embraced by those 
persons, who saw in it a link between Palestine and England and a plea for 
the special and separate foundation of the Anglican Church by direct 
emissaries from the Holy Land.  Glaston-bury was fixed as the headquarters 
of the Grail immi-grants. and the finding of a glass dish in the vicinity of 
the cathedral there not many years ago was held to be con-firmation of the 
story by many of the faithful. The exact date of this vessel cannot 
successfully be gauged, but there is not the least reason to suppose that it 
is more than a few hundred years old.  (See Tradition.)


Grail Sword : Associated with the Holy Grail in Arthurian Legend.  Its 
history begins with King David who be-queathed it to Solomon who was bidden 
to re-cast the pommel.  In Solomon's time it was placed in a ship built and 
luxuriously furnished by Solomon's wife.  Subse-quently discovered by the 
Knights of the Quest, it was assumed and worn by Galahad.


Gram: A magic sword thrust into a tree by Odin and pulled out by Sigmund.  
It bestowed upon its possessor excep-tional powers and performed many 
miracles.


Grand Copt: (See Cagliostro.)


Grand Grimoire, The: A work pretended to be edited by a suppositions person, 
Antonia del Rabina, who, it is alleged, prepared his edition from a copy 
transcribed from the genuine writings of King Solomon. The work is divided 
into two parts : the first containing the evocation of Lucifuge Rocofale 
(See "Ceremonial Magic " in article "Magic")  the second being concerned 
with the rite of making pacts with demons.  The work is regarded as one of 
the most atrocious of its type  but there is little reason for such heavy 
condemnation, as its childish and absurd. character must be patent to 
everyone.  Eliphas Levi says that it pretends to confer the Powder of 
Protection, that great mystery of the sages, but that in reality it confers 
the Powder of Consecution-whatever that may imply.  The first portion of the 
Grand Grimoire in a process for the evocation of evil spirits to assist the 
operator to discover hidden treasure.  The second part, that which deals 
with facts, suggests the surrender of the magician body and soul to the 
demon, and it is in this that the diabolical excellencies of the work 
consist.  But the pact, as it stands, is grossly unfair to the devil, for 
the working of it is such, that the magician can very readily slip through 
his fingers.


Grand Lodge : Foundation of.  (See Freemasonry.)


Grandier, Urbaln : Urbain Grandier, a canon of the French church, and a 
popular preacher of the town of Loudun in the district of Poiriers, was in 
the year 1634 brought to trial upon the accusation of magic. The first cause 
of his being thus called in question was the envy of his rival preachers, 
whose fame was eclipsed by his superior talents. The second cause was a 
libel falsely imputed to him upon cardinal Richelieu. Grandier, besides his 
eloquence, was distinguished for his courage and resolution, for the grace-
fulness of his figure, and the extraordinary attention he pied to the 
neatness of his dress and the decoration of his person, which last 
circumstance brought upon him the imputation of being so much devoted to the 
service of the fair  About this time certain nuns of the convent of 
Ursulines at Loudun (q.v.) were attacked with a disease which manifested 
itself by very extraordinary symptoms, suggesting to many the idea they  
were possessed with devils.  A rumour was immediately spread that Grandier, 
urged by some offence he had conceived against these nuns, was the author, 
by the skill he had in the arts of sorcery. of these possessions.  It 
unfortunately happened that the same capuchin friar who assured cardinal 
Richelieu that Greedier was the writer of the libel against him, also 
communicated to him the story of the possessed nuns, and the suspicion which 
had fallen on the priest on their account. The cardinal, seized with avidity 
on this occasion of private vengeance, wrote to the counsellor of state at 
London, to cause a strict investigation to be made into the charges, and in 
such terms as plainly implied that what he aimed at was the destruction of 
Grandier.  The trial took place in the month of August, 1634  and, according 
to the authorised copy of the trial, Grandier was convicted upon the 
evidence of Astaroth, a devil of the order of Seraphims, and chief of the 
possessing devils, of Easas, of Celsus, of Acaos, of Cedon, of Asmodens of 
the order of thrones, of Alex, of Zabulon, of Naphthalim, of Cham, of Uriel, 
and of Achas of the order of principalities. and sentenced to be burned 
alive.  In other words, he was convicted upon the evidence of twelve nuns, 
who, being asked who they were, gave in these names, and professed to be 
devils that, com-pelled by the order of the court, delivered a constrained 
tes-timony. The. sentence was accordingly executed, and Grandier met his 
fate with heroic constancy.  At his death an enormous drone fly was seen 
buzzing about his head. and a monk, who was present at the execution, 
attested that, whereas the devils are accustomed to present themselves in 
the article of death to tempt men to deny God their Saviour, this was 
Beelzebub (which in Hebrew signifies the God of flies), come to carry away 
to hell the soul of the victim.

Graterakes, Valentine : An Irish mesmerist born in the county of Waterford 
in 1628.  In 1662, he dreamed that he had received the gift of healing by 
laying on of hands. He ignored the dream, but as it occurred again on 
several occasions, he made an experiment upon his wife which was quite 
successful.  He practised the laying on of hands for practically all 
diseases, and in 1666 went to London where he was summoned to court.  Whilst 
there he healed many persons, but the insults of the courtiers proved too 
much for him and he was forced to withdraw to a house near London, where he 
continued his cures.  In his Critical History of Animal Magnetism Pechlin 
says,  Amongst the most astonishing cures which history records, are those 
of an Irish gentleman in London, Oxford, and other cities of England and 
Ireland.  He himself published in London in 1666 a full account of them.   
‘Val. Graterakes, Esq., of Waterford, in the kingdom of Ireland, famous for 
curing several diseases and distempers by the stroak of his hand only: 
London 1660'"
     Pechlin  believes that no doubt whatever can be enter-tained of the 
reality of his cures, as they are related in his own work; and they are, 
therefore worthy of being trans-lated into all languages.       
Pechlin caused a number of letters and testimonials to be printed, which 
place the veracity and the character of Graterakes in the clearest light.  
In the first place, Job. Glanville, the author of Scepsis Scientifica, in 
which he treated all learning and human science as open to doubt, and who 
was also a chaplain to Charles II., says in a letter that Graterakes was a 
simple, amiable, and pious man, a stranger to all deceit. The same testimony 
was given to him by George Rust, Bishop of Dromore in Ireland. The bishop 
says that he was three weeks at his house, where he had an opportunity of 
observing his sound morals, and the great number of his cures of the sick. 
Through the simple laying on of hands he drove the pains to the extremities 
of the limbs. Many times the effect was very rapid and as if by magic.  If 
the pains did not immediately give way, he repeated his rubbings, and always 
drove them from the nobler parts to the less noble, and finally into the 
limbs.
     The Bishop relates still further :-" I can as eye-witness assert that 
Graterakes cured dizziness, very bad diseases of the eyes and ears, old 
ulcers, goitre, epilepsy, glandular swellings, scirrhous indurations, and 
cancerous swellings.  I have seen swellings disperse in five days which were 
many years old, but I do not believe by super-natural means; nor did his 
practice exhibit anything sacred. The cure was sometimes very protracted, 
and the diseases only gave way through repeated exertions; some altogether 
resisted his endeavours.'
     It appeared to the bishop that something healing, something balsamic 
flowed from him.  Graterakes himself was persuaded that his power was an 
especial gift of God. He healed even ep4emic complaints by his touch, and on 
that account he believed it his duty to devote himself to the cure of 
diseases.
     To the bishop's may be added the testimonies of two physicians, 
Faireklow and Astel, who very assiduously inquired into the reality of his 
cures.
     “I was struck," says Fairekiow, " with his gentleness and kindness to 
the unhappy, and by the effects which he produced by his hand."
     Astel says,- “I saw Graterakes in a moment remove most violent pains 
merely by his hand.  I saw him drive a pain from the shoulder to the feet.  
If the pains in the head or the intestines remained fixed, the endeavour to 
remove them was frequently followed by the most dreadful crises, which even 
seemed to bring the patient's life into danger; but by degrees they 
disappeared into the limbs, and then altogether.  I saw a scrofulous child 
of twelve years with such swellings that it could not move, and he 
dissipated merely with his hand the greatest part of them. One of the 
largest, however, he opened, and so healed it with his spittle."  Finally 
Astel says that he saw a number of other cures, and repeats the testimonies 
of Rust and Faireklow on the character of Graterakes.
     The celebrated Robert Boyle, President of the Royal Society of London, 
says :-' Many physicians, noblemen, clergymen, etc., testify to the truth of 
Graterakes' cures, which he published in London. The chief diseases which he 
cured were blindness, deafness, paralysis, dropsy, ulcers, swellings, and 
all kinds of fevers."  Finally, it is said that 'he laid his hand on the 
part affected, and so moved the disease downwards."
     Graterakes was undoubtedly one of the most celebrated of the early 
mesmerists, and there is no question that the science owed considerable 
popularity to his cures. There was nothing of the charlatan about him, and 
he appears as an unaffected and simple person, whose whole desire was to 
make the best of the gift which he had received.

Greece  That magic in its widest sense was native to the imagination and 
genius of the Greeks is apparent in their theogony and mythology, 
essentially magical in conception and meaning, in their literature, 
sculpture and history. The natural features of the country appealed 
powerfully to the quality of their imagination. Mountains and valleys, 
mysterious caves and fissures, vapours and springs of volcanic origin ;  
groves,-these according to their character, were dedicated to the gods. 
Parnassus was the abode of the sun-god, Apollo; the lovely vale of Aphaca 
that of Adonis; the oak-groves of Dodona favoured of Zeus, the gloomy caves 
with their roar of subterranean waters the Oracle of Trophonius.  
Innumerable instances of magical wonder-working are found in the stories of 
their deities and heroes. The power of transformation is shown in a 
multitude of cases, amongst them those of Bacchus who, by waving a spear, 
could change the oars of a ship into serpents, the masts into heavy-
clustered vines, tigers, lynxes and panthers to appear amidst the waves, and 
the terrified sailors leaping overboard to take the shape of dolphins; in 
those wrought by Circe who by her magic wand and enchanted philtre turned 
her lovers into swine. The serpent-staff of Hermes gave, by its touch, life 
or death, sleep or waking; Medusa's head turned its beholders into stone; 
Hermes gave Perseus wings that he might fly and Pluto a helmet which 
conferred invisibility. Prome-theus moulds a man of clay and to give it life 
steals celestial fire from heaven; Odysseus to peer into the future descends 
to Hades in search of Tiresias the Soothsayer; Achilles is made invulnerable 
by the Waters of the Styx.
     Dedicated by immemorial belief there were places where the visible 
spirits of the dead might be evoked, Heraclea, Acheron, places where men in 
curiosity, in longing or remorse strove to call back for. a fleeting moment 
those who had passed beyond mortal ken.  In the month of March, when the 
spring blossoms broke through the earth and snowed the trees with white, the 
Festival of the Flowers was held at Athens, also the Commemoration of the 
Dead, when their spirits were thought to rise from their graves and wander 
about the familiar streets, striving to enter the dwellings of man and 
temples of the gods but shut out therefrom by the magic of branches of 
whitethorn, or by knotted ropes and pitch.
     Oracles:  Of great antiquity and eminently of Greek charac-ter and 
meaning were the Oracles.  For centuries they ministered to that longing 
deeply implanted in human nature the longing to know the future, and to 
invoke divine foresight and aid in the direction of human affairs, from 
those of a private citizen to the multitudinous needs of a great state.  
Divination and prophecy were therefore the great features of the oracles. 
This was inspired by various means, by intoxicating fumes natural or 
artificial, by the drinking of mineral springs, by signs and tokens, by 
dreams. The most famous Oracles were those at Delphi, Dodona, Epi-daurus, 
and that of Trophonius. but others of renown were scattered over the 
country.  Perhaps one of the earliest was that of Aesculapius son of Apollo, 
and called the Healer, the Dream-sender because his healing was given 
through the medium of dreams that came upon the applicant while sleeping in 
the temple-courts, the famous temple-sleep. This temple, situated at 
Epidaurus. was surrounded by sacred groves and whole companies of sick 
persons lingered there in search of lost health and enlightment through 
divine dreams.  Famous beyond all was that of Apollo, the Delphian oracle on 
the Southern Slopes of Parnassus where kings and princes, heroes and slaves 
of all countries journeyed to ask the questions as to the future and what it 
might hold for them. The temple was built above a volcanic chasm, amid a 
wildness of nature which suggested the presence of the unseen powers. Here 
the priestess, the Pythia, so named after the serpent Pytho whom Apollo 
slew, was seated on a tripod placed above the gaseous vapours rising from 
the chasm.  Intoxicated to a state of frenzy, her mouth foaming. wild 
torrents of words fell from her lips, and these were shaped into coherence 
and meaning by the attendant priests and given to the waiting questioner 
standing before the altar crowned with laurel, the symbol of sleep and 
dreams and sacred to Apollo. Priests and priestesses were also crowned with 
these leaves, and they were burned as incense; before the Pythias chamber 
hung a falling screen of laurel branches
while at the festival of the Septerion every ninth year a bower of laurel 
was erected ill the forecourt of the temple. One writer has left strange 
details such as the rule that the sacred fire within the temple must only he 
fed with fir-wood; and, though a woman was chosen as the medium of the 
prophetic utterance yet no woman might question the oracle.  The Oracle of 
the Pelasgic Zeus at Dodona, the oldest of all, answered by signs rather 
than inspired speech, the rustling of the leaves in the sacred groves, by 
means of lots and the falling of water, by the wind-moved clanging of 
brazen-bowls, two hollow columns standing side by side.  The three 
priestesses, Peliades, meaning doves, were given titles signifying the 
Diviner of the future ; the friend of man, Virtue  the virgin-ruler of man, 
Chastity. For two thousand years this oracle existed, from the time when it 
was consulted by those heroes of the ancient myths, struggling in the toils 
of Fate, Hercules, Achilles, Ulysses and Aeneas, down to the latest vestiges 
of Greek national-ity.  The Oracle of Trophonius was also of great renown. 
Here there were numerous caverns filled with misty vapours and troubled by 
the noise of hidden waters far beneath. In this mysterious gloom the 
supplicants slept sometimes for nights and days, coming forth in a 
somnambulic state from which they were aroused and questioned by the 
attendant priests. Frightful visions were generally re-counted, accompanied 
by a terrible melancholy, so that it passed into a proverb regarding a 
sorrowful man  He has been in the cave of Trophonius."  Thus it may be seen 
that magic in the sense of secret revelations, miraculous cures and 
prophetic gifts, of abnormal powers, had always existed for the Greeks, the 
oracles were a purely natural human way of communing with their gods upon 
earth. But magic in the lower sense of sorcery was unknown till Asiatic and 
Egyptian influences were introduced. The native conception of Fate as 
inexorable and inescapable for gods, kings and slaves alike was inimical to 
the spontaneous growth of a form of magic which had for its primary aim a 
certain command of the destinities of man.  Good and evil and the perpetual 
strife between these two principles, the belief in demonology, these were 
foreign to the Greek mind, they were imported.  It is said that to the 
Pytha-gorean school may be traced the first mention of good and evil demons 
and not till after the Persian War was there a word in the Greek language 
for magic.  As these foreign beliefs were thus gradually introduced and 
assimilated they were ascribed to the native deities, gradually becoming 
incorporated with the ancient histories and rites.
     After the invasion by the Persians, Thessaly, where their stay was of 
lengthy duration, became famous for its sorcer-esses and their practices 
which embraced a wide than-maturgical field, from calling down the moon - 
brewing magical herbs for love or death, so much so that Apuleius in his 
romance, The Golden Ass, says, that when in Thessaly he was in the place 
"where, by common report of the world, sorcery and enchantments were most 
frequent. I viewed the situation of the place in which I was, nor was there 
anything I saw that I believed to be the same thing which it appeared to be.  
Insomuch that the very stones in the street I thought were men bewitched and 
turned into that figure, and the birds I heard chirping, the trees with-out 
the walls, and the running waters, were changed from human creatures into 
the appearances they were.  I persuaded myself that the statues and 
buildings could move ; that the oxen and other brute beasts could speak and 
tell strange tidings  that I should bear and see oracles from heaven 
conveyed in the beams of the Sun."
     Sorceresses.-Homer tells the tale of Circe the enchant-ress, with her 
magic philtres and magic songs but makes no mention of Medea, the arch-
sorceress of later times.  Round her name the later beliefs clustered, to 
her were attributed all the evil arts, she became the witch par excellence, 
her infamy increasing from age to age.  The same may be said of Hecate, the 
moon-goddess, at first sharer with Zeus of the heavenly powers, but later 
become an ominous shape of gloom, ruler and lover of the night and darkness, 
of the world of phantoms and ghouls.  Like the Furies she wielded the whip 
and cord ; she was followed by hell hounds, by writhing serpents, by lamiae, 
strygae and empusae, figures of terror and loathing.  She presided over the 
dark mysteries of birth and death ; she was worshipped at night in the flare 
of torches.  She was the three-headed Hecate of the cross-roads where little 
round cakes or a lizard mask set about with candles were offered to her in 
propitiation, that none of the phantom mob might cross the threshold of man.  
Love-magic and death-magic, the usual forms of sorcery became common in 
Greece as else where. Love philtres and charms were eagerly sought, the most 
innocent being bitten apples and enchanted garlands. Means of protection 
against the evil eye became a necessity for tales of bewitchment were spread 
abroad, and of mis-fortune and death being brought upon the innocent and 
unwary by means of a waxen figure moulded in their image and tortured by the 
sorceress.  In tombs and secret places leaden tablets were buried inscribed 
with the names of foes and victims, pierced through with a nail in order to 
bring disaster and death upon them.  At this time it became law that none 
who practised sorcery might participate in the Eleusinian Mysteries, and at 
Athens, a Samian Sorceress, Theoris, was cast to the flames.
     Orphic Magic.-The introduction of Egyptian influences were due 
generally to the agency of Orpheus and Pythagoras, who, while in Egypt, had 
been initiated into the mysteries. The story of Orpheus shows him as pre-
eminently the wonder-worker, but one of beneficence and beauty.  To men of 
his time everything was enchantment and prodigy. By the irresistible power 
of his music he constrained the rocks, trees and animals to follow him, at 
his behest storms arose or abated.  He was the necromancer, who by his 
golden music overcame the powers of darkness, and descend-ing to the world 
of shades, found his beloved Eurydice, and but for the fatal and disobedient 
look into her face em they gained the upper air would have brought her back 
to the living world.  Jealous women tore him limb from limb, and his head 
floating down the waters of the Hebrus was cast on the rocky shores of 
Lesbos where, still retaining the power of speech, it uttered oracles, the 
guidance of which people from all parts sought, even those of Babylon.  He 
was said to have instructed the Greeks in medicine and magic, and for long 
afterwards remedies, magical formulae, incantations and charms were engraved 
upon Orphean tablets and the power of healing was ascribed to the Orphean 
Hymns.  Pythagoras, Philosopher and geometrician, to the populace a 
magician, indefatigable in the pursuit of know-ledge, wielded an immense 
influence on the thought of his time.  After his return from Egypt he 
founded a school where to those who had previously undergone severe and 
drastic discipline he communicated his wide and varied knowledge.  He was 
also credited with miraculous powers such as being visible at the same hour 
in places far apart as Italy and Sicily; of taming a bear by whispering in 
its ear ; of calling an eagle from its flight to alight on his wrist.
     Mysteries.-Among the greatest features of religious life were the 
mysteries held at periodic intervals in connection with the different 
deities, such as the Semothracian, the Bacchic and most famous of all, the 
Eleusinian.  Their origin is to be traced mostly to a pre-historic nature-
worship and vegetation-magic.  All these mysteries had three trials or 
baptisms by water, fire and air, and three specially sacred emblems, the 
phallus, egg and serpent, generative emblems sacred in all secret rites.  
The Samothracian centred round four mysterious deities, Axieros the mother, 
her children Axiocersos, male, Axiocersa, female, from whom sprang Casindos 
the originator of the universe. The festival probably symbolized the 
creation of the world, also the harvest and its growth.  Connected with this 
was the worship of Cybele, goddess of the earth, of the cities and fields.  
Her priests, the Corybantes, dwelt in a cave where they held their 
ceremonies, including a wild and orgiastic weapon-dance, accompanied by the 
incessant shaking of heads and clanging of swords upon shields. The cult of 
Bacchus Was said by some to have been carried into Greece from Egypt by 
Melampus.  He is the god of the vine and vegetation, and his mysteries 
typified the growth of the vine and the vintage; the winter sleep of all 
plant life and its renewal in spring. Women were his chief attendants, the 
Bacchantes, who, clashing cymbals and utter-ing wild cries in invocation of 
their god, became possessed by ungovernable fury and homicidal mania. 
Greatest of all in their relation to Hellenic life were the Eleusinian 
Mysteries. These were the paramount interest and function of the state 
religion exerting the widest, strongest in-fluence on people of all classes. 
The rites were secret and their details are practically unknown, but they 
undoubtedly symbolised the myth of Demeter, corn-goddess, and were held in 
spring and September. Prior to initiation a long period of purification and 
preparation was enforced, during which the higher meaning of the myth was 
inculcated, the original meaning having become exalted by the genius of the 
Greeks into an intimate allegory of the soul of man, its birth, life and 
death, its descent into Hades and subsequent release therefrom. After this 
there came the central point of the mysteries, the viewing of certain holy 
and Secret sym-bols; next, a crowning with garlands, signifying the happi-
ness which arises from friendship with the divine. The festival also 
embodied a scenic representation of the Story of Demeter; the rape of 
Persephone, the sorrow of the mother, her complaints before Zeus, the final 
reconciliation. Women played a great part in this, the reason being that as 
they themselves  produce," so by sympathetic magic their influence was 
conveyed to the corn, as when crying aloud for rain they looked upward to 
the skies, then down to the earth with cries of ' Conceive    These 
priestesses were crowned with poppies and corn. symbolical attributes of the 
deity they implored.  (See article Mysteries.)
     Divination.-Besides the priests and priestesses attached to the 
different temples there was an order of men called interpreters whose 
business it was to read futurity by various means such as the flight of 
birds and entrails of victims. These men often accompanied the armies in 
order to predict the success or failure of operations during warfare and 
thus avert the possibility of mistakes in the campaign: they fomented or 
repressed revolutions in state and government by their predictions. The most 
celebrated interpreters were those of Elis, where in two or three families 
this peculiar gift or knowledge was handed down from father to son for 
generations.  But there were others who were authorised by the state-men who 
traded on the credulity of the rich and poor, women of the lowest dregs of 
humanity, who professed to read the future in natural and unnatural 
phenomena, in eclipses, in thunder, in dreams, in unexpected sight of 
certain animals, in con-vulsive movement of eyelids, tingling of the ears, 
in sneez-ing, in a few words casually dropped by a passer-by.  In the 
literature and philosophies of Greece magic in all its forms is found as 
theme for imagination, discussion and belief.  In the hands of the tragic 
poets, sorceresses such as Circe and Medea become figures of terror and 
death, embodiments of evil. Pythagoras left no writings but on his theories 
were founded those of Empedocles and Plato.
In the verses of Empedocles he teaches the theory of re incarnation, he 
himself remembering previous existences wherein he was a boy, a girl, a 
plant, fish and bird.  He also claimed to teach the secrets of miraculous 
medicine, of the re-animation of old age, of bringing rain, storm, or 
sunshine, of recalling the dead. Aristides the Greek orator gives exhaustive 
accounts of the many dreams he experienced during sleep in the temples and 
the cures prescribed therein.  Socrates tells of his attendant spirit or 
genius who warned him, and others through his agency, of impending danger, 
also foretelling futurity.
     Xenophon, treating of divination by dreams, maintains that in sleep the 
human soul reveals her divine nature, and being freed from trammels of the 
body gazes into futurity. Plato, while inveighing against sorcery, took the 
popular superstitions relating to magic, demons and spirits and by his 
genius purified and raised them, using them as a basis for a spiritual and 
magical theory of things, unsurpassed for intellectual beauty.  On his 
teaching was founded the school of Neo-Platonists who were among the most 
fervid defenders of magic. Aristotle states that prediction is a purely 
natural quality of the imagination, while Plutarch in his writings, wherein 
much may be found on magic and dreams, gives an exhaustive account or the 
somnambulic states of the oracular priestess, Pythia, attributing them to
possession by the divinity.	K.N.


Greece Modern  Although superstition is rife in the Hellenic archipelago it 
partakes more of the nature of Slavonic tradition than that of the ancient 
inhabitants of the country, and is more or less petty and ill-defined. But 
the most notable circumstance in modern Greek superstition is that which 
relates to Vampirism. The Vampire is called Broucolack by the modern 
Hellenes, and appears to date from medieval times.  Says Calmet, " It is 
asserted by the modern Greeks, in defence of their schism, and as a proof 
that the gift of miracles, and the episcopal power of the keys, subsists in 
their church more visibly and evidently than in the church of Rome, that, 
with them, the bodies of excommunicated persons never rot, but swell up to 
an uncommon size, and are stretched like drums, nor ever corrupt or fall to 
dust, till they have received absolution from some bishop or priest. And 
they produce many instances of carcasses which have been in their graves 
uncorrupted, and which have afterwards putrefied as soon as the 
excommunication was taken off."
     "They do not, however, deny that a body's not corrupting is sometimes a 
proof of sanctity, but in this case they expect it to send forth an 
agreeable smell, to be white or ruddy, and not black, stinking, and swelled 
like a drum, as the bodies of excommunicated persons generally are. We are 
told, that in the time of Manuel, or Maximus, patriarch of Constantinople, 
the Turkish emperor having the mind to know the truth of the Greek notion 
concerning the incorruption of excommunicated bodies, the patriarch ordered 
the grave of a woman, who had lived in a criminal commerce with an 
archbishop of Constantinople, to be opened. Her body being found entire, 
black and much swelled, the Turks put it into a chest, under the emperor's 
seal, and the patriarch having repeated a prayer, and given absolution to 
the deceased, the chest was opened three days after and the body was found 
reduced to ashes.  It is also a notion which prevails among the Greeks, that 
the bodies of these excommunicated persons frequently appear to the living, 
both day and night, and speak to them, call upon them, and disturb them 
several other ways.
     "Leo Allatius is very particular upon this head, and says, that in the 
isle of Chio, the inhabitants never answer the first time they are called, 
for fear of its being a spectre but if they are called twice, they are sure 
it is not a Brouco-lack (this is the name they give these spirits). If any 
one appears at the first call, the spectre disappears, but the person 
certainly dies.
     "They have no way to get rid of these evil genii, but to dig up the 
body of the person that has appeared, and burn it after having repeated over 
it certain prayers.  By this means the body being reduced to ashes, appears 
no more. And they look upon it as a clear case, that either these 
mischievous and spiteful carcasses come Out of their graves of their own 
accord, and occasion the death of the persons that see or speak to them ; or 
that the devil himself makes use of these bodies to frighten and destroy 
mankind. They have hitherto discovered no remedy which more infallibly rids 
them of these plagues, than to burn or mangle the bodies which were made use 
of for these cursed purposes. Sometimes the end is answered by tearing out 
the heart and letting the bodies rot above ground before they burn them 
again, or by cutting off the head, or driving a large nail through the 
temples.
     Sir Paul Rycaut in his History of the Present State of the Greek 
Church, observes, that the opinion that, excommuni-cated bodies are 
preserved from putrefaction, prevails, generally, not only among the Greeks, 
but also among the Turks, and he gives us a fact which he had from a Caloyer 
of Candia, who confirmed it to him upon oath.  The caloyer's name was 
Sophronius, a man well known and respected in Smyrna.
     There died in the island of Milo, a man, who was excom-municated for a 
fault which he had committed in the Morea, and he was buried in a private 
place, without any ceremonies, and in unconsecrated ground. His relations 
and friends expressed great dissatisfaction at his being treated in this 
manner, and very soon after the inhabitants of the island were tormented 
every night by frightful apparitions, which they attributed to this unhappy 
man. Upon opening the grave his body was found entire, and his veins swelled 
with blood, and a consultation being held upon the subject, the caloyers 
dismembering his body, cutting it in pieces, and boiling it in wine, which, 
it seems, is the usual manner of proceeding there in those cases.
However, the friends of tile deceased prevailed upon them, by dint of 
entreaty, to delay the execution, and in the meantime sent to Constantinople 
to get absolution for him from the patriarch. Till the messenger could 
return the body was laid in the church and prayers and masses were said 
daily for the repose of his soul.  One day while Sophronius the caloyer 
above mentioned, was performing the service, there was heard on a sudden a 
great noise in the coffin, and upon examination the body was found reduced 
to ashes, as if it had been dead seven years. Partic-ular notice was taken 
of the time when the noise was heard, and it was found to be the very 
morning when the absolu-tion was signed by the patriarch.  Sir Paul Rycaut, 
who has recorded this event, was neither a Greek nor Roman Catholic, but a 
staunch Protestant of the Church of England
     He observes upon this occasion, that the notion among the Greeks is, 
that an evil spirit enters into the excommuni-cated carcass and preserves it 
from corruption by perform-ing the usual functions of the human soul in a 
living body. They fancy, moreover, that these corpses eat by night, and 
actually digest and are nourished by their food; that several have been 
found of a fresh, ruddy colour, with their veins ready to burst With blood, 
full forty days after their death, and that upon being opened there has 
issued from them as large a quantity of warm fresh blood as would come from 
a young person of the most sanguine constitu-tion. And this opinion prevails 
so universally, that every one is furnished with a story to this purpose.  
Father Theophilus Raynard, author of a particular treatise upon this 
subject, asserts that this coming again of deceased persons is an undoubted 
truth, and supported by unquest-ionable facts.  But to pretend that these 
spectres are always excommunicated persons, and that the schismatical Church 
of Greece has a privilege of preserving from putre-faction the bodies of 
those that die under her sentence, is what cannot be maintained, since it is 
certain that excom-municated bodies rot as well as others, and that several 
who have died in the communion of the church. Greek as well as Roman, have 
continued uncorrupted. There have even been instances of this nature among 
the heathens, and frequently among other animals, whose carcasses have been 
found unputrefied in the ground, and among the ruins of old buildings.

     M. De Tournefort has given, in his travels, an account of the digging 
up an imaginary Broucolack in the island of Mycone, where he was on the 1st 
of January, 1701.  His words are as follow :-" We were present at a very 
differ-ent scene in the same island, upon occasion of one of those dead 
corpses. which they suppose to come to life again after their burial. The 
man, whose story I am going to relate, was a peasant in Mycone, naturally 
ill-natured and quarrelsome (a circumstance of consequence in such cases); 
he was murdered in the fields, nobody knew how, or by whom.
     "Two days after his being buried in a chapel in the town it was noised 
about that he was seen in the night walking about in a great hurry; that he 
came into houses and tumbled about their goods,' griped people behind, and 
played a thousand little monkey tricks. At first it was only laughed at, but 
it soon grew to be a very serious affair when the better sort of people 
joined in the com-plaint. The Papas themselves gave credit to it, and no 
doubt had their reasons for so doing. Masses, to be sure, we said, but the 
peasant was incorrigible, and continued his old trade. After several 
meetings of the chief people of the town, and of the priests and monks, it 
was concluded to be necessary, in obedience to some old ceremonial, to Wait 
till nine days after the burial.
     "On the tenth day, a mass was said in the chapel where the body lay, in 
order to drive out the devil, which was imagined to have taken possession of 
it. When the mass was over the body was taken up, and preparations were made 
for pulling out its heart. The butcher of the town, an old clumsy fellow, 
began with opening the belly instead of the breast. He groped a long while 
among the entrails without finding what he looked for, till at 'last 
somebody said he should cut up the diaphragm, and then the heart was pulled 
out, to the admiration of the spectators. In the meantime the carcass stunk 
so abominably that they were obliged to burn frankincense but the smoke 
mixing with the fumes of the corpse. increased the stink and began to heat 
the poor people's brains. Their imagination, already affected with the 
spectacle before them, grew full of whimsies, and they took it into their 
heads that a thick smoke came from the body; nor durst we say that it was 
only the smoke of the incense.
     “In the chapel and the square before it they were incessantly bawling 
out Broucolack, which is the name they give to these pretended redivivi. 
From hence the bellowing was communicated to the streets and seemed to be 
invented on purpose to split the roof of the chapel. Several there present 
averred that the blood of the offender was red, and the butcher swore that 
the body Was still warm, whence they concluded that the deceased was guilty 
of a heavy crime for not being thoroughly dead, or rather for suffering 
himself to be re-animated by the devil, which is the notion they have of a 
Broucolack. They then roared out that Word in a stupendous manner. Just at 
this time there came in a flock of people. who loudly protested that they 
plainly saw the body was not grown stiff When it Was carried from the fields 
to the church to be buried, and that consequently it was a true Brouco-lack, 
Which word continued to be the burden of the song.
     “I question not but they would have sworn it did not stink if we hid 
not been there so thoroughly were their heads turned upon this occasion, and 
so strongly were they infatuated with the notion of these spectres.  As for 
us, we got as close to the body as we could, that we might observe what 
passed more exactly, and were almost poisoned with the stink  When they 
asked us what we thought of the corpse we told them we believed it to be 
completely dead, and having a mind to cure, or, at least, not to exas-perate 
their prejudices, we presented to them that it was no wonder the butcher 
should feel some warmth, by groping in the entrails, which were then 
putrefying, that it Was no extraordinary thing for it to emit fumes since 
the same will happen upon turning up a dunghill, and that as for the 
pretended redness of the blood, it was still visible by the butcher's hands, 
that it was a mere stinking nasty smear.
     “After all our reasoning they resolved upon going to the sea-shore, and 
there burning the dead man's heart. But, notwithstanding this execution, he 
did not grow more peaceable, but made more noise than ever.  He was accused 
of beating people in the night, breaking down doors, and even roofs of 
houses, shattering windows, tearing clothes, and emptying casks and bottles.  
It was a ghost of a very thrifty constitution, nor do 1 believe that he 
spared any house but the consul's, where we lodged.  In the meantime nothing 
could be more deplorable than the condition of this island. Not a head in it 
but was turned the wisest among them were seized like the rest.  In short, 
it was a real disorder of the brain, as dangerous as lunacy or madness. 
Whole families quitted their houses, and brought their beds from the 
remotest parts of the town into the great square, there to spend the night.  
Every one complained of some fresh insult, and nothing could be heard but 
groans at the approach of night.  The most sensible people among them 
thought proper to retire into the country.
     “When the prepossesion was so general, we thought it our best way to 
hold our tongues.  Had we opposed it we should have been treated not only as 
fools, but as infidels. Indeed, how was it possible to bring a whole nation 
to its senses ?  Those who believed in their hearts that we doubted the 
truth of the fact, came and reproached us with our incredulity, and 
endeavoured to prove that there were such things as Broucolacks, by 
quotations out of the Buckler of Faith, written by father Richard, a Jesuit 
missionary. Their argument was this: He was a Latin, and therefore you ought 
to believe him, nor should we have got anything by denying the consequence.  
We were entertained every morning with a recital- of the new pranks of this 
night-bird, who was even charged with being guilty of the most abominable 
sins.
     “Some of the citizens, who were most zealous for the public good, took 
it into their heads that there had been a defect in the most essential part 
of the ceremony.  They were of opinion that mass ought not to have been 
said, till after the heart had been pulled out.  With this precaution they 
insisted that the devil must needs have been worsted, and would not have 
ventured to come again; whereas, by mass being said first, he had time 
enough given him to make off, and return to his post when the danger was 
over.
     “After all these wise reflections, they were as much perplexed as at 
first setting Out.  They meet night and morning, debate, and make 
processions for three days and three nights. The Papas are obliged to fast, 
and run from house to house with sprinklers on their hands.  Holy water is 
plentifully scattered about, even to the washing of the doors, and filling 
the mouth of the poor Broucolack.
     “We repeated it so often to the magistrates, that we should not fail in 
Christendom to appoint a watch by night upon such an occasion, in order to 
observe what passed in the town, that at last they apprehended some 
vagabonds who had certainly a hand in these disorders; but either they were 
not the principal agents, or they were dismissed too soon.  For two days 
after, to make them-selves amends for the fast they had kept in prison, they 
begun to empty the wine casks of such as had been silly enough to leave 
their houses in the night, so that nothing was left but to have recourse 
again to prayers.
     “One day, as they were repeating a certain form, after having stuck a 
number of naked swords in the grave where the carcass lay (which they dug up 
three or four times a day to gratify the whim of whoever came by), an 
Albanian, who happened to be at Mycone, took upon him to pro-nounce with an 
air of great wisdom, that it was ridiculous to make use of the swords of 
Christians in such a case as this.   Ate you so blind," says he,  as not to 
see that the hilt of these swords, being made in the form of a cross, 
hinders the devil from coming out of the carcass ?  I am surprised that you 
do not take the Turkish sabres."  But the expedient of this wise personage 
had no effect : the Broucolack was still unruly; the whole island continued 
in a strange consternation, and they were utterly at a loss what saint to 
invoke, when all of a sudden, as if they had given one another the word, 
they begun to bawl all over the city that they had waited too long, that the 
Broucolack should be burned to ashes, and then they defied the devil to 
harbour there any longer, and that it was better to have recourse to this 
extremity, than to have the island totally deserted.  For, in fact, several 
whole families had begun to pack up in order to retire to Syra or Tinos.
     “The magistrates, therefore, gave orders to carry the Broucolack to the 
point of St. George's Island, where they got ready a great pile, with pitch 
and tar, for fear the wood should not burn fast enough of itself. The 
remnant of this miserable carcass was thrown into it and soon consumed. It 
was the 1st of January, 1701, and we saw the flame as we returned from 
Delos.  It might properly be called a rejoicing bonfire, as no more 
complaints were heard of the Broucolack. They only said that the devil had 
at last met with his match, and some ballads were made to turn him into 
ridicule.
     “It is a notion which prevails all over the Archipelago that the devil 
re-animates no carcasses but those of the Greek communion. The inhabitants 
of Santorini are terribly afraid of these bug-bears : those of Mycone, after 
their whims Were dissipated, Were equally afraid of a prose-cution from the 
Turks, and from the bishop of Tinos. Not a single Papas would venture to be 
at St. George's when the body was burnt, for fear the bishop should insist 
upon a fee for their taking up and burning a body without his leave.  As for 
the Turks, they did not fail, at their next visit, to make the Myconians pay 
heavily for their treatment of this poor devil, who became in every respect 
an object of abomination and horror to all the country."

Gregory, Mrs. Makdougail : (See British National Association of 
Spiritualists.)


Gregory the Seventh : A pope of the eleventh century. against whom a charge 
of necromancy was brought.  He is chiefly notable for his bitter and 
prolonged struggle with Henry IV., Emperor of Germany. A quarrel arose 
between them regarding the gift by Henry of ecclesiastical dignities, to 
account for which he was summoned before Gregory. He refused to appear, was 
excommunicated, and, in return, had the pope kidnapped by brigands.  
Gregory, however, was rescued by the people of Rome, and on his release 
commanded the Germans to elect a new emperor, Rudolph, duke of Suabia.  
Henry, attended by a very small retinue, thereupon repaired to Canossa, 
where Gregory at that time resided, to arrange for terms of peace. He was 
there treated with such severity and studied neglect that his desire to come 
to terms with the pope left him, and on his return he elected an anti-pope, 
Clement III. In the struggle which ensued Henry defeated Rudolph in battle 
and Gregory was sentenced as a sorcerer. He died in exile at Salerno.
     As a magician he is not very conspicuous, for his fame rests chiefly on 
a prophecy he made publicly that Rudolph would be victorious, and that  
before St. Peter's day," on the fulfillment of which saying he staked his 
papal crown.  The unfortunate Rudolph, entirely trusting to Gregory's 
oracular utterance, renewed the battle six times and finally perished 
without having obtained the promised victory.  Other stories credit Gregory 
with the power of making lightning with a motion of his hand, and causing 
thunder to dart from his sleeve.  It is related by Benno that on one 
occasion he left his magical book behind him at his villa. 'Entrusting two 
of his servants with the task of returning for it, he warned them not to 
look into it on pain of the most awful punishment.  However, curiosity over-
came the fears of one of them, and, opening the book he pronounced some 
words.  Immediately a band of imps appeared and asked what was their 
command. The terrified servants begged that the demons would cast down so 
much of the city wall as lay in their way. and thus they escaped the penalty 
of their disobedience.
     Of a lofty and severe cast of mind, Gregory's motive was not so much 
fraud as profound enthusiasm and strength of purpose, which sustained him 
through the struggle with Henry to the end of his life.


Grihestha  (See India.)


Grimoire  A text-book of Black Magic.  The three best known grimoires are 
the Grimorium Verum, the Grand Grimoire, and the Grimoire of Pope Honorius.  
Black magic (q.v.) is of course an ignorant and superstitious perversion of 
the true science, and the grimoires well illustrate this-their most 
noticeable feature being their utter futility.  The grimoires, in fact, 
cannot be taken seriously, and the diabolic practices contained in their 
pages are more absurd than fearsome.  Before entering upon them, the rites 
of the church are practised as a pre-liminary and fasting is observed.  The 
great object of the grimoires is to invoke the infernal powers, and at the 
same time to trick them.  The fiends are treated as imbeciles. In the 
grimoire, the magician is instructed how, when selling them his soul, he may 
deceive them by a play upon words.  One of the chief desires of the sorcerer 
of the middle ages was to discover hidden treasure by means of Satanic 
agency, and having found it to devote himself to good deeds and the 
distribution of his wealth among the poor.
     Abstinence from every species of impurity is strongly insisted upon for 
the space of an entire quarter of the moon, and the sorcerer most solemnly 
promises the grand Adonai (q.v.), the Master of all Spirits, that he shall 
not eat more than two meals per diem, and that these shall be prefaced by 
prayer.  The operator must change his apparel as seldom as possible, and 
sleep only on occasion, meditating continually on his undertaking. and 
centering all his hopes in the infinite goodness of Adonai, who is 
undoubtedly the supreme deity, and not as might be thought a master-fiend.  
But the grimoires teem with mystifications, and it is frequently difficult 
to discern their real meaning.  In the three grimoires alluded to, the 
infernal hierarchy is described at length-(See Demonology)  but the 
principal contents of these works are evocations and spells for the gaining 
over of the diabolical powers to the purposes of the sorcerer. That they 
were employed by veritable professors of the art of black magic is rather 
unlikely, as the real black magician had very much higher aims than the mere 
unearthing of buried treasure, and it is most probable that they were for 
the most part in use among amateurs of the art, who dabbled in it merely in 
the hope of enriching themselves.


Grimoire of Honorius, The  A magical work published at Rome in 1629, and 
not, as is generally thought, connected in any way with Kabbalistic magic. 
The work is indeed permeated with Christian ideas.  It is extremely unlikely 
that it is the work of the Roman Bishop known as Honorius. The work has been 
called "a malicious and somewhat clever imposture," since it pretends to 
convey the sanction of the Papal Chair to the operators of necromancy.  It 
deals with the evocation of the rebellious angels.


Grimorium Verum, The  This magical text-book was first published in 1517, 
and purported to be translated from the Hebrew.  it is based to some extent 
upon the Key of Solomon (q.v.). and is quite honest in its statement that it 
proposes to invoke ' devils," which it refers to the four elements, so that 
these would appear to be of the type of elementary spirits (q.v.).  A part 
of the account it gives regarding the hierarchy of spirits is taken from the 
Lemegeton (q.v.).  The work is divided into three portions: the first 
describing the characters and seals of the demons, with the forms of their 
evocation and dismissal; the second gives a description of the supernatural 
secrets which can be learned by the power of the demons; and the third is 
the key of the work and its proper application.  But these divisions only 
outline what it purports to place before the reader as the whole work is a 
mass of confusion.  The plates which supply the characters do not apply to 
the text  The book really consists of two parts-the Grimorium Verum itself 
and a second portion, which consists of magical secrets.  The first supplies 
directions for the preparation of the magician based on those of the 
Clavicle of Solomon  Instructions for the manufacture of magical 
instrument,, and the composition of a parchment on which the characters and 
seals are to be inscribed, as well as the processes of evocation and 
dismissal.  The second part contains the  ' admirable secrets "  of the 
pretended Albertus Magnus, the ' Petit Albert" and so forth. The work is 
only partially diabolical in character, and some of its processes might 
claim to be classed as White Magic.


Grossetete, Robert : Bishop of Lincoln from  1235,  and generally known as 
Robert of Lincoln. Among his many accomplishments he is said to have 
numbered some pro-ficiency in the art of magic.  Born of poor parents, he 
was early compelled to earn his own living, and even at times to beg for 
bread.  He was at length ' discovered " by the Mayor of Lincoln, who was 
attracted by his appear-ance and the shrewdness of his remarks, and had him 
Sent to school, where his remarkable capacity for study so helped his 
advancement that he was enabled to com-plete his education at Oxford, 
Cambridge, and Paris.  The illustrious Roger Bacon characterised him and his 
friend, Friar Adam do Marisco, as the most learned men of their time.  He 
was well skilled in the sciences of mathematics and astronomy, and a master 
of Greek and Hebrew.  As a member of the clergy he distinguished himself 
chiefly by his vigorous denunciation of the abuses in the court of Rome, and 
particularly of the pope, Innocent IV., whose rule added but little lustre 
to the church.  Grossetete did not hesitate to point out the misdeeds of the 
ecclesiastical dignitaries, many of whom had never even visited their 
various sees.  And he openly pronounced Innocent to be the Antichrist.
     His essays in necromancy include (Gower tells us) the making of a 
brazen head, which would answer questions and foretell the future.  However, 
this would appear to be no unique accomplishment, as both Pope Silvester 
II., and Roger Bacon are credited with it


Gruagach  That is "long haired one  from the Gaelic gruag, a wig: a faery 
being with protective duties, to be met with in Scottish legends and which 
apparently may be of either sex.  The Gruagach appears to have  been 
particu-larly associated with cattle, and milk was laid aside for him every 
evening -  otherwise no milk  would be got at next milking.  Usually this 
being was of a beneficent nature although occasionally it showed mis-
chievous traits by loosing the cattle in the byres so that the herds had to 
get up, sometimes several times during a night, to tie them up : this 
apparently caused the Grua-gach much delight.  There are many tales in 
different parts of Scotland about the Gruagach, from which one gathers that 
this fairy commonly had long hair and was well dressed, of whichever sex it 
might happen to be.  (See Scotland).


Gualdi : Dr. Campbel, in his well-known work Hermippus Redivivus or the 
Sage's  Triumph  over old  age and the grave relates that this  person was 
probably a Rosicrucian who lived for several hundreds of years. The 
particulars concerning him are as follows, but they cannot he verified, and 
are regarded by Godwin as apocryphal: - He sojourned at Venice for several 
months, and was known by the name of the  “Sober Signior" among the common 
people, on account of the regularity of his life, the com-posed simplicity 
of his manners and the quietness of his costume : for he always wore dark 
clothes, and these of a plain, unpretending style. Three things were 
remarked of him during his stay at Venice. The first was that he had a small 
collection of fine pictures, which her  readily showed to everybody that 
desired it : the next, that he was per-fectly versed in all arts and 
sciences, and spoke always with such minute particularity  as astonished 
nay, silenced-all who heard him, because he seemed to have been present at 
the things which he related, making the must unexpected corrections in small 
facts sometimes. And it was, in the third place, observed that he never 
wrote or received any letter, never desired any credit, but always paid for 
everything in ready money, and made no use of bankers, bills of exchange, or 
letters of credit.  However, he always seemed to have enough, and he lived 
respectably, though with no attempt at splendour or show.
     Signor Gualdi met, shortly after his arrival at Venice, one day, at the 
coffee-house which he was in the habit of frequenting, a Venetian nobleman 
of sociable manners, who was very fend of art, and this pair used to engage 
in sundry discussions, and they had many conversations concerning the 
various objects and pursuits which were interesting to both of them.  
Acquaintance ripened into friendly esteem, and the nobleman invited Signor 
Gualdi to his private house, whereat-for he was a widower-Signor Gualdi 
first met the nobleman's daughter, a very beautiful young maiden of 
eighteen, of much intelligence, and of great accomplishments. The nobleman's 
daughter was just introduced at her father's house from a convent, or 
pension, where she had been educated by the nuns. This young lady, in short, 
from constantly being in his society, and listening to his narratives, 
gradually fell in love with the mysterious stranger, much for the reasons of 
Desde-mona; though Signor Gualdi was no swarthy Moor, but only
a well-educated gentleman-a thinker rather than a doer. At times, indeed, 
his countenance seemed to grow splendid in expression, and he boasted 
certainly wondrous dis-course, and a strange and weird fascination would 
grow up about him, as it were, when he became more than usually pleased and 
animated. Altogether, when you were set thinking about him, he seemed a 
puzzling person, and of rare gifts, though when mixing with the crowd you 
would scarcely distinguish him from the crowd; nor would you observe him 
unless there was something akin to him in you excited by his talk.
     The Venetian nobleman was now on a footing of sufficient intimacy with 
Signor Gualdi to say to him one evening, at his own house, that he 
understood that he had a fine collection of pictures, and that, if 
agreeable, he would pay him a visit one day for the purpose of viewing them. 
The nobleman's daughter, who was present, and who was pensively looking down 
upon the table thinking deeply of something that the Signor had just said, 
raised her eyes eagerly at this expression of wish by her father, and, as 
accorded with her feelings, the appeared, though she spoke not, to be 
desirous to make one of the party to see the pictures. It was natural that 
she should secretly rejoice at this opportunity of becoming more intimately 
acquainted with the domestic life of one whom she had grown to regard with 
feelings of powerful interest. She felt that the mere fact of being his 
guest, and under the roof which was his, would seem to bring her nearer to 
him, and, as common with lovers, It seemed that their being thus together 
would, in feeling at least, appear to identify both. Signor Gualdi was very 
polite, and readily invited the nobleman to his house, and also extended the 
invitation to the young lady, should she feel disposed to accompany her 
father, since he divined from the expression of her face that she was 
wishful to that effect. The day for the visit was then named, and the Signor 
took his departure with the expression of friendship on all sides which 
usually ended their meetings
     It followed from this arrangement, that on the day appointed, the 
father and daughter went to Signor Gualdi's house.  They were received by 
the Signor with warm kindness, and were shown over his rooms with every mark 
of friendliness and distinction  The nobleman viewed Signor Gualdi's 
pictures with great attention, and when he had completed his tour he 
expressed his satisfaction by telling the Signor that he had never seen a 
finer collection, considering the number of pictures. They were now in 
Signor Gualdi's own chamber-the last of his set of rooms,-and they were just 
on the point of turning to go out, and Gualdi was removing the tapestry from 
before the door to widen the egress, when the nobleman, who had paused to 
allow him thus to clear the way, by chance cast his eyes upwards over the 
door, where there hung a picture evidently of the stranger himself. The 
Venetian looked upon it with doubt, and after a while his face fell; but it 
was soon cleared, as if with relief. The gaze of the daughter was also 
riveted upon the picture, which was very like Gualdi but she regarded it 
with a blush. The Venetian looked from the picture to Gualdi, and back again 
from Gualdi to the picture.  It was some time before he spoke.
     “That picture was intended for you, sir," said he at last, hesitating, 
to Signor Gualdi. A slight cold change passed over the eyes of the stranger; 
but he only made reply by a low bow.   You look a moderately young man, -to 
be candid with you, sir, I should say about forty-five, or thereabouts-and 
yet I know, by certain means of which I will not now further speak, that 
this picture is by the hand of Titian who has been dead nearly a couple of 
hundred years.  How is this possible?" he added, with a polite, grave smile.  
' It is not easy," said Signor Gualdi quietly, " to know all things that are 
possible, for very frequent mistakes are made concerning such  but there is 
certainly nothing strange in my being like a picture painted by Titian."  
The nobleman easily perceived by his manner, and by a momentary cloud upon 
his brow, that the stranger felt offence.  The daughter clung to her 
father's arm, secretly afraid that this little unexpected demur might pass 
into coolness, and end with a consummation of estrange-ment, which she 
feared excessively  she dreaded the rupture of their intimacy with the 
stranger; and, con-tradictory as it may seem, she wanted to withdraw, even 
without the point she dreaded being cleared up into renewed pleasant 
confidence. However, this little temporary mis-understanding was soon put to 
an end by Signor Gualdi himself, who, in a moment or two, resumed his 
ordinary manner, and he saw the father and daughter down-stairs, and forth 
to the entrance of his house, with his usual com-posed politeness - though 
the nobleman could not help some feeling of restraint, and his daughter 
experienced a considerable amount of mortification; and she could not look 
at Signor Gualdi-, rather, when she did, she looked too much.
     This little occurence remained in the mind of the noble-man.  His 
daughter felt body and dissatisfied afterwards, eager for the restoration of 
the same friendly feeling with Signor Gualdi, and revolving in her mind 
numberless schemes to achieve it.  The Venetian betook himself in the 
evening to the usual coffee-house, and he could not forbear speaking of the 
incident among the group of people collected there.  Their curiosity was 
roused, and one or two resolved to satisfy themselves by looking at the 
picture attentively the next morning.  But to obtain an opportunity to see 
the picture on this next morning, it was necessary to see the Signor Gualdi 
somewhere, and to have his invitation to his lodgings for the purpose. The 
only likely place to meet with him was at the coffee-house; and thither the 
gentlemen went at the usual time, hoping, as it was the Signor's habit to 
present himself, that he would do so. But he did not come-nor had he been 
heard of from the time of the visit of the nobleman the day before to the 
Signor's house-which absence, for a first time almost that he had been in 
Venice, surprised everybody. But as they did not meet with him at the 
coffee-house they thought was sure-one of the persons who had the oftenest 
con-versed with the Signor, and therefore was the freer in his acquaintance, 
undertook to go to his lodgings and inquire after him, which he did; but he 
was answered by the owner of the house, who came to the street-door to 
respond to the questioner, that the Signor had gone, having quitted Venice 
that morning early, and that he had locked up his pictures with certain 
orders, and had taken the key of his rooms with him.
     This affair made a great noise at the time in Venice, and an account of 
it found its way into most of the newspapers of the year in which it 
occurred.  In these newspapers, and elsewhere, an outline of the foregoing 
particulars may be seen. The, account of the Signor Gualdi will also be met 
with in Les Memoires historiques for the year 1687.


Guecubu : Among the Araucanians, a people of Chili, the Guecubu are evil 
spirits, who do all in their power to thwart and annoy the Great spirit, 
Togin, and his ministers.


Guillaume de Carpentras  An astrologer who made for King Rene of Sicily, and 
for the Duke of Milan, astrological spheres, from which horoscopes were 
drawn.  He made for Charles VIII. of France one which cost twelve hundred 
crowns. This sphere contained many utilities, and was so contrived that all 
the movements of the planets, at any hour of the day and night, were to be 
found there.


Guillaume de Paris : He is said by the demonologists to have made speaking 
statues, like those made by Roger Bacon- a thing which could  only be done 
by diabolical agency.


Guinefort  A strange story has been left on record by Father Etienne 
Bourbon, a Dominican, who died in 1262. He relates that while he was 
preaching in the diocese of Lyons, many women came to him confessing that 
they had taken their children to St. Guinefort. Curious to know what sort of 
saint it might be whose cult called for confession, Father Bourbon enquired 
into the matter, and found that Guinefort was a dog!  It was, in fact, that 
dog which had given rise to the well-known fable of the dog and the serpent, 
wherein a dog is killed under the unjust suspicion that it has slain a 
child, which in reality it has saved from the attack of a serpent. This dog-
martyr it was to whose "shrine" the women brought their children.
     A similar story is told of a dog named Ganelon, whose tomb was in 
Auvergne, in the neighbourhood of a fountain. The adventure took place 
during the reign of Louis Le Debonnaire. Two or three centuries later it was 
found that the waters of the fountain possessed medicinal virtues, but cures 
were attributed to the unknown occupant of the tomb-that is, until a certain 
bishop found among the archives of the Chateau the anecdote of Ganelon.


Guldenstubbe, Baron de : A famous mystic, who was one of the first in France 
to recognise the importance of spiritual-istic phenomena.  With the Comte 
d'Ourches, he held many experiments in table-turning, automatic writing, and 
so forth, and published a work entitled Practical Experimental Pneumatology 
or The Reality of Spirits and the Marvellous Phenomenon of their Direct 
Writing.  (See article France and Circles.)


Guppy, Mrs.: Nee Miss Nichol, a celebrated English medium Who began to 
exercise her powers about 1866.  At that time she lived with Mrs. Sim, a 
sister of Dr. Alfred Russel Wallace, who was a frequent witness of her 
phenomena. Thereafter her mediumistic powers developed apace and the circle 
of her sitters grew as the manifestations became more ambitious.  Raps were 
beard and apports of fruit and flowers conveyed to the seance-room.  A. R. 
Wallace states that on one occasion "the room and the table shook 
violently," and Miss Nichol herself was several times levitated-(See 
Levitation). Soon after the formal com-mencement of her mediumship she 
married Mr. Samuel Guppy.  In January, 1872 she gave a materialisation 
seance, the first serious attempt of the kind in this country. She and her 
husband were also instrumental in intro-ducing spirit-photography (q.v.) 
into England. On the death of Mr. Guppy she was married a second time to Mr. 
W. Volckman.


Guppy, Samuel : (See Spiritualism.)


Gurney, Edmund : A distinguished psychologist and student of psychic 
science.  He was born at Horsham in 1847, and educated at Blackheath and 
Trinity College, Cambridge, where he obtained a fellowship.  He devoted 
himself thereafter to the study of medicine and passed the second M.B. 
Cambridge examination in 1880. . Thus equipped, he turned to the 
investigation of psychical research, seeking, in common with most psychical 
researchers, to find evidence for the survival of consciousness and 
personality after death.  He chose for exploration the region of unconscious 
or subconscious activity-what Mr. Myers, himself a worker in the same field, 
has designated the "subliminal con-sciousness."  From 1874 to 1878 Gurney 
and Myers worked with professional mediums, getting but poor results, but on 
the founding of the Society for Psychical Research experiments of a more 
scientific nature were made. These resulted in two volumes of Phantasms of 
the Living, by Messrs. Myers, Podmore, and Gurney, which went some way 
towards establishing telepathy on a sound basis. To the same end were 
directed Mr. Gurney's careful hypnotic experiments between 1885 and 1888, 
and his contributions to the Proceedings of the S.P.R. He was, indeed, an 
ideal student of psychic research, acute, patient, exact, logical, and 
entirely disinterested.  Besides his psychological works he wrote The Power 
of Sound (1880), an essay on music, and a collection of essays entitled 
Tertium Quid (1887). He died in June, 1888, from an overdose of narcotic 
medi-cine.


Gustenhover : A goldsmith who resided at Strasburg in 1603.  In a period of 
much danger he gave shelter to one M. Hirschborgen who is described as good 
and religions. In return for the hospitality of his host he gave him some 
powder of projection and departed on his journey.
     Gustenhover indiscreetly made transmutation before many people, which 
in due course reached the ears of Rudolph II. himself, an amateur alchemist.  
He forthwith ordered the Strasburg magistrates to send the goldsmith to him.  
He was accordingly arrested and guarded with the greatest vigilance.  On 
learning that he was to be sent to the Emperor at Prague he disclosed the 
whole business and requesting the magistrates to meet together asked them to 
procure a crucet and charcoal, and without his coming near them to melt some 
lead.  On the metal being molten he then gave them a small quantity of a 
reddish powder on which being thrown into the crucet produced a considerable 
amount of pure gold.
     On being brought into the presence of the Emperor he con-fessed that he 
had not himself prepared the magical powder and was wholly ignorant of the 
nature of its composition.
This the Emperor refused to believe in spite of the repeated protestations 
of the goldsmith.  The powder being at length exhausted, Gustenhover was set 
to the now impossible task of making more gold.  He sought refuge from the 
fury of the Emperor by an alchemical blasphemy accursed by all sons of the 
doctrine.  Convinced that the alche-mist was concealing his secret, the 
Emperor had him im-prisoned for the rest of his life.
     It is believed that Hirschborgen who presented Gusten-hover with the 
powder was no other than Alexander Sethon (q.v.), who at that period was 
travelling Germany in various disguises.

Guyon, Madame (1648-1717): Jeanne Marie Bouvieres de la Mothe, a celebrated 
mystic and quietest who suffered much persecution at the hands of tile 
Church of Rome. She was born at Montargis on April 13th, 1648, and early 
showed a passion for martyrdom and religious exercises. As she grew older 
vanity took the place of devotion, for she was both witty and beautiful. At 
the age of sixteen She was forced into a marriage with the wealthy M. Guyon, 
more than twenty years her senior, in whose household she was exposed to 
insult and cruelty.  Broken in spirit she turned once more to religion, and 
consulted a Franciscan, who advised her to seek God in her heart rather than 
in outward observances.  From that time she became a mystic, aiming at the 
suppression of all human hopes and fears, and desires, and the attainment of 
a completely disinterested love of God.  She embraced every form of 
suffering, physical and mental, and even eschewed spiritual joys.  In 1680 
M. Guyon died, and his widow was released from bondage.  Henceforth she 
embraced the doctrine of quietism.  In losing the gifts," she said,  she had 
found the Giver, and had reached an ideal state of resignation and self-
suppression." She went to Paris, expounded her theories with earnestness and 
charm, and gathered an Illustrious circle about her.  Here also she made 
friends with Fenelon. But the persecutions of the Church increased. She 
herself requested that a commission be appointed to examine her doctrine and 
writings. Three commissioners were chosen, among them Bossuet, the champion 
of the Church, her erstwhile friend and now her bitter enemy. Her writings 
were condemned, and she herself incarcerated at Vincennes.  For four years 
she lay in the dungeons of the Bastile, while Bossuet used every means to 
calumniate her name and doctrine.  In 1702, her health broken, she was 
released and sent to Blois where she died in 1707.  Her last years were 
blessed with peace and resignation, and such a submission to trials as she 
had ever shown.

Gwion Bach : In Welsh romance and myth, son of Gwreang. Set by Ceridwin to 
stir the magic cauldron of science and inspiration intended to be drunk by 
her son, Gwion tasted the liquid and became gifted with supernatural sight. 
He fled, pursued by Ceridwin, and the pair were changed 'successively into a 
hare and a greyhound, a fish and an otter, a bird and a hawk, a grabs of 
wheat and a black hen, which ultimately swallowed the wheat.  (Compare the 
metamorphose of Ceridwin and Gwion Bach with that of the Queen of Beauty and 
the Djinn in the Arabian Nights; Tale of the Second Calendar).  Later Gwion 
was placed in a bag and flung into the sea by Ceridwin.  He was drawn out by 
Elphin, son of Cwyddus, and was now called Taliesin (Radiant Brow).


Gypsies : The name Gypsy, an abbreviation of " Egyptian," has been used for 
centuries by English-speaking people to denote a member of a certain carte 
of turbulent wanderers who travelled Europe during the Middle Ages, and 
whose descendants, in a much-decayed condition. are still found in most 
European countries. Many other names, such as Saracen"  and " Zigeuner," or 
" Cigan." have been applied to these people, but " Egyptian" is the most; 
widespread in time and place.  It does not relate to Egypt, but to the 
country of" Little Egypt" or " Lesser Egypt," whose identity has never been 
clearly established. Two Transylvanian references of the years 1417 and 1418 
indicate that Palestine is the country in question, but there is some reason 
to believe that ' Little Egypt" included other regions in the Levant.  
Gypsies speak of themselves as Romane', and of their language as Romani-
tchib (tchib=tongue).  Physically, they are black-haired and brown-skinned, 
their appearance, like their language, suggesting affinities with Hindustan. 
But,  although possessing marked racial characteristics, for the most part, 
they must also be regarded as a caste or organization.  In recent centuries, 
if not in earlier times, many of their over-lords were not of Gypsy blood, 
but belonged to the nobility and petite noblesse of Europe, and were 
formally appointed by the kings and governments of their respective 
countries to rule over all the Gypsies resident within those countries. The 
title of baron, count, or regent of the Gypsies was no proof that the 
official so designated was of Gypsy race. This fact must always be borne in 
mind in any consideration of the Gypsy system.
     The rulers thus appointed. being empowered by Christian princes, and 
under Papal approval, were necessarily Christian. Moreover, their vassals 
were at least Christian by profession.  Although their behaviour was often 
wildly inconsistent with such a profession, it was in the character of 
Christian pilgrims that they asked and obtained hospital-ity from the cities 
and towns of Medieval Europe. On the other hand, they seem to have practised 
rites which could not be described as Christian. This twofold character is 
illustrated in connection with the services which they still hold in the 
crypt of the church of Les Saintes Maries de la Mer, in the Ile de la 
Camargue, Bouche-du-Rhone. In this church the Festival of the Holy Marys is 
annually celebrated on 25th May, and to it the Gypsies come in great 
numbers. The crypt is specially reserved for them, because it contains the 
shrine of Saint Sara of Egypt, whom they regard as their patron saint. 
Throughout the night of 24th-25th May they keep watch over her shrine, and 
on the 25th they take their departure. Among the Gypsy votive offerings 
presented in the crypt, some are believed to date back to about the 1450. 
All this would appear to indicate that the Gypsies were Christians. Another 
statement, however, tends to qualify such a conclusion. This is the 
assertion that the shrine of Saint Sara rests upon an ancient altar 
dedicated to Mithra;  that the Gypsies of that neighbourhood who are known 
as  “Calagues," are descended from the Iberians formerly inhabiting the 
Camargue  and that their cult is really the Mithraic worship of fire and 
water, upon which the veneration of Saint Sara is super-imposed.
     Confirmation of this view may be obtained from the worship of fire 
still existing among the Gypsies of Southern Hungary. The ceremonies 
observed at child-birth, in order to avert evil during the period between 
birth and baptism, may be taken as evidence.  Prior to the birth of the 
child, the Gypsies light a fire before the mother's tent, and this fire is 
not suffered to go out until the rite of baptism has been performed. The 
women who light and feed the fire croon, as they do so, the following chant:

Burn ye, burn ye fast, O Fire!
And guard the babe from wrathful ire
Of earthy Gnome and Water-Sprite,
Whom with thy dark smoke banish quite I
Kindly Fairies, hither fare,
And let the babe good fortune share,
Let luck attend him ever here,
Throughout his life be luck aye near!
Twigs and branches flow in store, 
And still of branches many more,
Give we to thy flame, O Fire !
Burn ye, burn ye, fast and high,
Hear the little baby cry !

     It will be noted that the spirits of the Earth and Water are here 
regarded as malevolent, and only to be overcome by the superior aid of fire. 
Nevertheless, those women who are believed to have learned their occult lore 
from the unseen powers of Earth and Water are held to be the greatest 
magicians of the tribe. Moreover, the water-being is not invariably regarded 
as inimical, but is some-times directly propititated.  As when a mother, to 
charm away convulsive crying in her child, goes through the prescribed 
Ceremonial in all its details, of which the last is this appeal, as she 
Casts a red thread into the stream
     "Take this thread, O Water-Spirit, and take with it the Crying of my 
child !  If it gets well, I will bring thee apples and eggs!"  The water-
spirit appears again in a friendly character when a man, in order to recover 
a stolen horse, takes his infant to a stream, and, bending over the water, 
asks the invisible genius to indicate, by means of the baby's hand, the 
direction in which the horse has been taken.  In these two instances we have 
a clear survival of the worship of water and the watery powers.  It may be 
questioned whether these rites ought to be ascribed to Mithraism in its 
later stages, or whether they own an earlier origin
     One definite Statement with regard to Gypsy lore is afforded by Joseph 
Glanvil, in a passage which inspired Matthew Arnold's poem of' “The Scholar-
Gypsy."  "There was lately a lad in the University of Oxford," says Glanvil 
(Vanity of Dogmatising, 1661),”who was, by his poverty, forced to leave his 
studies there, and at last to join himself to a company of vagabond 
Gypsies."  Glanvil goes on to say that" after he had been a pretty while 
exercised in the trade," this scholar-gypsy chanced to meet two of his 
former fellow-students, to whom he stated :-" that the people he went with 
were not such impostors as they were taken for, but that they had a 
traditional kind of learning among them, and could do wonders by the powers  
of imagination, their fancy binding that of others ; that himself had 
learned much of their art, and when he bad compassed the whole secret, he 
intended," he said, " to leave their company, and give the world an account 
of what he had learned."
     Here we have clear indications of the possession of a body of esoteric 
learning, which included the knowledge and exercise of hypnotism.  Even 
among modern Gypsies this power is exercised.  De Rochas states that the 
Catalan Gypsies are mesmerists and clairvoyants, and the present writer has 
experienced an attempt on the part of a South Hungarian Gypsy to exert this 
influence.  The same power, under the name of glamour, was formerly an 
attribute of the Scottish Gypsies.  Glamour is defined by Sir Walter Scott 
as " the power of imposing on the eyesight of the Spectators, so that the 
appearance of an object shall be totally different from the reality."  And, 
in explanation of a reference to "the Gypsies' glamour'd gang," in one of 
his ballads, he remarks :   Besides the prophetic powers ascribed to the 
Gypsies in most European countries, the Scottish peasants believe them 
possessed of the power of throwing upon bystanders a spell to fascinate 
their eyes and cause them to see the thing that is not.  Thus in the old 
ballad of' Johnnie Faa,' the elopement of the Countess of Cassillis with a 
Gypsy leader is imputed to fascination-

“Sae Soon as they saw her weel-faur'd face,
They cast the glamour o'er her.”

     Scott also relates an incident of a Gypsy who  exercised his glamour 
over a number of people at Haddington, to whom he exhibited a common dung-
hill cock, trailing, what appeared to the spectators, a massy oaken trunk. 
An old man passed with a cart of clover, he stopped and picked out a four-
leaved blade ; the eyes of the spectators were opened, and the oaken trunk 
appeared to be a bulrush." The quatrefoil, owing to its cruciform shape. 
acted as a powerful antidote to witchcraft.  Moreover, in the face of this 
Sign of the Cross, the Gypsy was bound to desist from the exercise of what 
was an unlawful art.  As to the possibility of hypnotizing a crowd, or 
making them "to see the thing that is not," that feat is achieved to-day by 
African witch-doctors.  What is required is a dominant will on the one hand 
and a sufficiently plastic imagination on the other. 
     Scott introduces these statements among his notes on the ballad of " 
Christie's Will," in relation to the verse-

“He thought the warlocks o' the rosy cross,
Had fang'd him in their nets sae fast;
Or that the Gypsies' glamour'd gang
Had lair'd his learning at the last"

     This association of Rosicrucians with Gypsies is not inapt, for 
hypnotism appears to have been considered a Rosicrucian art.  Scott has 
other Suggestive references in this place.  " Saxo Grammaticus mentions a 
particular sect of Mathematicians, as he is pleased to call them, who,  'per 
Summam ludificandorum oculorum peritiam, proprios alienosque vultus, varus 
rerum imaginibus, adumbraie callebant; illicibusque formis veros obscurare 
conspectus." Merlin, the son of Ambrose, was particularly skilled in this 
art, and displays it often in the old metrical romance of Arthour and 
Merlin. The jongleurs were also great pro-fessors of this mystery, which has 
in some degree descended, with their name, on the modern jugglers." (See 
also Scott's note 2M appended to The Lay the Last Minstrel.)
     It will be seen that various Societies are credited with the 
possession, in an eminent degree, of the art of hypno-tism, during the 
Middle Ages.  Presumably, it was inherited from one common source.  How much 
the Gypsies were associated with this power may be inferred from a Scottish 
Act of Parliament of the year 1579, which was directed against " the idle 
people calling themselves Egyptians, or any other that fancy themselves to 
have knowledge of prophecy, charming, or other abused sciences."  For the 
term charming," like "glamour" and other kindred words (e.g  “enchantment,"  
“bewitched,"  spellbound") bore reference to the mesmeric influence.
     The statement made by Glanvil's scholar-gypsy would lead one to believe 
that the Gypsies inhabiting England in the seventeenth century possessed 
other branches of learn-ing.  They have always been famed for their alleged 
pro-phetic power, exercised through the medium of astrology and chiromancy 
or palmistry, and also by the interpretation of dreams; this last-named 
phase being distinctly specified in Scotland in 1611+. It does not appear 
that any modern Gypsies profess a knowledge of astrology.  Nevertheless, it 
is interesting to note that Groome# was shown by a Welsh Gypsy-man the form 
of the written charm employed by his mother in her  fortune-telling, and 
that form is unquestion-ably a survival of the horoscope.  Both mother and 
son were obviously unaware of that fact, and made no pro-fession of 
astrology ; but they had inherited the scheme of the horoscope from 
ancestors who were astrologers.
     The practice of chiromancy is still a Gypsy art, as it has been for 
ages.  A curious belief was current in medieval times to the effect that the 
three Kings or Magi who came to Bethlehem were Gypsies, and in more than one 
religious play they are represented as telling the fortunes of the Holy 
Family by means of palmistry. This circumstance has evoked the following 
suggestive remarks from C. G. Leland.%
     “As for the connection of the Three Kings with Gypsies, it is plain 
enough.  Gypsies were from the East  Rome and the world abounded in 
wandering Chaldean magi--priests, and the researches which I am making have 
led me to a firm conclusion that the Gypsy lore of Hungary and South 
Slavonia has a very original character as being. firstly, though derived 
from India, not Aryan, but Shamanic, that is, of an Altaic, or Tartar, or' 
Turanian' stock. Secondly, this was the old Chaldean-Accadian ' wisdom' or 
sorcery.  Thirdly-and this deserves serious examin-ation-it was also the old 
Etruscan religion whose magic formulas were transmitted to the Romans      
     “The Venetian witchcraft, as set forth by Bernoni, is evidently of 
Sclavic-Greek origin.  That of the Romagna is Etruscan, agreeing very 
strangely and closely with the Chaldean magic of Lenormant, and marvellously 
like the Gypsies'.  It does not, when carefully sifted, seem to be like that 
of the Aryans…nor is it Semitic.  To what degree some idea of all this, and 
of Gypsy connection with it, penetrated among the people and filtered down, 
even into the Middle Ages, no one can say.  But it is very probable that 
through the centuries there came together some report of the common origin 
of Gypsy and ' Eastern' or Chaldean lore, for, since it was the same, there 
is no reason why a knowledge of the truth should not have been disseminated 
in a time of a traditions and earnest study in occultism."
     These surmises on the part of a keen and accomplished student of every 
phase of magic, written and unwritten, are deserving of the fullest 
consideration.  By following the line indicated by Leland it may be possible 
to reach an identification of the  ' traditional kind of learning" possessed 
by the Gypsies in the seventeenth century.          DAVID MACRITCHIE

Gyromancy : Was performed by going round continually in a circle, the 
circumference of which was marked by letters. The presage was drawn from the 
words formed by the letters on which the inquirers stumbled when they became 
too giddy to stand. The object of this circumcursation was simply to exclude 
the interference of the will, and reduce the selection of letters to mere 
chance.  In some species of enchantment, however, the act of turning round 
was to produce a prophetic delirium.  The religious dances, and the rotation 
of certain fanatics on one foot, with their arms stretched out, are of this 
nature. These cases really indicate a magical secret, of which, however, the 
deluded victims rarely possessed any knowledge.  In the phenome-non known as 
St. Vitus's Dance, and the movements of the convulsionaries, manifestations 
of spiritual intelligence were quite common.  The tendency of the spiritual 
force is to act spirally, rhythmically, whether in the use of lan-guage or 
of the bodily members.

Hallucination : A false perception of sensory vividness arising without the 
stimulus of a corresponding sense-impression. In this it differs from 
illusion, which is merely the misinter-pretation of an actual sense-
perception.  Visual and auditory hallucinations are the most common, and 
especially the former ; but hallucination of the other senses may also be 
experienced, though it is not so readily distinguishable. Human figures and 
voices roost frequently form the subject of a hallucination, but in certain 
types other classes of objects may be seen-as, for instance, the rats and 
insects of  delirium  tremens.  Though  hallucination is  often associated 
with various mental and physical diseases, it may, nevertheless occur 
spontaneously while the agent shows no departure from full vigour of body 
and mind, and may be induced-i.e., in hypnotism-in about 90 per cent. of all 
subjects.  The essential difference between sane and insane Hallucinations 
is that in the former case the agent can, by reflection, recognise the 
subjective nature of the impression, even when it has every appearance of 
objectiv-ity ; whereas in the latter case the patient cannot be made to 
understand that the vision is not real.
     Until comparatively recently hallucinatory percepts were regarded 
merely as intensified memory-images, but as the most intense of ordinary 
representations do not possess that sensory vividness which is yet a feature 
of the smallest sensation received from the external world, it follows that 
other conditions must be present besides the excitement of the brain-
elements which is the correlate of representation.  It is true that the seat 
of excitement is the same both in actual sense-perceptions and in memory 
images but in the former case the stimulas is peripherally originated in the 
sensory nerve, whereas in the latter it takes its rise in the brain itself. 
Now if any neural system becomes highly excited-a state which may be brought 
about by emotion, ill-health, drugs, or a number of causes-it may serve to 
divert from their proper paths any set of impulses arising from the sense 
organs, and as any impulse ascending through the sensory nerves produces an 
effect of sensory vividness - normally, a true perception-the impulse's thus 
diverted give to the memory images an appearance of actuality, not 
distinguishable from that produced by a corresponding sense-impression. In 
hypnosis a state of cerebal dissociation is induced, whereby any one neural 
system may be abnormally excited, and hallucination thus very readily 
engendered. Drugs which excite the brain also induce hallucinations.
     The question or whether there is any relation between the hallucination 
and the person it represents is, and has long been, a vexed one. Countless 
well-authenticated stories of apparitions coinciding with a death or some 
other crisis are on record, and would seem to establish some causal 
connection between them.  In former times apparitions 'were considered to be 
the  “doubles" or “ethereal bodies" of the originals, and modern 
spiritualists believe that they are the spirits of the dead-or, mayhap, of 
the living, temporarily forsaking the physical organism. But the main theory 
among those who believe in such a causal connection between agent and 
hallucination-and in view of the statistics collected by Professor Sidgwick 
and others (See " Psychic Research"), it is difficult not to believe-is that 
of telepathy, or thought-transference. That the cerebral machinery for the 
transmission of thought should be specially stimulated in moments of intense 
excitement, or at the approach of dissolution, is not to be wondered at; and 
thus it is sought to account for the appearance of hallucinatory images 
coinciding with death or other crises. Moreover, the dress and appearance of 
the apparition does not necessarily correspond with the actual dress and 
appearance of its original.  Thus a man at the point of death, in bed and 
wasted by disease, may appear to a friend as if in his ordinary health, and 
wearing his ordinary garb. Nevertheless there are notable instances where 
some remarkable detail of dress is reproduced in the apparition.  It seems 
clear, however, that it is the agent's general personality which is, as a 
rule, conveyed to the percipient, and not, except in special cases, the 
actual matter of his surface-consciousness.
     A similar explanation has been offered for the hallucina-tory images 
which many people can induce by gazing in a crystal, or even in a pool of 
water, or a drop of ink, and which are often declared to give information, 
and reproduce scenes and people of whom the agent has no knowledge. It is 
suggested that those images which do not arise in the subliminal 
consciousness of the agent may have been telepathically received by him from 
other minds.  (See
"Crystal-gazing.")
     Collective Hallucination is a term applied to hallucinations which are 
shared by a number of people.  There is no evidence, however, of the 
operation of any other agency than suggestion (q.v.) or at the most, 
telepathy.


Ham : A Norwegian storm-fiend in the shape of an eagle with black wings, 
sent by Helgi to engulf Frithjof as he sailed for the island of Yarl 
Angantyr in the Saga of Grettir.


Hamazobii  (See Fascination.)

Hambaruan  Among the Dayaks of Borneo the hambaruan, or soul of a living 
man, may leave the body at will, and go where it chooses ; it is, however, 
liable to capture by evil spirits.  If this should happen, the man falls 
ill, and, if his soul is not speedily liberated, dies.

Hammurabi, Law of, against witchcraft: (See Semltes.)


Hamon  A sacred stone like gold, shaped as a ram's horn. If its possessor is 
in the posture of contemplation, it gives the mind a representation of all 
divine things.


Hand of Glory  The hand of a dead man, in which a lighted candle has been 
placed.  It was formerly believed in Ireland and Mexico to be an instrument 
of magic.  If the candle and its gruesome candlestick be taken into a house 
the sleeping inmates will be prevented from waking, and the candle itself 
will remain invisible.  To be truly effica-cious, however, both hand and 
candle must be prepared in a special manner.


Hands of Spirits  There are instances in occult history where the hand only 
of a spirit has become visible to the human eye. During the reign of James 
I. a vision of this kind came to a certain clerk who was engaged in writing 
a will which was to disinherit a son.  It took the form of a fine white 
hand, which appeared between the candle and the parchment, casting a shadow 
on the latter. It came three times, till the clerk, becoming alarmed, threw 
down his pen and refused to finish the work.  In the Book of Daniel it is 
related  " In the same hour came forth fingers of a. man's hand, and wrote 
over against the candlestick upon the plaster of the wall of the king's 
palace: and the king (Belshazzar) saw the part of the hand that wrote." 
There are also many instances of writing being done without human hands, and 
a Mr. Wolf, of Ohio, states that he has shaken hands with spirits, as 
"substantially" as one man shakes hands with another.  After a certain 
vision, it is recorded that Daniel was touched by a hand, which set him upon 
his knees and upon the palms of his hands.


Hanon-Tramp: The name given by the Germans to a certain kind of nightmare 
(q.v.). This particular nightmare takes the form of a demon, which 
suffocates people during sleep. It is believed by the French peasantry that 
this is " the destruction that wasteth at noon-day," as it is supposed that 
people are most exposed to its attacks at that time Its method of 
suffocation is to press on the breast and thus Impede the action of the 
lungs.

Harodim : A degree of Freemasonry very popular in the North of England, and 
especially in the County of Durham, and probably founded in Gateshead in 
1681.  It was brought under the Grand Lodge in 1735. They were the 
custodians of the Ritual of All Masonry, or the Old York Ritual.  There were 
nine lodges in all.  A London version of this society was the Harodim-Rosy-
Cross, of Jacobite origin, probably carried to London by the Earl of 
Derwentwater. This latter may have been a Scotch rite in very early times..


Harris, Thomas Lake, 1823-1906: An American spiritual-ist born in 
Buckinghamshire, who, with his parents, emigrated to the United States when 
he was of a tender age. He adopted the profession of a preacher of the 
Universalist Church, but afterwards became a Swedenborgian.  He attached 
himself to Davis (q.v.), but after the latter's exposure he deserted him and 
established himself as a preacher at New York, where he gathered round him a 
considerable congregation. When about twenty-seven years of age, he began to 
pose as the possessor of prophetic power, and produced a number of poems, 
which are not without a certain merit of their own.  These he was able to 
improvise with such rapidity as to lead many to the belief that he was 
indeed divinely inspired.  Somewhere about the year 1859 he visited London, 
where in certain circles his verse was admired.  On returning to America, he 
founded a small community near New York, of which he became the head.  Its 
members were of a heterogeneous description, composing American ladies of 
means, Japanese, clergymen, and the author, Laurence Oliphant, with his wife 
and mother. This community Harris called the Brotherhood of the New Life, 
and a little later on it was decided to change its Site to the shores of 
Lake Erie. The principal industry of the community was wine-making, and for 
this Harris was called to account by the temperance party, but he summarily 
dismissed their objections by stating that the wine he made was the direct 
vehicle of the Divine Breath.  His theology was a curious one: he believed 
that the Creator was androgyne, and he favoured married celibacy. The mode 
of breathing professed by him appears to have been imitated from that in 
vogue among certain Buddhist castes, but it was to be the mark of the 
faithful.  In 1881 the Oliphants seceded from his rule, and charged him with 
fraud. They took legal proceedings against him, and succeeded ill recovering 
considerable sums in this manner. Olipliant believed to the last that Harris 
possessed psychical powers, but there is no doubt at all that he was 
extremely avaricious and licentious as his books of verse, issued to a 
select circle, prove.  In 1891 he pro-claimed that he had renewed his youth, 
and that he had discovered what amounted to the elixir of life. On his death 
in 1906 his disciples would not believe that he had passed away, but thought 
he was only sleeping.  He died in March, and it was not util June that his 
demise was publicly acknowledged by his followers.  His whole philosophy was 
directed towards the breaking down the established order of the relations of 
the sexes. His sect had a jargon of its own, and its language was often 
inflated and absurd.  But with all his failings, and they were many, Harris 
was a man of considerable gifts, among which may be noted some poetic 
fervour and fluency and force of character.


Haruspication : (See Divination.)


Hasidim (“Pious Ones") : Devotees of a mystical phase of Judaism.  They are 
first heard of in the pre-Maccabean age.  In the first centuries of the 
Christian era we again hear of the Hasidim,, sometimes supposed to be the 
descen-dants of the earlier sect. The later Hasidim were saints and workers 
of miracles, gifted with esoteric wisdom and the prophetic faculty.  Early 
in the eighteenth century there arose yet another sect of the same name, 
having for its aim the revival of spirituality in the Jewish religion. 
Representatives of this mystic body are still to be found in Hungary, 
Poland, and Russia.


Hasona : (See Magic.)


Hassan Sabah : (See Assassins.)


Hastraun : A small mystical sect of Judaism, whose mem-bers were to be found 
in some parts of Palestine and Babylon. They practised some sort of 
communism, and were known also as 
"fearers of sin."


Hatha Yoga : The earliest and therefore most simple form of the Yoga 
practice.  An English translation of the Hatha Yoga Pradipika of Swatmaram 
Swami was published in 1893. This book consists of four chapters : the first 
containing advice as to surroundings, conduct, postures, etc.; the second 
dealing with breathing practice, prepara-tion, purification; the third gives 
ten Mudras which confer miraculous powers; and the fourth is a sort of 
supplement, and deals with the results of Yoga practice. The fruits of Yoga 
are detailed, and are of a very omniscient character.


Hauffe, Frederica : Better known as the " Seeress of Pro-vost," a somnambule 
who came under the observation of Dr. Justinus Kerner, a well-known poet and 
physician, early in the nineteenth century.  A natural trance and convulsive 
patient, she came to Kerner to be magnetised, but he endeavoured at first to 
treat her by medicinal means. Finding these unavailing, however, he resorted 
to magnet-ism.  Henceforward the Seeress passed the greater part of her life 
in trance, displaying all the usual somnambulic phenomena.  (See Magnetism 
under article Hypnotism.)
     She saw and conversed with apparitions, developed remark-able 
clairvoyant faculties, and dealt also in mysticism, des-cribing intricate 
symbolical circle-systems.  She was also the author of a "primitive" 
language, constructed with some ingenuity, which purported to be that 
tongue, spoken by the patriarchs of old, wherein the words conveyed in some 
mystic manner the properties of the things they designated. Dr. Kerner and 
others were sometimes able to see Frau Hauffe's ghostly interlocutors, as 
dim grey pillars of cloud. Physical phenomena of a poltergeistic character 
were also of common occurrence in her presence.


Haunted Houses: Not long ago a number of the daily papers contained, 
throughout several consecutive weeks, an advertisement offering for sale "an 
ancient Gothic Man-sion, known as Beckington Castle, ten miles from Bath and 
two from Frome" ; and the writer of this advertisement after expatiating on 
the noble scenery around Beckington, and the rare architectural beauty of 
the house itself, proceeded to say that the place was the more desirable 
because it was reported to be haunted I No doubt there are people who long 
for a house containing a bona fide ghost, and it is sometimes said that the 
rich tradesman, anxious to turn himself into a squire, invariably looks out 
for a haunted manor, while some waggish writers have declared, indeed, that 
nowadays ghosts are to be bought at Whitely's, and that the demand for them 
among American millionaires is stupendous. And, if the purchaser of 
Beckington Castle had to pay an additional high price because the place 
rejoiced in a veritable ghost, in reality anything of this sort usually 
makes a house almost unsale-able. At Lossiemouth, for example, on the east 
coast of Scotland, a fine old mansion stood untenanted for years, and was 
eventually sold for a merely nominal sum; and the reason was, simply, that 
according to popular tradition the building was paraded nightly by a female 
figure draped in white, her throat bearing an ugly scar, and her hands tied 
behind her back with chains. Nor is it merely concern-ing old Manors in the 
country that stories of this nature are current, and, even in many densely 
populated towns there exist to this day houses reputed to be haunted, which 
are quite unsaleable.
     It would seem that royal palaces, closely watched and guarded as they 
are nowadays, and invariably have been, are not altogether destitute of such 
inhabitants. For a legend contends that Windsor Castle is frequently visited 
by the ghost of Sir George Villiers, and it is said, moreover, that once, in 
the reign of Charles I., this ghost appeared to one of the king's gentlemen-
in-waiting, and informed him that the Duke of Buckingham would shortly fall 
by the hand of an assassin - a prophecy which was duly ful-filled soon 
after, as all readers of Les Trois Mousquetaires will doubtless remember, 
the incident figuring in that immortal story. Then at Hackwood House, near 
Basing-stoke, there is a room in which no one dares to sleep, all dreading 
'the grey woman  supposed to appear there nightly ; while Wyecoller Hall, 
near Colne, boasts a spectre horseman who visits the place once a year, and 
rides at full speed through the garden. Very different is the legend 
attached to Dilston, in Tyneside. where a bygone Lady Windermere is said to 
appear from time to time, and indulge in loud lamentations for her 
unfortunate husband, who was executed for his share in the Jacobite rising 
of 1715 ; while at Salmesbury Hall, Blackburn, there is a ghost of yet 
another kind, the people of the neighbourhood affirming that periodically 
they see a weird lady and her knight promenading the grounds of the Hall, 
indulging the while in silken dalliance. It need hardly be said, perhaps, 
that ghosts of this particular nature are remarkably common, and bulk 
largely in the spiritual lore of nearly every county; but the more gruesome 
apparitions predominate withal, and among these is the ghost of Amy Robsart, 
which still haunts the manor of Cumnor, in Oxfordshire.  For it must be 
borne in mind that Amy was a real woman, and not a mere creation of Sir 
Walter Scott's brain. She was married in 1550 to the Earl of Leicester, and 
his tragic death is commonly laid to his charge; but a tradition exists to 
the effect that Queen Elizabeth was really the responsible person, and 
recalling an authentic portrait of Amy, which bespeaks her a woman of charm 
and of no ordinary beauty, it is easy to believe that the ill-favoured queen 
hated her and took strong measures to get her out of the way.
     Numerous rectories rejoice in the ghost of a clergyman, erstwhile 
murdered by his infuriated parishioners; and there are several  haunted 
monasteries and convents, while at Holy Trinity Church at York a phantom nun 
appears occasionally on winter evenings, and walks about muttering 
paternosters. The story concerning her is that, on one occasion, during a 
period of civil-war, a band of soldiers were minded to sack the edifice in 
question, and on approach-ing it with this intention they were confronted by 
an abbess, who bade them beware of the divine wrath they would surely incur 
if they committed an act of sacrilege. They laughed at her piety, and, never 
thinking she would offer any resistance, they tried to march en masse into 
the building, but, hardly had they commenced the assault, ere their opponent 
snatched a sword from one of them, and stood bravely on the defensive. A 
fierce battle ensued, the abbess proving herself a veritable amazon, and 
slaying a host of her foes ; yet she lost her life ultimately, and her ghost 
it is which still frequents the church she sought to defend.
     There are few parts of England so rich in romance as Sherwood Forest, 
once the scene of Robin Hood's exploits; and there is at least one place in 
this region which claims a number of ghosts, Newstead Abbey, the seat of 
Lord Byron's ancestors. A part of the garden there is popularly known as ' 
the devil's wood," a name which points to the place having been infested 
once by minions of the foul fiend, while one of the rooms in the house is 
haunted by a certain  Sir John Byron, the little, of the grey beard," who 
presumably ended his days in some uncanny fashion. His portrait hangs over 
the hall in the dining-room, and a young lady, staying at Newstead about the 
middle of last century, contended stoutly that once she had entered this 
room to find the portrait gone, and its subject seated by the fireside 
reading a black-letter folio! The poet Byron himself cherished very fondly 
all the ghostly traditions which clung round his home, and it is recorded 
that, on his learning that there were stone coffins underneath the house, he 
straightway had one of them dug up and then opened.  He used some of its 
gruesome contents to “decorate" his own library, while he had the coffin 
itself placed in the great hall, through which thereafter the servants were 
afraid to pass by night.  He also utilised the supernatural lore of Newstead 
in one of his poems, and from this we learn that a spectre friar was wont to 
parade the mansion whenever some important event was wont to befall its 
owners

"When an heir is born he is heard to mourn, And when ought is to befall
That ancient line, in the pale moonshine
He walks from hall to hall.
His form you may trace, but not his face,
'Tis shadowed by his cowl;
But his eyes may be seen from the folds between, And they seem of a parted 
soul.
Say nought to him as he walks the hall, And he'll say nought to you:
He sweeps along in his dusky pall, As o'er the grass the dew.
Then, gramercy ! for the black friar; Heaven sain him, fair or foul,
And whatsoe'er may be his prayer, Let ours be for his soul."

     Passing from England to Ireland we find many haunted houses ;  for 
instance, Dunseverick in Antrim, where dwells still the soul of a bygone 
chief, so wicked in his lifetime that even hell's gates are closed to him. 
And passing from Ireland to Scotland we find numerous haunted buildings too, 
notably Holyrood Palace and the castles of Hermitage and Glamis.  It is the 
ghost of the murdered Rizzio which frequents Holyrood, yet it should be 
added that the vision is seldom seen nowadays; and mayhap the fates, aware 
that the Italian minstrel was shamefully treated, have at length accorded 
his soul a resting-place more cosy than the dismal Edinburgh Palace.  But 
the ghost of Hermitage, on the contrary, is still considerably addicted to 
exercise, and in truth his Story marks him as having been a man of rare 
activity and ambition. Lord Soulis was his name, and, possibly after hearing 
of Faustus' exploits, he vowed that he too would exorcise the devil, who 
generously made his appearance betimes. "Vast power will be yours on earth," 
said the evil one to Soulis "if you will but barter your soul therefor" ; so 
his lord-ship signed the requisite compact with his life's blood, and 
thenceforth his days were given over to the enjoyment of every conceivable 
pleasure. Anon, however, he felt that his end was near, and calling some of 
his vassals around him he told them of the awful fate awaiting him after 
death. Thunderstruck they were, but soon after Soulis was gone it occurred 
to them that, could they but destroy his mortal remains completely, they 
might save his soul from the clutches of Beelzebub. So having sheathed the 
corpse in lead they flung it into a burning fiery furnace, and manifestly 
this cremation saved his lordship from the nether regions, for had he gone 
there his soul would not have been active still at Hermitage.
      The ghost-story associated with Glamis Castle, the family seat of the 
Earl of Strathmore, is quite different from the rank and file of 
supernatural tales, and bears a more naked semblance of veracity than 
pertains to any of these.  It is a matter of common knowledge that there is 
a secret chamber at Glamis, a chamber which enshrines a mystery known only 
to a few members of the Strathmore family, and three or four generations ago 
a lady, staying as a visitor at Glamis, vowed she would solve the riddle. 
Her first difficulty was to locate the actual room, but one afternoon, when 
all the rest of the household were going out, she feigned a headache and 
thus contrived to be left completely alone.  Her next move was to go from 
room to room, putting a handkerchief in the window of each, and having done 
this she went outside and walked round the castle t6 see whether any room 
had evaded her search. Very soon she observed a window which had no handker-
chief in it, so she hastened indoors again, thinking that her quest was 
about to be rewarded.  But try as she might she could not find the missing 
room; and while she was search-ing the other guests returned to the house, 
along with them being the then Lord Strathmore. He was fiercely incensed on 
learning what had been going forward, and that night shrieks were heard in a 
long corridor in the castle. The guests ran out of their rooms to find out 
what was wrong, and in the dim light they perceived a curious creature with 
an inhuman head, wrestling with an aged man-servant who eventually contrived 
to carry the monster away. There the story ends, but as remarked before it 
bears a semblance of truth, the probability being that some scion of the 
Glamis castle family was mad or hideously deformed, and was accordingly 
incarcerated in a room to which access was difficult and secret.  And no 
doubt endless other ghost-stories rest on some basis of this sort, for, 
while the diverting practice of showing freaks in public is a comparatively 
new one, freaks themselves are among the world's most ancient institutions, 
perhaps almost as ancient as spectres and visions.  It is impossible in this 
place to allude to the host of less famous haunted residences, an allusion 
to which their owners might take strong excep-tion.	W.B.G.M.


Hayden, Mrs. : The first spiritualistic medium to visit Eng-land.  Mrs. 
Hayfee was the wife of W. B. Hayden, editor of the Star Spangled Banner. Her 
Seance phenomena consisted mainly of raps, by means of which communication 
with the spirits was established. Her supernormal faculties were testified 
to by Professor de Morgan in a letter dated July, 1853, and by Robert 
Chambers in Chambers' journal, May, 1853.


Haiti : (See West Indian Islands.)


Hazel Tree  The Hazel was dedicated to the god Thor, and, in the Roman 
Catholic Church, was esteemed a plant of great virtue for the cure of 
fevers. When used as a divining rod, the rod, if it were cut on St. John's 
Day or Good Friday, would be certain to be a successful instrument of 
divination. A hazel rod was a badge of authority, and it was probably this 
notion which caused it to be made use of by schoolmasters.  Among the 
Romans, a hazel rod was also a symbol of authority.


Head of Baphomet An interesting discovery was made public in 1818 dealing 
with the history of secret societies. There was found, among the antiquities 
of the imperial museum of Vienna some of those idols named heads of 
Baphomet, which the Templars adored. These heads represent the divinity of 
the Gnostics, named Mete or Wisdom.  For a long time there was preserved at 
Mar-seilles one of these gilded heads, seized in a retreat of the Templar 
when the latter were pursued by the law.  (See Baphomet.)


Healing by Touch : In England and Scotland, and in France also, the idea 
that a touch of the royal hand was a sure remedy for scrofula was long 
prevalent, and consequently this complaint acquired betimes the now familiar 
name of king's evil."  In France, so far as can be ascertained, this 
interesting practice dates from the reign of Louis IX., and in England from 
that of Edward III., who is recorded to have performed a considerable number 
of cures. He was wont to wash the affected part of the sufferer, but 
gradually the use of actual ablutions was discontinued, and most subsequent 
kings contented themselves with mere touching, while at the same time 
prayers were offered up on behalf of the patient. Anon the religious 
ceremony used on such occasions grew more elaborate, while, during the reign 
of Henry VII., a special " king's evil" petition was drawn up by a body of 
divines for insertion in the Service Book, and there it prevailed for a 
surprisingly long time thereafter, being found in some editions printed as 
late as the beginning of the eighteenth century.
     The idea that kings ruled by divine right emanated mainly from 
Scotland, and so it is natural to assume that the early inhabitants of that 
land regarded their sovereigns as capable of miracles. There is little or no 
evidence, nevertheless, that the Stuarts, prior to the Union of the Crowns, 
practised touching for king's evil ; but scarcely was Charles I. on the 
British throne ere he began to demon-strate his powers herein, and 
scrofulous persons flocked from far and near accordingly. Indeed, they came 
in such numbers, that early in the fifth year of his reign, Charles found it 
essential to specify certain times for their reception at court, and the 
proclamation which he issued on the subject may be read in the Historical 
Collections of John Rushworth, sometime secretary to Oliver Cromwell. Here 
it is stated that, in the future, those who wish to benefit from the king's 
thaumaturgic gift will be welcomed at Michaelmas or Easter, but it is clear 
that his Majesty saw fit to make exceptions to this rule, for, during his 
visit to Edinburgh in 1633, he ministered to numerous unfortu-nates in the 
month of June.  It was at Holyrood that he received them, the palace being 
transformed pro tempore into a veritable Lourdes, and Sir James Balfour, the 
Historian, who was knighted at this time, and created Lyon King-at-Arms, 
affirms in an unpublished manuscript, still extant in the Advocates Library, 
Edinburgh, that Charles 
success-fully “heallit 100 persons of the cruelles or kingis aivell, yong 
and olde."
     Reverting to the proclamation cited above, therein the king speaks at 
length of the many cures wrought by his "royal predecessors."  Now this, of 
course, may allude purely to the Plantagenets or Tudors, but it is equally 
possible that these references indicate touching for scrofula on the part of 
the early Stuarts, and be that as it may, Charles I. was not the only member 
of that dynasty who essayed the act.  John Evelyn, in his Diary, writes 
repeat-edly of Charles the Second's activities in this relation, while 
Samuel Pepys refers to the same thing, and in one passage he says the sight 
failed to interest him in the least, for he had seen it often before. 
Clearly, then, quite a host of the Merry Monarch's subjects were " heallit" 
by the royal touch, nor did the practice end with the ousting of the Stuarts 
in 1689. The Chevalier de St. George essayed it on several occasions, and 
his son Prince Charles, when in Scotland in 1745, made at least one attempt, 
though whether with success or not is unrecorded.
     In the infancy of the world, and during a time when these laws of 
nature ware but partially known and understood by man, it was most natural 
that these inexplicable powers should be directly ascribed to a divine 
influence. Healing of the sick was supposed to proceed alone from God, or 
through the priest' and saints His servants.  Faith was therefore necessary 
to the cure, and the magical powers were therefore transferred by words, 
prayers, and cere-monies, and the science was transmitted among the myster-
ies. Healing by touch, by laying on of hands, and by the breath, belonged to 
this secret influence; also the use of talismans and amulets, which were 
composed of organic as well as inorganic substances,-minerals, stones, and 
plants; the wearing of rings, of images of saints, and other symboli-cal 
objects ; lastly, heeling the sick by words and prayers.
     As regards the semblance which this science hears to magnetism. it is 
certain that not only were the ancients acquainted with an artificial method 
of treating disease but also with somnambulism itself. Among others, Agrippa 
von Nettesheim speaks of this plainly when he says, in his Occulta 
philosophia, p. 45 :-" There is a science, known but to very few, of 
illuminating and in-structing the mind, so that at one step it is raised 
from the darkness of ignorance to the light of wisdom. This is produced 
principally by a species of artificial sleep, in which a man forgets the 
present, and, as it were, perceives the future through the divine 
inspiration. Unbelieving wicked persons can also be deprived of this power 
by secret means."
     The healing of the sick by the touch and the laying on of hands is to 
be found among primitive peoples, the Indians, the Egyptians, and especially 
among the Jews.  In Egypt sculptures have been found where one hand of the 
operator is placed on the stomach and the other on the back.  Even the 
Chinese, according to the accounts of the early mission-aries (Athan.  
Kircher, China Illustrata), healed sickness by the laying on of hands.  In 
the Old Testament we find numerous examples, of which we shall extract a 
few.
     When Moses found his end approaching, he prayed for a worthy successor, 
and we find the following passage (Numbers, xxvii., 18, 20) :-" And the Lord 
said unto Moses, Take thee Joshua, the son of Nun, a man in whom is the 
spirit, and lay thine hand upon him, "And thou shalt put some of thine 
honour upon him, that all the congregation of the children of Israel may be 
obedient."
     Another instance is to be found in the healing the seem-ingly dead 
child by Elisha, who stretched himself three times upon the child, and 
called upon the Lord. The manner in which Elisha raised the dead son of the 
Shuna-mite woman is still more remarkable.  He caused Gehazi to proceed 
before him to lay his staff upon the face of the child.  As this was of no 
avail, Elisha went up into the room, and laid himself upon the child, etc., 
and his hands upon the child's hands, so that the child's body became warm 
again. After that the child opened his eyes. Elisha's powers even survived 
his death. “And Elisha died, and they buried him; and the bands of the Moabi 
tee invaded the land in the coming of the year.  And it came to pass, as 
they were burying a man, that, behold, they spied a band of men; and they 
cast the man into the sepulchre of Elisha; and when the man was let down, 
and touched the bones of Elisha, he revived and stood upon his feet." (2 
Kings, xiii., 20, 21). Naaman the leper, when he stood before Elisha's house 
with his horses and chariots, and had been told to wash seven times in the 
Jordan, said,  Behold I thought, he will surely come out to me, and stand, 
and call upon the name of the Lord his God, and strike his band over the 
place, and recover the leper."  (2 Kings, v. 4).
     The New Testament is particularly rich in examples of the efficacy of 
laying on of the hands.  "Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was 
given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery."  
(i Timothy, iv., '4), is the principal maxim of the Apostles, for the 
practical use of their powers for the good of their brethren in Christ.  In 
St. Mark we find  (xvi., 18) :-" They shall lay hands on the sick and they 
shall recover."  St. Paul was remarkable for his powers: "And it came to 
pass that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux; to 
whom Paul entered in, and prayed and laid his hands on him and healed him."  
(Acts, xxviii., 8). "And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house, 
and putting his hands on him, said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus that 
appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest, hath sent me that thou mayest 
receive thy sight and be filled with the Holy Ghost. And immediately there 
fell from his eyes as it had been scales, and he re-ceived sight."  (Acts, 
ix., 17, 18).  In St. Mark we find “And they brought young children to him, 
that he might touch them; and his disciples rebuked those who brought them.  
But Jesus said, ' Suffer the little children to come unto me, for of such is 
the kingdom of heaven.' And he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon 
them, and blessed them."  ' And they bring unto him one that was deaf and 
had an impediment in his speech, and they be-sought him to put his hand upon 
him.  And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his 
ears, and he spit and touched his tongue; and, looking up to heaven, he 
sighed, and said unto him, 'Ephphatha,'-that is' Be opened. And straightway 
his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake 
plain."  (Mark, vii., 33).
     Other passages may be met with in Matth. ix., i8; Mark v., 23 ; vi., 5 
; viii., 22 ; x., 13 ; xvi., 18; Luke v., 53 ; xviii., 15 ; John ix., i7 ; 
Acts ix., 17, etc., etc.  In the histories of the saints, innumerable 
examples are recorded, and the command, "In my name shall they cast out 
devils; they shall speak with new tongues; they shall take up serpents; and 
if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them; they shall lay their 
hands on the sick and they shall recover," applies to all true followers of 
Christ. Those, however, who are wanting in the power of the spirit and in 
faith cannot perform these acts like the saints, on whom they cast doubts 
because they cannot imitate them.
     The Saints accomplished everything through faith in Christ, and 
therefore were able to perform such miracles. We shall make mention of a few 
of the most remarkable accounts.  St. Patrick, the Irish apostle, healed the 
blind by laying on his hands.  St. Bernard is said to have restored eleven 
blind persons to sight, and eighteen lame persons to the use of their lambs, 
in one day at Constance. At Cologne he healed twelve lame, caused three dumb 
persons to speak, ten who were deaf to hear; and, when he himself was ill, 
St. Lawrence and St. Benedict appeared to him, and cured him by touching the 
affected part.  Even his plates and dishes are said to have cured sickness 
after his death. The miracles of SS. Margaret, Katherine, Elizabeth, 
Hildegarde, and especially the miraculous cures of the two holy martyrs 
Cosmas and Damianus, belong to this class. Among others, they freed the 
Emperor Justinian from an incurable sickness. St. Odilia embraced a leper, 
who was shunned by all men, in her arms, warmed him, and restored him to 
health.
     Remarkable above all others are those cases where persons who were at 
the point of death have recovered by holy baptism or extreme unction. The 
Emperor Constan-tine is one of the most singular examples. Pyrrhus, king of 
Epirus, had the power of assuaging colic and affections of the spleen by 
laying the patients on their backs and passing his great toe over them.  
(Plutarch. Vita Pyrrhi:
     Digitum maximum pedis divinitatem habuisse adeo quod igne non potuit 
comburi.") The Emperor Vespasian cured nervous affections, lameness, and 
blindness, solely by the laying on of his hands (Suelin, Vita Vespas).  
Accord-ing to Coelius Spartianus, Hadrian cured those afflicted with dropsy 
by touching them with the points of his fingers, and recovered himself from 
a violent fever by similar treatment.  King Olaf healed Egill on the spot by 
merely laying his hands upon him and singing proverbs (Edda, p, 216).  The 
kings of England and France cured diseases of the throat by touch.  ft is 
said that the pious Edward the Confessor, and in France that Philip the 
First, were the first who possessed this power. The formula used on such 
occasions was, "Le roi te touche, allez at guerissez; " so that the word was 
connected with the act of touching.  In England the disease was therefore 
called King's Evil."  In France this power was retained until the time of 
the Revolution, and it is said that at the corona-tion the exact manner of 
touching, and the formula-" Le roi te touche, dieu te guerisse "-were 
imparted to the monarch.  In the reign of Louis XIII. the Duke d'Epernon is 
said to have exclaimed, when Richelieu was made generalissimo against the 
Spaniards, ' What ! has the king nothing left but the power of healing wens 
?
    Among German princes this curative power was ascribed to the Counts of 
Hapsburg, and also that they were able to cure stammering by a kiss.  Pliny 
says, ' There are men whose whole bodies possess medicinal properties,-as 
the Marsi, the Psyli, and others, who cure the bite of serpents merely by 
the touch." This he remarks especially of the Island of Cyprus; and later 
travellers confirm these cures by the touch.  In later times, the Salmadores 
and Ensal-madores of Spain became very celebrated, who healed almost all 
diseases by prayer, laying on of hands, and by breathing. In Ireland, 
Valentine Greatrakes (q.v.) cured at first " king's evil" by touch.  In the 
seventeenth cen-tury, the gardener Levret and the notorious Streeper per-
formed cures in London by stroking with the hand.  In similar manner cures 
were performed by Michael Medina, and the Child of Salamanca; also Marcellus 
Empiricus (Sprengel, Gesch. der Med. Part 2, p. 179).  Richter, an innkeeper 
at Royan, in Silicia, cured, in the years 1817-18, many thousands of sick 
persons in the open fields, by touching them with his hands. Under the 
Popes, laying on of hands was called Chirothasy. Diapenbroek wrote two 
treatises on it, and, according to Lampe, four-and-thirty Chirothetists ware 
declared to be holy. Mesmer (q.v.) and his assistants also employed 
manipulations largely.


Hearn, Lafeadio : (See Fiction, Occult English.)


Heart : It is said in Ecclesiates that the heart of the wise is at the right 
side, the heart of the foolish at the left.  But this saying must be placed 
in the same category as that of Jonas, who said of some of the Ninevites 
that they did not know their right hand from their lelt-that is, they could 
not distinguish good from evil.

Heavenly Man, The : According to the Zohar, the first of the Sephiroth, or 
divine emanations. Before the creation God was without form, above and 
beyond all attributes. But when He had created the Heavenly Man He used him 
as a Chariot in which to descend. And desiring to make Him-self known by His 
attributes, " He let Himself be styled as the God of pardon, the God of 
Justice, the God Omnipotent, the God of Hosts and He who is (Jahveh)." The 
Heavenly Man is to be distinguished from the "earthly man." The creation of 
the earthly man was, indeed, the work of the Heavenly Man-that is, of the 
first emanation from God, the Supreme Manifestation, the Divine activity.


Hecate : Originally a Greek goddess of uncertain parentage. She appears to 
have been one of the Titans who ruled the heaven, earth and sea; and could 
bestow gifts on mortals at pleasure. Later she was confounded with other 
goddesses until she became at length a mystic goddess having all the magic 
powers of nature at command. Magicians and witches besought her aid, and 
sacrifices were offered to her where three ways met of dogs, honey and 
female black lambs.  Festivals were celebrated to her annually at AEgina.  
In appearance she was frightful, and serpents hung hissing around liar 
shoulders.

Hekalot : According to the Zohar, the seven halls of the world of Yetsirah, 
the divine halls into which the seekers for the Chariot (Merkabah) strive to 
enter.  Here dwell the angels, presided over by Metatron; likewise the souls 
of men not specially noted for their piety.  (The souls of the pious dwell 
in the world of Beriah).


Hela or ' Death" : One of the offspring of Loki and the giantess Angurbodi. 
The gods becoming alarmed of her and the other monsters which were coming to 
life in Jotun-heim, it was deemed advisable by All-father that they should 
be brought before him.  Hela was cast into Nifl-heim, to which are sent all 
those who die of sickness or old age. She governs this world, which is 
composed of nine regions, into which she distributes those who coma to her; 
and in which she inhabits a strongly-protected abode. Niflheim is said to be 
" a dark abode far from the sun" its gates open to the ' cutting north" : 
"its walls are formed of wreathed snakes and their venom is ever falling 
like rain" ; and it is surrounded by dark and poisonous streams.  "Nidhog, 
the great dragon, who dwells beneath the central root of Ygdrassil, torments 
and gnaws the dead."  It is said that one-half of Hela's body is livid, and 
the other half flesh-coloured. Hunger is her table; Starvation, her knife; 
Delay, her man; Slowness, her maid; Precipice, her threshold; Care, her bed; 
and Burning Anguish forms the hangings of her apartments.


Hellotrope : Said to render its possessor invisible if it be rubbed over 
with the juice of the herb of the same name; stops bleeding, and averts 
danger from poison.


Hell : The derivation of this word is probably from the root helen to cover, 
designating a subterranean or hidden place. In Ward's Mythology we find it 
in the form of Hel as a "place of the dead" alone, by no means a place of 
punish-ment. The conception of such has a more or less clear train of 
evolution behind it. The Christian idea of a place of punishment was 
directly coloured by the Jewish con-ception of Sheol, which in turn took 
shape from Babylonian sources. When exactly the idea began to form itself as 
a place of punishment is not clear, as among the ancient Semites, Egyptians 
and Greeks, we find the under-world regarded as a place of the dead alone. 
Thus in Egypt we find Amenti distinctly a place of the dead, in which the 
tasks of life are for the most part duplicated. This is the case also among 
barbarian people, who merely regard the land of the dead as an extension of 
human existence, in which man led a more or less shadowy life. The savage 
does not believe in punishment after death, and conceives that any breach of 
moral rule is summarily dealt with in this life.  It is only when a higher 
moral code emerges from totemic or similar rule that the idea of a place of 
punish-ment is invented by priest-craft. This is, however, not always the 
case: in Greece, Rome and Scandinavia, we find that Hades was merely looked 
upon as a place of the dead, where, like shadowy ghosts, mankind flit to and 
fro, gibbering and squeaking as phantoms are supposed to do. According to 
the Greeks, Hades was only some twelve feet under the surface of the ground, 
so that Orpheus would have had no vary long journey from the subterranean 
spheres to reach earth once more. Hell is generally regarded as a 
sovereignty, a place definitely ruled in an ordinary manner by a monarch set 
there for the purpose by the celestial powers. Thus the Greek Hades ruled 
the Sad Sphere of the Dead; Osiris was lord and governor of the Egyptian 
Amenti; in Central America, we find twin rulers in the Kiche Hades, Xibalba, 
whose names are given as Hun-came and Vukub-came. These latter are actively 
malignant, unlike the Mictlan of the Mexican, whose empire was for the 
generality of the people.  These could only exist there for the space of 
four years, after which they finally became entirely extinct. The Mexicans 
represent Mictlan as a huge monster with open mouth ready to devour his 
victims, and this we find paralelled in the Babylonian Tiawith. We thus see 
that at a certain stage in all mythologies, the conception of a place of the 
dead was confounded with the idea of a place of punishment. The Greeks 
generally bewailed the sad end of humanity which was condemned for ever to 
dwell in semi-darkness after death. The possibility of the existence of a 
place of reward never seemed to appeal to them. To the vivid Greek mind life 
was all in all, and it was left to the finer and altogether more upright 
Semitic conscience to evolve in the near East the conception of a place of 
punishment. Thus Sheol, from being regarded as a place of the dead became 
the home of fire, into which the wicked and unjust were thrust for their 
sins. This was certainly foreshadowed by Babylonian and Egyptian ideals, for 
we find the Egyptian unable to pass the test of justification simply 
rejected from the idea of rejection would soon spring the idea of active 
punishment. The Semitic conception of Hell was probably  reinforced on the 
introduction of Christianity into Europe, and coloured by the conception of 
the places of the dead belonging to the other mythologies of Europe. Thus 
the Scandinavian idea, which was also that of our Saxon forefathers, 
undoubtedly coloured the English conception of the place of punishment.
     "'Hela,' or  Death,' in the prose Edda, is one of the offspring of Loki 
and the giantess Angurbodi ; their other two being the wolf Fenrir and the 
Midgard serpent. The gods were not long ignorant that these monsters 
continued to be bred up in Jotunheim, and having had recourse to divination, 
became aware of all the evils they would have to suffer from them ; their 
being sprung from such a mother was a bad presage, and from such a sire one 
still worse. All-father therefore deemed it advisable to send one of the 
gods to bring them to him. When they came he threw the serpent into that 
deep ocean by which the earth is encircled. But the monster has grown to 
such an enormous size that, holding his tail in his mouth he encircles the 
whole earth.   ‘Hela’ he cast into Niflheim, and gave her power over nine 
worlds (regions), into which she dis-tributes those who are sent to her, 
that is to say, all who die through sickness or old age.  Here she possesses 
a habita-tion protected by exceedingly high walls and strongly barred gates.  
Her hall is called Elvidner; Hunger is her table; Starvation, her knife; 
Delay, her man ; Slowness, her maid ; Precipice, her threshold ; Care, her 
bed ; and Burning Anguish forms the hangings of her apartments. The one half 
of her body is livid, the other half the colour of human flesh.'  A 
description of Niflheim itself, the abode of Loki and his evil progeny, in 
given in the Voluspa.  It is a dark abode far from the sun' ; its gates are 
open to ‘the cutting north' ;  its walls are formed of wreathed snakes and 
their venom is ever falling like rain.'  It is surrounded by the dark and 
poisonous streams ‘Elivagar.’ Nidhog, great dragon, who dwells beneath the 
central root of Ygdrassil, torments and gnaws the dead."
     The probabilities are that the ideas concerning the Celtic other-world 
had little to do in forming the British conception of Hell. Tile Brythonic 
"Annwyl" was cer-tainly a subterranean locality, but it was by no means a 
place of punishment, being merely a microcosm of the world above, where folk 
hunted, ate and drank, as in early Britain. Nor was the Irish other-world 
much different and after crossing the waters of oblivion the possessed 
person found himself in a sphere in many ways resembling the earth-life.
     In southern Europe again the idea of Hell appears to have been strongly 
coloured by both classical and Jewisih conceptions.  Our best picture of the 
medieval conception of the place of punishment is undoubtedly the Inferno of 
Dante, who in most things followed the teaching of contemporary schoolmen in 
describing it. Acknowledging Virgil as his master, he follows him in many 
descriptions of Tartarus; but we find the Semitic idea cropping up every 
here and there, as in the beginning of one of the cantos, where, what looks 
suspiciously like a Hebrew incantation, is set down. The dramatis personae 
are classical; thus we have Pluto and many of the breed of Tartarus.  In 
later medieval times the ingenuity of the monkish mind came to the rescue 
and conceptions which in some instances appear to be perfectly original 
sprang up. Thus, Hell obtained an annexe, Purgatory.  its inhabitants took 
on a form which may distinctively be alluded to as European, in contra-
distinction to the more satyr-like shape of the earlier hierarchy of Hades.  
We find grizzly forms of bird-like shape, with exaggerated beaks and claws, 
and the animal forms and faces of later medieval gargoyles give us a capital 
idea of what the denizens of Hades seemed like in the eyes of the 
superstition of the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries.  It was only a modified version of these ideas which came down to 
our grandfathers, and one may suspect that such superstition, were not 
altogether disbelieved by our fathers.  This is not the place to embark upon 
a theological discussion as to whether the Hell of the Christians exists, or 
does not exist ; but it may be interesting to remark that a great 
controversy has raged ever since the time of Origen as to the question 
whether or not the punish-ments of Hell are eternal. Those who denied that 
this was so were called Universalists, and believed in the final redemption 
of all.  Enough has been said to show that most Eastern mythological systems 
possess a Hades which does not differ in any fundamental respect from that 
of most barbarian races, except that it is perhaps rather more specialised 
and involved. Many later writers, sceli as Swedenborg, Boehme, Blake and 
others (not to forget Milton), have given us vivid pictures of the hierarchy 
and general condition of Hell.  For the most part these are based on the 
patristic writings.  In the Middle Ages endless controversy took place as to 
the nature and offices of the various inhabitants of the place of punishment 
(See Demonology), and the descriptions of later visionaries are practically 
mere repetitions of the Conclusions then arrived at.
     The locality of Hell has also been a question of endless speculation ; 
some believed it to be resident in the sun, giving as their reason for this 
the fact the Greek name of that luminary Helios ;  but such childish 
etymologies appear to have been in disfavour with most writers on the 
subject, and the grand popular idea that Hell is subterra-nean has had no 
real rival.

Hellenbach, Baron : (See Germany.)


Helmont, John Baptista van, must be ranked as one of the pioneers of science 
by reason Of his experimental researches. his acute judgment, his 
penetrating attitude of mind leading him to say  Names do not trouble me, I 
contemplate the thing in itself as near as I can," and his untiring search 
for tile truth, not for personal aggrandizement or power, but in the service 
of progress and for the good of mankind.  He was born of a noble family in 
the year 1557 at Bois-le-Duc in Brabant.  Studying at Louvain, he early 
attained distinction in the science of mathematics, lecturing on physics at 
the age of seventeen.  Before he was twenty-two he had read Hippocrates and 
the Greek and Arabian authors and become eminent in the doctrines of 
Aristotle and Galen and the practice of medicine according to Vopiscus and 
Plem-pius.  In the year 1599 he took his degree of doctor of medicine. After 
this some years were spent in the practice of physic, but meeting a follower 
of Paracelsus he became interested in his theories of chemical medicine to 
such a degree that he retired to the castle of Vilvord, near Brussels, to 
spend the rest of his life in the study of experimental chemistry on which 
he wrote various treatises, becoming famous throughout Europe for his 
scientific knowledge. He revolutionized medicine as known in his day, 
turning aside from the theories of Galen and the Arabs, and created an epoch 
in the history of physiology, being the first to recognize the functions of 
the stomach and its relation to the other organs of the body.  His many and 
varied experiments led him to deal with aerial fluids, to which he gave the 
name of gas-carbonic acid gas being his discovery -and it is said that 
without him the chemistry of steel in all probability would have been 
unknown to science.
     The writings of van Helmont contain many truths, foreshadowings of 
ideas and principles now accepted as indispensable commonplaces, though 
these almost of necessity are hidden under much of the incomprehensible 
beliefs and illusions prevalent in his time. Alchemy, with ifs visions of 
the Elixir of Life and the Philosopher's Stone represented to him another 
field for experiment and research and though he never pretended to the art 
of making the transmuting powder, he testified his belief in the 
transmutation of metals, having seen the experiment performed many times. 
Among other things he became a firm believer in Mineral and Human Magnetism, 
anticipat-ing Mesmer in almost the very terms of the later exponent of the 
theory and basing his argument on the well-known facts of the sympathy or 
antagonism spontaneously arising between individuals and the influence 
exerted by a firm will over a weak imagination. To the last he declined to 
leave his retirement, though his fame brought him flattering invitations and 
offers from the Emperor and Elector Palatine. Almost unknown to his 
neighbours he yet attended any stricken by illness without accepting any 
fees for his services.  He lived to the age of sixty-seven, dying at his 
castle of Vilvord in 1624.


Helvetius, John Frederick : A physician of the Hague who in 1667 published a 
work concerning a strange adventure of his life in which he claimed to have 
taken part in a veritable act of metallic transmutation by alchemical 
processes. The book was translated into English and published at London 1670 
under the title Of a Transmuta-tion.  As it is one of the few exact 
descriptions of such an experiment, it has been thought well to append the 
passage recounting it in full, as follows: -
     “On the 27th December, i666, in the afternoon, a stranger, in a plain, 
rustic dress, came to my house at the Hague. His manner of address was 
honest, grave authortative; his stature was low, with a long face and hair 
black, his chin smooth.  He seemed like a native of the north of Scotland, 
and I guessed he was about forty-four years old.  After saluting me he 
requested me most respectfully to pardon his rude intrusion, but that his 
love of the pyrotechnic art made him visit me.  Having read some of my small 
treatises, particularly that against the sympathetic powder of Sir Kenelm 
Digby and observed therein my doubt of the Hermetic mystery, it caused him 
to request this interview.  He asked me if I still thought there was no 
medicine in Nature which could cure all diseases, unless the principal 
parts, as the lungs, liver, etc. were perished, or the time of death were 
come. To which I replied I never met with an adept, or saw such a medicine, 
though I read of much of it and often wished for it. Then I asked if he was 
a physician.  He said he was a founder of brass, yet from his youth learned 
many rare things in chemistry, particularly of a friend-the manner to 
extract out of metals many medicinal arcana by the use of fire. After 
discoursing of experiments in metals, he asked me, would I know the 
philosophers' stone if I saw it?  I answered, I would not, though I read 
much of it in Para-celsus, Helmont, Basil, and others, yet I dare not say I 
could know the philosophers' matter. In the interim he drew from his breast 
pocket a neat ivory box, and out of it took three ponderous lumps of the 
stone, each about the size of a small walnut. They were transparent and of a 
pale brimstone colour, whereto some scales of the crucible adhered when this 
most noble substance was melted. The value of it I since calculated was 
twenty tons weight of gold. When I had greedily examined and handled the 
stone almost a quarter of an hour, and heard from the owner many rare 
secrets of its admirable effects in human and metallic bodies, also its 
other wonderful properties, I returned him this treasure of treasures, truly 
with a most sorrowful mind, like those who conquer themselves, yet, as was 
just, very thankfully and humbly. I further desired to know why the colour 
was yellow, and not red, ruby colour, or purple, as the philosophers write.  
He answered that was nothing, for the matter was mature and ripe enough. 
Then I humbly requested him to bestow a little piece of the medicine on me, 
in perpetual memory of him, though but of the size of a coriander or hemp 
seed.  He presently answered,  Oh no, this is not lawful, though thou 
wouldst give me as many ducats in gold as would fill this room, not for the 
value of the metal, but for some particular consequences. Nay, if it were 
possible," said he, "that fire could be burnt by fire, I would rather at 
this instant cast all this substance into the fiercest flames."  He then 
demanded if I had a more private chamber, as this was seen from the public 
street.  I presently conducted him into the best furnished room backward, 
not doubting but he would bestow part thereof or some great treasure on me. 
He entered without wiping his shoes, although they were full of snow and 
dirt.  He asked me for a little piece of gold, and, pulling off his cloak, 
opened his vest, under which he had five pieces of gold. They were hanging 
to a green silk ribbon, and were of the size of breakfast plates. This gold 
so far excelled mine that there was no comparison for flexibility and 
colour. The inscriptions engraven upon them he granted me to write out; they 
were pious thanks-givings to God, dated 20th August, t666, with the 
characters of the Sun, Mercury, the Moon, and the signs of Leo and Libra.
     “I was in great admiration, and desired to know where and how he 
obtained them.  He answered, "A foreigner, who dwelt some days in my house, 
said he was a lover of this science, and came to reveal it to me. He taught 
me various arts-first, of ordinary stones and chrystals, to make rubies, 
chrysolites, sapphires, etc., much more valu-able than those of the mine; 
and how in a quarter of an hour to make oxide of iron, one dose of which 
would infallibly cure the pestilential dysentery, or bloody flux; also how 
to make a metallic liquor to cure all kinds of dropsies, most certainly and 
in four days; as also a limpid, clear water, sweeter than honey, by which in 
two hours of itself, in hot sand, it would extract the tincture of garnets, 
corals, glasses, and such like."  He said more, which I Helvetius, did not 
observe, my mind being occupied to understand how a noble juice could be 
drawn out of minerals to transmute metals.  He told me his said master 
caused him to bring a glass of rain-water, and to put some silver leaf into 
it, which was dissolved therein within a quarter of an hour, like ice when 
heated. "Presently he drank to me the half, and I pledged him the other 
half, which had not so much taste as sweet milk, but whereby, methought, I 
became very light-headed.  I thereupon asked if this were a philosophical 
drink, and wherefore we drank this potion; but he replied, I ought not to be 
so curious." By the said master's directions, a piece of a leaden pipe being 
melted, he took a little sulphureous powder out of his pocket, put a little 
of it on the point of a knife into the melted lead, and after a great blast 
of the bellow's, in a short time he poured it on the red stones of the 
kitchen chimney.  It proved most excellent pure gold, which the stranger 
said brought him into such trembling amazement that he could hardly speak; 
but his master encouraged him saying, "Cut for thyself the sixteenth part of 
this as a memorial and give the rest away among the poor," which the 
stranger did, distributing this alms, as he affirmed if my memory fail not, 
at the Church of Sparenda.  "At last," said he, ' the generous foreigner 
taught me thor-oughly this divine art."
     "As soon as his relation was finished, I asked my visitor to show me 
the effect of transmutation and so confirm my faith; but he declined it for 
that time in such a discreet manner that I was satisfied, he promising to 
come again in three weeks, to show me some curious arts in the fire, 
provided it were then lawful without prohibition. At the three weeks end he 
came, and invited me abroad for an hour or too.  In our walk we discoursed 
of Nature's secrets, but he was very silent on the subject of the great 
elixir gravely asserted that it was only to magnify the sweet fame and mercy 
of the most glorious God; that few men endeavoured to serve Him, and this he 
expressed as a pastor or minister of a church; but I recalled his atten-
tion, entreating him to show' me the metallic mystery, desiring also that he 
would eat, drink, and lodge at my house, which I pressed, but he was of so 
fixed a determination that all my endeavours were frustrated.  I could not 
forbear to tell him that I had a laboratory ready for an experiment, and 
that a promised favour was a kind of debt.
     “Yes, true," said he, " but I promised to teach thee at my return, with 
this proviso, if it wore not forbidden."
     “When I perceived that all this was in vain, I earnestly requested a 
small crumb of his powder, sufficient to trans-mute a few grains of lead to 
gold, and at last, out of his philosophical commiseration, he gave me as 
much as a turnip seed in size, saying, " Receive this small parcel of the 
greatest treasure of the world, which truly few kings or princes have ever 
seen or known."  "But," I said, this perhaps will not transmute four grains 
of lead," whereupon he bid me deliver it back to him, which, in hopes of a 
greater parcel, I did, but he, cutting half off with his nail, flung it into 
the fire, and gave me the rest wrapped neatly up in blue paper, saying, "It 
is yet sufficient for thee."  I answered him, indeed with a most dejected 
countenance, " Sir, what means this ? The other being too little, you give 
me now less."  He told me to put into the crucible half an ounce of lead, 
for there ought to be no more lead put in than the medicine can transmute. I 
gave him great thanks for my diminished treasure, con-centrated truly in the 
superlative degree, and put it charily up into my little box, saying I meant 
to try it the next day, nor would I reveal it to any. 'Not so, not so,' said 
he, 'for we ought to divulge all things to the children of art which may 
tend alone to the honour of God, that so they may live in the theosophical 
truth.' I now made a confession to him, that while the mass of his medicine 
was in my hands, I endeavoured to scrape away a little of it with my nail, 
and could not forbear; but scratched off so very little, that, it being 
picked from my nail, wrapped in a paper, and projected on melted lead, I 
found no transmu-tation, but almost the whole mass sublimed, while the 
remainder was a glassy earth, At this unexpected account he immediately 
said, " You are more dexterous to commit theft than to apply the medicine, 
for if you had only wrapped up the stolen prey in yellow wax, to preserve it 
from the fumes of the lead, it would have sunk to the bottom, and transmuted 
it to gold; but having cast it into the fumes, the violence of the vapour, 
partly by its sym-pathetic alliance, carried the medicine quite away.'  I 
brought him the crucible, and he perceived a most beautiful saffron-like 
tincture sticking to the sides.  He promise] to come next morning at nine 
o'clock, to show me that this tincture would transmute the lead into gold. 
Having taken his leave, I impatiently awaited his return, but the next day 
he came not, nor ever since.  He sent an excuse at half-past nine that 
morning, and promised to come at three in the afternoon, but I never heard 
QI him since.  I soon began to doubt the whole matter.  Late that night my 
wife, who was a most curious student and inquirer after the art, came 
soliciting me to make an experiment of that little grain of the stone, to be 
assured of the truth. Unless this be done,' said she, ' I shall have no rest 
or sleep this night.' She being so earnest, I commanded a fire to be made, 
saying to myself, ' I fear, I fear indeed, this man bath deluded me.' My 
wife wrapped the said matter in wax, and I Cut half an ounce of lead, and 
put it into a crucible in the fire. Being melted, my wife put in the 
medicine, made into a small pill with the wax, which presently made a 
hissing noise, and in a quarter of an hour the mass of lead was totally 
transmuted into the best and finest gold, which amaxed us exceedingly. We 
could not sufficiently gaze upon this admirable and miraculous work of 
nature, for the melted lead, after projection, showed on the fire the rarest 
and most beautiful colours imaginable, settling in green, and when poured 
forth into an ingot, it had the lively fresh colour of blood. When cold it 
shined as the purest and most splendid gold. Truly all those who were 
standing about me were exceedingly startled, and I ran with this aurified 
lead, being yet hot, to the goldsmith, who wondered at the fineness, and 
after a short trial by the test, said it was the most excellent gold in the 
world.
     "The next day a rumour of this prodigy went about the Hague and' spread 
abroad, so that many illustrious and learned persons gave me their friendly 
visits for its sake. Amongst the rest, the general Assay-master, examiner of 
coins of this province of Holland, Mr. Porelius, who with others earnestly 
besought me to pass some part of the gold through all their customary 
trials, which I did, to gratify my own curiosity. We went to Mr. Brectel, a 
silversmith, who first mixed four parts of silver with one part of the gold, 
then he filled it, put aquafortis to it, dissolved the silver, and let the 
gold precipitate to the bottom; the solution being poured off and the calx 
of gold washed with water, then reduced and melted, it appeared excellent 
gold, and instead of a loss in weight, we found the gold was increased, and 
had transmuted a scruple of the silver into gold by its abounding tincture.
     "Doubting whether the silver was now sufficiently separated from the 
gold, we mingled it with seven parts of antimony, which we melted and poured 
out into a cone, and blew off the regulus on a test, where we missed eight 
grains of our gold; but after we blew away the red of the antimony, or 
superfluous scoria, we found nine grains of gold for our eight grains 
missing, yet it was pale and silver-like but recovered its full colour 
afterwards, so that in the best proof of fire we lost nothing at all of this 
gold, but gained, as aforesaid. These tests I repeated four times and found 
it still alike, and the silver remaining out of the acquafortis was of the 
very best flexible silver that could be, so that in the total the said 
medicine or elixir had transmuted six drams and two scruples of the lead and 
silver into most pure gold."

Hermes Trismegistus (“ the thrice greatest Hermes ")  The name given by the 
Greeks to the Egyptian god Thoth or Tehuti, the god of wisdom, learning and 
literature. Thoth is alluded to in later Egyptian writings as " twice very 
great" and even as "five time. very great " in some demotic or popular 
scripts.  (ca. third century B.C.) To him was attributed as " scribe of the 
gods" the author-ship of all sacred books which were ti' us called " 
Hermetic" by the Greeks. These, according to Clemens Alexandrinus were 
forty-five in number and were sub-divided into six portions, of which the 
first dealt with priestly education, the second with temple ritual and the 
third with geographi-cal matter. The fourth division treated of astrology, 
the fifth of hymns in honour of the gods and a textbook for the guidance of 
Kings, while the sixth was medical.  It is unlikely that these books were 
all the work of one individual, and it is more probable that they represent 
the accumulated wisdom of Egypt, attributed in the course of ages to the 
great god of wisdom.
     As “scribe of the gods" Thoth was also the author of all strictly 
sacred writing.  Hence by a convenient fiction the name of Hermes was placed 
at the head of an extensive cycle of mystic literature, produced in post-
Christian times. Most of this Hermetic or Trismegistic literature has 
perished, but all that remains of it has been gathered and translated into 
English. It includes the " Poimandres," the " Perfect Sermon," or the " 
Asclepius," excerpts by Stobacus, and fragments from the Church Fathers and 
from the philosophers, Zosimus and Fulgentius.  Hitherto these writings have 
been neglected by theologians, who have dismissed them as the offspring of 
third century Neo--Platonism. According to the generally accepted view, they 
were eclectic compilations, combining Neo-Platonic philosophy, Philonic 
Judaism and Kabalistic theosophy in an attempt to supply a philosophic 
substitute for, Christianity. The many Christian elements to be found in 
these mystic scriptures were ascribed to plagiarism.  By an examination of 
early mystery writings and traditions it has been proved with some degree of 
certainty that the main source of the Trismegistic Tractates is the wisdom 
of Egypt, and that they "go back in an unbroken tradition of type and form 
and context to the earliest Ptolemaic times."
     The " Poimandres," on which all later Trismegistic literature is based, 
must, at least in its original form, be placed not later than the first 
century. The charge of plagiarism from Christian writings, therefore, falls 
to the ground.  If it can be proved that the “Poimandres" belongs to the 
first century, we have in it a valuable docu-ment in determining the 
environment and development of Christian origins.
     Mr. G. R. S. Mead, author of" Thrice Greatest Hermes" says in a 
illuminating passage
     The more one studies the best of these mystical ser-mons, casting aside 
all prejudices, and trying to feel and think with the writers, the more one 
is conscious of approaching the threshold of what may well be believed to 
have been the true adytum of the best in the mystery traditions of 
antiquity. Innumerable are the hints of the greatnesses and immensities 
lying beyond that threshold-among other precious things the vision of the 
key to Egypt's wisdom, the interpretation of apocalypsis by the light of the 
sun-clear epopteia of the intelligible cosmos.

Herne, J,; A medium who was associated with Charles Williams (q.v.) during a 
part of the latter's career and who afterwards practised on his own account. 
Materialisation was a special feature of his seances. And Miss Florence Cook 
held her first materialisation seance in conjunction with Herne. He was one 
of the mediums present on the occasion of Mrs. Guppy's famous transit, and 
was himself on one occasion transported in like manner.


Heyd : A Norwegian sea-witch or storm-fiend in the shape of a white bear, 
alluded to in the saga of Grettir. With the other storm-fiend Ham, she was 
sent by Helgi to engulf Frithjof as he sailed for the island of Yari 
Angantyr.


Heydon, John   English Astrologer (fl.-1667). In his useful if not 
invaluable Lives of the Alchemystical Philoso-phers, Waite speaks with great 
scorn of the English Astrolo-ger, John Heydon, describing him as no better 
than a charlatan, and for that reason furnishing no facts whatso-ever 
concerning his career.
     The astrologer appears to have been born in 1629, his father being 
Francis Heydon, owner of a small estate called Sidmouth, in Devonshire. It 
was not in that romantic shire, however, that the astrologer first saw the 
light of day, but at a house in London boasting the pleasant name of Green 
Arbour  and after some years spent here Heydon went to Worcestershire, when 
his education was attended to by various clergymen. Being a clever boy, his 
parents naturally desired to send him to the University, but this was soon 
rendered virtually impossible by the outbreak of the great civil war, and 
thereupon Heydon took arms on behalf of the king, and fought in several 
battles. He is said to have been successful as a soldier, and to have won to 
the captaincy of a troop of horse under Prince Rupert, but on the ultimate 
triumph of the Roundhead party, the young man found it advisable to leave 
England, and for some years he sojourned in various countries on the 
Continent, notably Spain and Turkey. Indeed, if his contemporaneous 
biographers are to be trusted, he pene-trated so far afield as Zante, the 
island in the Levant whose praise has been sung so beautifully by Edgar 
Allan Poe; but by 1652 Heydon was back in his native England, and in 1655 we 
find him studying law and established in the Temple, a place almost sacred 
by virtue of its many literary associations. Nor was law his only study, for 
soon he was deep in that craft of astrology wherewith his name was destined 
to become associated, and on one occasion, having prophesied that Cromwell 
would shortly die by hanging, he was straightway imprisoned accordingly. So, 
at least, says Thomas Carte in his life of the great-Marquis of Ormonde, 
that storehouse of information con-cerning England in Stuart and Cromwellian 
days.
     Those who take an interest in the history of medicine will doubtless 
recall Nicholas Culpeper, who, after fighting for the Parliament in the 
Civil war, devoted a wealth of energy to compiling elaborate treatises on 
astrology and pharmacopoeia, arts which went hand in hand in the seventeenth 
century. And it was the widow of this Culpeper whom Heydon took to wife, the 
year of their marriage being 1656, while it would seem that a daughter was 
born of their union, for among the astrologers' writings is a volume 
entitled Advice to a Daughter (I 658). Whether Heydon continued living in 
the Temple after his marriage is not recorded, nor do we hear that he even 
attended greatly to legal business, and it is likely, on the contrary that 
astrology occupied all his time, while it appears that that imprisonment 
already mentioned was not the only one he suffered. He became intimate with 
many of the great scientists of the Restoration, but quarrelled with a 
number of them too; while, though he always maintained that he was not 
actually affiliated with the Rosicrucians, it is a fact that he explained 
their theories publicly. Little is known about his later years, while the 
date of his death is unknown, and, before turning to the subject of his 
writings, it only behoves to state that his portrait was engraved by Thomas 
Cross.
     Mr. Waite declares that Heydon's writings are sorry pasliches, and it 
cannot be questioned that the bulk of his work is derivative, Sir Thomas 
Browne being one whom he apes particularly.  Nevertheless Heydon must be 
credited with considerable assiduity, and his Rosicrucian books alone are 
numerous, the best of them being probably The New Method of Rosie-Crucian 
Physick (1658), The Rosie-Crucian Infallible Axiomater (1660), The Wise 
Man's Crown, or The Glory of the Rosie-Cross (1664), and The Rosie- Cross 
Uncovered (I 662). In addition to them he was author of Theomagia or The 
Temple of Wisdom (1664), and The Prophetic Trumpeter, sounding an Allarum to 
England (1655), the latter being dedicated to Henry Crom-well, while 
according to Wood's Athenae Oxonicsis, Heydon was likewise the compiler of A 
Rosiecrucian Theological Dictionary. Yet another book from his pen was Idea 
of the Law, and at the end of this we find advertisements of several works 
of his, probably pamphlets, none of which is known to exist nowadays, but 
whose titles are worth recording here.  One is called The Familiar Spirit, 
another The Way to Converse with Angels, while the others are A New Method 
of Astrology, Of Scandalous Nativities, and Cabballa, or the Art by which 
Moses and Elijah did so many Miracles.  It is quite possible, of course, 
that these pam-phlets were advertised while yet in course of preparation, 
and that the author was prevented from bringing them to a finish, but their 
titles are significant, showing how far Heydon waded into the sea of 
mysticism, and suggesting that he was really more erudite therein than Mr. 
Waite imagines.

Hieroglyphs : Hieroglyphs were, and are, frequently made use of by the 
spirits in the so-called  direct " writing, i.e., writing produced without a 
medium or any physical agent. Direct writing, though frequently produced at 
seances, is perhaps most common in poltergeistic outbreaks, when the 
poltergeist is wont to distribute messages through the house.  Thus in the 
disturbance in the house of Dr. Phelps. Stratford, in 1850-1851, hieroglyphs 
were found on the walls and ceilings, while turnips covered with them were 
seen to grow from the pattern of the carpet.  On this occasion the matter 
was investigated by Andrew Jackson Davis, who recognised the hieroglyphs as 
spiritual symbols, which he was inspired to interpret as friendly messages 
from high spiritual powers.


Hilarion : (See Michael Maer.)


Hippomancy : A method of divination practised by the ancient Celts, who kept 
certain white horses in consecrated groves. These were made to walk 
immediately after the sacred car, and auguries were drawn from their move-
ments. The ancient Germans kept similar steeds in their temples.  If on 
leaving these on the outbreak of hostilities they crossed the threshold with 
the left forefoot first, the presage was regarded as an evil one, and the 
war was abandoned.

Hobgoblin, Robin Goodfellow, or Puck : An English domestic fairy or brownie 
of nocturnal habits.  He is of a happy disposition, and is believed to be 
one of the courtiers, probably the jester, at the court of Oberon.  Reginald 
Scot, in his Discovery of Witchcraft says :-" Your  gran-dames' maids were 
wont to set a bowl of milk for him for his pains in grinding of malt and 
mustard, and sweeping the house at midnight.  This white bread, and bread 
and milk, was his standard fee."  He is perhaps best known in Britain by his 
appellation of Puck, and his qualities and attributes are represented under 
this name in Shakespeare's Midsummer's Night's Dream."  By some he is 
believed to be the demon who leads men astray during the night. Sometimes he 
is clothed in a suit of leather close to his body, and sometimes he wore 
green.  He is usually repre-sented as full of tricks and mischief.


Hocus Pocus : Words of magical import, which by some are believed to be 
derived from  Ochus Bochus" a magician and demon of the north.  It is 
perhaps more probable, however, that as others say they are a corruption of 
the Latin words "hoc est corpus," and are an imitation of the act of 
transubstantiation practised by the priests of the Church of Rome.


Hod : The name assigned in the Kabbala to the number eight and meaning " 
Eternity "-that is, Eternity of the conquests achieved by mind over matter, 
active over passive, life over death.

Holland: (For early matter see Teutons).
Spiritualism.-Since the introduction of spiritualism into Holland , in 1857-
8, no small part of its history has been enacted in that country, 
notwithstanding that the phleg-matic and by no means impressionable 
temperament of the Dutchman would seem to make but an indifferent medium of 
him. The first Dutch spiritualist of whom we have record is one J. N. T. 
Marthese, who, after studying psychic phenomena in foreign countries, 
finally returned to his native Holland, bringing with him the American 
medium Home. The latter held seances at the Hague, before several learned 
societies, and by command of Queen Sophia, a seance was given in her 
presence. The medium himself, in an account of the performance, tells us 
that the royal lady was obliged to sit out seven seances, on con-secutive 
evenings, before any results were obtained. These results, however, were 
apparently satisfactory, for the Queen was thereafter a staunch supporter of 
the movement. During Home's visit, spiritualism gained a considerable hold 
on the people of Holland, and the practice of giving small private seances 
became fairly wide-spread.  Spirit voices were heard at these gatherings, 
the touch of spirit hands was felt, and musical instruments were played upon 
by invisible performers.  Particularly were these seances appreciated which 
were held at the house of Mr. T. D. Van Herwerden, in the Hague, and which 
were attended by many enthusiastic students of spiritualistic phenomena. His 
medium was, as a rule, a Japanese boy of his household, about fourteen years 
old, and very ignorant.  The mani-festations ranged from spirit rapping and 
table turning in the earlier seances to form materialisation in those of a 
later date.  One of the principal spirits purported to be a monk, Paurellus, 
who had been assassinated some three hundred years previously in that city.  
Afterwards Mr. Van Herwerden was induced by his friends to publish his 
diary, under the title of Experiences and Communications on a still 
Mysterious Territory.  For a time, as has been said, spiritualistic seances 
were only conducted in family circles, and were of a quite private nature.  
But as the attention of the intellectuals became more and more directed to 
the new science, societies were formed to pro-mote research, and to throw 
light upon that which was obscure and perplexing. The first of these was the 
society called the  “Oromase," or Ormuzd, which was founded by Major J. 
Revius, a friend of Marthese, in 1859, and which included among its numbers 
many people of high repute. They met at the Hague, and the records of their 
transactions were carefully preserved.  Major Revius was president and 
continued to act in that capacity till 1871, the year of his death. The 
society's secretary, A. J. Rita, was also a prominent worker in " the 
cause."  The " “Oromase" library contained a fine collection of works on 
spiritualism, mesmerism, and kindred subjects, and included American, 
French, German and English hooks.  Another society, the "Veritas," was 
founded in Amsterdam in 1869.  The studies of this latter association were 
conducted in a some-what less searching and scientific spirit than those of 
the Oromase."  Its mediums specialized in trance utterances and written 
communications from the spirits, and its members inclined to a belief in re-
incarnation, which was at variance with the opinions of the older society.  
Rotterdam had, for a time, a society with similar objects known as the ' 
Research after Truth," but it soon came to an end, though its members 
continued to devote themselves privately to the investigation of spirit 
phenomena.  Other equally short-lived societies were formed in Haarlem and 
other towns.  In all of these, however, there was a dearth of mediums able 
to produce form materializations, and to supply the want a number of foreign 
mediums hastened to Holland.  Hitherto the comparatively private nature of 
the seances, and the high standing of those who took part in them, had 
prevented the periodicals from making any but the most cautious comments on 
the seances.  But the advent of professional mediums on the scene swept away 
the barrier and let loose a flood of journalistic ridicule and criticism. 
This in turn provoked the supporters of spirit-ualism to retort, and soon a 
lively battle was in progress between the spiritualists and the sceptics. 
The con-sequence was, that "the cause" was boomed as much by the articles 
which derided it as by those which were in favour of it.  Such mediums as 
Mrs. Margaret Fox Kane, the Davenport brothers, Rita, Home, Miss Cook, and 
Henry Slade, came over to Holland.  Writers arose who were prepared to 
devote their abilities to the defence of spiritualism.  Such an one was 
Madame Ruse van Calcar, who not only wrote a novel expounding spiritualistic 
principles, but also conducted a monthly journal "On the Boundaries of Two 
Worlds," and held a sort of spiritualistic salon, where enthusiasts could 
meet and discuss their favourite subject.  Dr. H. de Grood, Dr. J. Van 
Veizen, Dr. Van der Loef, Herr Schimmel, are among the other prominent Dutch 
authors who wielded their pens in defence of the same opinions. The writings 
of Professors Varley, Crookes, and Wallace were translated into the Dutch 
lan-guage, and lecturers helped to spread the belief in com-munication with 
the Other World. A mesmerist, Signor Donata, carried on the practice of 
"Animal Magnetism" in Holland, and endeavoured to identify the magnetic 
force emanating from the operator with the substance of which disembodied 
spirits are composed. Many exposures were made of unscrupulous mediums, and 
these, naturally, cast discredit upon the entire movement.  But on the whole 
the mediums, professional or otherwise, were well received.  Such phases of 
psychic phenomena as haunted houses and poltergeists are also very common, 
but are 50 similar to these manifestations in other countries that they 
require no separate treatment.


Holly : This name is probably a corruption of the word "holy" as this plant 
has been used from time immemorial as a protection against evil influence.  
It was hung round, or planted near houses, as a protection against 
lightning. Its common use at Christmas is apparently the survival of an 
ancient Roman custom, occurring during the festival to Saturn, to which god 
the holly was dedicated. While the Romans were holding this feast, which 
occurred about the time of the winter solstice, they decked the outsides of 
their houses with holly  at the same time the Christians were quietly 
celebrating the birth of Christ, and to avoid detection, they outwardly 
followed the custom of their heathen neighbours, and decked their houses 
with holly also. In this way the holly came to be connected with our Christ-
mas customs.  This plant was also regarded as a symbol of the resurrection. 
The use of mistletoe along with holly is probably due to the notion that in 
winter the fairies took shelter under its leaves, and that they protected 
all who sheltered the plant.  The origin of kissing under the mistletoe is 
considered to have come from our Saxon ancestors, who regarded this plant as 
dedicated to Freya, the goddess of love.


Holy Trinity Church, York : (See Haunted Houses).


Home, Daniel Dunglas (1833-1886): One of the best known of spiritualistic 
mediums, was born near Edinburgh in 1833.  At the age of nine he was taken 
by his aunt to America, where in 1850 he became a convert to the new 
doctrine of spiritualism and himself developed mediumistic powers.  The next 
five years saw him occupied in giving seances in New York and elsewhere.  In 
1855 some of his friends subscribed a sum of money to send him to Europe. In 
England his seances were attended by many notable people, and on the 
Continent also be was admitted into the highest society.  Until 1859 he had 
subsisted on the bounty of his wealthy friends-for at no time did he take 
actual fees for his services-but in that year he married a Russian lady of 
noble birth, young, charming, and possessed of means.  But on her death in 
1862 his financial circum-stances were altered again.  Four years later he 
was adopted by a wealthy widow, Mrs. Lyon, who made him large money gifts.  
In a few mouths, however, she tired of her adopted son and sued him in the 
law courts for the recovery of her "gifts."  The charge of fraud was not 
proved, and many distinguished persons filed affidavits testifying to the 
actuality of Home's mediumistic powers, but the court was not satisfied that 
he had not influenced Mrs. Lyon, and judgment was given in her favour.  
During all this time he had largely exercised his faculties as a medium, and 
in 1870-72 he held a series of sittings with Sir William Crookes In 1871 he 
married again, and for the second time his wife was a Russian lady of means. 
From 1872 onwards he lived mostly on the Continent, where he died in 1886, 
after a long and painful illness. Home's mediumship presents many remarkable 
features. His seances were productive of both trance and physical phenomena, 
the latter including raps and table-tilting, levitation and elongation, 
materialisa-tion, the fire-ordeal, and practically every form of manifes-
tation. Unlike other mediums, he was never detected in fraud, though his 
mediumship was spread over so many years, and his phenomena are among the 
best-attested in the records of spiritualism. But a more important factor in 
Home's success was his wonderful personality. Though of lowly birth, he 
early acquired an ease and charm of manner which fitted him for the good 
society wherein he was destined to move.  Artless and spontaneous and very 
affectionate, of pleasing manners and generous disposition, he won the 
hearts of all with whom he came in contact, and inspired in his sitters an 
emotional confidence which seems frequently to have over-ruled their 
judgment.  Sir W. Crookes said of him that he was "one of the most lovable 
of men," whose "perfect genuineness and upright-ness were beyond suspicion."  
Whether a medium should ever be " beyond suspicion" to a scientific 
investigator is, of course, open to question, but the instance shows 
abundantly that even scientists are not immune from the influence of 
personal magnetism.



Homunculas: An artificial man supposed to have been made by the alchemists, 
and especially by Paracelsus. To manufacture one, he states that the needful 
spagyric substances should be taken and shut up in a glass phial, and 
afterwards be placed to digest in horse-dung for the space of forty days.  
At the end of this time, there will be something which will begin to move 
and live in the bottle. This something is a man, but a man who has no body 
and is transparent. Nevertheless, he exists, and nothing remains but to 
bring him up-which is not more difficult to do than to make him. You may 
accomplish it by daily feeding him-during forty weeks, and without 
extricating him from his dung-hill-with the arcanum of human blood. At the 
end of this time you shall have a veritable living child, having every 
member as well-proportioned as any infant born of a woman. He will only be 
much smaller than an ordinary child, and his physical education will require 
more care and attention.


Hopedale Community: A socialistic and religious community founded in 1842 
near Milford in Massachusetts, by the Rev. Adin Ballon. In 1850 various 
spirit manifestations made their appearance in the Community, while on the 
death of its founder in 1852, communications of a spiritual-istic cast, 
purporting to come from him, were received through the hand of a living 
member of the Community. The little hand at Hopedale did a good deal to help 
the advance of Spiritualism.


Hopkins, Matthew: Called the Witchfinder; flourished in 1640.  Of him Godwin 
says, "Nothing can place the credulity of the English nation on the subject 
of witchcraft in a more striking point of view, than the history of Matthew 
Hopkins, who, in a pamphlet published in 1647 in his own vindication, 
assumes to himself the surname of the Witch-finder.  He fell by accident, in 
his native country of Suffolk, into contact with one or two reputed witches, 
and, being a man of an observing turn and an ingenious invention, struck out 
for himself a trade, which brought him such moderate returns as sufficed to 
maintain him, and at the same time gratified his ambition by making him a 
terror to many, and the object of admiration and gratitude to more, who felt 
themselves indebted to him for ridding them of secret and intestine enemies, 
against whom, as long as they proceeded in ways that left no footsteps 
behind, they felt they had no possibility of guarding themselves."
     After two or three successful experiments, Hopkins en-gaged in a 
regular tour of the countries of Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex and 
Huntingdonshire.  He united to him two con-federates, a man named John 
Stern, and a woman whose name has not been handed down to us. They visited 
every town in their route that invited them, and secured to them the 
moderate remuneration of twenty shillings and their expenses, leaving what 
was more than this to the spontaneous gratitude of those who should deem 
themselves indebted to the exertions of Hopkins and his party.  By this 
expedient they secured to themselves a favourable reception and a set of 
credulous persons who would listen to their dictates as so many oracles.  
Being three of them, they were enabled to play the game into one another's 
hands, and were sufficiently strong to overawe all timid and irresolute 
opposition.  In every town to which they came, they inquired for reputed 
witches, and having taken them into custody, were secure for the most part 
of a certain number of zealous abettors, and took care that they should have 
a clear stage for their experiments. They overawed their helpless victims 
with a certain air of authority, as if they had received a commission from 
heaven for the discovery of misdeeds.  They assailed the poor creatures with 
a multitude of questions constructed in the most artful manner. They 
stripped them naked, in search for the devil's marks in different parts of 
their bodies, which they ascertained by running pins to the head into those 
parts, that, if they were genuine marks, would prove themselves such by 
their insensibility.  They swam their victims in rivers and ponds, it being 
an un-doubted fact, that, if the persons accused were true witches the 
water, which was the symbol of admission into the Christian Church, would 
not receive them into its bosom. If the persons examined continued 
obstinate, they seated them in constrained and uneasy attitudes, 
occasionally binding them with cords, and compelling them to remain so 
without food or sleep for twenty-four hours.  They walked them up and down 
the room, two taking them under each arm, till they dropped down with 
fatigue. They carefully swept the room in which the experiment was made, 
that they might keep away spiders and flies, which were supposed to be 
devils or their imps in that disguise.
     The most plentiful inquisition of Hopkins and his con-federates was in 
the years 1644, 1645, and 1646.  At length there were so many persons 
committed to prison upon suspicion of witchcraft, that the government was 
com-pelled to take in hand the affair.  The rural magistrates before whom 
Hopkins and his confederates brought their victims, were obliged, willingly 
or unwillingly, to commit them for trial.  A commission "'as granted to the 
earl of Warwick and others to hold a session of jail-delivery against them 
for Essex at Chelmsford.  Lord Warwick was at this time the most popular 
nobleman in England.  He was appointed by the parliament lord high admiral 
during the civil war.  He was much courted by the independent clergy, was 
shrewd, penetrating and active, and exhibited a singular mixture of pious 
demeanour with a vein of facetiousness and jocularity.  With him was sent 
Dr. Calamy, the most eminent divine of the period of the Commonwealth, to 
see (says Baxter) that no fraud was committed, or wrong done to the parties 
accused.  It may well be doubted, however, whether the presence of this 
clergyman did not operate unfavourably to the persons suspected.  He 
preached before the judges.  It may readily be believed, considering the 
temper of the times, that he insisted much upon the horrible nature of the 
sin of witchcraft, which could expect no pardon, either in the world or the 
world to come.
     He sat on the bench with the judges, and participated in their 
deliberations.  In the result of this inquisition sixteen persons were 
hanged at Yarmouth in Norfolk, fifteen at Chelmsford, and sixty at various 
places in the county of Suffolk. Whitlocke in his Memorials of English 
Affairs, under the date of 1649, speaks of many witches being apprehended 
about Newcastle, upon the information of a person whom he calls the Witch-
finder, who, as his experi-ments were nearly the same, though he is not 
named, we may reasonably suppose to be Hopkins; and in the follow-ing year 
about Boston in Lincolnshire.  In 1652 and 1653 the same author speaks of 
women in Scotland, who were put to incredible torture to extort from them a 
confession of what their adversaries imputed to them.
     The fate of Hopkins was such as might be expected in similar cases. The 
multitude are at first impressed with horror at the monstrous charges that 
are advanced.  They are seized, as by contagion, with terror at the 
mischiefs which seem to impend over them, and from which no innocence and no 
precaution appear to afford them sufficient protec-tion.  They hasten, as 
with an unanimous effort, to avenge themselves upon these malignant enemies, 
whom Cod and man alike combine to expel from society.  But, after a time, 
they begin to reflect, and to apprehend that they have acted with too much 
precipitation, that they have been led on with uncertain appearances. They 
see one victim led to the gallows after another, without stint or 
limitation.  They see one dying with the most solemn asseverations of 
innocence, and another confessing apparent-ly she knows not what, what is 
put into her mouth by her relentless persecutors. They see these victims 
old, crazy and impotent, harassed beyond endurance by the ingenious 
cruelties that are practised against them.  They were first urged on by 
implacable hostility and fury, to be satisfied with nothing but blood.  But 
humanity and remorse also have their turn.  Dissatisfied with themselves, 
they are glad to point their resentment against another. The man that at 
first they hailed as a public benefactor, they presently come to regard with 
jealous eyes, and begin to consider as a cunning imposter, dealing in cool 
blood with the lives of his fellow-creatures for a paltry gain, and, still 
more horrible, for the lure of a perishable and short-lived fame. The 
multitude, we are told, after a few seasons, rose upon Hopkins and resolved 
to subject Mm to one of his own criterions.  They dragged him to a pond and 
threw him into the water for a witch.  It seems he floated on the surface, 
as a witch ought to do.  They then pursued him with hootings and revilings. 
and drove him for ever into that obscurity and ignominy which he had amply 
merited.

Horbehutet: The Egyptian winged disk.  He was a solar deity who accompanied 
the sun-god, Ra, on his daily journey across Egypt for the purpose of 
warding off evil from him.  His symbol was placed over the gates and doors 
of temples to protect them from malign influences.

Horse-Whispering: A secret method by which certain persons are able to 
acquire power over refractory horses.  As is well known to students of gypsy 
lore, that interesting people appear to be in possession of some secret by 
which they are enabled to render vicious horses entirely tame; and opinions 
are divided as to whether this secret consists in the application of a 
certain odour or balm to the horse's muzzle, or whispering into its ear a 
spell or incantation. It is said, indeed, that the gypsy horse-charmer 
applies aniseed to the nose of the animal.  But besides being practised by 
gypsies, horse-whispering is in vogue amongst many other peoples.  Camden in 
his Recital of Irish Superstitions says :-" It is by no means allowable to 
praise a horse or any other animal unless you say 'God save him.'  If any 
mischance befalls a horse in three days after, they find out the person who 
commended him, that he may whisper the Lord's Prayer in his right ear."  It 
was said by Con Sullivan, a famous Irish horse-whisperer of the eighteenth 
century, that it is out of the power of the professors of the art to explain 
the source of their influence, -the same thing being affirmed by those who 
practise it in South America, where a couple of men will tame half a dozen 
wild horses in three days. The same art is widely practised in Hungary and 
Bohemia, and it was from a Bohemian gypsy that a family in the county of 
Cork claimed to hold a secret by which the wildest or most vicious horse 
could be tamed.  For generations this secret was regularly transmitted as a 
parting legacy at the time of death from the father to the eldest son.
     Throughout the North of Scotland there are disseminated members of a 
secret society for the breaking in of refractory horses, which is believed 
to be called the Horseman's Society, and which purports to be able to trace 
its origin away back into the dark ages  Those only are admitted who gain 
their livelihood by the care and management of horses, and the more affluent 
and better educated are jealously excluded. Many farmers entertain a 
prejudice against the members of the society, but they are forced to admit 
that they are always very capable in the manage-ment of their teams, and can 
perform services which would otherwise require the calling in of a 
veterinary surgeon. They are usually skilled in the knowledge of herbs and 
simple", and a great deal of the marvellous is imputed to them.  In fact it 
is stated that they hold their meetings at night and in the clear moonlight, 
going through various equestrian performances with horses borrowed for the 
occasion from their masters' stables. There is further said to be an inner 
circle in the society, where the black art and all the spells and charms of 
witchcraft are the objects of study, and the members of which can smite the 
horses and cattle with mysterious sickness, and even cast a glamour over 
human beings.  Indeed a local writer goes so far as to say that the inner 
circle of the Horsemen employ hypnotic influence both on men and animals, as 
it is said certain North-American Indians, and some of the jungle tribes of 
Hindustan, do.
     The famous Con Sullivan has already been alluded to, and his 
achievements were really wonderful.  On one occasion his services were 
requisitioned by Colonel Westenra afterwards Earl of Rosmore, who possessed 
a racehorse called " Rainbow," of the most savage description. which would 
attack any jockey courageous enough to mount him by seizing him by the leg 
with his teeth, and dragging him from the saddle.  A friend of the Colonel's 
told him that he knew a person who could cure Rainbow, and a wager of 1,000 
pounds was laid on the matter.  Con Sullivan, who was known throughout the 
countryside as 
"The Whisperer" was sent for, and after being shut up alone with the animal 
for a quarter of an hour, he gave the signal for the admission of those who 
had been waiting on the result.  When they entered, they found the horse 
extended on his back, playing like a kitten with Sullivan, who was quietly 
sitting by him; but both horse and operator appeared exhausted, and the 
latter had to be revived with brandy. The horse was perfectly tame and 
gentle from that day.  Another savage steed named " King Pippin" took an 
entire night to cure, but in the morning he was seen following Sullivan like 
a dog, lying down at the word of command, and permitting any person to put 
his hand into his mouth.  Shortly afterwards he won a race at the Curragh.  
Sullivan is described by one who knew him well as an ignorant rustic of the 
lower class, but there can be no question as to his extraordinary powers.
     The statement of Sullivan is probably correct, that the successful 
whisperer is not acquainted with the secret of his own power.  "The reason," 
says Rich, "is obvious. A force proceeding immediately from the will or the 
in-stinctive life would be impaired by reflection in the under-standing and 
broken up or at least diminished by one half. The violent trembling of the 
animal under this operation is like the creaking and shivering of the tables 
before they begin to ' tip,' and indicates a moral or nervous force acting 
physically, by projection perhaps from the spirit of the operator. None of 
these cases are, after all, more wonderful than the movement of our Own 
limbs and bodies by mental force, for how does it move them with such ease ?  
And may not the same power that place" its strong but invisible little 
fingers on every point of our muscular frames, stretch its myriad arms a 
little further into the sphere around us, and operate by the same laws, and 
with as much ease, on the stalwart frame of a horse, or even a clothes-
horse?


House of Light: (See Babylonia.)


House of Washing : (See Babylonia.)


House of Wisdom: The tarik or "path" of the House of Wisdom was founded by 
Moslem mystics at Cairo in the ninth century, and had seven initiatory 
degrees. The original founder appears to have been one Abdallah. a Persian, 
who, believing in the Gnostic doctrine of the Aeons or Sephiroths, applied 
the system to the successors of Mohammed, stating that Ismael was the 
founder of his tarik and one of his descendants as the seventh Imaum. He 
established an active system of propaganda and sent missionaries far and 
wide.  He was succeeded in his office as chief of the society by his son and 
grandson. After the institution bad been in existence for some time it was 
transferred to Cairo, and assemblies were held twice a week, when all the 
members appeared clothed in white. They were gradually advanced through the 
seven degrees of which the tarih consisted, and over which a Dai-al-doat or 
" Missionary of missionaries " presided. A later chief. Hakem-bi-emir-Illah, 
increased the degrees to nine, and in 1004 erected a stately home for the 
society, which he elaborately furnished with mathematical instruments.  As 
the institution did not meet with the approval of the authorities, it was 
destroyed in 1123 by the then Grand Vizier, but meetings continued 
elsewhere. The officers of the society were -Sheik, Dai-el-keber, or Deputy, 
Dai, or Master, Refik, or Fellow, Fedavie, or Agent, Lassik, or Aspirant, 
Muemini, or Believer. The teaching was to the effect that there had been 
seven holy Imaums, that God had sent seven Lawgivers, who had each seven 
helpers, who in turn had each twelve apostles.  (See Assassins.)

Huet, Pierre-Daniel: A celebrated bishop of Avrenches, who died in 1721.  
One finds in his Reminiscences many inter-esting passages relating to the 
vampires by the Greek Archipelago.  "Many strange things," he says "are told 
of the broucolagnes, or vampires of the Archipelago.  It is said in that 
country that if one leads a wicked life, and dies in sin, he will appear 
again after death as he was wont in his lifetime, and that such a person 
will cause great affright among the living."  Huet believed that the bodies 
of such people were abandoned to the power of the devil, who retained the 
soul within them for the vexation of mankind.  Father Richard, a Jesuit, 
employed on a mission in these islands, provided Huet with details of many 
cases of vampirism.  In the Island of St. Erini, the Thera of the ancients 
occurred one of the greatest chapters in the history of vampirism.  He says 
that these people were tormented by vampires, that they were constantly 
disinterring corpses for the purpose of burning them Huet states that this 
evidence is worthy of credence as emanating from a witness of unimpeachable 
honesty, who has had ocular demonstrations of what he writes about. He 
further says that the inhabitants of these islands after the death of a 
person, cut off his feet, bands, nose, and ears, and they call this act 
acroteriazein.  They hang all these round the elbow of the dead.  It is 
noteworthy that the bishop appears to think that the modern Greeks may have 
inherited the practice of burning bodies from their fathers in classical 
times, and that they imagine that unless the corpse is given to the flames, 
all cannot be well with the soul of the deceased.

Hun-Came:	(See Hell.)


Hungerford, Lord: (See England.)


Huns: The ancient historians credited the Huns with a monstrous origin. They 
were often called children of the devil, because it was said that they were 
born of a union between demons and hideous witches, the latter cast out of 
their own county by Philimer, king of the Goths, and his army.  The old 
writers state that the Huns were of horrible deformity, and could not be 
mistaken for anything but the children of demons.  Besoldus, following 
Servin, claims that their name of Huns comes from a Celtic or barbaric word 
signifying great magicians.  Many stories are told of their magic prowess, 
and of their raising spectres to assist them in battle.


Hydromancy : Divination by water, is said by Natalis Comes to have been the 
invention of Nereus, and according to Delrio, a most respectable authority 
in these matters, it is a method of divination than which nulla faecundior 
im-posturis.  Iamblichus, he says, mentions one kind of hydromancy to which 
the Emperor Andronicus Comnenus had recourse ; not in person, for regard for 
his character (a character richly demanding such caution !) forbade this 
humiliation. This worthy applied to Sethos, a diviner, who from his youth 
upward had been addicted to magic, and on that account had been deprived of 
sight by the Emperor Manuel.  The question proposed by hydromancy was, who 
was to he the successor of Andronicus, a doubt which grievously perplexed 
the superstitious tyrant, and left him in hesitation as to the fittest 
victim whom his suspicious vengeance might first sacrifice.  The evil spirit 
when summoned, showed upon the water the letters S.I., and upon being asked 
at what time the person so designated should succeed, he replied, before the 
Feast of the exalta-tion of the Cross.  His prediction was verified, for, 
within the time named, Isaac Angelus had thrown Andronicus to be torn in 
pieces by the infuriated populace of Constantin-ople.  It should be 
remembered here that the devil spells, as he repeats the Lord's Prayer, not 
in the natural order, but backwards.  S.I., when inverted, would fairly 
enough represent Isaac, according to all laws of magic.
     The same story is related with great spirit by Nicetas. The arts with 
which the tempter cheats the ear of his votary are vividly displayed, and 
there is one very pic-turesque touch, when the fiend is asked respecting 
time, which we are surprised should have escaped Delrio, who evidently 
burrows from this source, though he refers to lamblichus. The annalist has 
already remarked that he neither knows, nor indeed wishes to know, the 
method of practising hydromancy, but Delrio, on the contrary, describes 
several kinds.  In one a ring was suspended by a thread in a vessel of 
water, and this being shaken, a judg-ment was formed according to the 
strokes of the ring against the sides of the vessel.  In a second, three 
pebbles were thrown into standing water, and observations were drawn from 
the circles which they formed.  A third depended upon the agitations of the 
sea, whence the learned Jesuit deduces a custom prevalent among the Oriental 
Christians of annually baptizing that element; at the same time taking 
especial care to show that the betrothment of the Adriatic by the Doge of 
Venice has a widely different origin.  A fourth divination was taken from 
the colour of water, and certain figures appearing in it, which Varro says 
afforded numerous prognostics of the event of the Mithridatic War.  But this 
branch was of sufficient importance to deserve a separate name, and we read 
accordingly of divination by fountains, these being the waters most 
frequently consulted.  Among the most celebrated fountains for this purpose 
were those of Palicorus in Sicily, which invariably destroyed the criminal 
who ventured to adjure them falsely in testimony of his innocence.  A full 
account of their usage and virtue is given by Macrobius.  Pausanias has 
described a fountain near Epidaurus, dedicated to Ino, into which on her 
festival, certain loaves were wont to be thrown.  It was a favourable omen 
to the applicant if these offerings were retained  on the other hand, most 
unlucky if they were washed up again.  So, also, Tiberius cast golden dice 
into the fountain of Apomus, near Padua, where they long remained as a proof 
of the imperial monster's good fortune in making the highest throw.  Several 
other instances of divining springs may be found collected by the diligence 
of Boissard; and to a belief in them Delrio thinks a custom of the ancient 
Germans is referable, who threw their new-born children into the Rhine, with 
a conviction that if they were spurious they would sink, if legitimate they 
would swim.  In a fifth method, certain mysterious words were pronounced 
over a cup full of water, and observations were made upon its spontaneous 
ebullition.  In a sixth, a drop of oil was let fall on water in a glass 
vessel, and this furnished as it were a mirror upon which many wonderful 
objects became visible. This, says Delrio, is the Modus Fessanus. Clemens 
Alexandrinus is cited for a seventh kind, in which the women of Germany 
watched the sources, whirls, and courses of rivers, with a view to prophetic 
interpretation the same fact is mentioned by Vives in his Commentary upon 
St. Agustine.  In modern Italy, continues the learned Jesuit, diviners are 
still to be found who write the names of any three persons suspected of 
theft upon a like number of little balls, which they throw into the water 
and some go to so profane an extent as to abuse even holy water for this 
most unsanctified purpose.  Boissard, as cited above, has explained more 
fully than Delno two of these methods of hydromancy, that by the ring 
suspended in a vessel of water, and the method by its spontaneous 
ebullition.  A very similar account is given by Wierus.
     In a fragment of Varro's book, de Cultu Deorum, the practice of 
hydromancy is attributed to Numa.  Upon this statement St. Augustine has 
commented in the passage to 'which we have already referred, and he mentions 
that the practice of hydromancy was attributed by Varro to the Persians, and 
afterwards to the philosopher Pythagoras. Strabo in like manner has ascribed 
the practice to the Persians
     Hydromancy is, in principle, the same thing as divination by the 
crystal or mirror, and in ancient times a natural basin of rock kept 
constantly full by a running stream, was a favourite medium.  The double 
meaning of the 'word "reflection" ought here to be considered, and how 
gazing down into clear water, the mind is disposed to self-retirement and to 
contemplation, deeply tinctured with melancholy.  Rocky pools and glomy 
lakes figure in all stories of witchcraft-witness the Craic-pol-nain in the 
Highland woods of Laynchork; the Devil's Glen in the county of Wicklow, 
Ireland; the Swedish Blokula; the witch mountains of Italy; and the 
Bibiagora, between Hungary and Poland.  Similar resorts in the glens of 
Germany were marked, as Tacitus mentions, by salt springs; for this again 
there was an additional good reason, which would carry us far from the 
present subject to explain.
     It was really only another form of divination by the gloomy water pool 
that attracted so much public attention at that time, when Mr. Lane, in his 
work on Modern Egypt testified to its success as practised in Egypt and 
Hindostan. That gentleman having resolved to witness the performance of this 
species of sorcery, the magician commenced his operations by writing forms 
of invocation to his familiar spirits or, six slips of paper, a chafing dish 
with some live charcoal in it was then procured, and a boy summoned who had 
not yet reached the age of puberty. Mr. Lane inquired who were the persons 
that could see in the fluid mirror, and was told that they were a boy not 
arrived at puberty, a virgin, a black female slave, and a pregnant woman.  
To prevent any collusion between the sorcerer and the boy, Mr. Lane sent his 
servant to take the first boy he met.  When all was prepared, the sorcerer 
threw some incense and one of the strips of paper into the chafing-dish; he 
then took hold of the boy's right hand, and drew a square with some mystical 
marks on the palm; in the centre of the square he poured a little ink, which 
formed the magic mirror, and desired the boy to look steadily into it 
without raising his head.  In this mirror the boy declared that he saw 
successively, a man sweeping, seven men with flags, an army pitching its 
tents, and the various officers of state attending on the Sultan.  The rest 
must be told by Mr. Lane himself.
     "The sorcerer now addressed himself to me, and asked me if I wished the 
hey to see any person who was absent or dead.  I named Lord Nelson, of whom 
the boy had evi-dently never heard, for it was with much difficulty that he 
pronounced the name after several trials. The magician desired the boy to 
say to the Sultan, ' My master salutes thee and desires thee to bring Lord 
Nelson; bring him before my eyes that I may see him speedily.' The boy then 
said so, and almost immediately added, 'A messenger has gone and brought 
back a man dressed in a black (or rather, dark blue) Suit of European 
clothes; the man has lost his left arm.'  He then paused for a moment or 
two, and looking more intently and more closely into the ink, said No, he 
has not lost his left arm, but it is placed on his breast.' This correction 
made his description more striking than it had been without it; since Lord 
Nelson generally had his empty sleeve attached to the breast of Ills coat; 
but it was the right arm that he had lost.  With out saying that I suspected 
the boy had made a mistake, I asked the magician whether the objects 
appeared in the ink as if actually before the eyes, or as if in a glass, 
which makes the right appear left.  He answered that they appeared as in a 
mirror.  This rendered the boy's descrip-tion faultless. Though completely 
puzzled, I was some-what disappointed with his performances, for they fell 
short of what he had accomplished in many instances in presence of certain 
of my friends and countrymen.  On one of these occasions an Englishman 
present ridiculed the performance, and said that nothing would satisfy him 
but a correct description of the appearance of his own father, of whom he 
was sure no one of the company had any knowledge.  The boy, accordingly, 
having called by name for the person alluded to, described a man in a Frank 
dress, with his hand placed on his head, wearing spectacles, and with one 
foot on the ground and the other raised behind him, as if he were stepping 
down from a seat. The description was exactly true in every respect; the 
peculiar position of the hand was occasioned by an almost constant headache, 
and that of the foot or leg by a stiff knee, caused by a fall from a horse 
in hunting.  On another occasion Shakespeare was described with the most 
minute exactness. both as to person and dress, and I might add several other 
cases in with the same magician has excited astonishment in the sober minds 
of several Englishmen of my acquain-tance."  So far Mr. Lane, whose account 
may be compared with that given by Mr. Kinglake, the author of Eothen.
     It may be worth adding, that in another case of hydromancy known to 
Elihu Rich, the boy could see better without the medium than with it-though 
he could also see reflected images in a vessel of water.  This fact may be 
admitted to prove that such images are reflected to the eye of the seer from 
his own mind and brain; how the brain becomes thus enchanted, or the eye 
disposed for vision, is another question; certainly it is no proof that the 
recollected image in the mind of the inquirer is transferred to the seer, as 
proofs can be shown to the contrary.

Hyperaesthesia: An actual or apparent exaltation of the perceptive 
faculties, characteristic of the hypnotic state. The smallest suggestion, 
whether given by word, look, gesture, or even breathing or unconscious 
movement, is instantly seized upon and interpreted by the entranced subject, 
who for this reason is often termed " sensitive." The phenomenon of 
hyperaesthesia, observed but wrongly interpreted by the early magnetists and 
mesmerists, was largely responsible for the so-called clairvoyance, thought-
reading. community of sensation, and other kindred phenomena. The 
realisation of suggestion and hyperaes-thesia was the great achievement of 
Beltrand and Braid, which brought hypnotism into the domain of scientific 
fact. The significance of hyperaesthesia in connection with every form of 
psychic phenomena can hardly be over estimated. Nor is it met with only in 
the trance state.  It enters into the normal existence to an extent that is 
but imperfectly understood.  Dreams, for instance, frequently reproduce 
impressions which have been recorded in some obscure stratum of 
consciousness, while much that we call intuition is made up of inferences 
subconsciously drawn from indica-tions too subtle to reach the normal 
consciousness. Hyper-aesthesia has been defined above as "an actual or 
apparent exaltation of the perceptive faculties." The reason for this is 
that modern scientists declare that it is not known whether the senses are 
actually sharpened or not. Most probably the hyperaesthetic perception is 
merely a normal perception which by reason of the state of cerebal dissocia-
tion operates in a free field. Very slight sense-impressions may be recorded 
in the brain during normal consciousness, but such is the inhibiting effect 
of the excitement occasioned by other similar impressions, that they do not 
reach full consciousness.


Hypnosis  (See Hypnotism).


Hypnotism: A peculiar state of cerebral dissociation dis-tinguished by 
certain marked symptoms, the most prominent and invariable of which is a 
highly increased suggestibility in the subject. The hypnotic state may be 
induced in a very large percentage of normal individuals, or may occur 
spontaneously. It is recognised as having an affinity with normal sleep, and 
likewise with a variety of abnormal conditions, among which may be mentioned 
somnambulism, ecstasy, and the trances of Hindu fakirs and savage medicine-
men.  In fact, in one or other of their forms, hypnosis and its kindred have 
been known in practically all countries and all times.
     Hypnotism is no longer classed with the occult sciences. It has gained, 
though only within comparatively recent years, a definite scientific status, 
and no mean place in legitimate medicine.  Nevertheless its history is 
inextricably interwoven with occultism, and even to-day much hypnotic 
phenomena is classed as "spiritualistic"; so that the consideration of 
hypnotism in this place is very necessary to a proper understanding of much 
of the occult science of our own and former times.
    The Early Magnetists - So far back as the 16th century hypnotic 
phenomena were observed and studied by men of science, who attributed them 
to magnetism, an effluence radiating from every object in the universe, in a 
greater or less degree, and through which all objects might exercise a 
mutual influence one on another.  From this doctrine was constructed the 
"sympathetic" system of medicine, by means of which the magnetic effluence 
of the planets, of the actual magnet, or of the physician, was brought to 
bear upon the patient.  Paracelsus is generally supposed to be the 
originator of the sympathetic system, as he was its most powerful exponent.  
Of the magnet he says
     "The magnet has long lain before all eyes, and no one has ever thought 
whether it was of any further use, or whether it possessed any other 
property, than that of attracting iron.  The sordid doctors throw it in my 
face that I will not follow the ancients; but in 'what should I follow them 
?  All that they have said of the magnet amounts to nothing.  Lay that which 
I have said of it in the balance, and judge.  Had I blindly followed others, 
and had I not myself made experiments, I should in like manner how nothing 
more than what every peasant sees-that it attracts iron. But a wise man must 
enquire for himself, and it is thus that I have discovered that the magnet, 
besides this obvious and to every man visible power, that of attracting 
iron, possesses another and concealed power."
-That of healing the sick.
     And there is no doubt that cures were actually effected by Paracelsus 
with the aid of the magnet, especially in cases of epilepsy and nervous 
affections.  Yet the word "magnet" is most frequently used by Paracelsus and 
his followers in a figurative sense, to denote the magnes microcosmi, man 
himself, who was supposed to be a repro-duction in miniature of the earth, 
having, like it, his poles and magnetic properties From the stars and 
planets, he taught, came a very subtle effluence which affected man's mind 
or intellect, while earthly substances radiated a grosser emanation which 
affected his body. The human mummy especially was a "magnet"  well suited 
for remedial purposes, since it draws to itself the diseases and poisonous 
properties of other substances. The most effective mummy was that of a 
criminal who had been hanged, and it was applied in the following manner.  
"If a person suffer from disease, " says Paracelsus,  either local or 
general, experiment with the following remedy. Take a magnet impregnated 
with mummy, and combined with rich earth.  In this earth sow some seeds that 
have a likeness to, or homogeneity with, the disease; then let this earth, 
well sifted and mixed with mummy, be laid in an earthen vessel, and let the 
seeds committed to it be watered daily with a lotion in which the diseased 
limb or body has been washed. Thus will the disease be transplanted from the 
human body to the seeds which are in the earth. Having done this, transplant 
the seeds from the earthen vessel to the ground, and wait till they begin to 
flourish into herbs.  As they increase, the disease will diminish, and when 
they have reached their mature growth, will altogether disappear."  The 
quaint but not altogether illogical idea of “weapon-salve " - anointing the 
weapon instead of the wound-was also used by Paracelsus, his theory being 
that part of the vital spirits clung to the weapon and exercised an ill 
effect on the vital spirits in the wound, which would not heal until the 
ointment had first been applied to the weapon; this also was an outcome of 
the magnetic theory.
     Towards the end of the 16th century Paracelsus was worthily succeeded 
by J. B. van Helmont, a scientist of distinction and an energetic 
protagonist of magnetism. Material nature," he writes, "draws her forms 
through constant magnetism from above, and implores for them the favour of 
heaven; and as heaven, in like manner, draws something invisible from below, 
there is established a free and mutual intercourse, and the whole is 
contained in an individual." Van Helmont believed also in the power of the 
will to direct the subtle fluid. There was, he held, in all created things. 
a magic or celestial power through which they were allied to heaven. This 
power or strength is greatest in the soul of man, resides in a less degree 
in his body, and to some extent is present in the lower animals, plants, and 
inorganic matter.  It is by reason of his superior endowment in this respect 
that man is enabled to rule the other creatures, and to make use of 
inanimate objects for his own purposes. The power is strongest when one is 
asleep, for then the body is quiescent, and the soul most active and 
dominant; and for this reason dreams and prophetic visions are more common 
in sleep.  "The spirit," he says, "is everywhere diffused, and the spirit is 
the medium of magnetism; not the spirits of heaven and of hell, but the 
spirit of man, which is con-cealed in him as the fire is concealed in the 
flint. The human will makes itself master of a portion of its spirit of 
life, which becomes a connecting property between the corporeal and the 
incorporeal, and diffuses itself like the light." To this ethereal spirit he 
ascribes the visions seen by "the inner man" in ecstasy, and also those of 
the " outer man" and the lower animals.  In proof of the mutual influence of 
living creatures he asserts that men may kill animals merely by staring hard 
at them for a quarter of an hour. That Van Helmont was not ignorant of the 
power of imagination is evident from many of his writings.  A common needle, 
he declares, may by means of certain manipulations, and the will-power and 
imagina-tions of the operator, be made to possess magnetic proper-ties.  
Herbs may become very powerful through the imagination of him who gathers 
them.  And again
     “I have hitherto avoided revealing the great secret, that the strength 
lies concealed in man, merely through the sug-gestion and power of the 
imagination to work outwardly, and to impress this strength on others, which 
then continues of itself, and operates on the remotest objects. Through this 
secret alone will all receive its true illumination- all that has hitherto 
been brought together labor-iously of the ideal being out of the spirit-all 
that has been said of the magnetism of all things--of the strength of the 
human soul-of the magic of man, and of his dominion over the physical 
world." Van Helmont also gave special importance to the stomach as the chief 
seat of the soul, and recounts an experience of his own in which, on 
touching some aconite with his tongue, he finds all his senses trans-ferred 
to his stomach.  In after years this was to be a favourite accomplishment of 
somnambules and cataleptic subjects.  (See Stomach, Seeing with.)
      A distinguished English magnetist was Robert Fludd, who wrote in the 
first part of the 17th century.  Fluid was an exponent of the microcosmic 
theory, and a believer in the magnetic effluence from man.  Not only were 
these emanations able to cure bodily diseases, but they also affected the 
moral sentiments; for if radiations from two individuals were, on meeting, 
flung back or distorted, negative magnetism, or antipathy resulted, whereas 
if the radiations from each person passed freely into those from the other, 
the result was positive magnetism, or sympathy. Examples of positive and 
negative magnetism were also to be found among the lower animals and among 
plants. Another magnetist of distinction was the Scottish physician, 
Maxwell, who is said to have anticipated much of Mesmer's doctrine.  He 
declares that those who are familiar with the operation of the universal 
spirit can, through its agency cure all diseases, at no matter what 
distance.  He also suggests that the practice of magnetism, though very 
valuable in the hand of a well-disposed physician, is not without its 
dangers, and is liable to many abuses.
     While the theoretical branch of magnetism was thus receiving attention 
at the hands of the alchemical philoso-phers, the practical side was by no 
means neglected. There were in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries a 
number of" divine healers," whose magic cures were without doubt the result 
of hypnotic suggestion.  Of these perhaps the best known and most successful 
were Valentine Greatrakes, an Irishman, and a Swabian priest named Gassner.  
Great-rakes was born in 1628, and on reaching manhood served for some time 
in the Irish army, thereafter settling down on his estate in Waterford.  In 
1662 he had a dream in which it was revealed to him that he possessed the 
gift of curing king's evil.  The dream was repeated several times ere he 
paid heed to it, but at length he made the experiment, his own wife being 
the first to be healed by him. Many who came to him from the surrounding 
country were cured when he laid his hands upon them.  Later the impression 
came upon him strongly that he could cure other diseases besides king's 
evil, News of his wonderful powers spread far and wide, and patients came in 
hundreds to seek his aid.  Despite the fact that the Bishop of the Diocese 
forbade the exercise of these apparently magical powers, Greatrakes 
continued to heal the afflicted people who sought him.  In 1666 he proceeded 
to London, and though not invariably successful, he seems to have per-formed 
there a surprising number of cures, which were testified to by Robert Boyle, 
Sir William Smith, Andrew Marvell, and many other eminent people.  He 
himself describes them in a work entitled "Val. Greatrakes, Esq., of 
Waterford, in the kingdom of Ireland, famous for curing several diseases and 
distempers by the stroak of his hand only: London, 1660."  His method of 
healing was to stroke the affected part with his hand, thus driving the 
disease into the limbs and so finally out of the body. Sometimes the 
treatment acted as though by magic, but if immediate relief was not obtained 
the rubbing was continued, and but few cases were dismissed as incurable. 
Even epidemic diseases he healed by a touch.  It is said that during the 
treatment the patient's fingers and toes remained insensible to external 
stimuli, and frequently he himself showed every symptom of such a magnetic 
crisis as was afterwards to become a special feature of mesmeric treatment.  
Personally Greatrakes was a simple and pious gentleman, persuaded that his 
marvellous powers were a divinely-bestowed gift, and most anxious to make 
the best use of them.  The other healer mentioned, Gassner, belongs to a 
somewhat later period-about the middle of the eighteenth century.  Gassner 
was a priest of Bludenz in Vorarlberg, where his many cures gained for him a 
wide celebrity.  All diseases, according to him, were caused by evil spirits 
possessing the patient, and his mode of healing thus consisted of exorcising 
the demons.  He too was a man of kindly disposition and piety, and made a 
large use-of the Scriptures in his healing operations. The ceremony of 
exorcism was a rather impressive one.  Herr Gassner sat at a table, the 
patient and spectators in front of him, A blue red-flowered cloak hung from 
his shoulders; the rest of his clothing, we are told, was " clean, simple, 
and modest."  On his left was a window, on his right, the crucifix.  His 
fine personality, deep learning, and noble character inspired the faith of 
the patient and his friends and doubtless played no small part in his 
curative feats. Sometimes he made use of magnetic manipulations, stroking or 
rubbing the affected part, and driving the disease, after the manner of 
Greatrakes, into the limbs of the patient. The formula of exorcism he 
generally pronounced in Latin, with which language the demons showed a 
perfect familiar-ity.  Not only could he control sickness by these means, 
but the passions also were amenable to his treatment.  "Now anger is 
apparent, now patience, now joy, now sorrow, now hate, now love, now 
confusion, now reason,-each carried to the highest pitch.  Now this one is 
blind, now he sees, and again is deprived of sight, etc."  These curious 
results suggest the phreno-magnetism of later years, where equally sudden 
changes of mood were produced by touching with the finger-tips those parts 
of the subject's head which phrenology associated with the various emotions 
to be called forth.
     Hitherto it will be seen that the rational and supernatural 
explanations of magnetism had run parallel with one another, the former most 
in favour with the philosophers, the latter with the populace.  It was 
reserved for Emanuel Swedenborg (q.v.) (1688-1772), the Swedish philosopher 
and spiritualist, to unite the doctrine of magnetism with that of 
spiritualism-i.e., the belief in the action in the external world of the 
discarnate spirits of deceased human beings.  That Swedenborg accepted some 
of the theories of the older magnetists is evident from his mystical 
writings, from which the following passage has been extracted.
    “ In order to comprehend the origin and progress of this influence 
(i.e., God's influence over man), we must first know that that which 
proceeds from the Lord is the divine sphere which surrounds us, and fills 
the spiritual and natural world.  Ml that proceeds from an object, and 
surrounds and clothes it, is called its sphere.
     “As all that is spiritual knows neither time nor space, it therefore 
follows that the general sphere or the divine one-has extended itself from 
the first moment of creation to the last.  This divine emanation, which 
passed over from the spiritual to the natural, penetrates actively and 
rapidly through- the whole created world, to the last grade of it, where it 
is yet to be found, and produces and maintains all that is animal, 
vegetable, and mineral.  Man is continually surrounded by a sphere of his 
favourite propensities; these unite themselves to the natural sphere of his 
body, so that together they form one.  The natural sphere surrounds every 
body of nature, and all the objects of the three kingdoms. Thus it allies 
itself to the spiritual world. This is the foundation of sympathy and 
antipathy, of union and separation, according to which there are amongst 
spirits presence and absence.
     “The angel said to me that the sphere surrounded man more 'lightly on 
the back than on the breast, where it was thicker and stronger.  This sphere 
of influence peculiar to mail operates also in general and in particular 
around him by means of the will, the understanding, and the prac-tice.
     "The sphere proceeding from God, which surrounds man and constitutes 
his strength, while it thereby operates on his neighbour and on the whole 
creation, is a sphere of peace, and innocence; for the Lord is peace and 
innocence. Then only is man consequently able to make his influence 
effectual on his fellow man, when peace and innocence rule in his heart, and 
he himself is in union with heaven.  This spiritual union is connected with 
the natural by a benevo-lent man through the touch and the laying on of 
hands, by which the influence of the inner man is quickened, prepared, and 
imparted. The body communicates with others which are about it through the 
body, and the spiritual influence diffuses itself chiefly through the hands, 
because these are the most outward or ultimum of man; and through him, as in 
the whole of nature, the first is con-tained in the last, as the cause in 
the effect.  The whole soul and the whole body are contained in the hands as 
a medium of influence."
     Mesmerism or Animal Magnetism.-In the latter half of the eighteenth 
century a new era was inaugurated in connection with the doctrine of a 
magnetic fluid. The fresh impetus which the science of magnetism received at 
that period was due in a very large measure to the works of Franz Aritoine 
Mesmer (q.v.), a physician from whose name the word " mesmerism" was taken. 
He was born at Wiel, near Lake Constance, in 1733, and studied medicine at 
the University of Vienna, taking his doctor's degree in 1766.  In the same 
year he published his first work, De Planetarum Influxu (.' De l'influence 
des Planettes sur le corps humain").  Though he claimed to have thereby 
discovered the existence of a universal fluid, to which he gave the name of 
magnetisme animal, there is no doubt that his doctrine was in many respects 
identical with that of the older magnetists mentioned above. The idea of the 
univer-sal fluid was suggested to him in the first place by his observation 
of the stars, which led him to believe the celestial bodies exercised a 
mutual influence 0 each other and on the earth. This he identified with 
magnetism, and it was but a step-and a step which had already been taken by 
the early magnetists-to extend this influence to the human body and all 
other objects, and to apply it to the science of medicine. In 1776 Mesmer 
met with Gassner, the Swabian priest whose miraculous cures have already 
been considered;  and, setting aside the supernatural explanation offered by 
the healer himself, Mesmer declared that the cures and severe crises which 
followed on his manipulations were attributable t6 nothing but magnetism. 
Nevertheless this encounter gave a new trend to his ideas. Hitherto he 
himself had employed the magnet in order to cure the sick, but seeing that 
Gassner dispensed with that aid, he was led to consider whether the power 
might not reside in a still greater degree in the human body. Mesmer's first 
cure was performed on an epileptic patient, by means of magnets, but the 
honour of it was disputed by a Jesuit named Hell, who had supplied the 
magnetic plates, and who claimed to have discovered the principles on which 
the physician worked.  Thereafter for a few years Mesmer practised in 
various European cities, and strove to obtain recognition for Ills theories, 
but without success.  In 1778 however, lie went to Paris, and there attained 
an immediate and triumphant success in the fashionable world, though the 
learned bodies still refused to have anything to say to him.  Aristocratic 
patients flocked in hundreds to Mes-mer's consulting-rooms, which were hung 
with mirrors, it being one of the physicians' theories that mirrors 
augmented the magnetic fluid.  He himself wore, it is said, a shirt of 
leather, lined with silk, to prevent the escape of the fluid, while magnets 
were hung about his person to increase his natural supply of magnetism.  The 
patients were seated round a baguet or magnetic tub, of which the following 
description is given by Seifert, one of Mesmer's biographers.
     "This receptacle was a large pan, tub, or pool of water, filled with 
various magnetic substances, such as water, sand, stone, glass bottles 
(filled with magnetic water), etc.  It was a focus within which the 
magnetism was con-centrated, and out of which proceeded a number of con-
ductors. These being bent pointed iron wands, one end was retained in the 
baguet, whilst the other was connected with the patient and applied to the 
seat of the disease. This arrangement might be made use of by any number of 
persons seated round the baguet, and thus a fountain, or any receptacle in a 
garden, as in a room, would answer for the purpose desired." For the 
establishment of a school of Animal Magnetism Mesmer was offered 20,000 
livres by the French government, with an annual sum of 10.000 livres for its 
upkeep; but this he refused. Later, however, the sum of 340,000 livres was 
subscribed by prospective pupils, and handed over to him. One of Mesmer's 
earliest and most distinguished disciples was
M. D'Eslon, a prominent physician, who laid the doctrines of animal 
magnatism before the Faculty of Medicine in 1780.  Consideration of Mesmer's 
theories was, however, indignantly refused, and D'Eslon warned to rid 
himself of such dangerous doctrine. Another disciple of Mesmer who attained 
to distinction in magnetic practise was the Marquis de Puysegur, who was the 
first to observe and describe the state of induced somnambulism now as well 
known as the hypnotic trance. It has been suggested, and seems not 
improbable, that Mesmer himself knew some-thing of the induced trance, but 
believing it to be a state full of danger, steadfastly set his face against 
it. However that may be, Puysegur's ideas on the subject began to supersede 
those of Mesmer, and he gathered about him a distinguished body of 
adherents, among whom was num-bered the celebrated Lavater. Indeed, his 
recognition of the fact that the symptoms attending the "magnetic sleep" 
were resultant from it, was a step of no small importance in the history of 
mesmerism. In 1784 a commission was appointed by the French government to 
enquire into the magnetic phenomena. For some reason or another its members 
chose to investigate the experiments of D'Eslon, rather than those of Mesmer 
himself. The commissioners, including among their number Benjamin Franklin, 
Lavoisier, and Bailly, observed the peculiar crises attending the treatment, 
and the rapport between patient and physician, but decided that imagination 
could produce all the effects, and that there was no evidence whatever for a 
magnetic fluid. The report, edited by M. Bailly, gives the following 
description of the crisis.
     “The sick persons, arranged in great numbers, and in several rows 
around the baquet (bath), received the mag-netism by means of the iron rods, 
which conveyed it to them from the baquet by the cords wound round their 
bodies, by the thumb which connected them with their neighbours, and by the 
sounds of a pianoforte, or an agreeable voice, diffusing magnetism in the 
air.
     "The patients were also directly magnetised by means of the finger and 
wand of the magnetiser, moved slowly before their faces, above or behind 
their heads, or on the diseased parts.
     "The magnetiser acts also by fixing his eyes on the subjects; by the 
application of his bands on the region of the solar plexus; an application 
which sometimes con-tinues for hours.
     "Meanwhile the patients present a very varied picture.  Some are calm, 
tranquil, and experience no effect. Others cough and spit, feel pains, heat, 
or perspiration. Others, again, are convulsed.
     “As soon as one begins to be convulsed, it is remarkable that others 
are immediately affected.
     "The commissioners have observed some of these con-vulsions last more 
than three hours. They are often accom-panied with expectorations of a 
violent character, often streaked with blood. The convulsions are marked 
with involuntary motions of the throat, limbs, and sometimes the whole body; 
by dimness of the eyes, shrieks, sobs, laughter, and the wildest hysteria.  
These states are often followed by languor and depression. The smallest 
noise appears to aggravate the symptoms, and often to occasion shudderings 
and terrible cries. It was noticeable that a sudden change in the air or 
time of the music had a great influence on the patients, and soothed or 
accelerated the convulsions, stimulating them to ecstasy, or moving them to 
floods of tears.
     "Nothing is more astonishing than the spectacle of these convulsions.
     "One who has not seen them can form no idea of them. The spectator is 
as much astonished at the profound repose of one portion of the patients as 
at the agitation of the rest.
     "Some of the patients may be seen rushing towards each other with open 
arms, and manifesting every symptom of attachment and affection.
     “All are under the power of the magnetizer; it matters not what state 
of drowsiness they may be in, the sound of his voice. a look, a motion of 
his hands, spasmodically affects them.”
     Though Mesmer, Puysegur, and their followers con-tinued to practise 
magnetic treatment. the report of the royal commission had the effect of 
quenching public interest in the subject, though from time to time a spas-
modic interest in it was shown by scientists.   M. de Jussieu, at about the 
time the commission presented its report, suggested that it would have done 
well to enquire into the reality of the alleged cures, and to endeavour to 
find a satisfactory explanation for the phenomena they had witnessed ; while 
to remedy the deficiency he himself formulated a theory of "animal heat," an 
organic emana-tion which might be directed by the human will. Like Mesmer 
and the others, he believed in action at a distance.
     Mesmeric practitioners formed themselves into "Societies of Harmony," 
until the political situation in France rendered their existence impossible. 
Early in the nine-teenth century Petetin and Delenze published works on 
magnetism.  But a new era was inaugurated with the publication in 1823 of 
Alexandra Bertrand's Traite du Somnambulisme, followed three years later by 
a treatise Da Magnetisme Animal en France. Bertrand was a young physician of 
Paris, and to him belongs the honour of having discovered the important part 
played by suggestion in the phenomena of the induced trance. He had observed 
the connection between the magnetic sleep, epidemic ecstasy, and spontaneous 
sleep-walking, and declared that all the cures and strange symptoms which 
had formerly been attributed to "animal magnetism," "animal elec-tricity," 
and the like, resulted from the suggestions of the operator acting on the 
imagination of a patient whose suggestibility was greatly increased.  It is 
probable that had he lived longer-he died in 1831, at the age of thirty-six-
Bertrand would have gained a definite scientific standing for the facts of 
the induced trance; but as it was the practitioners of animal magnetism 
still held to the theory of a fluid or force radiating from magnetizer to 
subject, while those who were unable to accept such a doctrine, ignored the 
matter altogether, or treated it as vulgar fraud and charlatanry. 
Nevertheless Bertrand's works and experiments revived the flagging interest 
of the public to such an extent that in 1831 a second French commission was 
appointed by the Royal Academy of Medicine.  The report of this commission 
was not forth-coming till more than five years had elapsed, but when it was 
finally published it contained a definite testimony to the genuineness of 
the magnetic phenomena, and especially of the somnambulic state; and 
declared that the com-mission was satisfied of the therapeutic value of 
"animal magnetism."  The report was certainly not of great scientific worth. 
The name of Bertrand is not even mentioned therein, nor his theory 
considered; on the other hand, a good deal of space is given to the more 
supernatural phenomena clairvoyance, action at a distance, and the 
prediction by somnambulic patients of crises in their maladies. This is the 
more excusable, however, since these ideas were almost universally 
associated with somnambu-lism.  Community of sensation (q.v.) was held to be 
a feature of the trance state, as was also the transference of the senses to 
the stomach-(See Stomach, seeing with)1 while thought-transference was 
suggested by some of these earlier investigators, notably by Deleuze, who 
suggested that thoughts were conveyed from the brain of the operator to that 
of the subject through the medium of the subtle magnetic fluid. Meanwhile 
the spiritualistic theory was becoming more and more frequently advanced to 
explain the" magnetic" phenomena, including both the legitimate trance 
phenomena and the multitude of supernormal phenomena which was supposed to 
follow the somnambulic state. This will doubtless account in part for the 
extra-ordinary animosity which the medical profession showed towards animal 
magnetism as a therapeutic agency. Its anesthetic properties they ridiculed 
as fraud or imagination, notwithstanding that serious operations, even of 
the amputation of limbs, could be performed while the patient was in the 
magnetic sleep. Thus Dr. John Elliotson was forced to resign his 
professorship at the University College Hospital; Dr. James Esdaile, a 
surgeon who practised at a government hospital at Calcutta, had to contend 
with much ignorance and stupid conservatism in his professional brethren; 
and similar contemptuous treatment was dealt out to other medical men, 
against whom nothing could be urged but their defence of mesmerism. In 1841 
James Braid, a Manchester surgeon, arrived independently at the conclusions 
which Bertrand had reached some eighteen years earlier.  Once more the 
theory of abnormal sugges-tibility was offered to explain the various 
phenomena of the so-called " magnetic" sleep ; and once more it was utterly 
ignored, alike by the world of science and by the public. Braid's 
explanation was essentially that which is offered now.  He placed the new 
science-hypnotism, he called it, on a level with other natural sciences, 
above the mass of medieval magic and superstition in which he had found it. 
Yet even Braid does not seem to have entirely separated the chaff from the 
grain, for we find him countenancing the practice of phreno-magnetism 
(q.v.), a combination of mesmerism and phrenology wherein the entranced 
patient. whose head is touched by the operator's fingers, exhibits every 
sign of the emotion or quality associated with the phrenological organ 
touched.  Braid asserts that a subject, entirely ignorant of the position of 
the phrenological organs, passed rapidly and accurately from one emotion to 
another, according to the portion of the scalp in contact with the 
hypnotist's fingers.  His physiological explana-tion is a somewhat 
inadequate one, and we can only suppose that he was not fully appreciative 
of his owl, theory of suggestion.  In 1843 two periodicals dealing with 
magnet-ism appeared-the Zoist, edited by Dr. Elliotson and a colleague, and 
the Phreno-Magnet, edited by Spencer T. Hall.  The first, adopting a 
scientific tone, treated the subject mainly from a therapeutic point of 
view, while the latter was of a more popular character.  Many of the 
adherents of both papers, and notably Elliotson himself, afterwards became 
spiritualists.  In 1845 an additional impetus wag given to animal magnetism 
by the publica-tion in that year of Baron von Reichenbach's researches. 
Reichenbach claimed to have discovered a new force, which he called odyle, 
od, or odylic force, and which could be seen in the. form of flames by 
"sensitives."  In the human being these emanations might be seen to radiate 
from the finger-tips, while they were also visible in animals and inanimate 
things. Different colours issued from the different poles of the magnet. 
Reichenbach experimented by putting his sensitives in a dark room with 
various objects-crystals, precious stones, magnets, minerals, plants, 
animals-when they could unerringly distinguish each object by the colour and 
size of the flame visible to their clairvoyant eye. These emanations were so 
invariable and so permanent that an artist might paint them, and this, 
indeed, was frequently done.  Feelings of tempera-ture, of heat or cold, 
were also experienced in connection with the odylic force.  Baron von 
Reichenbach's experi-ments were spread over a number of years, and were made 
with every appearance of scientific care and precision, so that their effect 
on the mesmerists of the time was very considerable.  But notwithstanding 
the mass of dubious phenomena which was associated with hypnotism at that 
time, there is no doubt but that the induced trance, with its therapeutic 
and anaesthetic value, would soon have come into its own had not two 
circumstances occurred to thrust it into the background. The first was the 
applica-tion of chloroform and ether to the purposes for which hypnotism had 
hitherto been used, a substitution which pleased the medical faculty 
greatly, and relieved its mem-bers from the necessity of studying hypnotism. 
The second circumstance was the introduction of the movement known as modern 
spiritualism, which so emphasised the occult side of the trance phenomena as 
to obscure for nearly half a century the true significance of induced 
somnambulism.
     Modern Views of Hypnotism.-But if the great body of medical and public 
opinion ignored the facts of hypnotism during the period following Braid's 
discovery, the subject did not fail to receive some attention from the more 
scienti-fic portion of Europe, and from time to time investigators took upon 
themselves the task of enquiring into the phenom-ena.  This was especially 
the case in France, where the science of mesmerism or hypnotism was most 
firmly en-trenched, and where it met with least opposition.  In 1858 Dr. 
Azam, of Bordeaux, investigated hypnotism from Braid's point of view, aided 
by a number of members of the Faculty of Paris. An account of his researches 
was pub-lished in r860, but cast no new light on the matter. Later the same 
set of facts were examined by Mesnet, Duval, and others.  In 1875 Professor 
Richet also studied the science of artificial somnambulism.  It is, however, 
from Bernheim and the Nancy school that the generally accepted modern view 
of hypnotism is taken.  Bernheim was himself n disciple of Liebeault, who, 
working on independent lines, had reached the conclusions of Bertrand and 
Braid and once more formulated the doctrine of suggestion.  Bern-heim's work 
De la Suggestion, published in 1884, embodied the theories of Liebeault and 
the result of Bernheim's own researches therein.  According to this view, 
then, hypnotism is a purely psychological process. and is induced by mental 
influences. The "passes" of Mesmer and the magnetic philosophers, the 
elaborate preparations of the baquet, the strokings of Valentine Greatrakes, 
and all the multitudinous ceremonies with which the animal magnetists were 
wont to produce the artificial sleep, were only of service in inducing a 
state of expectation in the patient, or in providing a soothing and 
monotonous, or violent, sensory stimulus.  And so also with the modern 
methods of inducing hypnosis; the fixation of the eyes, the contact of the 
operators hand, the sound of his voice, are only effective through the 
medium of the subject's mentality.  Other investigators who played a large 
part in popularising hypnotism were Professor J. M. Charcot, of the 
Salpetriere, Paris, a distinguished pathologist, and R. Heidenhain, 
professor of physiology at Breslau. The former taught that the hypnotic 
condition was essentially a morbid one, and allied to hysteria; a theory 
which, becoming widely circulated, exercised a somewhat detrimental effect 
on the practice of hypnotism for therapeutic purposes, till it was at length 
proved erroneous.  Even now a prejudice lingers, particularly in this 
country, against the use of the induced hypnotic trance in medicine.  
Heidenhain, again, laid stress on the physical operations to induce 
s6mnambulism, believing that thereby a peculiar state of the nervous system 
was brought about, wherein the control of the higher nerve centres was 
temporarily removed, so that the suggestion of the operator was free to 
express itself auto-matically through the physical organism of the patient. 
The physiological theory also is somewhat misleading; nevertheless its 
exponents have done good work in bringing the undoubted facts of hypnosis 
into prominence.  Besides these theories there is another which is to be met 
with chiefly in its native France-the old doctrine of a magnetic fluid.  But 
it is rapidly dying out.  Among the symptoms which may safely, and without 
reference to the super-natural, be regarded as attendant on hypnotism are 
the rapport between patient and operator, implicit obedience on the part of 
the former to the smallest suggestion, whether given verbally or by look, 
gesture, or any uncon-scious action, anaesthesia, positive and negative 
hallucina-tions, the fulfillment of post-hypnotic promises, control of 
organic processes and of muscles not ordinarily under voluntary control.  
Other phenomena which have been allied from time to time with magnetism, 
mesmerism, or hypnotism, and for which there is not the same scientific 
basis; are clairvoyance, telekinesia, transference of the senses from the 
ordinary sense-organs to some other parts of the body, usually the finger 
tips or the pit of the stomach, community of sensation, and the ability to 
commune with the dead. The majority of these, like the remarkable phenomena 
of phreno-magnetism, can be directly traced to the effect of suggestion on 
the imagination of the patient. Ignorant as were the protagonists of 
mesmerism with regard to the great suggestibility of the magnetised subject, 
it is hardly surprising that they saw new and supernormal faculties and 
agencies at work during the trance state. To the same ignorance of the 
possibilities of suggestion and hyperaesthesia may be referred the common 
belief that the hypnotizer can influence his subject by the power of his 
will alone, and secure obedience to commands which are only mentally 
expressed. At the same time it must be borne in mind that if the growing 
belief in telepathy be accepted, there is a possibility that the operation 
of thought transference may be more freely carried out during hypnosis, and 
it is notable, in this respect, that the most fruitful of the telepathic 
experiments conducted by psychical re-searchers and others have been made 
with hypnotized percipients.  (See Telepathy.)
     Among numerous explanations of the physiological conditions 
accompanying the hypnotic state there is one, the theory of cerebral 
dissociation, which is now generally accepted of science, and which may be 
briefly outlined as follows. The brain is composed of innumerable groups of 
nerve cells, all more or less closely connected with each other by means of 
nervous links or paths of variable resistance.  Excitement of any of these 
groups, whether by means of impressions received through the sense organs or 
by the communicated activity of other groups, will, if sufficiently intense, 
occasion the rise into consciousness of an idea.  In the normal waking state 
the resistance of the nervous association-paths is fairly low, so that the 
activity is easily communicated from one neural group to another. Thus the 
main idea which reaches the upper stratum of consciousness is attended by a 
stream of other, subcon-scious ideas, which has the effect of checking the 
primary idea and preventing its complete dominance.  Now the abnormal 
dominance of one particular system of ideas-that suggested by the operator-
together with the com-plete suppression of all rival systems, is the 
principal fact to be explained in hypnosis.  To some extent the physiolo-
gical process conditioning hypnosis suggests an analogy with normal sleep.  
When one composes himself to sleep there is a lowering of cerebral 
excitement and a proportionate increase in the resistance of the neural 
links; and this is precisely what happens during hypnosis, the essential 
passivity of the subject raising the resistance of the associa-tion-paths.  
But in normal sleep, unless some exciting cause he present, all the neural 
dispositions are at rest, whereas in the latter case such a complete 
suspension of cerebral activities is not permitted, since the operator, by 
means of voice, gestures, and manipulations of the patient's limbs, keeps 
alive that set of impressions relating to him-self.  One neural disposition 
is thus isolated, so that any idea suggested by the operator is free to work 
itself out in action, without being submitted to the checks of the sub-
activity of other ideas.  The alienation is less or more complete according 
as the degree of hypnotism is light or heavy, hut a comparatively slight 
raising of resistance in the neural links suffices to secure the dominance 
of ideas suggested by the hypnotizer.  Hyperaesthesia, than which perhaps no 
phenomenon is more frequently mentioned in connection with the hypnotic 
state, really belongs to the doubtful class, since it has not yet been 
decided whether or no an actual sharpening or refining of the senses takes 
place. Alternatively it may be suggested that the accurate perception of 
very faint sense-impressions, which seems to furnish evidence for 
hyperaesthesia, merely recalls the fact that the excitement conveyed through 
the sensory nerve operates with extraordinary force, being freed from the 
restriction of sob-excitement in adjacent neural groups and systems.  In 
accepting this view-point we concede that in normal life very feeble sensory 
stimuli must act on nerve and brain just as they do in hypnosis, save that 
in the former case they are so stifled amid a multitude of similar 
impressions that they fail to reach consciousness. In any case the 
occasional abnormal sensitiveness of the subject to very slight sensory 
stimuli is a fact of hypnotism as well authenticated as anesthesia itself, 
and the term hyperaesthesia," if not entirely justified, may for want of a 
better be practically applied to the observed phenome-non.  The hypnotic 
state is not necessarily induced by a second person.  " Spontaneous" 
hypnotism and "auto--hypnotisation"  are well known to science. Certain 
Indian fakirs and the shamans of uncivilised races can produce in themselves 
a state closely approximating to hypnosis, by a prolonged fixation of the 
eyes, and by other means.  The mediumistic trance is also, as will be shown 
hereafter, a case in point.
     Hypnotism and Spiritualism.-Spiritualism is a legacy directly 
bequeathed by the magnetic philosophers of medieval times, and through them, 
from the still older astrologers and magi.  It has been shown that at a very 
early date phenomena of a distinctly hypnotic character were ascribed to the 
workings of spiritual agencies, whether angelic or demoniac, by a certain 
percentage of the observers Thus Greatrakes and Gassner believed themselves 
to have been gifted with a divine power to heal diseases.  Cases of ecstasy, 
catalepsy and other trance states were given a spiritual significance - 
i.e., demons, angels, elementals, and so on, were supposed to speak through 
the lips of the possessed.  Witchcraft, in which the force of hypnotic 
suggestion seems to have operated in a very large degree, was thought to 
result from the witches' traffic with the Prince of Darkness and his 
legions.  Even in some cases the souls of deceased men and women were 
identified with these intelligences, though not generally until the time of 
Swedenborg. Though the movement known as "modern spiritualism" is usually 
dated from 1848, the year of the “Rochester Rappings," the real growth of 
spiritualism was much more gradual, and its roots were hidden in animal 
magnetism.  Emanuel Swendenborg, whose affinities with the magnetists have 
already been referred to, exercised a remarkable influence on the 
spiritualistic thought of America and Europe, and was in a sense the founder 
of that faith.  Automatic phenomena were even then a feature of the magnetic 
trance, and clairvoyance, community of sensation, and telepathy were 
believed in generally, and regarded by many as evidences of spiritual 
communication. In Germany Professor Jung-Stilling, Dr. C. Romer, Dr. Werner, 
and the poet and physician Justinus Kerner, were among those who held 
opinions on these lines, the latter pursuing his investigations with a 
somnambule who became famous as the " Seerers of Prevorst "-Frau Frederica 
Hauffe.  Frau Hauffe could see and converse with the spirits of the 
deceased, and gave evidence of prophetic vision and clairvoyance.  Physical 
phenomena were witnessed in her presence, knockings, rattling of chains, 
movement of objects without contact, and, in short, such manifestations as 
were characteristic of the poltergeist family.  She was, moreover, the 
originator of a "primeval" language, which she declared was that spoken by 
the patriarchs.  Thus Frau Hauffe, though only a somnambule, or magnetic 
patient, possessed had the qualities of a successful spiritualistic medium.  
In England also there were many circumstances of a supernatural character 
associated with mesmerism.  Dr. Elliotson, who, as has been indicated, was 
one of the best-known of English magnetists, became in time converted to a 
spiritualistic theory, as offering an explanation of the clairvoyance and 
similar phenomena which he thought to have observed in his patients.  
France, the headquarters of the rationalist school of magnetism, had, 
indeed, a good deal less to show of spiritualistic opinion.  Nonetheless 
even in that country the latter doctrine made its appearance at intervals 
prior to 1848.  J. P. F. Deleuze, a good scientist and an earnest 
protagonist of magnetism, who published his Histoire Critique da Magnetisme 
Animal in 1813, was said to have embraced the doctrines of spiritualism 
before he died. Dr. G. P. Billot was another believer in spirit communica-
tion, and one who succeeded in obtaining physical pheno-mena in the presence 
of his somnambules.  It is, however, in the person of Alphonse Cahagnet, a 
man of humble origin who began to study induced somnambulism about the year 
1845, and who thereafter experimented with somnambules, that we encounter 
the first French spiritual-ist of distinction.  So good was the evidence for 
spirit communication furnished by Cahagnet and his subjects that it remains 
among the best which the annals of the movement can produce.  In America, 
Laroy Sunderland, Andrew Jackson Davis, and others who became pillars of 
spiritualism in that country were first attracted to it through the study of 
magnetism.  Everywhere we find hypnotism and spiritualism identified with 
each other until in 1848 a definite split occurs, and the two go their 
separate ways.  Even yet, however, the separation is not quite complete.  In 
the first place, the mediumistic trance is obviously a variant of 
spontaneous or self-induced hypnotism, while in the second, many of the most 
striking phenomena of tile seance-room have been matched time and again in 
the records of animal magnetism.  For instance, the diagnosis of disease and 
prescription of remedies dictated by the control to the ' healing medium" 
have their prototype in the cures of Valentine Greatrakes, or of Mesmer and 
his disciples.  Automatic phenomena-speaking in "tongues" and so forth-early 
formed a characteristic feature of the induced trance and kindred states.  
While even the physical phenomena, movement without contact, apports, 
rappings, were witnessed in connection with magnetism long before the 
movement known as modern spiritualism was so much as thought of. In many 
instances, though not in all, we can trace the operation of hypnotic 
suggestion in the automatic phenom-ena, just as we can perceive the result 
of fraud in much of the physical manifestations. The question whether after 
the factors of hypnotism and fraud have been removed, a section of the 
phenomena remains inexplicable say by the hypothesis of communication with 
the spirit-world is one which has been in the past, and is to-day, answered 
in the affirmative by many men of the highest distinction in their various 
walks of life, and one which we would do well to treat with due 
circumspection.  This, however, is reserved for consideration elsewhere, the 
scope of the present article being to show how largely spiritualism has 
borrowed from the fact of hypnotism.  (See Suggestion.)
     In M. Larelig's biography of the celebrated painter, Wiertz, and also 
in the introductory and biographical note affixed to the CataIogue Raisonne 
du Musee Wiertz by Dr. S. Watteau, 1865, is to be found a detailed 
description of an extremely curious hypnotic experiment in which Wiertz was 
the hypnotic subject and a friend, a doctor, the hypno-tiser.  Wiertz had 
long been haunted by a desire to know whether thought persisted in a head 
severed from the trunk.  His wish was the reason of the following experi-
ment being undertaken, this being facilitated through his friendship with 
the prison doctor in Brussels, and another outside practitioner.  The latter 
had been for many years a hypnotic operator, and had more than once put 
Wiertz into the hypnotic state, regarding him as an excellent sub-ject.  
About this time a trial for murder in the Place Saint-Gery had been causing 
a great sensation in Belgium and the painter had been following the 
proceedings closely. The trial ended in the condemnation of the accused.  A 
plan was arranged and Wiertz, with the consent of the prison doctor, 
obtained permission to hide with his friend, Dr. D., under the guillotine, 
close to where the head of the condemned would roll into the basket.  In 
order to carry out the scheme he had determined upon more efficiently, the 
painter desired his hypnotiser to put him through a regular course of 
hypnotic suggestion, and when in the sleep state to command him to identify 
himself with various people and tell him to read their thoughts and 
penetrate into their psychical and mental states.  The following is a 
resume' given in Le Progres Spirite :-" On the day of execution, ten minutes 
before the arrival of the condemned man, Wiertz, accompanied by his friend 
the physician with two witnesses, ensconced themselves underneath the 
guillotine, where they were entirely hidden from sight. The painter was then 
put to sleep, and told to identify himself with the criminal.  He was to 
follow his thoughts
and feel any sensations, which he was to express aloud. He was also ' 
suggested ' to take special note of mental conditions during decapitation, 
so that when the head fell in the basket he could penetrate the brain and 
give an account of its last thoughts.  Wiertz became entranced almost 
immediately, and the four friends soon understood by the sounds overhead 
that the executioner was conducting the condemned to the scaffold, and in 
another minute the guillotine would have done its work.  The hypnotized 
Wiertz manifested extreme distress and begged to be 
de--magnetised, as his sense of oppression was insupportable. It was too 
late, however-the knife fell.  'What do you feel?  What do you see ? '  asks 
the doctor.  Wiertz writhes convulsively and replies, 'Lightning ! A 
thunder-bolt falls !  It thinks;  it sees ! '  ' Who thinks and sees
'The head.  It suffers horribly.  It thinks and feels but does not 
understand what has happened. It seeks its body and feels that the body must 
join it.  It still waits for the supreme blow for death, but death does not 
come.'  As Wiertz spoke the witnesses saw the head which had fallen into the 
basket and lay looking at them horribly; its arteries still palpitating.  It 
was only after some moments of suffering that apparently the guillotined 
head at last became aware that is was separated from its body. Wiertz became 
calmer and seemed exhausted, while the doctor resumed his questions. - The 
painter answered :- I fly through space like a top spinning through fire.  
But am I dead ?  Is all over ?  If only they would let me join my body 
again!  Have pity! give it back to me and I can live again.  I remember all.  
There are the judges in red robes.  I hear the sentence.  Oh! my wretched 
wife and children.  I am abandoned.  If only you would put my body to me, I 
should be with you once more. You refuse? All the same I love you, my poor 
babies. Miserable wretch that I am I have covered you with blood.  When will 
this finish! - or is not a murderer condemned to eternal punish-ment ? ' As 
Wiertz spoke these words the witnesses thought they detected the eyes of the 
decapitated head open wide with a look of unmistakable suffering and of 
beseeching. The painter continued his lamentations.  'No, such suffering 
cannot endure for ever; God is merciful.  All that belongs to earth is 
fading away.  I see in the distance a little light glittering like a 
diamond.  I feel a calm steal-ing over me.  What a good sleep I shall have I 
What joy I ' These were the last words the painter spoke.  He was still 
entranced, but no longer replied to the questions put by the doctor.  They 
then approached the head and Dr. D. touched the forehead, the temples, and 
teeth and found they were cold. The head was dead."
In the Wiertz Gallery in Brussels are to be found three pictures of a 
guillotined head, presumably the outcome of this gruesome experiment.


Hypocephalus   A disk of bronze or painted linen found under the heads of 
Grieco-Roman mummies in Egypt. It is inscribed with magical formulae and 
divine figures, and -its object was probably to secure warmth for the 
corpse. There is frequently depicted upon such amulets a scene showing 
cynocephalus apes adoring the solar disk seated in his boat.



I


lacchus  (See Mysteries.)


lao, or I-ha-ho : A mystic name said by Clement of Alexan-dria to have been 
worn on their persons by the initiates of the Mysteries of Serapis.  It is 
said to embody the symbols of the two generative principles.


Ichthyomancy : Divination by the inspection of the entrails of fish.


Ideas of Good and Evil  (See Yeats.)


Ifrits : Hideous spectres probably of Arabian origin, now genii of Persian 
and Indian mythology. They assume diverse forms, and frequent ruins, woods 
and wild desolate places, for the purpose of preying upon men and other 
living things. They are sometimes confounded with the Jinns or Divs of 
Persia.


Ignis Fatuus  A wavering luminous appearance frequently observed in meadows 
and marshy places, round which many popular superstitions cluster.  Its 
folk-names, Will O' the Wisp and Jack 0' Lantern, suggest a country fellow 
bearing a lantern or straw torch (wisp).  Formerly these lights were 
supposed to haunt desolate bogs and moor-lands for the purpose of misleading 
travellers and drawing them to their death.  Another superstition says that 
they are the spirits of those who have been drowned in the bogs, and yet 
another, that they are the souls of unbaptized in-fants. Science refers 
these ignes fatui to gaseous exhalations from the moist ground, or, more 
rarely, to night-flying insects.


Iliuminati : The term used first of all in the 15th century by enthusiasts 
in the occult arts signifying those who claimed to possess " light" directly 
communicated from a higher source, or due to a larger measure of human 
wisdom. We first find the name in Spain about the end of the 15th century.  
Its origin is probably a late Gnostic one hailing from Italy, and we find 
all sorts of people, many of them charlatans, claiming to belong to the 
brotherhood.  In Spain, such persons as laid claim to the title had to face 
the rigour of the Inquisition, and this is perhaps the reason that we find 
numbers of them in France in the early seventeenth century, as refugees.
     Here and there small bodies of those called Illuminati, sometimes known 
as Rosicrucians rose into publicity for a short period.  But it is with 
Weishaupt, Professor of Law at Ingolstadt, that the movement first became 
identified with republicanism.  It soon secured a strong hold all through 
Germany, but its founder's object was merely to convert his followers into 
blind instruments of his supreme will.  He modelled his organisation on that 
of the Jesuits, adopted their system of espionage, and their maxim that the 
end justified the means.  He induced mysticism into the workings of the 
brotherhood, so that an air of mystery might prevade all its doings, adopted 
many of the classes and grades of Freemasonry, and held but hopes of the 
communication of deep occult secrets in the higher ranks.
     Only a few of the members knew him personally, and thus although the 
society had many branches in all parts 6f Germany, to these people alone was 
he visible, and he began to be regarded by those who had not seen him almost 
as a god.  He took care to enlist in his ranks as many young men of wealth 
and position as possible, and within four or five years the power of 
Illuminism became extra-ordinary in its proportions, its members even had a 
hand in the affairs of the state, and not a few of the German princes found 
it to their interest to having dealings with the fraternity. Weishaupt's 
idea was to blend philan-thropy and mysticism.  He was only 28 when he 
founded the sect in 1776. but he did not make much progress until a certain 
baron Von Knigge joined him in 1780.  A gifted person of strong imagination 
he had been admitted master of most of the secret societies of his day, 
among them Freemasonry.  He was also an expert occultist and the 
supernatural had strong attractions for him. These two, rapidly spread the 
gospel of the Revolution throughout Germany.  But they grew fearful that, if 
the authorities discovered the existence of such a society as theirs they 
would take steps to suppress it. With this in view they conceived the idea 
of grafting it on to Freemasonry, which they considered would protect it, 
and offer it means of spreading more widely and rapidly.
     The Freemasons were not long in discovering the true nature of those 
who had just joined their organisation.  A chief council was held with the 
view of thoroughly examin-ing into the nature of the beliefs held by them 
and a con-ference of masons was held in 1782 at which Knigge and Weishaupt 
attended and endeavoured to capture the whole organisation of Freemasonry. 
but a misunderstanding grew up between the leaders of illuminism.  Knigge 
withdrew from the society; and two years later those who had reached its 
highest grade and had discovered that mysticism was not its true object, 
denounced it to the Bavarian Government as a political society of a 
dangerous character. Weishaupt fled, but the damage had been done, for the 
fire kindled by illuminism was soon to burst forth in the French Revolution.
     The title Illuminati was later given to the French Mar-tinists (q.v.)


Imhetep: An Egyptian deity, son of Ptah and Nut, to whom great powers of 
exorcism were attributed.  He was often appealed to in cases of demoniac 
possession.


Imperator :  Control of Rev. W. S. Moses.  (See Moses, William Stainton.)


Impersonation : Mediums who are controlled by the spirit of a deceased 
person frequently impersonate that person, imitate his voice and gestures, 
his physical peculiarities and manners, and exhibit the symptoms of any 
disease from which he may have suffered.  (See Trance Personalities.)


Incense, Magical : (See Magic.)


Incommunicable Axiom, The :  It was believed that all magical science was 
embodied in knowledge of this secret. The Axiom is to be found enclosed in 
the four letters of the Tetragram arranged in a certain way; in the words " 
Azoth"  and " Inri"  written kabalistically; and in the monogram of Christ 
embroidered in the labarum. He who succeeded in elucidating it became 
humanly omni-potent from the magical standpoint.


Incubus : A spirit which has intercourse with mortal women. The concept may 
have arisen from the idea of the com-merce of gods with women, rife in pagan 
times.  For, modern and medieval instances, we can do little more than refer 
to the pages in which they may be found, and the very names of the writers 
will sufficiently avouch their credibility. The history of Hector Boethius 
has three or four notable examples, which obtain confirmation from the pen 
of Cardan.  One of these we may venture to transcribe in the quaint dress 
which Holinshed had given it.  " In the year 1480 it chanced as a Scottish 
ship departed out of the Forth towards Flanders, there arose a wonderful 
great tempest of wind and weather, so outragious, that the maister of the 
ship, with other the mariners, woondered not a little what the matter ment, 
to see such weather at that time of the yeare, for it was about the middest 
of summer. At length, when the furious pirrie and rage of winds still 
increased, in such wise that all those within the ship looked for present 
death, there was a woman underneath the hatches called unto them above, and 
willed them to throw her into the sea, that all the residue, by God's grace, 
might yet be saved; and thereupon told them how she had been haunted a long 
time with a spirit dailie comming unto hir in man's likenesse.  In the ship 
there chanced also to be priest, who by the maister's appointment going down 
to this woman, and finding her like a most wretched and desperate person, 
lamenting hir great misfortune and miserable estate, used such wholesome 
admonition and comfortable advertise-ments, willing her to repent and hope 
for mercy at the hands of God, that, at length, she seeming right penitent 
for her grievous offences committed, and fetching snodrie sighs even from 
the bottome of her ifeart, being witnesse, as should appeare, of the same, 
there issued forth of the pumpe of the ship, a foule and evil-favoured 
blacke cloud with a mighty terrible noise, flame, smoke, and stinke, which 
presently fell into the sea.  And suddenlie thereupon the tempest ceassed, 
and the ship passing in great quiet the residue of her journey, arrived in 
saftie at the place whither she was bound."  ('Chronicles,' vol. v., 146, 
Ed. 1808). In another case related by the same author, the Incubus did not 
depart so quietly.  In the chamber of a young gentle-woman, of excellent 
beauty, and daughter of a nobleman in the country of Mar, was found at an 
unseasonable hour, "a foule monstrous thing, verie horrible to behold," for 
the love of which "Deformed" nevertheless, the lady had refused sundry 
wealthy marriages.  A priest who was in the company began to repeat St. 
John's Gospel, and ere he had proceeded far "suddenlie the wicked spirit, 
making a verie sore and terrible roaring noise, ffue his waies, taking the 
roofe of the chamber awale with him, the hangings and coverings of the bed 
being also burnt therewith."
     Erastus, in his Tract "de Laiis," Sprangerus, who assures us that 
himself and his four colleagues punished many old women of Ratisbon with 
death for this commerce, Zanchius ("de Operibus Dei," xvi., 4.); Dandidas 
("in Aristotelis de Anima," ii.' 29, 30); Reussus (v., 6); 
Godel-man (ii., 5); Valesius ("de Sacra Phil.," 40); and Delrio, passim," - 
among others, will satiate the keenest curiosity on these points.  From 
Bodinus, we learn that Joan Hervilleria, at twelve years of age, was 
solemnly betrothed to Beelzebub, by her mother, who was afterwards burnt 
alive for compassing this clandestine marriage.  The bridegroom was very 
respectably attired, and the marriage formulary was simple.  The mother 
pronounced the follow-ing words to the bridegroom: "Ecce filiam meam quam 
spospondi tibi," and then turning to the bride, "Ecce amicum tuom qui beabit 
te."  It appears, however, that Joan was not satisfied with her spiritual 
husband alone, but became a bigamist, by inter-marrying - with real flesh 
and blood.  Besides this lady, we read of Margaret Bre-mont, who, in company 
with her mother, Joan Robert, Joan Guillemin, Mary, wife of Simon Agnus, and 
Wilhelma, spouse of one Grassus, were in the habit of attending dia-bolic 
assignations.  These unhappy wretches were burnt alive by Adrian Ferreus, 
General Vicar of the Inquisition. Magdalena Crucia of Cordova, an abbess,  
was more fortunate.  In 1545 she became suspected by her nuns of magic, an 
accusation very convenient when a superior was at all troublesome.  She 
encountered them with great wisdom by anticipating their charge; and going 
before-hand to the Pope, Paul III., she confessed a thirty years intimate 
acquaintance with the devil, and obtained his
pardon.  (See England.)


India  Mystical Systems.-It would be beyond the scope of such a work as this 
to undertake to provide any account of the several religious systems of 
India, and we must confine ourselves to a description of the mysticism and 
demonology which cluster round these systems, and an outline of the magic 
and sorcery of the native peoples of the empire.
     Hinduism.-It may be said that the mysticism of the Hindus was a 
reaction against the detailed and practical ceremonial of the Vedas.  If its 
trend were summarised it might justly he said that it partakes strongly of 
disinter-estedness  is a pantheistic identifying of subject and object, 
worshipper and worship; aims at ultimate absorp-tion in the Infinite; 
inculcates absolute passivity, the most minute self-examination, the 
cessation of the physical powers; and believes in the spiritual guidance of 
the mystical adept.  For the Indian theosophists there is only one Absolute 
Being, the One Reality.  True, the pantheistic doctrine of Ekam advitiyam 
"the One without Second" posits a countless pantheon of gods, great and 
small, and a rich demonology; but it has to be 'understood that these are 
merely illusions of the soul and not realities. Upon the soul's coming to 
fuller knowledge, its illusions are totally dispelled, but to the ordinary 
man the imper-sonality of absolute being is useless.  He requires a sym-
bolic deity to bridge the gulf betwixt the impersonal Absolute and his very 
material self, hence the numerous gods of Hinduism which are regarded by the 
initiated merely as manifestations of the Supreme Spirit.  Even the rudest 
forms of idolatry in this way possess higher meaning.  As Sir Alfred Lyall 
says.:" It (Brahminism) treats all the worships as outward visible signs of 
the same spiritual truth, and is ready to show how each par-ticular image or 
rite is the symbol of some aspect of univer-sal divinity.  The Hindus, like 
the pagans of antiquity adore natural objects and forces,- a mountain, a 
river, or an animal.  The Brahmin holds all nature to be the vesture or 
cloak of indwelling divine energy which inspires every-thing that produces 
all or passes man's understanding."
     The life ascetic has from the remotest times been re-garded in India as 
the truest preparation for communion with the deity.  Asceticism is  
extremely prevalent especially in connection with the cult of Siva, who is 
in great measure regarded as the prototype of this class. The Yogis or Jogis 
(disciples of the Yogi. philosophy), practise mental abstraction, and are 
popularly supposed to attain to superhuman powers.  The usual results of 
their ascetic practices are madness or mental vacancy, and their so-called 
supernatural powers are mostly prophetic, or in too many cases pure jugglery 
and conjuring.  The Parama--Hamsas, that is "supreme swans" claim to be 
identical with the world-soul, and have no occupation except medita-tion on 
Brahma. They are said to be equally indifferent to pleasure or pain, 
insensible to heat or cold, and incapable of satiety or want. The Sannyasis 
are those who renounce terrestrial affairs: they are of the character of 
monks, and are as a general rule extremely dirty. The Dandis or staff-
bearers are worshippers of Siva in his form of Bhai-rava the Terrible.  Mr. 
J. C. Owen in his Mystics, Ascetics and Sects of India says of these Sadhus 
or holy men
     Sadhuism whether perpetuating the peculiar idea of the efficacy of 
asceticism for the acquisition of far-reaching powers over natural phenomena 
or bearing its testimony to the belief of the indispensableness of 
detachment from the world as a preparation for the ineffable joy of ecstatic 
communion with the Divine Being, has undoubtedly tended to keep before men's 
eyes as the highest ideal, a life of purity and restraint and contempt of 
the world of human affairs.  It has also necessarily maintained amongst the 
laity a sense of the rights and claims of the poor upon the charity of the 
more opulent members of the community. Further, Sadhuism by the multiplicity 
of the independent sects which - have arisen in India has engendered and 
favoured a spirit of tolerance which cannot escape the notice of the most 
superficial observer."
     One of the most esoteric branches of Hinduism is the Sakta cult.  The 
Saktas are worshippers of the Sakti or female principle as a creative and 
reproductive agency. Each of the principal gods possesses his own Sakti, 
through which his creative acts are performed, so that the Sakta worshippers 
are drawn from all sects.  But it is principally in connection with the cult 
of Siva that Sakta worship is practised.  Its principal seat is the north-
eastern part of India-Bengal, Behar and Assam.  It is divided into two 
distinct groups.  The original self-existent gods were sup-posed to divide 
themselves into male and female energies, the male half occupying the right-
hand and the female the left-hand side. From this conception we have the two 
groups of "right-hand" observers and "left-hand" observers. In the Tantras 
or mystical writings, Siva unfolds in the nature of a colloquy in answer to 
questions asked by his spouse Parvati, the mysteries of Sakta occultism.  
The right-hand worshippers are by far the most numerous. Strict secrecy is 
enjoined in the performance of the rites, and only one minor caste, the 
Kanlas, carry on the mystic and degraded rites of the Tantras.
     Brahmanism - Brahmanism is a system originated by the Brahmans, the 
sacerdotal caste of the Hindus, at a comparatively early date.  It is the 
mystical religion of India par excellence, and represents the more archaic 
beliefs of its peoples.  It states that the numberless individual existences 
of animate nature are but so many manifestations of the one eternal spirit 
towards which they tend as their final goal of supreme bliss.  The object of 
man is to prevent himself sinking lower in the scale, and by degrees to 
raise himself in it, or if possible to attain the ultimate goal immediately 
from such state of existence as he happens to be in.  The code of Manu 
concludes "He who in his own soul perceives the supreme soul in all beings 
and acquires equanimity towards them all attains the highest state of 
bliss." Mortification of animal instincts, absolute purity and perfection of 
spirit, were the moral ideals of the Brahman class.  But it was necessary to 
pass through a succession of four orders or states of existence ere any hope 
of union with the deity could be held out.  These were: that of 
brakmacharin, or student. of religious matters; grihastha, or householder; 
vanavasin, or hermit; and sannyasin or bhikshu, fakir or religious 
mendicant.  Practically every man of the higher castes practised at least 
the first two of these stages, while the priestly class took the entire 
course.  Later, however, this was by no means the rule, as the scope of 
study was intensely exacting, often lasting as long as forty-eight years, 
and the neophyte had to support himself by begging from door to door.  He 
was usually attached to the house of some religious teacher ; and after 
several years of his tuition was usually married, as it was considered 
absolutely essential that he should leave a son behind him to offer food to 
his spirit and to those of his ancestors. He was then said to have become a 
" Householder" and was required to keep up perpetually the fire brought into 
his house upon his marriage day.  Upon his growing older, the time for him 
arrived to enter the third stage of life, and he " cut himself off from all 
family ties except that (if she wished) his wife might accompany him, and 
went into retirement in a lonely place, carrying with him his sacred fire, 
and the instruments necessary to his daily sacrifices."  Scantily clothed, 
and with hair and nails uncut, it is set down that the anchorite must live 
entirely on food growing wild in the forest-roots, herbs, wild grain, and so 
forth.  The acceptance of gifts was not permitted him unless absolutely 
necessary, and his time was spent in reading the metaphysi-cal portions of 
the Veda, in making offerings, and in practising austerities with the object 
of producing entire indifference to worldly desires.  In this way he fits 
himself for the final and most exalted order, that of religious mendicant or 
bhikshu. This consists solely of meditation.  He takes up his abode at the 
foot of a tree in entire solitude, and only once a day at the end of their 
labours may he go near the dwellings of men to beg a little food.  In this 
way he waits for death, neither desiring extinction nor existence, until at 
length it reaches him, and he is absorbed in the eternal Brahma.
      The purest doctrines of Brahmanism are to be found in the Vedanta 
philosophic system, which recognises the Veda, or collection of ancient 
Sanskrit hymns, as the revealed source of religious belief through the 
visions of the ancient Risk's or seers.  It has been already mentioned that 
the Hindu regarded the entire gamut of animated nature as being traversed by 
the one soul, which journeyed up and down the scale as its actions in its 
previous existence were good or evil.  To the Hindu the vital element in all 
animate beings appears essentially similar, and this led directly to the 
Brahmanical theory of transmigration, which has taken such a powerful hold 
upon the Hindu mind.
Demonology.-A large and intricate demonology has clustered around Hindu 
mythology.  The gods are at con-stant war with demons. Thus Durga slays 
Chanda and Asura, and also despatches Durga, a fiend of similar name to 
herself. Vishnu also slays more than one demon, but Durga appears to have 
been a great enemy of the demon race.  The Asuras, probably a very ancient 
and aboriginal pantheon of deities, later became demons in the popular 
imagination, and the Rakshasas were cloud-demons. They are described as 
cannibals, could take any form, and were constantly, menacing the gods.  
They haunt cemeteries, disturb sacrifices, animate the dead, harry and 
afflict mankind in all sorts of ways.  In fact they are almost an absolute 
parallel with the vampires of Slavonic countries; and this greatly assists 
the conclusions of Asikoff that the Slavonic vampires were originally cloud-
spirits.  We find the gods constantly harassed by demons; and on the whole 
we may be justified in concluding that just as the Tuatha-de-danaan harassed 
the later deities of Ireland, so did these aboriginal gods lead an existence 
of constant warfare with the divine beings of the pantheon of the immigrant 
Aryans.
     Popular Witchcraft and Sorcery.-The popular witch-craft and sorcery of 
India greatly resembles that of Europe. The Dravidian or aboriginal races of 
India have always been strong believers in witchcraft, and it is possible 
that here we have an example of the mythic influence of a conquered people.  
They are, however, extremely reticent regarding any knowledge they possess 
of it.  It is practi-cally confined to them, and this might lead to the 
hasty supposition that the Aryan races of India possess no witchcraft of 
their own.  But this is strongly unlikely, and the truth probably lies quite 
in the other direction; how-ever, the extraordinarily high demands made upon 
the popular religious sense by Brahmanism probably crushed the superstitions 
of the lower cultus of a very early period, and confined the practice of 
minor sorcery to the lower castes, who were of course of Dravidian or 
aboriginal blood.  We find witchcraft most prevalent among the more isolated 
and least advanced races, like the Kols, Bhils, and Santals. The nomadic 
peoples are also strong believers in sorcery, one of the most dreaded forms 
of which is the Jigar Khor, or liver-eater, of whom Abul Fazl says :-One of 
this class can steal away the liver of another by looks and incantations.  
Other accounts say that by looking at a person he deprives him of his 
senses, and then steals from him something resembling the seed of a pome-
granate, which he hides in the calf of his leg ; after being swelled by the 
fire, he distributes it among his fellows to be eaten, which ceremony 
concludes the life of the fascinated person.  A Jigar Khor is able to 
communicate his art to another by teaching him incantations, and by making 
him eat a bit of the liver cake. These Jigar Khors are mostly women.  It is 
said they can bring intelligence from a long distance in a short space of 
time, and if they are thrown into a river with a stone tied to them, they 
nevertheless will not sink.  In order to deprive any one of this wicked
power, they brand his temples and every joint of his body, cram his eyes 
with salt, suspend him for forty days in a subterranean chamber, and repeat 
over him certain incan-tations."  The witch does not, however, devour the 
man's liver for two and a half days, and even if she has eaten it, and is 
put under the hands of an exorciser, she can be forced to substitute a liver 
of some animal in the body of the man whom she victimised.  We also hear 
tales of witches taking out the entrails of people, sucking them, and then 
replacing them.  All this undoubtedly illustrates, as in ancient France and 
Germany, and probably also in the Slavonic countries, the original 
combination of witch and vampire; how, in fact, the two were one and the 
same.  In India the arch-witch Ralaratri, or " black night" has the joined 
eyebrows of the Salvonic werewolf or vampire, large cheeks, widely-parted 
lips, projecting teeth, and is a veritable vampire.  But she also possesses 
the powers of ordinary witchcraft, - second-sight, the making of philtres, 
the control of tempests, the evil eye, and so forth.  Witches also take 
animal forms, especially those of tigers; and stories of trials are related 
at which natives gave evidence that they had tracked certain tigers to their 
lairs, which upon entering they had found tenanted by a a notorious witch or 
wizard.  For such witch-tigers the usual remedy is to knock out their teeth 
to prevent their doing any more mischief.  Strangely enough the Indian 
witch, like her European prototype, is very often accom-panied by a cat.  
The cat, say the jungle people, is aunt to the tiger. and taught him 
everything but how to climb a tree.  Zalim Sinh, the famous regent of Kota, 
believed that cats were associated with witches, and imagin-ing himself 
enchanted ordered that every cat should be expelled from his province.
     As in Europe, witches are known by certain marks. They are believed to 
learn the secrets of their craft by eating offal of all kinds.  The popular 
belief concerning them is that they are often very handsome and neat, and 
invariably apply a clear line of red lead to the parting of their hair.  
They are popularly accused of exhuming dead children, and bringing them to 
life to serve occult purposes of their own. They cannot die so long as they 
are witches, and until, as in Italy, they can pass on their knowledge of 
witchcraft to someone else. They recite charms backwards, repeating two 
letters and a half from a verse in the Koran.  If a certain charm is 
repeated " for-wards," the person employing it will become invisible to his 
neighbour. but if he repeats it backwards, he will assume whatever shape he 
chooses.  A witch can acquire power over her victim by getting possession of 
a lock of hair, the paring of nails, or some other part of his body, such as 
a tooth.  For this reason natives of India are extremely careful about the 
disposal of such, burying them in the earth in a place covered with grass, 
or in the neigh-bourhood of water, which witches universally dislike. Some 
people even fling the cuttings of their hair into running water.  Like the 
witches of Europe too, they are in the practice of making images of persons 
out of wax, dough, or similar substances, and torturing them, with the idea 
that the pain will be felt by the person whom they desire to injure.  In 
India the witches' familiar is known as Bir or the " hero," who aids her to 
inflict injury upon human beings.  The power of the witch is greatest on the 
14th, 15th and 29th of each month, and in particular on the Feast of Lamps, 
and the Festival of Durga.
      Witches are often severely punished amongst the isolated hill-folk and 
a diabolical ingenuity is shown in torturing them.  To nullify their evil 
influence, they are beaten with rods of the castor-oil plant and usually die 
in the process. They are often forced to drink filthy water used by curriers 
in the process of their work, or their noses are cut off, or they are put to 
death.  As has been said, their teeth are often knocked out, their heads 
shaved and offal is thrown at them.  In the case of women their heads are 
shaved and their hair is attached to a tree in some public place. They are 
also branded; have a ploughshare tied to their legs; and made to drink the 
water of a tannery.  During the Mutiny, when British authority was relaxed, 
the most atrocious horrors were inflicted upon witches and sorcerers by the 
Dravidian people.  Pounded chili peppers were placed in their eyes to see if 
they would bring tears, and the wretched beings were suspended from a tree 
head downwards, being swung violently from side to side. They were then 
forced to drink the blood of a goat, and to exorcise the evil spirits that 
they had caused to enter the bodies of certain sick persons. The mutilations 
and cruelties practised on them are such as will not bear repeti-tion, but 
one of the favourite ways of counteracting the spells of a witch is to draw 
blood from her, and the local priest will often prick the tongue of the 
witch with a needle, and place the resulting blood on some rice and compel 
her to eat it.
     In Bombay, the aboriginal Tharus are supposed to possess special powers 
of witchcraft, so that the " Land of Tharus" is a synonym for witch-land.  
In Gorakhpur, witches are also very numerous, and the half-gypsy Ban-jaras, 
or grain-carriers, are notorious believers in witch-craft.  In his 
interesting Popular Religion and Folk-lore of Northern India, Mr. W. Crooke, 
who has had exceptional opportunities for the study of the native character, 
and who has done much to clear up the dark places of Indian popular 
mythology, says regarding the various types of Indian witches
     "At the present day the half-deified witch most dreaded in the Eastern 
Districts of the North-western Provinces is Lona, or Nona, a Chamarin or 
woman of the currier caste.  Her legend is in this wise.  The great 
physician Dhanwantara, who corresponds to Luqman Hakim of the Muhammadans, 
was once on his way to cure King Parikshit, and was deceived and bitten by 
the snake king Takshaka. He therefore desired his son to roast him and eat 
his flesh, and thus succeed to his magical powers.  The snake king dissuaded 
them from eating the unholy meal, and they let the cauldron containing it 
float down the Ganges.  A currier woman, named Lona, found it and ate the 
contents, and thus succeeded to the mystic powers of Dhanwantara. She became 
skilful in cures, particularly of snake-bite. Finally she was discovered to 
be a witch by the extra-ordinary rapidity with which she could plant out 
rice seedlings.  One day the people watched her, and saw that when she 
believed herself unobserved she stripped herself naked, and taking the 
bundle of the plants in her hands threw them into the air, reciting certain 
spells.  When the seedlings forthwith arranged themselves in their proper 
places, the spectators called out in astonishment, and finding herself 
discovered, Nona rushed along over the country, and the channel which she 
made in her course is the Loni river to this day.  So a saint in Broach 
formed a new course for a river by dragging his clothes behind him.      
     “Another terrible witch, whose legend is told at Mathura, is Putana, 
the daughter of Bali, king of the lower world. She found the infant Krishna 
asleep, and began to suckle him with her devil's milk. The first drop would 
have poisoned a mortal child, but Krishna drew her breast with such strength 
that he drained her life-blood, and the fiend, terrifying the whole land of 
Bali with her cries of agony, fell lifeless on the ground.  European witches 
suck the blood of children ; here the divine Krishna turns the tables on the 
witch.
     “The Palwar Rajputs of Oudh have a witch ancestress. Soon after the 
birth of her son she was engaged in baking cakes.  Her infant began to cry, 
and she was obliged to perform a double duty.  At this juncture her husband 
arrived just in time to see his demon wife assume gigantic and supernatural 
proportions, so as to allow both the baking and nursing to go on at the same 
time.  But finding her secret discovered, the witch disappeared, leaving her 
son as a legacy to her astonished husband. Here, though the story is 
incomplete, we have almost certainly, as in the case of Nona Chamarin, one 
of the Melusina type of legend, where the supernatural wife leaves her 
husband and children, because he violated some taboo, by which he is 
forbidden to see her in a state of nudity, or the like.
     “The history of witchcraft in India, as in Europe, is one of the 
saddest pages in the annals of the people.  Nowa-days, the power of British 
law has almost entirely sup-pressed the horrible outrages which, under the 
native administration were habitually practised.  But particu-larly in the 
more remote and uncivilized parts of the country this superstition still 
exists in the minds of the people and occasional indications of it, which 
appear in our criminal records, are quite sufficient to show that any 
relaxation of the activity of our magistrates and police would undoubtedly 
lead to its revival in some of its more shocking forms."
     The aborigines of India live in great fear of ghosts and invisible 
spirits, and a considerable portion of their time is given up to averting 
the evil influences of these.  Pro-tectives of every description litter 
their houses, and the approaches to them, and they wear numerous amulets for 
the purpose of averting evil influences.  Regarding these, Mr. Crooks says
     "Some of the Indian ghosts, like the Ifrit of the Arabian Nights, can 
grow to the length of ten yojanas or eighty miles. In one of the Bengal 
tales a ghost is identified because she can stretch out her hands several 
yards for a vessel.  Some ghosts possess the very dangerous power of 
entering human corpses, like the Vetala, and swelling to an enormous size. 
The Kharwars of Mirzapur have a wild legend, which tells how long ago an 
unmarried girl of the tribe died, and was being cremated. While the 
relations were collecting wood for the pyre, a ghost entered the corpse, but 
the friends managed to expel him.  Since then great care is taken not to 
leave the bodies of women unwatched.  So, in the Panjab, when a great person 
is cremated the bones and ashes are carefully watched till the fourth day, 
to prevent a magician interfering with them.  If he has a chance, he can 
restore the deceased to life, and ever after retain him under his influence.  
This is the origin of the custom in Great Britain of waking the dead, a 
practice which 'most probably originated from a silly superstition as to the 
danger of a corpse being carried off by some of the agents of the invisible 
world, or exposed to the ominous liberties of brute animals.'  But in India 
it is considered the best course, if the corpse cannot be immediately 
disposed of, to measure it carefully, and then no malignant Bhutt can occupy 
it.
     Most of the ghosts whom we have been as yet con-sidering are malignant.  
There are, however, others which are friendly.  Such are the German Elves, 
the Robin Goodfellow, Puck, Brownie and the Cauld Lad of Hilton of England, 
the Glashan of the Isle of Man, the Phouka or Leprechaun of Ireland.  Such, 
in One of his many forms, is the Brahmadaitya, or ghost of a Brahman who has 
died unmarried.  In Bengal he is believed to be more neat and less 
mischievous than other ghosts; the Bhuts carry him in a palanquin, he wears 
wooden sandals, and lives in a Banyan tree.


Infernal Court.-Wierus and others, learned in the lore of the infernal 
regions, have discovered therein princes and high dignitaries, ministers, 
ambassadors, and officers of state, whose names would fill much space to 
little purpose Satan is no longer the soverign of Hades, but is, so to 
speak, leader of the opposition.  The true leader is Beelze-bub.


Initiation : The process of entry into a secret society or similar 
organisation.  The idea of initiation was certainly inherited by the 
Egyptians and Asssyrians from older neolithic peoples, who possessed secret 
organisations or "mysteries" analogous to those of the Medwiwin of the North 
American Indians or those of the Australian Black-fellows. We read of 
initiation into the various grades of the Egyptian priesthood and the " 
mysteries" of Eleusis and Bacchus.  (See Mysteries.)  These processes prob-
ably consisted of tests of courage and fidelity (as do the savage 
initiations) and included such acts as sustaining a severe buffeting, the 
drinking of blood, real and imagin-ary, and so forth.  In the Popol Vuh, the 
saga of the Kiche Indians of Guatemala we have a picture of the initia-tion 
tests of two hero-gods on entrance to the native Hades.  Indeed, most of the 
mysteries typified the descent of man into Hell, and his return to earth, 
based on the corn-mother legend of the resurrection of the wheat plant.
     Initiation into the higher branches of mysticism, magic and theosophy 
has been largely written upon  The process in regard to these is of course 
entirely sym-bolical, and is to be taken as implying a preparation for the 
higher life and the regeneration of the soul.


Institor, Henricus : (See Malleus Maleficarum.)


Instruments, Magical : (See Magic.)


Insufflation, says Eliphas Levi, 'is one of the most impor-tant practices of 
occult medicine, because it is a perfect sign of the transmission of life. 
To inspire, as a fact, means to breath upon some person or thing, and we 
know already. by the one doctrine of Hermes, that the virtue of things has 
created words, and that there is an exact proportion between ideas and 
speech, which is the first form and verbal realisation of ideas. The breath 
attracts or repels, according, as it is warm or cold. The warm breathing 
corresponds to positive electricity, and the cold breathing to negative 
electricity.  Electrical and nervous animals fear the cold breathing, and 
the experiment may be made upon a cat, whose familiarities are important.  
By fixedly regarding a lion or tiger and blowing in their face, they would 
be so stupefied as to be forced to retreat before us. Warm and prolonged 
insufflation restores the circulation of the blood, cures rheumatic and 
gouty pains, re-estab-lishes the balance of the humours, and dispels 
lassitude. When the operator is sympathetic and good, it acts as a universal 
sedative.  Cold insufflation soothes pains occa-sioned by congestions and 
fluidic accumulations.  The two breathings must, therefore, be used 
alternately. observing the polarity of the human organism, and acting in a 
contrary manner upon the poles, which must be treated successfully to an 
opposite magnetism. Thus. to cure an inflamed eye, the one which is not 
affected must be subjected to a warm and gentle insufflation, cold insuffla-
tion being practised upon the suffering member at the same distance and in 
the same proportion.  Magnetic passes have a similar effect to 
insufflations, and are a real breath-ing by transpiration and radiation of 
the interior air, which is phosphorescent with vital light; slow passes 
constitute a warm breathing which fortifies and raises the spirits; swift 
passes are a cold breathing of dispersive nature, neutralising tendencies to 
congestion. The warm insuffla-tion should be performed transversely. or from 
below upward, the cold insufflation is more effective when directed downward 
from above."


Intuitional World  Formerly known as the Buddhic Plane, is in the theosophic 
scheme the fourth world, and from it come intuitions.  (See Theosophy, Solar 
System, and Intuition).


Invocation  (See Necromancy.)


Ireland  For information regarding ancient Ireland See Celts."  Although 
nominally Christianised, there is little doubt that the early medieval Irish 
retained many relics of their former condition of paganism, especially those 
which possessed a magical tendency.  This is made clear by the writings of 
Giraldus Cambrensis, the first account we have of Irish manners and customs 
after the invasion of the country by the Anglo-Normans.  His description, 
for example, of the Purgatory of St. Patrick in Lough Derg, Co. Donegal, 
proves that the demonology of the Catholic Church had already fused with the 
animism of Irish native heathnesse.  He says:-
      "There is a lake in Ulster containing an island divided into two 
parts.  In one of these stands a church of especial sanctity, and it is most 
agreeable and delightful, as well as beyond measure glorious for the 
visitations of angels and the multitude of the saints who visibly frequent 
it.  The other part, being covered with rugged crags, is reported to be the 
resort of devils only, and to be almost always the theatre on which crowds 
of evil spirits visibly perform their rites.  This part of the island 
contains nine pits, and should any one perchance venture to spend the night 
in one of them (which has been done, we know, at times, by some rash men), 
he is immediately seized by the malignant spirits, who so severely torture 
him during the whole night, inflicting on him such unutterable sufferings by 
fire and water, and other torments of various kinds, that when morning comes 
scarcely any spark of life is found left in his wretched body.  It is said 
that any one who has once submitted to these torments as a penance imposed 
upon him, will not afterwards undergo the pains of hell, unless he commit 
some sin of a deeper dye.
     "This place is called by the natives the Purgatory of St. Patrick.  For 
he, having to argue with a heathen race concerning the torments of hell, 
reserved for the reprobate, and the real nature and eternal duration of the 
future life, in order to impress on the rude minds of the unbelievers a 
mysterious faith in doctrines so new, so strange, so opposed to their 
prejudices, procured by the efficacy of his prayers an exemplification of 
both states even on earth, as a salutary lesson to the stubborn minds of the 
people."
     The ancient Irish believed in the possibility of the trans-formation of 
human beings into animals, and Giraldus in another narrative of facts 
purporting to have come under his personal notice proves that this belief 
had lost none of its significance with the Irish of the latter half of the 
twelfth century.  The case is also interesting as being one of the first 
recorded examples of lycanthropy (q.v.) in the British Isles, and that must 
be our excuse for quoting it at some length.
     “About three years before the arrival of Earl John in Ireland, it 
chanced that a priest, who was journeying from Ulster towards Meath, was 
benighted in a certain wood on the borders of Meath.  While, in company with 
only a young lad, he was watching by a fire which he had kindled under the 
branches of a spreading tree, lo l a wolf came up to them, and immediately 
addressed them to this effect : ' Rest secure, and be not afraid, for there 
is no reason you should fear, where no fear is ' The travellers being struck 
with astonishment and alarm, the wolf added some orthodox words referring to 
God.  The priest then implored him, and adjured him by Almighty God and 
faith in the Trinity, not to hurt them, but to inform them what creature it 
was in the shape of a beast uttered human words.  The wolf, after giving 
catholic replies to all questions, added at last: 'There are two of us, a 
man and a woman, natives of Ossory, who, through the curse of Natalis, saint 
and abbot, are compelled every seven years to put off the human form, and 
depart from the dwellings of men.  Quitting entirely the human form, we 
assume that of wolves.  At the end of the seven years, if they chance to 
survive, two others being substituted in their places, they return to their 
country and their former shape. And now, she who is my partner in this 
visitation lies dangerously sick not far from hence, and, as she is at the 
point of death, I beseech you, inspired by divine-charity, to give her the 
consolations of your priestly office.'
     "At this wood the priest followed the wolf trembling, as he led the way 
to a tree at no great distance, in the hollow of which he beheld a she-wolf, 
who under that shape was pouring forth human sighs and groans.  On seeing 
the priest, having saluted him with human courtesy, she gave thanks to God, 
who in this extremity had vouchsafed to visit her with such consolation.  
She then received from the priest all the rites of the church duly 
performed, as far as the last communion. This also she importunately 
demanded, earnestly supplicating him to complete his good offices by giving 
her the viaticum.  The priest stoutly asserting that he was not provided 
with it, the he-wolf who had withdrawn to a short distance, came back and 
pointed out a small missal-book, containing some consecrated wafers, which 
the priest carried on his journey, suspended from his neck, under his 
garment, after the fashion of the country.  He then intreated him not to 
deny them the gift of God, and the aid destined for them by Divine 
Providence; and, to remove all doubt, using his claw for a hand, he tore off 
the skin of the she-wolf from the head down to the navel, folding it back.  
Thus she immediately presented the form of an old woman. The priest, seeing 
this, and compelled by his fear more than his reason, gave the communion;  
the recipient having earnestly implored it, and devoutly partaking of it. 
Immediately afterwards the he-wolf rolled back the skin and fitted it to its 
original form.
     "These rites having been duly, rather than rightly performed, the he-
wolf gave them his company during the whole night at their little fire, 
behaving more like a man than a beast. When morning came, he led them out of 
the wood, and, leaving the priest to pursue his journey pointed out to him 
the direct road for a long distance.  At his departure, he also gave him 
many thanks for the benefit he had conferred, promising him still greater 
returns of gratitude, if the Lord should call him back from his present 
exile, two parts of which he had already completed."
     “It chanced, about two years afterwards, that I was passing through 
Meath, at the time when the bishop of that land had convoked a synod, having 
also invited the assist-ance of the neighbouring bishops and abbots, in 
order to have their joint counsels on what was to be done in the affair 
which had come to his knowledge by the priest's confession. The bishop, 
hearing that I was passing through those parts, sent me a message by two of 
his clerks, request-ing me, if possible, to be personally present when a 
matter of so much importance was under consideration; but if I could not 
attend he begged me at least to signify my opinion in writing. The clerks 
detailed to me all the cir-cumstances, which indeed I had heard before from 
other persons; and, as I was prevented by urgent business from being present 
at the synod, I made up for my absence by giving them the benefit of my 
advice in a letter.  The bishop and synod, yielding to it, ordered the 
priest to appear before the pope with letters from them, setting forth what 
had occurred, with the priest's concession, to which instrument the bishops 
and abbots who were present at the synod affixed their seals."
     "In our own time we have seen persons who, by magical arts, turned any 
substance about them into fat pigs, as they appeared (but they were always 
red), and sold them in the markets.  However, they disappeared as soon as 
they crossed any water, returning to their real nature  and with whatever 
care they were kept, their assumed form did not last beyond three days. It 
has also been a frequent complaint, from old times as well as in the 
present, that certain hags in Wales, as well as in Ireland and Scotland 
changed themselves into the shape of hares, that, sucking teats under this 
counterfeit form, they might stealthily rob other people's milk."

     In Anglo-Norman times sorcery was widely practised but notices are 
scarce.  It is only by fugitive passages in the works of English writers who 
constantly animadvert against the superstitious nature and practices of the 
Irish that we glean any information concerning the occult history of the 
country.  The great cause celebre of the Lady Alice Kyteler (q.v.) shook the 
entire Anglo-Norman colony during several successive years in the first half 
of the fourteenth century.  The party of the Bishop of Ossory the relentless 
opponent of the Lady Alice, boasted that by her prosecution they had rid 
Ireland of a nest of sorcerers, but there is reason to believe that Ireland 
could have furnished numerous similar instances of black magic had the 
actors in them been of similar rank to the ill-fated lady-that is of 
sufficient importance in the eyes of chroniclers.
     In this connection a work on Irish Witchcraft and Demon-ology by Mr. 
St. John D. Seymour (1913), is of striking and pregnant interest.  We do not 
gather from it that Mr. Seymour had any previous general knowledge of the 
sub-ject he handles before writing this book, and he appears to take it for 
granted that witchcraft in Ireland is purely an alien system, imported into 
the island by the Anglo--Normans and Scottish immigrants to the north.  This 
undoubtedly is the case so far as the districts of the Pale and of Ulster 
are concerned, but surely it cannot be applied to the Celtic districts of 
Ireland.  Regarding these Mr. Seymour is silent, but it will occur to most 
readers that the analogy of Celtic Scotland, which abounded in witches and 
witch-customs, is powerful evidence that a system similar to that in vogue 
in the Highlands obtained in the aboriginal districts of Ireland.  Early 
Irish works contain numerous references to sorcery, and practices are 
chronicled in them which bear a close resemblance to those of the shamans 
and medicine-men of savage tribes all over the world.  Animal 
transformation, one of the most common feats of the witch, is alluded to 
again and again in the ancient Irish cycles, and there are few heroes in 
Hibernian legend who have not a fair stock of working magic at their finger-
ends. Wonder-working druids, too, abound.  Mr. Seymour will have it that  In 
Celtic Ireland dealings with the unseen were not regarded with such 
abhorrence, and indeed had the sanction of custom and antiquity."  He also 
states that " the Celtic element had its own super-stitious beliefs, but 
these never developed in this direction" (the direction of Witchcraft).  
This is very difficult to believe.  The lack of records of such a system is 
no criterion that it never existed, and we have not the least hesitation in 
saying that a thorough examination of the subject would prove that a 
veritable system of witchcraft obtained in Celtic Ireland as elsewhere, 
although it may not have been of 
“Celtic" origin.
     Be that as it may, Mr. Seymour's book is most inter-esting as dealing 
with those Anglo-Norman and Scottish portions of Ireland where the belief in 
witchcraft followed the lines of those in vogue in the mother-countries of 
the immigrant populations.  He sketches the cause celebre of the Kyteler 
case (q.v.), touches on the circumstances con-nected with the Earl of 
Desmond and notes the case of the Irish prophetess who insisted upon warning 
the ill-fated James I. of Scotland on the night of his assassination at 
Perth. It is not stated by the ancient chronicler, quoted by Mr. Seymour, 
from what part of Ireland the witch in question emanated-for a witch she 
undoubtedly was as she possessed a familiar spirit, Huthart, whom she 
alleged had made her cognisant of the coming catastrophe. Mr. Seymour does 
not seem to be aware of the history of this spirit.  He is the Teutonic 
Hudekin (q.v.) or Hildekin, the wearer of the hood, sometimes also alluded 
to as Heckdekin, well known throughout Germany and Flanders as a species of 
house-spirit or brownie.  Trithemius alludes to him as a "spirit known to 
the Saxons who attached himself to the Bishop of Hildesheim" and we find him 
cropping up here and there in occult history. From this circumstance it 
might with justice be inferred that the witch in question came from some 
part of Ireland which had been settled by Teutonic immigrants, and more 
probably from Ulster, but the data is insufficient to permit us to conclude 
this definitely.
     From the most scanty materials, Mr. Seymour has com-piled a book of 
outstanding interest.  He passes in review the witchcraft trials of the XVI. 
century, the burning of Adam Dubh, of the Leinster trial of O’Toole and 
College Green in 1327 for heresy, and the passing of the statute against 
witchcraft in Ireland in 1586. The prevalence of witchcraft in Ireland 
during the sixteenth century is proved by him to have been very great 
indeed, but a number of the authorities he cites, as to the existence of 
sorcerers in the Green Isle, almost certainly refer to the more Celtic 
portions of it; for example Rich and Stani-hurst. He has an excellent note 
upon the enchantments of the Earl of Desmond who demonstrated to his young 
and beautiful wife the possibilities of animal transformation by changing 
himself into a bird, a hag, a vulture, and a gigantic serpent. Human 
relations with the Devil are dwelt upon at length by Mr. Seymour in a racy 
chapter, and we are told how he was cheated by a doctor of divinity and 
raised on occasion by certain sorcerers. Florence Newton, the witch of 
Youghal claims an entire chapter to herself, and worthily, for her case is 
one of the most absorbing in the history of witchcraft. At any rate, 
whatever her occult powers, she splendidly succeeded in setting a whole com-
munity by the ears. Ghostly doings and apparitions, fairy possession, and 
dealings with the ‘wee folk' are also included in the volume; and Mr. 
Seymour has not confined himself to Ireland, but has followed one of his 
countrywomen to America, where he shows how she gave congenial employ-ment 
to the fanatic Cotton Mather (q.v.). Witchcraft notices of the seventeenth 
century in Antrim and Island Magee comprise the eighth chapter; and the 
ninth and last bring down the affairs of sorcery in Ireland from the year 
1807 to the present day. The last notice is that of a trial for murder in 
1911, when a wretched woman was tried for killing another-an old-age 
pensioner-in a fit of insanity. A witness deposed that he met the accused on 
the road on the morning of the crime holding a statue or figure in her hand, 
and repeating three times "I have the old witch killed.  I got power from 
the Blessed Virgin to kill her." It appears that the witch quoted in 
question threatened to plague the murderess with rats and mice; a single 
rodent had evidently penetrated to her abode, and was followed by the bright 
vision of a lady who told the accused that she was in danger, and further 
informed her that if she received the old pensioner's pension-book without 
taking off her clothes and cleaning them and putting out her bed and 
cleaning up the house, she would receive dirt for ever and rats and mice."  
This is not an isolated case, and shows how hard such superstitions die in 
the more remote portions of civilised countries.
     We have reviewed Mr. Seymour's book at some length because it 
represents practically all that exists on the subject in question.  But it 
would be interesting to see him further his researches by an examination 
into such of the native Irish records as exist.  Such a course would most 
probably result in the rescue of a considerable amount of detail which would 
enable him to complete the occult history of his country.


Iron : Its occult virtues are thus described by Pliny, accord-ing to Holland 
.-" As touching the use of Yron and steele in Physicke, it serveth otherwise 
than for to launce, cut, and dismember withal  for take the knife or dagger, 
an make an ymaginerie circle two or three times round with the point thereof 
upon a young child or an elder bodie. and then goe round withall about the 
partie as often, it is a singular preservative against all poysons, 
sorceries, or enchantments.  Also to take any yron naile Out of the coffin 
or sepulchre wherein man or woman lieth buried, and to sticke the same fast 
to the lintle or side post of a dore, leading either to the house or bed-
chamber where any dooth lie who is haunted with Spirits in the night, lie or 
she shall be delivered and secured from such phanasticall illusions.  
Moreover, it is said, that if one be lightly pricked with the point of sword 
or dagger, which hath been the death of a man, it is an excellent remedy 
aga'nst the pains of sides or breast, which come with sudden prickes or 
stitches."
     In certain parts of Scotland and the North of Ireland, there is a 
belief in the potency of iron tor warding off the attacks of fairies.  An 
iron poker, laid across a cradle, will, it is believed. keep the fairies 
away until the child is baptised.  The Rev. John G. Campbell in his 
Superstitions of the Scottish Highlands relates how when a child, he and 
another boy were believed to be protected from a fairy which had been seen 
at a certain spot by the possession, the one of a knife, and the other of a 
nail. This was at Appin in Argylishire.


Irving's Church, Speaking with Tongues in :  In 1831 an outbreak of speaking 
with tongues occurred in the con-gregation of Edward Irving, in London.  For 
several years Irving had waited for such a visitation, and had instituted 
special early-morning services for the purpose of hastening it. At length. 
in July, 1831, the" visitation" came, first one and then another of the 
congregation speak-ing with "tongues"  and with prophetic utterance. Irving 
himself was not at first entirely disposed to accept the utterances as of 
divine origin.  But the undoubted good faith and irreproachable doctrine of 
his flock re-assured him.  Robert Baxter,. who was absent at the com-
mencement of the outbreak, but who was himself influenced to prophesy at a 
later date, has left an account of his experiences.  The phenomena did not 
greatly differ from that of similar outbreaks.  The inspired speakers were 
often attended by physical symptoms, such as convulsions, and they spoke in 
loud, somewhat unnatural tones. Baxter declares that he spoke sentences in 
Latin, French, and unknown languages.  At length, however, evil spirits 
began to appear in the company. some of the congregation admitting that they 
had been possessed by false spirits. The outbreak seen afterwards died out.


Isaac of Holland  Very little is known about the life of this alchemist, but 
he is commonly supposed to have lived and worked early in the fifteenth 
century, the principal reason for assigning his career to that period being 
that in his writings he refers to Geber, Dastin, Morien and Arnold de 
Villanova, but not to more modern authorities  while again. he appears to 
have been acquainted with various chymical processes discovered towards the 
close of the fourteenth century. and hence it may reasonably be deduced that 
he did not live anterior to that time. Accord-ing to tradition Isaac worked 
along with his son, whose name is not recorded, and the pair are usually 
regarded as having been the first men to exploit chymistry in the 
Netherlands.  They are said to have been particularly skilful in the 
manufacture of enamels and artificial gems, and it is noteworthy that no 
less distinguished an alchemist than Paracelsus attached value to the 
Dutchmen's researches while these are also mentioned with honour by the 
seven-teenth century English scientist, Robert Boyle.
     Isaac compiled two scientific treatises, the one entitled De Triptici 
Ordine Elixiris et Lapidis Theoria, and the other Opera Mineralia Joannis 
Isaaci Hollandi, sive de Lapide PIiilosophico, and both were published at 
the beginning of the seventeenth century  The more important of the two is 
the last-named, wherein the author sets forth his ideas on the exalting of 
base metals into Sot and Lone, and shows by the aid of illustrations exactly 
what kind of vessels should be used for this purpose.

Italy : (For Ancient Italy see Rome.) Magic and sorcery in medieval Italy 
seem strangely enough to have centred round many great personalities of the 
church, and even several popes have been included by the historians of 
occult science in the ranks of Italian sorcerers and alchemists. There 
appears to have been some sort of tradition. the origin of which is by no 
means clear, that the popes had been given over to the practice of magic 
ever since the tenth century, and it was alleged that Silvester II. 
confessed to this charge on his death-bed.  Levi States that Honorius III., 
who preached the Crusades, was an abominable necroman-cer, and author of a 
grimoire or book by which spirits were evoked, the use of which is reserved 
exclusively to the priesthood.  Platina, quoting from Martinus Polonus, 
states that Silvester, who was a proficient mathematician and versed in the 
Kabala on one occasion evoked Satan himself and obtained his assistance to 
gain the pontifical crown.  Furthermore he stipulated as the price of 
selling his soul to the Devil that he should not die except at Jerusa-lem, 
to which place lie inwardly determined he would never betake himself.  He 
duly became Pope, but on one occasion whilst celebrating mass in a certain 
church at Rome, he felt extremely ill, and suddenly remembered that he was 
officiating in a chapel dedicated to the Holy Cross of Jerusa-lem.  He had a 
bed set up in the chapel, to which he summoned the cardinals, and confessed 
that he had held communication with the powers of evil.  He further arranged 
that when dead his body should be placed upon a car of green wood, and 
should be drawn by two horses, one black and the other white; that they 
should be started on their course, but neither led nor driven, and that 
where they halted there his remains should be entombed.  The conveyance 
stopped in front of the Lateran, and at this juncture most terrible noises 
proceeded from it, which led the bystanders to suppose that the soul of 
Silvester had been seized upon by Satan in virtue of their agreement. There 
is no doubt whatsoever that must of these legends concerning papal 
necromancers are absolute inventions and can be traced through Platina and 
Polonus to Galfridus and Gervaise, the necromancer, whom Naude has rightly 
termed " the greatest forger of fables, and the most notori-ous liar that 
ever took pea in hand ! "  On a par with such stories is that of Pope Joan, 
who for several years sat on the papal throne although a woman, and who was 
supposed to be one of the blackest sorceresses of all time.  To her many 
magic books are attributed.  Levi has an interesting passage in his History 
of Magic, in which he states that certain engravings in a Life of this 
female pope, purporting to represent her, are nothing else than ancient 
tarots representing Isis crowned with a tiara.  " It is well-known," he 
says, "that the hieroglyphic figure on the second tarot card is still called 
'The Female Pope,' being a woman wearing a tiara, on which are the points of 
the crescent moon, or the horns of Isis."  It is much more possible that the 
author of the grimoire in question was Honorius II., the anti-pope, or 
perhaps another Honorius who is described as the son of Euclid and master of 
the Thebans.  But all Italian necromancers and magicians were by no means 
church-men-indeed medieval leafy was hardly a place for the magically 
inclined, so stringent were the laws of the church against the Black Art.  
Astrology, however, flourished to some extent, and its practitioners do not 
appear to have been unduly persecuted.  A Florentine astrologer, named 
Basil, who flourished at the beginning of the fifteenth cen-tury, obtained 
some repute for successful predictions; and is said to have foretold to 
Cosmo de Medic that he would attain exalted dignity, as the same planets had 
been in ascendency at the hour of his birth, as in that of the Emperor 
Charles V.  Many remarkable predictions were made by Antiochus Tibertus of 
Romagna, who was for some time councillor to Pandolpho de Maletesta, Prince 
of Rimini. He foretold to his friend, Guido de Bogni, the celebrated 
soldier, that he was unjustly suspected by his best friend, and would 
forfeit his life through suspicion.  Of himself he predicted that he would 
die on the scaffold, and of the Prince of Rimini, his patron, that he would 
die a beggar in the hospital for the poor at Bologna.  It is stated that the 
prophecies came true in every detail.
     Although the notices of sorcery in medieval times are few and far 
between in Italian history, there is reason to suspect that although magic 
was not outwardly practised, it lurked hidden in by-paths and out-of-the-way 
places. We have an excellent portrait of the medieval Italian magician in 
those popular myths regarding Virgil the Enchanter.  The fame of Virgil the 
Poet had waxed so great in ancient Italy, that in due course of time his 
name was synonymous with fame itself.  From that it is a short step to the 
attribution of supernatural power, and Virgil the Roman poet became in the 
popular mind the medieval Enchanter.  His myth is symptomatic of magic in 
medie-val Italy as a whole, and it may therefore be given here at some 
length.
     When the popular myth of Virgil the Enchanter first grew into repute is 
uncertain, but probably the earliest faint conception arose about the 
beginning of the tenth century, and each succeeding generation embroidered 
upon it some fantastic impossibility.  Soon, in the South of Italy-for the 
necromancer's fame was of southern origin-there floated dim, mysterious 
legends of the enchantments which he had wrought.  Thus he fashioned a 
brazen fly, and planted it on the gate of fair Parthenope to free the city 
from the inroads of the insects of Beelzebub. On a Neapolitan hill he built 
a statue of brass, and placed in its mouth a trumpet; and lo I when the 
north wind blew there came from that trumpet so terrible a roar that it 
drove back into the sea the noxious blasts of Vulcan's forges, which, even 
to this day, seethe and hiss near the city of Puossola.  At one of the gates 
of Naples he raised two statues of stone, and gifted them respectively with 
the power of blighting or blessing the strangers who, on enter-ing the city, 
passed by one or the other of them.  He con-structed three public baths for 
the removal of every disease which afflicts the human frame, but the 
physicians, in a wholesome dread of losing their patients and their fees, 
caused them to be destroyed.  Other wonders he wrought, which in time 
assumed a connected form, and were woven into a life of the enchanter, first 
printed in French about 1490-1520.  A still fuller history appeared in 
English, the well-known " Life of Virgilius," about 1508, printed by Hans 
Doesborcke at Antwerp.  It sets forth with tolerable clearness the popular 
type of the medieval magician, and will be our guide in the following 
biographical sketch.
Virgil was the son of a wealthy senator of Rome, wealthy and powerful enough 
to carry on war with the Roman Emperor.  As his birth was heralded by extra-
ordinary portents, it is no marvel that even in childhood he showed himself 
endowed with extraordinary mental powers. and his father having the sagacity 
to discern in him an embryo necromancer, sent him, while still very young, 
to study at the University of Toledo, where the "art of magick" was taught 
with extraordinary success.
     "There he studied diligently, for he was of great under-standing, and 
speedily acquired a profound insight into the great Shemaia of the Chaldean 
lore.  But this insight was due, not so much to nocturnal vigils over 
abstruse books, as to the help he received from a very valuable familiar.  
And this was the curious fashion in which he was introduced to the said 
familiar
     “Upon a tyme the scholers at Tolenten hadde lycence to goo to playc and 
sporte them in the fyldes after the usuance of the olde tyme; and there was 
also Virgilius therby also walkynge among the hylles all about.  It fortuned 
he spyed a great hole in the syde of a great hyll, wherein he went to depe 
that he culde not see no more lyght, and than he went a lytell ferther 
therein, and then he sawe soon lyght agayne, and than wente he fourth 
streyghte.  And within a lyteli wyle after he harde a voice that called, 
'Virgilius, Virgilius,' and he loked aboute, and he colde nat see nobodye. 
Than Virgilius spake, and asked, 'Who calleth me?'  Than harde he the voyce 
agayne, but he sawe nobodye.  Than sayd he, 'Virgilius, see ye not that 
lytell bourde lyinge byside you there, marked with that worde ?' Than 
answered Virgilius, I see that borde well enough.'  The voyce said, 'Deo 
away that bourde, and lette me out theratte.'
     “’Than answered Virgilius to the voyce that was under the lytell 
bourde, and sayd, ' Who art thou that talkest me so ?'  Than answered the 
devyll, 'I am a devyll con-jured out of the body of a certeyne man, and 
banysshed here tyll the daye of jugement, without that I be delyvered by the 
handes of men.  Thus, Virgilius, I pray thee delyver me out of this payn, 
and I shall show unto thee many bokes of nygromancy, and how thou shalt cum 
by it lytly, and shalte knowe the practyse therein, that no man in the 
science of nygromancy shall (sur)pass thee; and, more-over, I shall showe 
arid informe thee so that thou shalt have all thy desyre, whereby methinke 
it is a great gyfte for so lytell a donyge, for ye may also thus all your 
poor frendys helpen, and make ryghte your ennemycs un-mighty.'
     “Thorough that great promise was Virgilius tempted. He badde the fynd 
showe the bokes to hym, that he myght have and occupy them at his wyll.  And 
so the fynd showed hym, and then Virgilius pulled open a bourde, and there 
was a lytell hole, and thereat wrange the devyll out lyke a yeel, and cam 
and stode before Virgilius lyke a bigge man.
     “’Thereof Virgilius  was astonied, and merveyled greately thereof, 
tliat so great a man myght com out at so lytell a hole !
     “'Then sayd Virgilius, ' Shulde ye well passe into the hole that ye cam 
out of? I  'Yes, I shall well,' sayd the devyll.  'I holde the beste pledge 
that I have, ye shall not do it.'  ' Well,' sayd the devyll, ' thereto I 
consente.'
     And then the devyll wrange hymself into the lytell hole agen, and as he 
was therein, Virgilius kyvered the hole agen with the bourde close, and so 
was the devyll begyled, and myght not there come out agen, but there abydeth 
shutte styli therein.  Than called the devyll dredefully (drearily) to 
Virgilius, and sayd, 'What have ye done?' Virgilius answered, 'Abyde there 
styli to your day apoynted.' And fro thensforth abydeth he there.'
     Virgil's father died soon after this event, and his estates being 
seized by his former colleagues, his widow sunk into extreme poverty.  
Virgil accordingly gathered together the wealth he had amassed by the 
exercise of his magical skill, and set out for Rome, to replace his mother 
in a position proper to her rank.  At Toledo, however, he was a famous 
student; at Rome he was a despised scholar, and when he besought the Emperor 
to execute justice and restore to him his estate, that potentate -  ignorant 
of the magician's power-simply replied, 'Me-thinketh that the land is well 
divided to them that have it, for they may help you in their need; what 
needeth you for to care for the disheriting of one school-master Bid him 
take heed, and look to his schools, for he hath no right to any land here 
about the city of Rome.'
     Four years passed, and only such replies as this were vouchsafed to 
Virgil's frequent appeals for justice.  Grow-ing at length a-weary of the 
delay, he resolved to exercise his wondrous powers in his own behalf.  When 
the harvest-time came, he accordingly shrouded the whole of his right-ful 
inheritance with a vapour so dense that the new pro-prietors were unable to 
approach it, and under its cover his men gathered in the entire crop with 
perfect security. This done; the mist disappeared.  Then a great indignation 
possessed the souls of his enemies, and they assembled their swordsmen, and 
marched against him to take off his head. Such was their power that the 
Emperor for fear fled out of Rome, ' for they were twelve senators that had 
all the world under them; and if Virgilius had had right, he had been one of 
the twelve, but they had disinherited him and his mother.'  When they drew 
near, Virgil once more baffled their designs by encircling his patrimony 
with a rampart of cloud and shadow.
     The  Emperor, with surprising inconsistency, now coalesced with the 
senators against Virgil-whose magical powers he probably feared far more 
than the rude force of the senatorial magnates-and made war against him. But 
who can prevail against the arts of necromancy ? Emperor and senators were 
beaten, and from that moment Virgil, with marvellous generosity, became the 
faithful friend and powerful supporter of his soverign      
     It may not generally be known that Virgil, besides being the saviour of 
Rome, was the founder of Naples.  This feat had its origin, like so many 
other great actions, in the power of love.
     Virgil's imagination had been fired by the reports that reached him of 
the surpassing loveliness of the Sultan's daughter.  Now the Sultan lived at 
Babylon (that is, at Cairo-the Babylon of the medieval romancers), and the 
distance might have daunted a less ardent lover and less potent magician.  
But Virgil's necromantic skill was equal to a bridge in the air-where other 
glowing spirits have often raised fair castles I-and passing over it, he 
found his way into the Sultan's palace,-into the Princess's chamber,-and 
speedily overcoming her natural modesty, bore her back with him to his 
Italian bower of pleasaunce. There having enjoyed their fill of love and 
pleasure, he restored to her bed in her father's palace.  Meanwhile, her 
absence had been noted, but she was soon discovered on her return, and the 
Sultan repairing to her chamber, interro-gated her respecting her 
disappearance.  He found that she knew not who it was that had carried her 
off, nor whither she had been carried.
     When Virgil restored the lady on the following night, she took back 
with her, by her father's instructions, some of the fruit plucked from the 
enchanter's garden; and from its quality the Sultan guessed that she had 
been carried to a southern land " on the side of France."  These nocturnal 
journeys being several times repeated, and the Sultan's curiosity growing 
ungovernable, he persuaded his daughter to give her lover a sleeping-
draught.  The deceived magician was then captured in the Babylonian palace, 
and flung into prison, and it was decreed that both he and his mistress 
should be punished for their love by death at the stake.
     Necromancers, however, are not so easily outwitted. As soon as Virgil 
was apprized of the fate intended for him, he made, by force of his spells, 
the Sultan and all his lords believe that the great river of Babylon-the 
might Nilus-was overflowing in the midst of them, and that they swam and lay 
and sprang like geese; and so they took up Virgilius and the Princess, tore 
them from their prison, and placed them upon the aerial bridge.  And when 
they were thus out of danger, he delivered the Sultan from the river, and 
all the lords; and lo, when they recovered their humanity, they beheld the 
enchanter bearing the beautiful Princess across the Mediterranean; and they 
marvelled much, and felt that they could not hope to prevail against his 
super-natural power.
     And in this manner did Virgilius convey the Sultan's daughter over the 
sea to Rome.  And he was highly enamoured of her beauty.  "Then he thought 
in his mind how he might marry her "-apparently forgetting that he was 
already married-" and thought in his mind to found in the midst of the sea a 
fair town with great lands belong-ing to it; and so he did by his cunning, 
and called it Naples: and the foundation of it was of eggs.  And in that 
town of Naples he made a tower with four corners and on the top he set an 
apple upon an iron yard, and no man could pull away that apple without he 
brake it; and through that iron set he a bottle, and on that bottle set he 
an egg; and he hanged the apple by the stalk upon a chain, and so hangeth it 
still.  And when the egg stirreth, so should the town of Naples quake; and 
when the egg brake. then should the town sink.  When he had made an end, he 
let call it Naples."
     After accomplishing so much for his Babylonian beauty, Virgil did not 
marry her, but endowing her with the town of Naples and its lands, gave her 
in marriage to a certain grandee of Spain.  Having thus disposed of her and 
her children, the enchanter returned to Rome, collected all his treasures, 
and removed them to the city he had founded, where he resided for some 
years, and established a school which speedily became of illustrious renown.  
Here he lost his wife, by whom he had had no issue; built baths and bridges, 
and wrought the most extraordinary miracles, So passed an uncounted number 
of years, and Virgil at length abandoned Naples for ever, and retired to 
Rome.
     Outside the walls of the Imperial City he built a goodly town, that had 
but one gate, and was so fenced round with water as to bar any one from 
approaching it. And the entry of its one gate was made" with twenty-four 
iron flails, and on each side was there twelve men smiting with the flails, 
never ceasing, the one after the other ; and no man might come in without 
the flails stood still, but he was slain.  And these flails ',ere made with 
such a gin (contrivance) that Virgilius stopped them when he list to enter 
in thereat, but no man else could find the way. And in this castle put 
Virgilius part of his treasure privily; and, when this was done, he imagined 
in his mind by what means he might make himself young again, because he 
thought to live longer many years, to do many wonders and marvellous things.  
And upon a time went Virgilius to the Emperor, and asked him of licence (of 
absence) by the space of three weeks.  But the Emperor in no wise would 
grant it unto him for he would have Virgilius at all times by him."
     Spiritualism.-We have perhaps our first indication of the rise and 
spread of spiritualism in Italy in the modern acceptance of the term in an 
article published in the Civitta Catholica the well-known Roman organ, 
entitled "Modern Necromancy."  The conclusions of the article were:-
     “1st.  Some of the phenomena may be attributed to imposture, 
hallucinations, and exaggerations in the reports of those who describe it, 
but there is a foundation of reality in the general sum of the reports which 
cannot have originated in pure invention or he wholly discredited without 
ignoring the value of universal testimony.
     “2nd. The bulk of the theories offered in explanation of the proven 
facts, only cover a certain percentage of those facts, but utterly fail to 
account for the balance.
     “3rd.  Allowing for all that can be filtered away on mere human 
hypotheses, there are still a large class of phenomena appealing to every 
sense which cannot be accounted for by any known natural laws, and which 
seem to manifest the action of intelligent beings."
     D. D. Home last visited the principal cities of Italy in 1852, and had 
been so active in his propaganda that numerous circles were formed after his 
departure. Violent journalistic controversies arose out of the foundation of 
these societies. with the result that public interest was so aroused that it 
could only be satisfied with the publication of a paper issued from Geneva, 
and edited by Dr Pietro Suth and Signor B. E. Manieri entitled Il amore del 
Vera. In the journal accounts of the spiritual movements in the various 
countries of Europe, and America, were published although the Church and 
press levelled the anathemas against the journal.  In the spring of 1863 a 
society was proved at Palermo entitled Il Societa Spiritual di Palermo, 
which had for president Signor J. V. Paleolozo, and for members men of the 
stamp of Paolo Morelle, professor of Latin and Philosophy.
     It was about the autumn of 1864 that lectures were first given on 
Spiritualistic subjects in Italy.  They were started in Leghorn and Messina, 
and though of a very mixed character, and often partaking largely of the 
lecturer's peculiar idiosyncrasies on religious subjects, they served to 
draw attention to the upheaval of thought going on in all directions, in 
connection with the revelations from the Spirit world.  It could not be 
expected that a movement so startling and unprecedented as that which opened 
up a direct communication between the natural and the Spirit worlds could 
gain ground in public acceptance without waking up all the latent elements 
of enthusiasm, fanaticism, and bigotry, which prevailed in the Italian as in 
every other community.
     In the year 1870, there had been over a hundred different societies 
formed, with varying success, in different parts of Italy.  Two of the most 
prominent flourishing at that date were conducted in Naples, and according 
to the French journal, the Revue Spirite represented the two opposing 
schools which have prevailed in Continental Spiritualism, namely, the 
"Reincarnationists" whom we have elsewhere classified as " Spiritists " and 
the " Immortalists," or those known in America and England merely as 
"Spiritualists."
(See France.)
     About 1868, an immense impulse was communicated to the cause of 
Spiritualism-at least in the higher strata of Italian Society-by the visit 
of Mr. and Mrs. Guppy to Naples, at which place they took up their residence 
for two or three years.  Mrs. Guppy- nee Miss Nichol - of London,
was renowned throughout Europe for her marvellous powers as a " Physical 
force Medium" and as Mr. Guppy's wealth and social standing enabled him to 
place his gifted wife's services at the command of the distinguished 
visitors who crowded his salons, it soon became a matter of notoriety that 
the highest magnates of the land, including King Victor Emmanuel and many of 
his nearest friends and counsellors, had yielded conviction to the truth of 
the astounding phenomena exhibited through Mrs. Guppy's Mediumship.
     It was about the year 1863, that Spiritualism began to enjoy the 
advantage of fair and honourable representation in the columns of a new 
paper entitled, the Annali dello Spiritisno, or " Annals of Spiritualism."  
This excellent journal was commenced at Turin, and published by Signor 
Niceforo Filalete, with all the liberality, energy, and talent worthy alike 
of the subject and its editor.
     From the columns of the Annali we learn that a Venetian Society of 
Spiritualists, named 
"Atea" elected General Giuseppe Garibaldi their honorary president, and 
received the following reply by telegraph from the distinguished hero, the 
liberator of Italy: " I gratefully accept the presidency of the Society 
Atea.  Caprera, 23rd September."
     The same issue of the Annali contains a verbatim report of a" grand 
discourse, given at Florence, by a distinguished literary gentleman, Signor 
Sebastiano Fenzi, in which the listeners were considerably astonished by a 
rehearsal of the many illustrious names of those who openly avowed their 
faith in Spiritualism.
     The years 1863-4 appear to have been rich in Spiritualis-tic efforts.  
Besides a large number of minor associations, the existence of which was 
recorded from time to time the early numbers of the Annali and Revue 
Spirite, a society which continued for a long time to exert a marked 
influence in promoting the study of occult forces and phenomena, was formed 
about this time in Florence, under the title of The Magnetic Society of 
Florence. The mem-bers of this association were withbut exception persons 
remarkable for literary and scientific attainments, or those of high 
influential position in society.
     About this time Mr. Seymour Kirkup, a name familiar to the early 
initiators of Spiritualism, resided in Florence, and communicated many 
records of spiritual phenomena. to the London Spiritual Magazine.  Nearly 
ten years after the establishment of the Magnetic Society of Florence, Baron 
Guitern de Bozzi, an eminent occultist, founded the Pneumatological 
Psychological Academy of Florence, but upon his demise it was discontinued.
     Modern Sorcery.-In his Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches of Italy, 
the late Charles Godfrey Leland gives a valuable account of the life and 
practice of the modern Italian strega or witch.  He says: " In most cases 
she comes of a family in which her calling or art has been practised for 
many generations.  I have no doubt that there are instances in which the 
ancestry remounts to medieval, Roman, or it may be Etruscan times. The 
result has naturally been the accumulation in such families of much 
tradition.  But in Northern Italy, as its literature indicates, though there 
has been some slight gathering of fairy tales and popular superstitions by 
scholars, there has never existed the least interest as regarded the strange 
lore of the witches, nor any suspicion that it embraced an incredible 
quantity of old Roman minor myths and legends, such as Ovid has recorded, 
but of which much escaped him and all other Latin writers      Even yet 
there are old people in the Romagna of the North who know the Etruscan names 
of the Twelve Gods, and invocations to Bacchus, Jupiter, and Venus, Mercury, 
and the Lares or ancestral spirits, and in the cities are women who prepare 
strange amulets, over which they mutter spells, all known in the old Roman 
time and who can astonish even the learned by their legends of Latin gods, 
mingled with lore which may be found in Cato or Theocritus.  With one of 
these I became intimately acquainted in 1886, and have ever since employed 
her specially to collect among her sisters of the hidden Spell in many 
places all the traditions of the olden times known to them.  It is true that 
I have drawn from other sources but this woman by long practice has 
perfectly learned what few understand, or just what I want, and how to 
extract it from those of her kind.
     “Among other strange relics, she succeeded, after many years, in 
obtaining the following ' Gospel,' which I have in her handwriting A full 
account of its nature with many details will be found in an Appendix.  I do 
not know definitely whether my informant derived a part of these traditions 
from written sources or oral narration, but believe it was chiefly the 
latter......
     “For brief explanation I may say that witchcraft is known to its 
votaries as la vecchia religione, or the old religion, of which Diana is the 
Goddess, her daughter Aradia (or Herodias) the female Messiah, and that this 
little work sets forth how the latter was born, came down to earth, 
established witches and witchcraft, and then returned to heaven.  With it 
are given the ceremonies and invocations or incantations to be addressed to 
Diana and Aradia, the exorcism of Cain, and the spells of the holy-stone, 
rue, and verbena, constituting. as the text declares, the regular church-
service, so to speak, which is to be chanted or pronounced at the witch-
meetings.  There are also included the very curious incantations or 
benedictions of the honey, meal, and salt, or cakes of the witch-supper, 
which is curiously classical, and evidently a relic of the Roman mysteries."
     Briefly the ritual of the Italian witches is as follows At the Sabbath 
they take meal and salt, honey and water, and say a conjuration over these, 
one to the meal, one to the salt, one to Cain, one to Diana, the moon-
goddess. They then sit down naked to supper, men and women, and after the 
feast is over they dance, sing and make love in the darkness, quite in the 
manner of the medieval Sabbath of the sorcerers.  Many charms are given 
connected with stones, especially if these have holes in them and are found 
by accident.  A lemon stuck full of pins we are told is a good omen.  Love-
spells fill a large space in the little work, which for the rest recounts 
several myths of Diana and Endymion in corrupted form.  (See also Leland's 
Etruscan-Roman Remains.)


lubdan: In Ultonian romance, the King of the Wee Folk. One day he boasted 6f 
the might of his strong man Glower, who could hew down a thistle at one 
blow. His bard Risirt retorted that beyond the sea, there existed a race of 
giants, any one of whom could annihilate a whole battalion of the Wee Folk. 
Challenged to prove his words. Risirt brought Creda, King Fergus' dwarf and 
bard. He then dared Iubdan to go to Fergus' palace and taste the king's 
porridge.  Iubdan and Bebo, his queen, arrived at the palace at midnight, 
but in trying to get at the porridge so as to taste and be away before 
daybreak, Iubdan fell in, He was found in the pot next morning by the 
scullions, and he and Bebo were taken before Fergus, who after a while 
released them in exchange for a pair of water shoes, wearing which a man 
could go over or under water as freely as on land.


Ivunches:	Chilian familiars. (See American Indians.)


Iynx: A Chaldean symbol of universal being, the name of which signifies 
"power of transmission." It was repro-duced as a living sphere or winged 
globe. The first example was perhaps put forth by mind on the plane of 
reality, to be followed by three others called paternal and ineffable, and 
latterly by hosts of Iynxs of a subordinate character, described as "free 
intelligences." The lynx is described by Eliphas Levi as "corresponding to 
the Hebrew Yod or to that unique letter from which all other letters were 
formed."



J


Jacinth, or Hyacinth: A stone which preserves from plague and from 
lightning, strengthens the heart, and brings wealth, honour, prudence, and 
wisdom. It is recommended by Albertus Magnus as a soporific, on account of 
its coldness, and is ordered by Psellus in cases of coughs, ruptures, and 
melancholy, to be drunk in vinegar.  Marbodaeus describes the wonderful 
properties of three species of the jacinth Pliny and Leonardus are also 
particular in their account of it.


Jacob's Ladder: According to the kabalistic view, Jacob's Ladder. which was 
disclosed to him in a vision, is a meta-phorical representation of the 
powers of alchemy, operating through visible nature.  The "Ladder" was a " 
Rain-bow," or prismatic staircase, set up between heaven and earth.  Jacob's 
Dream implied a history of the whole hermetic creation. There are only two 
original colours, red an(l blue, representing " spirit " and " matter," for 
orange is red mixing with the yellow light of the sun, yellow is the 
radiance of the sun itself, green is blue and yellow, indigo is blue 
tinctured with red, and violet is produced by the mingling of red and blue.  
The sun is alchemic gold, and the moon is alchemic silver.  In the operation 
of these two potent spirits, or mystic rulers of the world, it is supposed 
astrologically that all mundane things were produced.


Jadian, or Were-tiger: (See Malays.)


Jakin and Boas : The names of the two symbolical pillars of Solomon's 
Kabalistic temple, and which were believed to explain all mysteries. The one 
was black and the other white, and they represented the powers of good and 
evil. It is said that they symbolise the need of "two" in the world: Human 
equilibrium requires two feet; the worlds gravitate by means of two forces; 
generation needs two sexes.


James IV. of Scotland : It was almost inevitable that the romantic nature of 
James IV. of Scotland should have encouraged the study of alchemy and the 
occult sciences in the manner he did. Dunbar in his Remonstrance, speaks of 
the patronage which he bestowed upon alchemists and charlatans, and in the 
Treasurer's accounts there are numerous payments for the " Quinta Essentia," 
including wages to the persons employed, utensils of various kinds and so 
forth. In a letter to one Master James Inglis, James says:-
     “James, etc…..to dear Master James Inglis greeting. We graciously 
accept your kindness, by which in a letter brought to us you signify that 
you have beside you certain books learned in the philosophy of the true 
Alchemy, and that although most worthy men have sought them from you. you 
have nevertheless with difficulty kept them for our use, because you had 
heard of our enthusiasm for the art. We give you thanks; . . . and we have 
sent our familiar, Master James Merchenistoun, to you, that he may see to 
the transfer hither of those books which you wish us to have; whom receive 
in good faith in our name. Farewell, From our Palace at Edinburgh."

Japan : All that the word "magic" defines is to be found amongst the 
Japanese, in their religious beliefs and rites in their conception of Nature 
and in the national customs. To them all forms and objects animate or 
inanimate possess, equally with man, a soul with good or evil tendencies, 
and these entities, either of their own volition or by evocation, come into 
close touch with man either to his advantage or detriment. Their folklore 
and traditions are wrought of the marvellous and the Japanese thought of to-
day is still permeated with a belief in the supernatural.
     The predominant feature of the Japanese religion, Shintoism, is the 
worship of ancestors. allied to that of Nature. There are twelve recognised 
sects of Shintoism-all with ancestor-worship as their cardinal principle. 
The belief of the Japanese is that the disembodied spirits acquire the 
powers of deities and possess supernatural attributes. They become potential 
for good or evil and they exercise their potentialities in the same mundane 
sphere upon which their interests and affections centred during life. They 
thus become guardian divinities, and as such the object of ceremonies in 
their honour is to show gratitude for their services whilst upon earth and 
to solicit a continuance of these services beyond the grave. On this point 
Lafcadio Hearn wrote :-". An intimate sense of relation between the visible 
and invisible worlds. is the special religious characteristic of Japan among 
all civilised countries. To Japanese thought the dead are not less real than 
the living. They take part in the daily life of the people, sharing the 
humblest sorrows and the humblest joys. They attend the family repasts, 
watch over the well-being of the household, assist and rejoice in the pros-
perity of their descendants.  They are present at the public pageants, at 
all the sacred festivals of Shinto, at the military games, and at all the 
entertainments especially provided for them. And they are universally 
thought of as finding pleasure in the offerings made to them or the honours 
conferred upon them." Every morning, before the family shrine, to be found 
in all Japanese homes, flowers are set and food-emblems placed as offerings 
of pious affection, while ancient prayers are repeated, for on the shrine, 
beside the symbols of the Sun-goddess and the tutelary god of the family are 
put the memorial tablets containing names, ages and dates of death of 
members of the household. There are stories of the souls of ancestors taking 
material form and remaining visible through cen-turies. In the month of July 
three days are set apart for the celebration of the Festival of the Dead. At 
this time it is thought that the disembodied souls return from the dismal 
region of the Shades to gaze for a while upon the beauty of their country 
and to visit their people. On the first morning new mats are placed upon all 
altars and on every household shrine, while in all the homes tiny meals are 
prepared in readiness for the ghostly guests. The streets at night are 
brilliant with many torches; in front of every house gaily-coloured lanterns 
are lit in welcome.
     Those who have recently lost some relative go to the cemeteries to pray 
and burn incense and leave offerings of water and flowers set in bamboo 
vases.  On the third day the souls of those who are undergoing penance are 
fed, also those who have no friends 'among the living to care for them. The 
evening of this day is the time of the ghosts' departure, and for this 
thousands of little boats are fashioned and laden with food-offerings and 
tender messages of fare-well. When the night falls, tiny lanterns are lit 
and hung at the miniature prows and the ghosts are supposed to step aboard. 
Then the craft are set free upon river, lake and sea, the water gleaming 
with glow of thousands of lights. On this day no sailor dreams of putting 
out to sea-for this one night it belongs to the dead. It is believed that if 
a ship fails to come to port before the sailing of the ghost-fleet the dead 
arise from the deep and the sailors can hear their mournful whispering, 
while the white breakers are their hands clutching the shores, vainly trying 
to return.
     In the Shinto pantheon there are deities representing well nigh 
everything in heaven and earth; from the moun-tain of Fiyiama to the 
household kitchen, from Wisdom to Scarecrows, from Caligraphy to Poverty, 
Laughter to Small pox. When babes are a week old they are taken to the 
temple and placed under the protection of some god chosen by the parents, 
but in later years he may choose his patron god for himself beside the 
tutelary one.
     In remote parts of Japan may still be found traces of an older form of 
Shinto in which phallic symbols had their place as representing life-giving 
power and therefore used as a magical exorcism of evil influences, 
especially that of disease. In this connection appears a dwarf-god who is 
said to have first taught mankind the art of magic and medicine  In Shinto 
there are no idols, their place being taken by shintia, god-bodies, concrete 
objects in which the divine spirit is supposed to dwell, such as the mirror, 
jewel and sword of the Sun-goddess, worshipped at the famous Ise shrine. 
Pilgrims from all parts of Japan make their way to this shrine, acquiring 
merit and purification thereby. These pilgrims receive from the priests 
objects of talismanic properties called harai, these also serving as 
evidence of having been at the holy place. In former days they were 
recognised as passports. The term harai signifies to " drive out," to " 
sweep away," and has reference to the purification of the individual from 
his sins. These objects are in the form of small envelopes or paper boxes 
each containing shavings of the wands used by the Ise priests at the half-
yearly festivals held to purify the nation in general from the consequences 
of the sins of the preceding six months. The list includes witchcraft, also 
wounding and homicide, these latter being regarded more as unclean-ness than 
as a moral stigma. On the pilgrims return home the harai are placed upon the 
"god's-shelf."
     On fete-days are still practised the ancient ordeals. These are three 
in number, the Kugadachi, in which priests, wrought to ecstatic frenzy by 
participation in a rhythmic dance, pour upon their bodies boiling water 
without receiving harm from the process; the Hiwatari consisting of walking 
barefoot over a bed of live coals, priests and people alike participating, 
and Tsurugi-watari, the climbing of a ladder of sword-blades. These are 
regarded as tests of purity of character, this being thought to confer an 
immunity from hurt in these ordeals. The attendant rites consist of exorcism 
of evil spirits by the waving of wands and magical finger-knots, and 
invocation of the gods who are then believed to be actually present.
     Possession by Divinities -In connection with some of the Shinto sects 
occult rites are practised to bring about posses-sion of a selected person 
by the actual spirits of the gods. Priests and laymen alike develop and 
practice this art, undergoing a period of purification by means of various 
austerities.  Prophecy, divination and the cure of disease are the objects 
of these rites.  The ceremony may take place in a temple or ordinary house 
where the " gods' shelf" makes the shrine. In the rites gohei, the Shinto 
symbols of consecration are used, the pendant form for purification and 
exorcism of evil influences, and an upright gohei affixed to a wand 
signifying the shintai, or god-body, is the central object. The medium, 
called maeza takes his Seat in the midst. Next him in importance is the 
functionary, the maeza who presides over the ceremony. It is he who builds 
the magical pyre in a brass bowl and burns in the flames strips of paper 
inscribed with characters, effigies of disease and trouble. There is a 
clapping of hands to call the attention of the gods and chants are intoned, 
accompanied by the shaking of metal-ringed crosiers and the tinkle of 
pilgrim bells. After the fire is burnt out, the bowl is removed and sheets 
of paper placed in symbolic form, upon which is then put the upright gohei 
wand. There is further chanting, the medium closes his eyes and clasps his 
hands into which the maeza now thrusts the wand. All then await the advent 
of the god which is indicated by the violent shaking of the wand and 
convulsive throes on the part of the medium, who is now considered to have 
become the god. The maeza reverently prostrates himself before the entranced 
nahaza, and asks the name of the god who has deigned to come. This done and 
answered, he next offers his petitions, to which the god replies. The 
ceremony is concluded by a prayer and the medium is awakened by beating upon 
his back and the massaging of his limbs out of their cataleptic contraction. 
These possession-rites are 'also conducted by the pilgrims who ascend the 
mountain of Ontake.
      Buddhism, which shares with Shinto the devotions of Japan, enjoins 
meditation as a means of attaining to supernatural knowledge and occult 
power. It is said that to those who in truth and constancy put in force the 
doctrines of Buddha the following ten powers will be granted.  (I). They 
know the thoughts of others.  (2). Their sight, piercing as that of the 
celestials, beholds without mist all that happens in the earth. (3). They 
know the past and present.  (4). They perceive the uninterrupted succession 
of the ages of the world.  (5). Their hearing is so fine that they perceive 
and can interpret all the har-monies of the three worlds and the ten 
divisions of the universe.  (6). They are not subject to bodily conditions 
and can assume any appearance at will.  (7). They dis-tinguish the shadowing 
of lucky or unlucky words, whether they are near or far 'away.  (8). They 
possess the knowledge of all forms, and knowing that form is void, they can 
assume every sort of form; and knowing that vacancy is form, they can 
annihilate and render nought all forms. (9). They possess a knowledge of all 
laws.  (10). They possess the perfect science of contemplation. It is said 
that methods are thus known by which it is possible to so radically change 
the psychological condition of the individ-ual that he is enabled to 
recognise the character of the opposition between subjective and objective. 
These two extremes are reconciled in a higher condition of conscious-ness, a 
higher form of life, a more profound and complete activity which concerns 
the inmost depths of the self. To the " Zen" monasteries, belonging to a 
Buddhist sect of that name, anyone who is so inclined may retire for tem-
porary meditation and for the development of these special faculties, which 
are mainly produced by entering upon a calm mental state, not exactly 
passive, but in which the attention is not devoted to any one thing, but is 
evenly distributed in all directions, producing a sort of void and 
"waiting." The spirit thus obtains entire repose and a satisfaction of the 
thirst for the ideal. This mystical retirement is sought by statesmen and 
generals, by scientific professional and business-men, and it is said that 
the force which accumulates within them by practising the "Zen" methods is 
of effective service to them in practical life.
     Many of the customs of the Japanese have a magical significance. At the 
Festival of the New Year extending over three days it is considered of the 
first importance to insure good luck and happiness for the coming year by 
means of many traditional observances. Houses are thoroughly cleansed 
materially and spiritually, this last is getting rid of the evil spirits by 
throwing out beans and peas from the open slides of the houses. The gateways 
are decorated with straw ropes made to represent the lucky, Chinese numbers 
of three, five and seven. Mirror cakes, associated with the sun-goddess are 
eaten, 'also lobsters, longevity being symbolised by their bent and ancient, 
appearance, the pine-tree branches used for decoration at this time 'also 
signifying long life.
     Divination is performed by various methods: by divining rods, by the 
reading of lines and cracks in the shoulder-blade of a deer, and by the 
classical form taken from the Confucian " 
Yih-king " or Book of Changes, this involving the use of eight diagrams and 
sixty-four diagrams.  One method of" raising spirits" used by the Japanese, 
especially by girls who have lost their lovers by death, is to put into a 
paper lantern a hundred rushlights and repeat an incanta-tion of a hundred 
lines.  One of these rushlights is taken out 'at the end of each line and 
the would-be ghost-seer then goes out in the dark with one light still 
burning and blows it out when the ghost ought to appear.
     Charms are everywhere, fashioned of all substances 'and in all forms, 
such as strips of paper bearing magical inscriptions to avert evil, 
fragments of temples, carven rice-grains representing the gods of Luck, 
sutras to frighten the demons, copies of Buddha's footprint, and paper 
tickets bearing the name of a god are often 'affixed outside the doors of 
houses to combat the god of Poverty.
     Nature and her manifestations are the result of indwelling soul-life 
and the Japanese mind, imbued with this belief has peopled nature with 
multiform shapes. There are dragons with lairs in ocean and river which yet 
can fly abroad in the air while from their panting breath come the clouds of 
rain and tempests of lightning. In the mountains and forests are bird-like 
gnomes who often beset way-faring men and women and steal away their wits. 
There are 'also mountain men, huge hairy monkeys, who help the wood-cutters 
in return for food, and mountain-women, ogres with bodies grown over with 
long white hair, who flit like evil moths in search of human flesh. Then 
legend tells of the Senrim, hermits of the mountains, who knew all the 
secrets of magic, wizards who were attended by wise toads and flying 
tortoises, who could conjure magical animals out of gourds, who could 
project their souls into space. To animals were also ascribed supernatural 
powers. The fox is believed to possess such gifts to an almost limitless 
extent, for he has miraculous vision and hearing, he can read the inmost 
thoughts of man, he can transform himself and assume any shape 'at will. He 
loves to delude mankind and work destruction thereby to this end often 
taking the form of 'a beautiful and seductive woman whose embrace means 
madness and death. To the 'agency of this animal is attributed demoniacal 
possession, thu, occurring mostly among ignorant and superstitious women of 
the lower classes. The cat is not regarded with 'any kindly feeling by the 
Japanese, this being ascribed to the fact that this animal, together with 
the serpent, were the only creatures who did not weep at Buddha's death. 
This animal has also the power of bewitchment and possesses vampire 
proclivities. Among sailors, however, the cat is held in estimation, for it 
is thought to possess the power of warding off the evil spirits which haunt 
the sea. The images of  animals are thought to be also endowed with life. 
There are tales of bronze horses and deer, of huge carven dragons and stone 
tortoises wandering abroad at night, terrorising the people and only laid to 
rest by summary decapitation. Butterflies are thought to be the wandering 
souls of the living who may be dreaming or sunk in reverie; white 
butterflies are the souls of the dead.  Fireflies keep afar evil spirits, 
and an ointment compounded of their delicate bodies defies any poison.
     Trees occupy a foremost place in the tradition and legends of Japan.  
The people regard them with great affection, and there are stories of men 
who, seeing a tree they loved withering and dying, committed hara-kiri. 
before it praying the gods that their life so given might pass into the tree 
and give it renewed vigour. The willow is one of the most eerie of trees, 
the willow-spirit often becoming a beautiful maiden and wedding a human 
lover The pine tree brings good fortune, especially in the matte of happy 
marriages.  It is also a token of longevity.  Tree spirits can sometimes be 
inimical to man and it is recorded of one that to stay its disturbing 
wanderings it was necessary to cut it down, when from the stump flowed a 
stream of blood.
     The element of Fire figures largely in the Japanese world of marvels.  
It is worshipped in connection with the rites of the Sun-goddess and even 
the kitchen-furnace becomes the object of a sort of cult.  There is the lamp 
of Buddha while messages from Hades come to this world in the shape of fire-
wheels, Phantom-fires flicker about and flames burn in the cemeteries; there

When at the point of death he fell into terrible swoons, during which his 
soul made toilsom journeys.  In the first he was tormented for having kept 
innocent prisoners in his dungeons, in the second, he was tortured still 
more for having ground the people under heavy tasks; during the third voyage 
he died, but his body disappeared mysteriously before he could be buried, 
and i was thought that the devil had taken him.

Jean de Meung : Jean de Meung owes his celebrity to his poetical genius 
rather than his alchemical powers; to his Roman de 'a Rose, rather than to 
his rhyming treatise upon the hermetic philosophy.  He was born about 1280, 
and flourished through the reigns of Louis X., Philip the Long, Charles IV., 
and Philip de Valois.  He appears to have possessed a light and railing wit, 
and a keen appreciation of a jest; and it may well be doubted whether he was 
altogether sincere in his praises of alchemy.  Having composed a quatrain on 
woman, which stigmatized her in the strongest terms, the ladies of Charles 
VI.'s court resolved to revenge their affronted honour, and surrounding him 
in the royal antechamber, desired the courtiers present to strip him 
preparatory to their inflicting a sound flag-ellation.  Jean solicited to be 
heard before he was con-demned and punished; and having obtained an interval 
of grace, set forth, with fluent eloquence, that he was certainly the author 
of the calumnious verses, but that they were not intended to vilipend all 
womankind.  He referred only to the vicious and debased, and not to such 
models of purity as he saw around him. Nevertheless, if any lady present 
felt that the verses really applied to her, he was her very humble servant, 
and would submit to a well-deserved chastisement.  Like most of the medieval 
poets, Jean de Meung was a bitter enemy of the priesthood, and he con-trived 
with great ingenuity a posthumous satire upon their inordinate greed.  He 
bequeathed in his will, as a gift to the Cordeliers, a chest of immense 
weight.  As his fame as an alchemist was wide-spread, the brotherhood 
accepted the legacy in the belief that the chest contained the golden 
results of his quest of the Philosopher's Stone.  But when they opened it. 
their dismayed eyes rested only on a pile of slates, covered with the most 
unintelligible hierogly-phics and cabalistic characters. The perpetrator of 
this  practical joke was hardly, we think, a very sincere believer in the 
wonders of alchemy.  (See Devon, Witchcraft In.)
 

Jeanne, D'Arc : Jeanne d'Arc was born in the village of Domremy, near 
Vaucouleurs, on the border of Champagne and Lorraine, on Jan. 6th, 1412. She 
was taught to spin and sew, but not to read or write, these accomplishments 
being unusual and unnecessary to people in her station of life.  Her parents 
were devout, and she was brought up piously.  Her nature was gentle, modest, 
and religious but with no physical weakness or morbidity; on the con-trary. 
she was exceptionally strong, as her later history shows.
     At or about the age of thirteen, Jeanne began to experience what 
psychology now calls "auditory hallucinations."  In other words, she heard 
"voices "-usually accompanied by a bright light-when no visible person was 
present. This, of course, is a common symptom of impending mental disorder;  
but no insanity developed in Jeanne d'Arc. Startled she naturally was at 
first, but continuation led to familiarity and trust. The voices gave good 
counsel of a very commonplace kind. as, for instance, that she "must be a 
good girl and go often to church."  Soon, however, she began to have 
visions; saw St. Michael, St. Catharine, and St. Margaret; was given 
instructions as to her mission; eventually made her way to the Dauphin. put 
herself at the head of 6,000 men, and advanced to the relief of Orleans, 
which was surrounded by the victorious English.  After a fortnight of hard 
fighting, the siege was raised, and the enemy driven off.  The tide of war 
had turned, and in three months the Dauphin was crowned king at Rheims as 
Charles the Seventh.
     At this point, Jeanne felt that her mission was accom-plished.  But her 
wish to return to her family was over-ruled by king and archbishop, 'and she 
took part in the further fighting against the allied English and Burgundian 
forces, showing great bravery 'and tactical skill. But in November, 1430, in 
a desperate sally from Compiegne - which was besieged by the Duke of 
Burgundy- she fell into the enemy's hands, was sold to the English, and 
thrown into 'a dungeon 'at their headquarters in Rouen.
     After a year's imprisonment she was brought to trial before the Bishop 
of Beauvais, in 'an ecclesiastical court. The charges were heresy 'and 
sorcery.  Learned doctors of the Church, subtle lawyers, did their best to 
entangle the simple girl in their dialectical toils  but she showed 'a 
remarkable power of keeping to her 'affirmations 'and of avoiding heretical 
statements.  " God has 'always been my Lord in all that I have done," she 
said.  But the trial was only pretence, for her fate was 'already decided.  
She was condemned to the stake.  To the end, she solemnly 'affirmed the 
reality of her "voices," and the truth of her depositions.  Her last word, 
'as the smoke 'and flame rolled round her, was "Jesus."  Said an English 
soldier, 'awestruck by the manner of her passing: " We 'are lost; we have 
burned 'a Saint."  The idea was corroborated in popular opinion by events 
which followed, for speedy death-as if by Heaven's 'anger-overtook her 
judges 'and 'accusers.  Inspired by her example and claims, 'and helped by 
dissension and weakening on the side of the enemy, the French took heart 
once more; 'and the English were 'all-but swept out of the country.
     Jeanne's family was rewarded by ennoblement, under the name of D Lys.  
Twenty-five years 'after her death, the Pope acceded to a petition that the 
process by which she was condemned should be re-examined.  The result was 
that the judgment was reversed, and her innocence estab-lished and 
proclaimed.
     The life of the Maid supplies 'a problem which orthodox science cannot 
solve.  She was 'a simple peasant girl, with no 'ambitious hankering after a 
career.  She rebelled pathetically 'against her mission.  " I had far rather 
rest 'and spin by my mother's side, for this is no work of my choosing, but 
I must go 'and do it, for my Lord wills it.,, She cannot be dismissed on the 
"simple idiot" theory of Voltaire, for her genius in war 'and her aptitude-
in repartee undoubtedly prove exceptional mental powers, unschooled though 
she was in what we call education. We cannot call her a mere hysteric, for 
her health and strength were superb. It is on record that 'a man of science 
said to 'an Abbe "Come to the Salpetriere Hospital, 'and I will show you 
twenty Jeannes d'Arc." To which the Abbe -responded: "Has one of them given 
us back Alsace 'and Lorraine ?" The retort was certainly neat. Still, though 
the Sal-petriere hysterics have not won back Alsace 'and Lorraine, it is 
nevertheless true that many great movements have sprung from fraud or 
hallucination.  May it not have been so with Jeanne?  She delivered France, 
'and her importance in history is great; but may not her mission 'and her 
doings have been the outcome of merely subjective hallucinations, induced by 
the brooding of her specially religious 'and patriotic mind on the woes of 
her country ?  The army, being ignorant 'and superstitious, would readily 
believe in the Supernatural nature of her mission, 'and great energy and 
valour would result-for a man fights well when he feels that Providence is 
on his side.
     This is the most usual kind of theory in explanation of the facts.  But 
it is not fully satisfactory.  How came it-one may ask-that this untutored 
peasant girl could persuade not only the rude soldiery, but 'also the 
Dauphin 'and the Court, of her Divine 'appointment?  How came -she to be 
given the command of 'an 'army?  Surely a post of such responsibility 'and 
power would not be given to 'an Ignorant girl of eighteen, on the mere 
strength of her own
claim to inspiration. It seems, 'at least, very improbable.
     Now it so happens (though the materialistic school of historians 
conveniently ignore or belittle it) that there is strong evidence in support 
of the idea that Jeanne gave the Dauphin some proof of the possession of 
supernormal faculties.  In fact, the evidence is so strong that Mr. Andrew 
Lang called it "unimpeachable "-and Mr. Lang did not usually err on the side 
of credulity in these matters. Among other curious things, Jeanne seems to 
have repeated to Charles the words of 'a prayer which he had made men-tally; 
and she also made some kind of clairvoyant dis-covery of 'a sword hidden 
behind the altar of Fierbois church.  Schiller's  magnificent dramatic poem-
" Die Jungfrau von Orleans "-though unhistorical in some details, is 
substantially 'accurate on these points concerning clairvoyance and mind-
reading.
     The best books on the Maid 'are those of Mr. Anatole France (two 
vols.), 'and Mr. Andrew Lang, giving respectively the sceptical and the 
believing side as to the explanation of her experiences.  There is also a 
very useful little book by Miss C. M. Antony, with preface by Father R. H. 
Benson.


Jelaleddin, Ruml : A Sufi poet of the thirteenth century, A.D.  He teaches 
the Suit doctrine that the chief end of man is so to emancipate himself from 
human thoughts and wishes, human needs and the outward impressions of the 
senses, that he may become a mere mirror for the Deity. So refined an 
essence does his mind become that it is 'as nearly as possible nothing ; yet 
while in this state it can, by a union with the Divine Essence, mysteriously 
become the All.  In his teachings he declares that names and words must-not 
be taken for the things they represent:-“Names thou mayst know; go, seek the 
truth they name Search not the brook, but heaven, for the moon."

whether a young damsel be a maiden or no; the same being boiled in wine 
helpeth the toothache, and tempered with wax cureth the swelling glandules 
named the king's evil.  They say that the magicians use this jeat stone much 
in their sorceries, which they practice by the means of red hot axes, which 
they call axinomancia, for they 'affirm that being cast thereupon it will 
burne and consume, if that ewe desire and wish shall happen accordingly." 
Jet is known in Prussia as black amber.

Jinn : Singular Jinnee, plural Jineeyeh, Arabian spirits, per-haps 
animistic, but more probably strictly mythological like the Persian divs 
(q.v.). The jinn were created out of fire, and occupied the earth for 
several thousand years before Adam; they were perverse, and would not 
reform, 'although prophets were sent to reclaim them; they were eventually 
driven from the earth, 'and took refuge in the outlying islands of the sea.  
One of the number named Azazeel (afterwards called Iblees) had been carried 
off 'as a prisoner by the 'angels; he grew up 'amongst them, 'and became 
their chief, but having refused, when commanded, to prostrate himself before 
Adam, he was degraded to the condition of a sheytan, and becomes the father 
of the sheytans, or devils.  The jinn are not immortal, but destined 
ultimately to die: they eat and drink and propa-gate their species ; they 
live in communities, and are ruled over by princes: they can make themselves 
visible or invisible, and assume the forms of various animals, such as 
serpents, cats and dogs.  There are good jinn and bad jinns.  They frequent 
baths, wells, latrines, ovens, ruined houses, rivers, cross roads 'and 
market places.  Finally, like the demons of the Rabbins, they ascend to 
heaven and learn the future by eavesdropping.  But with all their power and 
knowledge, they are liable to be reduced to obedience by means of talismans 
or magic arts, and become obsequious servants until the spell is broken.
     It is far from clear or certain, that the jinn of the east were 
borrowed from the mythology or philosophy of the west, and the practice of 
translating the Arabic word jinn by the Latin term 
"genius" arose more from an apparent resemblance in the names, than from 
'any iden-tity in the nature and functions of those imaginary beings. This 
similarity of name, however, must have been purely accidental, for the Arabs 
knew little or nothing of the Latin language, and not a single term derived 
immediately from it; demon, therefore, and not genius was the word which 
they would have used if they had borrowed this part of their creed from the 
west.  Jinn appears, moreover, to be a genuine Arabic word, derived from 'a 
root signifying “to veil " or  conceal " ; it, therefore, means properly, 
that which is veiled 'and cannot be seen."  " In one sense,' says Fruzabadi, 
author of the Camus, "the word Jinn signifies 'any 'spiritual being 
concealed from 'all our senses, 'and, for that reason, the converse of a 
material being. Taken in this extensive sense, the word Jinn comprehends 
devils as well 'as 'angels, but there are some properties common to both 
angels and Jinn; some peculiar to each. Every angel is a Jinn, but every 
Jinn is not an angel.  In another sense, this term is applied peculiarly to 
a particular kind of spiritual beings ; for such beings are of three kinds; 
the good, which are angels; the bad, devils; and the intermediate, 
comprehending both good 'and bad, who form the class of Jinn." Thus the 
Arabs acknowledge good 'and bad genii, in that respect agreeing with the 
Greeks, but differing from the Persians. The genii, so long familiarized to 
European readers by the Arabian Nights,  were not  the same beings,  
mentioned by the Arabian lexicographer, but the Divs and Divatis of Indian 
romance, dressed up in a foreign 'attire, to please the taste of readers in 
Persia and Arabia.
     The principal differences, therefore, between the genii of the west and 
the jinn of the east, seem to have been these; the genii were deities of an 
inferior rank, the constant companions and guardians of men, capable of 
giving useful or prophetic impulses, acting as a species of mediators 'and 
messengers between the gods and men.   Some were supposed to be friendly, 
others hostile, 'and many believed one of each kind to be 'attached, from 
his birth, to every mortal.  The former was called Agathod'a1mon, the latter 
Cacodaemon; 'and one of the latter who appeared to Cassius is represented 
'as a man of vast stature and of a black hue, whence, no doubt, that colour 
has been given, in latter times, to the devil.  The good genius prompted men 
to good, the evil to bad 'actions. That of each individ-ual was as a shadow 
of himself.  Often he was represented 'as a serpent; his age 'also varied; 
he was generally crowned with a chaplet of plane leaves.  In coins of Trajan 
and Hadrian the genius places a patera with his right hand on 'an 'altar, 
'and holds 'a sort of scourge in his left.  His sacrifices were wholly 
bloodless, consisting of wine and flowers, 'and the person who performed the 
oblation was the first to taste the cup.  They were adored with 
prostrations, particularly on the birthday, which was placed under their 
especial care.
     The Roman men swore by their Genius, the women by their Juno. The 
genius of the reigning Prince was an oath of extraordinary solemnity.  There 
were local as well 'as individual genii, concerning whom many particulars 
may be found in " Vossius," de Idol.
     The Jinn, on the contrary, who seem to be the linear descendants of the 
Devate's and Rakshasas of the Hindu mythology, were never worshipped by the 
Arabs, nor con-sidered as anything more than the 'agents of the Deity. Since 
the establishment of Mohammedanism, indeed, they have been described 'as 
invisible spirits, 'and their feats and deformities which figure in romance 
'are as little believed by Asiatics, as the tales of " Arthur's Round Table" 
are by ourselves. Their existence as superhuman beings is maintained by the 
Mussulman doctors, but that has little connection with their character 'and 
functions as delineated by poets.


Jinnistan : An imaginary country which, according to a popular belief among 
the Persians, was the residence of the jinn who had submitted to Solomon.


Johannites : A mystic sect who follow the tenets of the late Father John of 
Cronstadt, where they publish an organ, and pursue their propaganda by means 
of itinerant pam-phlet-sellers. They are said to 'abduct Jewish children, 
and because of this rumour they have on more than one occasion come under 
police supervision. They have several times unsuccessfully fixed the date of 
the Last Judgment. They declared in Father John's life-time that all the 
powers of heaven had descended into Cronstadt, 'and were personified in the 
entourage of Father John. They exhorted all believers to make confession to 
Father John, who alone could rescue sinners from the depths of hell. The 
orthodox clergy would not know the Lord, but Father John would gather 
together in. Cronstadt 244,000 of the blessed, and then " leave the earth." 
Another affirmation of theirs is that all children who 'are new-born 'are " 
little devils," who must be "stamped out" immediately 'after birth. The 
Johannites urged the people to sell 'all their possessions and send the 
proceeds to Father John, or entrust them to the keeping of the pamphlet-
sellers. Evidence is forth-coming tending to show that Father John was 
unaware of the abuse of his name, and on one occasion, in reply to a 
telegram from Bishop Nikander, of Perm, he strongly repudiated any 
connection with certain Johannite propa-gandists in the Perm Government.

John XXII., Pope :  Jacques Duese, subsequently Pope John XXII. was born at 
Cahors in France towards the close of the 12th century. The exact date of 
his 'advent is indeterminate, but it is reported that his parents were in 
affluent circumstances, and it has even been suggested that they belonged to 
the noblesse. Jacques was educated first at a Dominican priory in his native 
village, and after-wards at Montpellier; while subsequently he proceeded to 
Paris, where he studied both law 'and medicine. Leaving the Sorbonne, he was 
still 'at 'a loss to know what pro-fession to follow; but, chancing to 
become intimate with one Bishop Louis, a son of Charles II., King of Naples, 
the young man decided to enter the church, being doubtless prompted to this 
step by the conviction that his new friend's influence would help him 
forward in the clerical career.  Nor was the future pontiff disappointed 
herein, for in the year 1300, at the instance of the Neapolitan sovereign, 
he was elevated to the episcopal see of Frejus, while in 1308 he was 
'appointed Chancellor of Naples.  He soon showed himself 'a man of no mean 
'ability in ecclesiasti-cal affairs, and in 1310 Pope Clement V. saw fit to 
summon him to Avignon, being anxious to consult him anent certain points; 
while in 1312 Jacques was made Bishop of Porto, and four years later he was 
elected to the pontifical crown 'and sceptre.
     Thenceforth he lived always at Avignon, but his life was by no means 'a 
quiet or untroubled one.  Early in his reign the throne of Germany became 
vacant, Louis of Bavaria 'and Frederick of Austria both contended for it, 
and Jacques gave great offence by supporting the claims of the latter; while 
at a later date he raised a storm by preaching a some-what heterodox sermon, 
its purport being that the souls of those who have died in 'a state of grace 
go straight into Abraham's bosom, 'and do not enjoy the beatific vision of 
the Lord till after the Resurrection and the last judgment. This doctrine 
was hotly opposed by many clerics, notably Thomas of England, who had the 
courage to preach against it openly at Avignon; and so great was the 
disfavour which John incurred, in fact, that for several years after his 
death in 1334 he was widely regarded as Anti-Christ.
     Jacques has frequently been credited with avarice, and it is true that 
he made stupendous efforts to raise money, imposing numerous taxes unheard 
of before his regime. Indeed, he manifested considerable ingenuity in this 
relation, and so the tradition that he dabbled in hermetic philosophy is 
probably founded on hard fact.  It must be conceded, on the one hand, that 
in the course of his reign he issued a stringent bull against alchemists; 
but then, this was directed rather against the charlatans of the craft than 
against those who were seeking the philosopher's stone with real 
earnestness, and with the aid of scientific know-ledge.  It is more than 
likely, moreover, that Jacques sent forth this mandate largely with a view 
to blinding those who had charged him with essaying the practice at issue 
himself; 'and, be that as it may, it is certain that he believed in magic 
and was interested in science.  His credulity as regards the former is 
demonstrated by his bringing a charge of sorcery against Geraud, Bishop of 
Cahors; while his scientific predilections are evinced by the fact that he 
kept up a laboratory in the palace at Avignon, and was wont to spend much 
time therein. Doubtless some of this time was given to physiological and 
pathological studies, for various works of a medical nature are ascribed to 
Jacques, in particular a collection of prescriptions, a treatise on diseases 
of the eye, and another on the formation of the foetus. But it may well be 
supposed that the avaricious prelate's activities in his laboratory were 
'also bestowed in some measure on alchemistic researches, 'and the theory is 
buttressed by his having been a friend of Arnold de Villanova; while more 
important still, among the writings attributed to Jacques is L' Art 
Transmutatoire, published at Lyons in 1557. Besides, the pontiff left behind 
him on his death a vast sum of money 'and a mass of priceless jewels, and it 
was commonly asserted, among the 'alchemists of the day, that these and also 
two hundred huge ingots had all been manufactured by the deceased. The story 
of the unbounded wealth he had 'amassed in this way gradually blossomed and 
bore fruit, and one of Jacques' medieval biographers credits him with having 
concocted a quantity of gold equivalent to 660,000 pound sterling.

K


Ka : The Egyptian conception of one of the seven parts of man; 'a spiritual 
double or astral body.  Not only did mankind possess a Ka, but 'animals and 
inanimate objects as well.  Every mortal received a Ka at birth.  When he 
died his Ka left him, but was supposed to hover near the body and 
occasionally to reanimate it.  For this purpose statues were placed near the 
mummy in which the Ka might find a temporary shelter.  The Ka was provided 
with food by the friends of the deceased who left provisions in the tomb for 
its use.  (See Egypt and Vampire.)


Kabala, The : A Hebrew 'and Jewish system of theosophy. The word signifies 
"doctrines received from tradition." In ancient Hebrew literature tile name 
was used to denote the entire body of religions writings, the Pentateuch 
excepted. It is only in the early middle ages that the system of theosophy 
known as Kabalism was designated by that name.  We will first consider the 
Kabala as a literary production before proceeding to examine it in the light 
of a hand-book of Hebrew occultism.  The main sources which went to the 
making of' the Kabala 'are the Sepher Yesirah or Book of Creation, which is 
a combination of medieval mysticism 'and science. The date of origin of this 
work has been matter of great 'argument, but. it is perhaps safest to say 
that it seems to be earlier than the ninth century A.D.  The Bahir or 
brilliant is first quoted by Nabmanides, 'and is usually 'attributed to his 
teacher, Ezra. It owes much to the Sepher Yesirah, 'and to a great extent 
foreshadows the Zohar, which is 'a commentary on the Pentateuch, including 
eleven dissertations on that book,-the most important of which 'are the Book 
of Secrets, the Secret of Secrets, the Mysteries of the Pentateuch and the 
Hidden Interpretation.  It pretends to the 'authorship of Simon ben Yohai in 
the second century, and it is alleged that he drew his sources from 
traditional dialogues between God and Adam in Paradise.  It is further 
stated that it was discovered in a cavern in Galilee where it had been 
hidden for one thousand years. It has been proved almost beyond doubt, 
however, that it was written in the thirteenth century, and the capture of 
Jerusalem by the Crusaders is 'alluded to. It is 'also believed that Moses 
de Leon, who died in 35, 'and who circulated and sold the Zohar, was himself 
its author. At the same time there is no doubt that it enshrines a large 
number of very 'ancient and im-portant Hebrew traditions. The matter 
contained in the Kabala deals with the nature of God, the sephiroth or 
divine emanations, of 'angels 'and of man. God, known in the Kabala as En 
Soph, fills and contains the universe. As he is boundless, mind cannot 
conceive him, so in a certain mystical sense he is non-existent.  The 
doctrine of the sephiroth is undoubtedly the most important to be met with 
in the pages of the Kabala. To justify his existence the Deity had to become 
active 'and creative, 'and this he achieved through the medium of the ten 
sephiroth or intelligences which emanated from him like rays pro-ceeding 
from a luminary.  The first sephiroth or emanation was the wish to become 
manifest, and this contained nine other intelligences or sephiroth, which 
'again emanate one from the other-the second from the first, the third from 
the second, 'and so forth. These are known as the Crown, Wisdom, 
Intelligence, Love, Justice, Beauty, Firmness, Splendour. Foundation 'and 
Kingdom.  From the junction of pairs of sephiroth, other emanations were 
formed  thus from Wisdom 'and Intelligence proceeded Love or Mercy and from 
Mercy 'and Justice, Beauty. The sephiroth are 'also symbolical of primordial 
man and the heavenly man, of which earthly man is the shadow.  They form 
three triads which respectively represent intellectual, moral, and physical 
qualities: the first, Wisdom, Intelligence and Crown; the second Love, 
Justice 'and Beauty; the third Firmness, Splendour and Foundation.  The 
whole is
circled or bound by Kingdom, the ninth sephiroth.  Each of these triads 
symbolises a portion of the human frame: the first the head; the second the 
arms; the third the legs. It must be understood that though those sephiroth 
are emanations from God they remain a portion, and simply represent 
different aspects of the One Being.
     Kabalistic cosmology posits four different worlds, each of which forms 
a sephiric system of a decade of emanations, which were verified in the 
following manner: the world of emanations or the heavenly man, a direct 
emanation from the En Soph. From it is produced the world of creation, or 
the Briatic world of pure nature, but yet not so spiritual as the first. The 
angel Metatron inhabits it and constitutes the world of pure spirit.  He 
governs the visible world and guides the revolutions of The planets.  From 
this is formed the world of formation or the Yetziratic world, still less 
refined, which is the abode of angels.  Finally from these emanates the 
world of action or matter, the dwelling of evil spirits, which contains ten 
hells, each becoming lower until the depths of diabolical degradation is 
reached. The prince of this region is Samael, the evil spirit, the serpent 
of Genesis, otherwise " the Beast."  But the universe was incomplete without 
the creation of man; the heavenly Adam, that is the tenth sephiroth created 
the earthly Adam, each member of whose body corresponds to a part of the 
visible universe.  The human form, we are told, is shaped after the four 
letters which constitute the Jewish tetragrammation, Jhava, thus, the 
letters J h a v a . The souls of the whole human race pre-exist in the world 
of emanations, and are all destined to inhabit human bodies. Like the 
sephiroth from which it emanates, every soul has ten potentces, consisting 
of a trinity of triad - spirit, soul, cruder soul or neptesh.  Each soul, 
before its entrance into the world consists of male and female united into 
one being, but when it descends to this earth, the two parts are separated 
and animate different bodies. The destiny of the soul upon earth is to 
develop the perfect germs implanted in it, which must ultimately return to 
En Soph. If it does not succeed in acquiring the experience for which it has 
been sent to earth, it must re-inhabit the body three time till it becomes 
duly purified.  when all the souls in the world of the sephiroth shall have 
passed through this period of probation and returned to the bosom of En 
Soph, the jubilee will commence; even Satan will be restored to his angelic 
nature, and existence will be a Sabbath without end. The Kabala states that 
these esoteric doctrines are contained in the Hebrew scriptures, but cannot 
be perceived by the uninitiated; they are, however, plainly revealed to 
persons of spiritual mind.
     Next considering the Kabala as occult literature, we find it stated 
that the philosophical doctrines developed in its pages are found to have 
been perpetuated by the secret method of oral tradition from the first ages 
of humanity. "The Kabala," says Dr. Ginsburg, when explaining the story of 
its birth, "was first taught by God Himself to a select company of angels, 
who formed a theosophic school in Paradise.  After the Fall the angels most 
graciously communicated this heavenly doctrine to the disobedient child of 
earth, to furnish the protoplasts with the means of returning to their 
pristine nobility and felicity.  From Adam it passed over to Noah, and then 
to Abraham, the friend of God, who emigrated with it to Egypt, where the 
patriarch allowed a portion of this mysterious doctrine to ooze out.  It was 
in this way that the Egyptians obtained some knowledge of it, and the other 
Eastern nations could introduce it into their philosophical systems.  Moses, 
who was learned in all the wisdom of Egypt, was first initiated into the 
Kabala in the land of his birth, but became most proficient in it during his 
wanderings in the wilderness, when he not only devoted to it the leisure 
hours of the whole forty years, but received lessons in it from one of the 
angels.  By the aid of this mysterious science the law-giver was enabled to 
solve the difficulties which arose during his management of the Israelites, 
in spite of the pilgrimages, wars, and frequent miseries of the nation.  He 
covertly laid down the principles of this secret doctrine in the first four 
books of the Pentateuch, but withheld them from Deuteronomy.  Moses also 
initiated the seventy Elders into the secrets of this doctrine, and they 
again transmitted them from hand to hand.  Of all who formed the unbroken 
line of tradition, David and Solomon were the most deeply initiated into the 
Kabala.  No one, how-ever, dared to write it down till Schimeon ben Jochai, 
who lived at the time of the destruction of the second.  After his death, 
his son, Rabbi Eleazar, and his secretary, Rabbi Abba, as well as his 
disciples, collated Rabbi Simon Ben Jochai's treatises, and out of these 
composed the celebrated work called Z H R, Zohar, Splendour, which is the 
grand storehouse of Kabalism."
     The history of Kabalistic origins, however, is as has been shown almost 
wholly fabulous, and no evidence worthy of the name can he adduced in its 
support. The mysticism of the Mishna and the Talmud must be carefully 
distinguished from that of the Kabalistic writings, as they are un-doubtedly 
of very considerable antiquity.  But the Kabala has certain claims upon the 
modern  student of mysticism. Its philosophical value is not depreciated by 
its modern origin, and it is regarded by many as an absolute guide to 
knowledge in all the most profound problems of existence. Its thesis is 
extensive and profound, but examination unfortunately proves it to be merely 
a series of dogmatic hypotheses, a body of positive doctrine based on a 
central assumption which is incapable of proof. This tradition, says Eliphas 
Levi, wholly reposes on the single dogma of magic, that the Visible is for 
us a proportional measure of the Invisible.  In fact it proceeds by analogy 
from the known to the unknown.  At the same time, it is a most interesting 
effort of the human mind.
     Medieval magic was deeply indebted to Kabalistic combinations of the 
divine names for the terms of its rituals, and from it derived the belief in 
a resident virtue in sacred names and numbers.  Certain definite rules are 
employed to discover the sublime source of power resident in the Jewish 
scriptures.  Thus the words of several verses in the scriptures which are 
regarded as containing an occult sense, are placed over each other, and the 
letters are formed into new words by reading them vertically; or the words 
of the text are arranged in squares in such a manner as to be read 
vertically or otherwise. Words are joined together and re-divided, and the 
initial and final letters of certain words are formed into separate words.  
Again, every letter of the word is reduced to its numerical value, and the 
word is explained by another of the same quantity.  Every letter of a word 
too is taken to be an initial of an abbreviation of it. The twenty-two 
letters of the alphabet are divided into two halves, one half is placed 
above the other, and the two letters which thus become associated are 
interchanged.  This a becomes 1, b, m, and so on.  This cipher alphabet is 
called albm from the first interchanged pairs. The commutation of the 
twenty-two letters is effected by the last letter of the alphabet taking the 
place of the first, the last but one the place of the second and so forth.  
This cipher is called atbah.  These permutations and combinations are much 
older than the Kabala, and obtained amongst Jewish occultists from time 
immemorial.
     Lastly, it should be pointed out that the Kabala has been condemned 
nowhere more strongly than among the Jews themselves.  Jewish orthodoxy has 
always been suspicious of it, and as Mr. A. E. Waite has well said: “The 
best lesson we can learn from it is the necessity of scrupulously separating 
the experimental knowledge of the mystics from their bizarre fields of 
speculation."


Kabotermannekens : According to the Flemish peasants, little spirits which 
play tricks on the women of the country, particularly on those who work in 
the dairy.


Kaf : According to the Musulmans, a great mountain that stretches to the 
horizon on every side.  The earth is in the middle of this mountain, they 
say, like a finger in the middle of a ring.  Its foundation is the stone 
Sakhrat, the least fragment of which is capable of working untold marvels. 
This stone it is which causes earthquakes.  It is made of a single emerald.  
The mountain, which is frequently spoken of in Eastern tales, is said to be 
the habitation of genii. To reach it one must pass through dark 
wildernesses, and it is essential that the traveller be guided by a 
supernatural being.


Kai : The seneschal of King Arthur, known in the French romances as Messire 
Queux, or Maitre Queux or Kuex.  He is prominent in the Morte d'Arthur.  In 
the tale of Kilhwuh and Olwen in the Mabinogion, he is identified with a 
per-sonage whose "breath lasted nine nights and days under water" and who 
"could exist nine nights and nine days without sleep."  A wound from his 
sword could not be cured  he could make himself as tall as the highest tree, 
and so great was the heat of his nature that, during rain, whatever he 
carried remained dry.  Originally a deity, a rain-and-thunder god, he had 
apparently degenerated, through a series of mythological processes, into a 
mere hero.


Kale Thaungto : A town of wizards in Lower Burma.  (See Burma.)


Kalid : (See Morien.)


Kapila  believed by the Hindus to be the god Vishnu, son of Brahman, in the 
fifth of his twenty-four incarnations.  He wrote a series of philosophical 
propositions known as the Sutras, in which he states it is by philosophical 
study alone that one may attain union with the deity.


Kardec, Allen : The nom de guerre of Denizard Rivail, the French 
spiritualist whose doctrines were largely accepted on the Continent and 
especially in France.  The chief tenet in spiritism was the doctrine of re-
incarnation.  Rivail, before his conversion to spiritualism, had occupied 
himself a great deal with animal magnetism.  In 1856 he was intro-duced into 
a spiritualistic circle by Victorien Sardon.  His Livre des Esprits and the 
works with which he followed it were based largely on communications 
received through mediums.  They had a wide circulation, and the doctrines of 
spiritism became much more popular, in France at least, than those of the 
rival spiritualism, which did not include reincarnation among its tenets.  
The names A lien and Kardec which M. Rivail assumed were names he had borne 
in two former incarnations, revealed to him by mediumistic communications.  
He was the editor of La Revue Spirits, and the founder and president of the 
Parisian Society for Spiritualistic Studies, at which M. Camille Flammarion, 
then nineteen years of age, made his first acquaintance with psychic science 
in 1861.  Allan Kardec died in 1869, his doctrines having by that time 
become firmly established.  In Britain, however, they made but little 
headway, his only disciple of note in this country being Miss Anna 
Blackwell.  (See France and Spiritualism.)


Karma : is a doctrine common to Brahmanism, Buddhism and Theosophy though 
theosophists have not adopted it wholly as it is taught in the two religions 
mentioned.  The word karma itself means "action," but it may be useful to 
remember that generally the doctrine teaches that every-thing done is done 
for eternity, that, in short, " thou shalt reap as thou didst sow."  Action 
is not homogeneous but on the contrary, contains three elements, the thought 
which conceives it, the will which finds the means of accomplishment, and 
the union of thought and will which brings the action to pass.  It is plain, 
therefore, that thought is very potent for good or evil, for as the thought 
is, so will the action be. The miser, thinking of avarice, is avaricious, 
the libertine, thinking of vice, is vicious, and on the con-trary, those of 
virtuous thoughts show virtue in their actions.  Arising naturally from such 
teaching is the attention devoted to thought-power.  Taking the analogy of 
the physical body which may be developed by regimen and training, based on 
natural scientific laws, theosophists teach that character may, in exactly 
the same way, be scientifically built up.  Physical weakness can be eradi-
cated and an opposite state of affairs brought about by special exercise of 
the weak part, and by a similar method, weakness of character may be 
converted into strength Every vice is considered to evidence the lack of a 
corres-ponding virtue, avarice for instance showing the absence of 
generosity.  Instead, however, of allowing matters to rest at this, under 
the plea-arising from ignorance-that the man was naturally avaricious, 
theosophists, on the lines of scientific knowledge, teach that constant 
thought directed to generosity will in time change the man's nature in this 
respect. This result cannot, of course, be brought about in a day, and the 
length of time necessary depends on at least two factors, the strength of 
thought and the strength of the vice, for the latter may be the sum of the 
indulgence of many ages and hence correspondingly difficult to eradicate The 
doctrine of karma must, however, be considered not in its relation to one 
life only, but in the light of the theo-sophic teaching of reincarnation 
(q.v.). Re-incarnation is carried on under the law of karma as well as of 
evolution. The new-born man bears within him the seeds of what he for-merly 
was.  His character is the same as it was. It is as he made it in past 
existences and accordingly as he made it, so does it continue unless he 
himself change it as he had the power to do. Each succeeding existence finds 
that character more definite in one direction or another and if it be evil, 
the effort to change it becomes increasingly difficult, indeed a complete 
change may not be possible until many exist-ences of effort have passed.  In 
such cases as these, the promptings of evil may be too strong to be 
resisted, yet the man who has an intelligent knowledge of the workings of 
Karma, though he must eventually yield, does so only after the most 
desperate struggle of which his nature is capable, and thus, instead of 
yielding weakly and increas-ing the power of the evil, he has helped to 
destroy its potency.  Only in the most rare cases can he free himself with 
one effort.  (See also Theosophy and Evolution.)


Katean Secret Society : A secret society of foe Moluccas. Anyone who wished 
to become a member was introduced into the Katean house through an aperture 
in the form of a crocodile's jaws or a cassowary's beak.  Having remained 
there for a few days lie was secretly removed to a remote spot.  At the end 
of two months he was permitted to return to his relatives-hitherto unaware 
of his where-abouts-a member of the 
Katean Society.


Kathari : An heretical sect who excited the wrath of the clergy in mediaeval 
times.  (See Waldenses.)


Katie King: A spirit.  (See Materialism and Spiritualism.)


Katika Lima : Malay system of Astrology. (See Malays.)


Katika Tujo : Malay system of Astrology. (See Malays.)


Kauks, hatched from cock's egg: (See Cock.)


Keingala : The weather-wise mare of Asmund in the saga of Grettir the 
Strong.  Her master believed in her weather prophecies, and in setting his 
second son, Grettir, to look after the horses, told him to be guided by 
Keingola, who would always return to the stable before a storm.  As she 
persisted in remaining on the cold hillside, grazing on the scanty grass 
till the lad was nearly frozen with cold, Grettir determined to make her 
return home regardless of the weather.  One morning before turning out the 
horses he tore off a long strip of her skin from wither to flank,  This bad 
the effect of making the mare soon seek her stable; and the same thing 
occurring the next day, no storm impending, Asmund himself let out the 
horses, when he discovered what had been done,


Kelly, Edward : (See Dee.)


Kelpie, The : A water spirit which, in Scotland, is believed to haunt 
streams and torrents.  Kelpies appear to be of a mischievous nature, and 
were often accused of stopping the water-wheels of mills, and of swelling 
streams.  The Kelpie is occasionally used as a name of terror to frighten 
unruly children; and it was believed that he also devoured women.


Kephalonomancy : A method of divination which "a practised by making divers 
signs on the baked head of an ass.  It was familiar to the Germans and the 
Lombard, substituted for it the head of a goat.  The ancients placed lighted 
carbon on an ass's head, and pronounced the names of those who were 
suspected of any crime.  If a crackling coincided with the utterance of a 
name, the latter was taken as being that of the guilty person.


Kephu : a Karen Vampire. (See Vampire.)


Kepler, John-T571-1630:  A great  mathematician and astrologer.  He was born 
at Weil in Wurtemburg and educated at a monastic school at Maulbrunn and 
after-wards at the university of Tubingen, where he studied philosophy, 
mathematics, theology and astronomy.  In 1593 he became professor of 
mathematics and morals at Gratz in Styria, where he also continued his 
astrological studies.  He had an unhappy home life, and was some-what 
persecuted for his doctrines.  In 1626 were printed the famous Rodolphine 
tables, which he had prepared along with Tycho de Brahe, the astronomer.  He 
died at Ratisbon.  The laws of the courses of the planets, deduced by Kepler 
from observations made by Tycho, and known as The Three Laws of  Kepler, 
became the foundation of Newton's discoveries, as well as the whole modern 
theory of the planets.  His services in the cause of astronomy have placed 
him high amongst the distinguished men of science, and in 1808 a monument 
was erected to his memory at Ratisbon.  His most important work is his 
Astronomia nova, seu Physica Coelestis tradita Commentariis de Motibus 
Stellae Martis (1609) which is still regarded as a classic by astronomers.


Kerheb : Egyptian Scribes.  (See Egypt.)


Kerner, Dr. : (See Spiritualism.)


Kether  The Kabbalistic name for the number one, and meaning  “Reason "-the 
Crown, the equilibrating power. Also a Hebrew occult name for one of the 
three essentials of God-Reason.


Kevan of the Curling Locks : The lover of Cleena who went off to hunt in the 
woods, leaving her to be abducted by the fairies.


Key of Solomon the King : A magical treatise of medieval origin, of which a 
number of manuscripts are extant.  It is supposed to be the work of King 
Solomon (q.v.), but is manifestly of comparatively modern origin, and was 
probably written in the fourteenth or fifteenth century. It is permeated 
with late Jewish ideas, and its chief inten-tion appears to be the finding 
of treasure, and the making of such experiments as have for their object the 
interference with the free will of others.  The power of the Divine Name is 
much in evidence, and the entire work is an absurd combination of pomposity 
and nonsense.
     The Lemegeton, or Leeser Key of Solomon, is much more noteworthy.  Its 
earliest examples date from the seven-teenth century, and it invokes the 
hierarchies of the abyss by legions and millions.  It is divided into four 
parts, which control the offices of all spirits at the will of the
operator.  The first part, Goetia, contains forms of con-juration for 
seventy-two demons with an account of their powers and offices.  The second 
part, Theurgia Goetia, deals with the spirits of the cardinal points, who 
are of mixed nature.  The third hook is called the Pauline Art-the 
significance of which name is unaccountable.  It deals with the angels of 
the hours of the day and night, and of the signs of the Zodiac.  The fourth 
part is entitled Almadel, which enumerates four other choirs of spirits.  
The usual homilies regarding purity of life are insisted upon, as is the 
circumstance that none of the conjurations shall be applied to the injury of 
another.


Khalb : The Egyptian name for the shadow, which at death was supposed to 
quit the body to continue a separate exist-ence of its own.  It was 
represented under the form of a sunshade.


Khu : The Egyptian name for one of the immortal parts of man, probably the 
spirit.  The word means " clear" or "luminous" and is symbolised by a flame 
of fire.


Khwaja Ka Mulay : (See Siberia.)


Klan : In Irish legend, Father of Lugh.  His magical cow with her wonderful 
supply of milk having been stolen by Balor, he revenged himself by making 
Balor's daughter, Ethlinn, the mother of three sons.  Of these two were 
drowned by Balor, and the third Lugh, escaping by falling into a bay, was 
wafted back to his father,  Kian.  Some years later, while fighting in 
Ulster, Kian fell in with the three sons of Turenn whose house was at enmity 
with him. To escape their notice, he turned himself into a pig, but they 
recognised him and he was wounded by one of them. He begged to be restored 
to his human shape before dying. This being granted, he rejoiced in having 
outwitted his enemies, as they would now have to pay the blood-fine for a 
man instead of a pig. The brothers, determined that there should be no 
blood-stained weapon to publish the deed, stoned Kian and buried his body.


King Robert of Sicily : (English romance of the fourteenth century, author 
unknown).  It has never been printed. It tells how King Robert of Sicily was 
beguiled by pride into sneering at a priest who read mass. To punish him, an 
angel was sent down by God, and he, assuming Robert's shape, transformed the 
King into the likeness of his own fool  he is sent out to lie with the dogs.  
He was at length allowed to resume his proper shape after a long and igno-
minious penance.  See poem on the subject by Longfellow.


Kinocetus : A stone said to be good in casting out devils.


Kirk, Robert : (See Scotland.)


Kischuph : In the Kabala, the higher magical influence.  It is divided into 
two branches, an elementary and a spiritual, and includes exorcism.  
Sometimes Kischuph exhibits a striking resemblance to the witchcraft of 
medieval times. Sorcerers were said to change themselves into animals, and 
go long distances in a very short time'.  They may also induce pain and 
disease and death in men and animals. Still further allied to witches are 
the "women who make a contract with the Schedim, and meet them at certain 
times, dance with them, and visit these spirits who appear to them in the 
shape of goats.  In many countries such women are killed."  This form of 
Kischuph is true sorcery the other form, material Kischuph, is rather evil 
sympathy, consisting of disturbing influences on the natural elements 
produced by exciting false " rapports" in various sub-stances.


Kiss, Bewitched by means of a: Florence Newton, a notorious witch of the 
Middle Ages, was on several occasions accused of having bewitched people by 
means of a kiss.  The first was a servant-maid who had refused alms to her.  
About a week later the witch kissed her violently, from which time she 
suffered from fits and was transported from place to place, now being 
carried mysteriously to the top of the house, now being placed between two 
feather beds, and so on. The witch also caused the death of one David Jones, 
who stood sentinel over her in prison, by kissing his hand, and by the same 
means brought about the death of the children of three Youghal aldermen.


Klinnrath, Henry  A German alchemist and hierophant of the physical side of 
the Magnum Opus. He was certainly aware of the greater issues of Hermetic 
theorems and may be regarded as a follower of Paracelsus. He was born in 
Saxony about the year 1560. At the age of 28 he graduated in medicine at the 
University of Basle. He practised in Hamburg and thereafter in Dresden where 
he died in poverty and obscurity in 1601, at the age of forty-five. The most 
remarkable of his works, some of which are still in Manuscript, is the 
Anphitheatrum Sapientiae AEternae solius verae Chnstiano Kabbalisticum 
divino magicum, &c. It is an unfinished work and appeared after his decease 
with a preface and conclusion by Erasmus Wohlfahrt. It is a purely mystical 
and magical treatise. The seven steps leading to the goal of universal 
knowledge are described in a commentary on the Wisdom of Solomon. The work 
has been described as being the voice of ancient chaos, and its curious 
folding plates are particularly suggestive.


Klinschor, or Klingsor : Lord of the Magic Castle wherein are kept Arthur's 
mother and other queens. He is nephew to Virgilius of Naples and is overcome 
by Gawain. He is alluded to in the Parsival of Wolfram von Eschenbach.


Knigge : (See Illuminati.)


Knox, John  (See Scotland.)


Koilon is the name applied to the ether by Mrs. Besant and Mr. C. W. 
Leadbeater in their book on Occult Chemistry. (See Ether; Theosophy.)


Kommasso : Evil spirits inhabiting trees.  (See Burma.)


Koons' Spirit Room : A log seance-room erected in Dover, Athens County, 
Ohio, by a farmer, Jonathan Koons, in 1852. Koons, an early convert to 
spiritualism, had been told that he and his eight children would develop 
medium-istic powers, and the spirit-room was intended to be used for 
manifestations produced by their mediumship. The room was furnished with the 
appliances incidental to the spiritualistic séance - table for rappings, 
tambourines, and other musical instruments; phosphorus, by means of which 
the spirits might show themselves. The phenomena witnessed by the sitters, 
including Charles Partridge, editor of the Spiritual Telegraph, were of a 
varied nature, but in the main identical with the other manifestations of 
the same period. The spirits who visited Koon's log building claimed to be a 
band-one hundred and sixty-five in number-of men who had lived before the 
time of Adam, and from whom were descended the well-known spirit 
personalities, John and Katie King.


Kosh : The wicked forest fiend of the Bangala of the Southern Congo.

Koshel : (See Slavs.)

Kostchtchie, or " Deathless" : A  Russian goblin of the bogle-boe species. 
This horrid monster is described as having a death's head and fleshless 
skeleton, "through which is seen the black blood flowing and the yellow 
heart beating." He is armed with an iron club, with which he knocks down all 
who come in his path. In spite of his ugliness, he is said to be a great 
admirer of young girls and women. He is avaricious, hates old and young 
alike, and particularly those who are fortunate. His dwelling is said to be 
amongst the mountains of the Koskels and the Caucasus. where his treasure is 
concealed.


Kostka, Jean : The pseudonym of Jules Doinel. A late Gnostic and initiate of 
the 33rd degree, who, converted to the Christian standpoint, revealed his 
diabolic adventures in the pages of La Verite under the title of " Lucifer 
Un-masked." He tells of diabolic happenings in the private chapel of a lady, 
"Madame X." who figures frequently in his pages, and who is thought to be 
the late Countess of Caithness, of visions of Jansen, and the classical 
deities. It is certain from the evidence that M. Kostka never came into 
personal contact with a Satanic or Luciferian cultus, and that his diabolic 
experiences were merely those of the amateur Satanist.


Kramat  (See Magic.)


Krata Repoa, or Initiation into the ancient Mysteries of the Priests of 
Egypt, written by C. F. Koppen and J. W. B. Von Hymmen, and. published at 
Berlin in 1782. The term Krata Repoa, said to be of Egyptian origin, 
possesses no affinity to that language so far as the present writer is 
aware. The work is divided into seven grades. That of Postophoris (a word 
used by Apuleius to signify a priest of Isis) corresponds to the apprentice 
or keeper of the sacred threshold. Secondly comes the degree of Neokaros, in 
which are to be found many ordeals and temptations. The third degree is the 
State of Death-of degree of judg-ment and of the passage of the Soul. The 
candidate was restored to light in the following degree, the Battle of. the 
Shadows. In the fifth grade a drama of Vengeance was enacted, and the sixth 
is that of the astronomer before the gate of the gods. In the final grade 
the whole scheme of initiation was expounded. It has been thought that these 
degrees corresponded to the actual procedure of a secret society, and it may 
be that in some measure they did, as one of their authors was a prominent 
member of The African Builders (q.v.), but although there would seem to be 
elements of real tradition in the work, most of it is probably mere 
invention.


Krstaca : Dalmatian name for a witch.  (See Slavs.)


Kund : (See Scandinavia.)


Kyphl : Among the Egyptians, an aromatic substance, with soothing and 
healing properties, prepared from sixteen materials according to the 
prescription of the sacred books.



L


Labadie, Jean : A fanatic of the seventeenth century, born in 1610 at Bourg, 
on the Dordogne. He declared himself a second John the Baptist, sent to 
announce the second coming of the Messiah. He even went so far as to claim 
some measure of divinity for himself. But to his ambition as a votary he 
joined a taste for more worldly pleasures, which he indulged under the mask 
of religion. He died in 1674. Among his works (which were condemned) was Le 
Veritable Exorcisme, au l'unique moyen de chasser le diable du, monde 
chretien..


Labartu : (See Babylonia, also Semites.)


Laburum is a kabbalistic sign, embodied in the Great Magical Monogram which 
is the seventh and most important pantacle of the Enchiridion.

Lacteus  A stone applied to rheumatic eyes.


Lady-bird : A rustic mode of divination was that practised with the lady-
bird or lady-fly. The lady-bird was captured by a maid and bidden to fly 
"north, south, or east, or west" in the direction in which her lover lived. 
Which-ever way the insect flew, there dwelt her future husband.


Lady of Lawers : One of the Breadalbane family. of Scottish origin, and 
married to Campbell of Lawers. This gentle-woman was believed to be gifted 
with prophetic powers, and her prophecies are said to be written in a book 
shaped like a barrel and kept in the charter room of Taymouth Castle: it is 
named " The Red Book of Balloch." These forecasts all have reference to the 
house and lands of Bread-albane; we give the following as an example :-" 
When the red cairn on Ben Lawers fell the church would split. In the same 
year that the cairn, built by the sappers and miners on Ben Lawers, fell, 
the Disruption in the Church of Scotland took place."


Lam : A magical word in Hindu yoga practice.


Lamb : Dr. Lamb was a noted sorcerer in the time of Charles the First. The 
famous Richard Baxter, in his Certainty of the World of Spirits, printed in 
1691, has recorded an appropriate instance of the miraculous performance of 
this man. Meeting two of his acquaintance in the street, and they having 
intimated a desire to witness some examples of his skill, he invited them 
home with him. He then con-ducted them into an inner room, where presently, 
to their no small surprise, they saw a tree spring up in the middle of the 
apartment. They had scarcely ceased wondering at this phenomenon, when in a 
moment there appeared three diminutive men, with little axes in their hands 
for the purpose of cutting down this tree.  The tree was felled; and the 
doctor dismissed his guests, fully satisfied of the solidity of his 
pretensions.  That very night, however, a tremendous hurricane arose, 
causing the house of one of the guests to rock from side to side, with every 
appearance that the building would come down, and bury him and his wife in 
the ruins. The wife in great terror asked " Were you not at Dr. Lamb's to-
day?" The husband confessed it was true. "And did you not bring something 
away from his house ?" The husband owned that, when the little men felled 
the tree, he had picked up some of the chips, and put them in his pocket. 
Nothing now remained to be done but to produce the chips, and get rid of 
them as fast as they could. This ceremony performed, the whirl-wind 
immediately ceased, and the remainder of the night passed quietly.
     Dr. Lamb at length became so odious by his reputation for these 
infernal practices, that the populace rose upon him in 1640, and tore him to 
pieces in the streets. Nor did the effects of his ill-fame -terminate here. 
Thirteen years after, a woman, who had been his servant maid, was 
apprehended on a charge of witchcraft, was tried, and in expiation of her 
crime was executed at Tyburn.


Lamps, Magic : There dwelt at Paris in the time of St. Louis, a famous 
Jewish Rabbi called Jachiel, a great manufacturer of prodigies, who was 
regarded by the Jews as one of their saints, and by the Parisians as a 
sorcerer. During the night when everyone was asleep, he was wont to work by 
the light of a magic lamp which cast through his chamber a glow like that - 
of day itself. He never replenished this lamp with oil, nor otherwise 
attended to it, and folks began to hint that he had acquired it through 
diabolic agencies. If anyone chanced to knock at his door during the night 
they noticed that the lamp threw out sparks of light of various colours, but 
if they continued to rap the lamp failed and the Rabbi turning from his work 
touched a large nail in the middle of his table which connected magically 
with the knocker on the street-door, giving to the person who rapped upon it 
something of the nature of an electric
shock.  (See France.)
     Lamps of this description were supposed to be known to the 
Rosicrucians, and it is said that in opening the tomb of a daughter of 
Cicero several lamps were found burning upon it.  It is of course possible 
that the light from these was luminous or phosphorescent and not living 
flame.
     The magic lamp of Aladdin will occur to everyone in this connection; 
and romance abounds in such vehicles of light.

Lancashire Witches : A story with many pathetic and pitiable features, and 
one which is eloquent of the ignorance and credulity of the age, is that of 
the Lancashire Witches.  Not very far from Manchester lies Pendelbury 
Forest, a gloomy though romantic and picturesque spot. At the time when it 
was inhabited by the witches-that is to say, about the beginning of the 17th 
century-it was held in such terror by law-abiding folks that they scarcely 
dared to approach it.  They imagined it to be the haunt of witches and 
demons, the scene of all sorts of frightful orgies and diaboli-cal rites. So 
that when Roger Nowel, a country magistrate, hit upon the plan of routing 
the witches out of their den, and thus ridding the district of their 
malevolent influence, he fancied he would be doing a public-spirited and 
laudable action. He promptly began by seizing Elizabeth Demdike and Ann 
Chattox, two women of eighty years of age, one of them blind, and the other 
threatened with blindness, both of them living in squalor and abject 
poverty. Demdike's daughter, Elizabeth Device, and her grandchildren, James 
and Alison Device, were included in the accusation, and Ann Redferne, 
daughter of Chattox was apprehended with her mother. Others were seized in 
quick succession-Jane Bulcock and her son John, Alice Nutter, Catherine 
Hewitt, and Isabel Roby. All of them were seduced-by what means it were 
better not to enquire too closely-to make a more or less detailed confession 
of their communication with the Devil. When this had been extorted from 
them. they were sent to prison in Lancaster Castle, some fifty miles away, 
there to await trial for their misdeeds.
     They had not lain in prison very long when the authorities were 
informed that about twenty witches had assembled on Good Friday, at Malkin's 
Tower, the home of Elizabeth Device, in order to compass the death of one 
Covel, to blow up the castle in which their companions were confined, and 
rescue the prisoners, and also to kill a man called Lister, which last 
purpose they accomplished by means of diabolical agency.  In the summer 
assizes of 1612 the prisoners were tried for witchcraft, and were all found 
guilty. The woman Demdike had died in prison, and thus escaped a more 
ignominious death at the gallows. The principal witnesses who appeared 
against Elizabeth Device were her grandchildren, James and Jennet Device. 
Directly the latter entered the witness-box her grandmother set up a 
terrible yelling punctuated by bitter execrations. The child, who was only 
nine years of age, begged that the prisoner might be removed as she could 
not otherwise proceed with her evidence. Her request was granted, and she 
and her brother swore that the Devil had visited their grandmother in the 
shape of a black dog, and asked what were her wishes. She had intimated that 
she desired the death of one John Robinson, whereupon the fiend told leer to 
make a clay image of Robinson and gradually crumble it to pieces, saying 
that as she did so the man's life would decay and finally perish. On such 
evidence ten persons were hanged, including the aged Ann Chattox.
     It is shocking to reflect that, at a period when literature and 
learning were at their height, such cruelty could be tolerated, not only by 
the vulgar and uneducated, but by the learned judges who pronounced the 
sentence. The women were old and ignorant and probably weak-minded. No doubt 
they began in time to invest themselves with those powers, which their 
neighbours credited to them, and to believe themselves fit objects for the 
awe and terror of the people. It is even possible that they may have seen 
some sort of visions, or hallucinations, which they persuaded themselves 
were evil spirits attending on them Thus their own cunning and ignorance may 
have hastened their downfall.
     Twenty-two years later a similar outrage, on the same spot, was 
narrowly avoided, by the shrewdness of the judge who tried the case. A 
certain misguided man, by name Edmund Robinson, thought to profit by the 
general belief in witchcraft. To this end he taught his young son, a boy of 
eleven to say that one day he encountered in the fields two dogs, with which 
he tried to catch a hare. But the animals would not obey his bidding, and at 
length he tied them to a post and whipped them, when they immediately turned 
into a witch and her imp. This monstrous story gained such credence that 
when Robinson declared that his son possessed a sort of second-sight, which 
enabled him to distinguish a witch at a glance, no one thought of denying 
his statement.  Accordingly, he took the boy to the neigh-bouring churches, 
set him on a bench, and bade him point out the witches.  No less than 
seventeen persons were thus accused and might have been hanged had not the 
judge's suspicions been aroused by the story, for the jury did not hesitate 
to convict them.  However, the doubts of the worthy judge gained a respite 
for the prisoners, some of whom were sent to London for examination by the 
King's physician and by the king himself. The boy's story was in-vestigated 
and found to be merely a tissue of lies, as, indeed, the child himself 
confessed it to be.  (See Whitaker, The History of Whalley, p.215.)


Lapis Exilis  A name applied to the Graal itself. It is this stone which 
causes the phoenix to renew her youth. Lapis Exilis, according to Wolfram 
von Eschenbach, was synony-mous with the Holy Grail.


Lapis Judaicus : Also identified with the Graal and the Talismanic stone of 
inexhaustible feeding power. It is sometimes called Theolithos, and seems 
but another name for the Lapis Exilis (q.v.)  It has been confounded with 
the Phoenix stone. Another legend clings to it: it is said to have fallen 
from the crown of Lucifer, as he was banished from heaven, and remains in 
the keeping of the angels of the air.


Lapland  The Laplanders have a reputation for magical practice which is 
almost proverbial throughout Europe, and certainly so among the peoples of 
the Scandinavian Peninsula. Indeed the Finns still credit them with extra-
ordinary power in sorcery and divination. Many Scan-dinavian scions of 
nobility were in ancient times sent to Lapland to obtain a magical 
reputation, and Eric the son of Harold Haarfager found Gunhild, daughter of 
Asur Tote, sonjourning among the Lapps in A.D. 922 for that purpose.  
English literature abounds with reference to Lapland witches. But Sorcery in 
Lapland was a preserve of the male shamans or magicians. Like the Celtic 
witches the Lapps were addicted to the selling of wind or tempests in 
knotted ropes.
     Scheffer in his Lapponia (1674) writing of Lapp magic says :-" The 
melancholic constitution of the  Laplanders, renders them subject to 
frightful apparitions and dreams, which they look upon as infallible 
presages made to them by the Genius of what is to befall them. Thus they are 
frequently seen lying upon the ground asleep, some singing with a full 
voice, others howling and making a hideous noise not unlike wolves.
     "Their superstitions may be imputed partly to their living in 
solitudes, forests, and among the wild beasts partly to their solitary way 
of dwelling separately from the society of others, except who belong to 
their own families sometimes several leagues distance. Hereafter it may be 
added.  that their daily exercise is hunting, it being observed that this 
kind of life is apt to draw people into various superstitions, and at last 
to a correspondence with spirits. For those who lead a solitary life being 
frequently destitute of human aid, have oft-times recourse to forbidden 
means, in hopes to find that aid and help among the spirits, which they 
cannot find among men; and what encourages them in it is impunity, these 
things being committed by them, without as much as the fear of any 
witnesses; which moved Mr. Rheen to allege, among sundry reasons which he 
gives for the continuance of the impious superstitions of the Laplanders, 
this for one: because they live among inaccess-ible mountains, and at a 
great distance from the conversa-tion of other men.  Another reason is the 
good opinion they constantly entertain of their ancestors, whom they cannot 
imagine to have been so stupid as not to understand what God they ought to 
worship, wherefore they judge they should be wanting in their reverence due 
to them, if, by receding from their institutions, they should reprove them 
of impiety and ignorance.
     “The parents are the masters, who instruct their own sons in the 
magical art.  'Those,' says Tornaeus, 'who have attained to this magical art 
by instructions receive it either from their parents, or from somebody else, 
and that by degrees which they put in practice as often as an oppor-tunity 
offers.  Thus they accomplish themselves in this art, especially if their 
genius leads them to it.  For they don't look upon every one as a fit 
scholar; nay, some are accounted quite incapable of it, notwithstanding they 
have been sufficiently instructed, as I have been informed by very credible 
people.'  And Job. Tornaeus confirms it by these words: ' As the Laplanders 
are naturally of different inclinations, so are they not equally capable of 
attaining to this art.'  And in another passage, they bequeath the demons as 
part of their inheritance, which is the reason that one family excels the 
other in this magical art. From whence it is evident, that certain whole 
families have their own demons, not only differing from the familiar spirits 
of others, but also quite contrary and opposite to them. Besides this, not 
only whole families, but also particular persons, have sometimes one, 
sometimes more spirits belonging to them, to secure them against the designs 
of other demons, or else to hurt others. Claus Petri Niurenius speaks to 
this effect, when he says - ‘ They are attended by a certain number of 
spirits, some by three, others by two, or at least by one. The last is 
intended for their security, the other to hurt others. The first commands 
all the rest. Some of those they acquire with a great deal of pains and 
prayers, some without much trouble, being their attendants from their 
infancy.' Joh. Tornaeus gives us a very large account of it. 'There are 
some,' says he, 'who naturally are magicians; an abominable tiling indeed. 
For those who the devil knows which will prove very serviceable to him in 
this art, he seizes on in their very infancy with certain distemper, when 
they are haunted with apparitions and visions, by which they are, in 
proportion of their age, instructed in the rudiments of this art. Those who 
are a second time taken with this distemper, have more appar-itions coming 
before them than in the first, by which they receive much more insight into 
it than before. But if they are seized a third time with this disease, which 
then proves very dangerous, and often not without the hazard of their lives, 
then it is they see all the apparitions the devil is able to contrive, to 
accomplish them in the magical art. Those are arrived to such a degree of 
perfection, that without the help of the drum (see infra), they can foretell 
things to come a great while before; and are so strongly possessed by the 
devil, that they foresee things even against their will. Thus, not long ago, 
a certain Laplander, who is still alive, did voluntarily deliver his drum to 
me, which I had often desired of him before; notwithstanding all this, he 
told me in a very melancholy posture, that though he had put away his drum, 
nor intended to have any other hereafter, yet he could foresee everything 
without it, as he had done before. As an instance of it, he told me truly 
all the particular accidents that had happened to me in my journey into 
Lapland, making at the same time heavy complaints, that he did not know what 
use to make of his eyes those things being presented to his sight much 
against his will.'
     “Lundius observes, that some of the Laplanders are seized upon by a 
demon, when they are arrived to a middle age, in the following manner: -
Whilst they are busy in the woods, the spirit appears to them, where they 
discourse concerning the conditions, upon which the demon offers them his 
assistance, which done, he teaches them a certain song, which they are 
obliged to keep in constant remem-brance.  They must return the next day to 
the same place, where the same spirit appears to them again, and repeats the 
former song, in case he takes a fancy to the person; if not, he does not 
appear at all. These spirits make their appearances under different shapes, 
some like fishes, some like birds, others like a serpent or dragon, others 
in the shape of a pigmee. about a yard high; being attended by three, four, 
or five other pigmees of the same bigness, sometimes by more, but never 
exceeding nine. No sooner are they seized by the Genius, but they appear in 
the most surprising posture, like madmen, before be-reaved of the use of 
reason.  This continues for six months; during which time they don't suffer 
any of their kindred to come near them, not 50 much as their own wives and 
children. They spend most of this time in the woods and other solitary 
places, being very melancholy and thoughtful scarce taking any food, which 
makes them extremely weak. It you ask their children, where and how their 
parents sustain themselves, they will tell you, that they receive their 
sustenance from their Genii. The same author gives us a remarkable instance 
of this kind in a young Laplander called Olaus, being then a scholar in the 
school of Liksala, of about eighteen years of age. This young fellow fell 
mad on a sudden, making most dreadful postures and outcries, that he was in 
hell, and his spirit tormented beyond what could be expressed. If he took a 
book in hand; so soon as he met with the name of Jesus, he threw the book 
upon tile ground in great fury, which after some time being passed over, 
they used to ask him whether he had seen any vision during this ecstacy ? He 
answered that abundance of things had appeared to him, and that a mad dog 
being tied to his foot, followed him wherever he stirred. In his lucid 
intervals he would tell them, that the first beginning of it happened to him 
one day, as he was going out of the door of his dwelling, when a great flame 
passed before his eyes and touching his ears, a certain person appeared to 
him all naked. The next day he was seized with a most terrible headache, so 
that he made most lamentable outcries, and broke everything that came under 
his hands. This un-fortunate person's face was as black as coal, and he used 
to say, that the devil most commonly appeared to him in the habit of a 
minister, in a long cloak; during his fits he would say that he was 
surrounded by nine or ten fellows of a low stature, who did use him very 
barbarously, though at the same time the standers-by did not perceive the 
least thing. like it. He would often climb to the top of the highest fir 
trees, with as much swiftness as a squirrel, and leap down again to the 
ground, without receiving the least hurt. He always loved solitude, flying 
the conversation of other men. He would run as swift as a horse, it being 
impossible for anybody to overtake him. He used to talk amongst the woods to 
himself no otherwise than if several persons had been in his company.
     I am apt to believe, that those spirits were not altogether unknown to 
the ancients, and that they are the same which were called by Tertullian 
Paredri, and are mentioned by Monsieur Valois, in his Ecclesiastical History 
of Eusebius.
     Whenever a Laplander has occasion for his familiar spirit, he calls to 
him, and makes him come by only singing the song he taught him at their 
first interview; by which means he has him at his service as often as he 
pleases. And because they know them obsequious and serviceable, they call 
them Sveie, which signifies as much in their tongue, as the companions of 
their labour, or their helpmates. Lun-dius has made another observation, 
very well worth taking notice of, viz. -That those spirits or demons never 
appear to the women, or enter into their service, of which I don't pretend 
to allege the true cause, unless one might say, that perhaps they do it out 
of pride, or a natural aversion they have to the female sex, subject to so 
many infirmities."
     For the purposes of augury or divination the Lapps employed a magic 
drum, which, indeed, was in use among several Arctic peoples. Writing in 
1827, De Capell Brooke states that the ceremonies connected with this 
instrument had almost quite disappeared at that date. The en-croachments of 
Lutheranism had been long threatening the existence of the native shamanism. 
In 1671 the Lapp drum was formally banned by Swedish law, and several 
magicians were apprehended and their instruments burnt. But before that date 
the religion which the drum represented was in full vigour.  The Lapps 
called their drum Kannus (Regnard, 1681), also Kaunus, Kabdas, Kabdes 
Gabdas, and Keure (Von Duben, 1873.) its Scandinavian designations being 
troll-trumma, or Ruec-bomme," magic or runic drum," otherwise Spa-trumma,  
fortune-telling drum."  J. A. Friis has shown that the sampo of the Finnish 
Kelevala is the same instrument. According to Von Duben, the best pictures 
and explanations of the drum are to be found in Friss's Lappisk Mythologi 
(Christiania, 1871), pp. 30-47, but there are good descriptions in Von 
Duben's own work (On Lapland, och Lapparne, Stockholm, 1873), as also in the 
books of Scheffer, Leem, Jessen, and others. The appear-ance of the Lapp 
drum is thus described by Regnard in 1681 -This instrument is made of a 
single piece of wood, hollowed in its thickest part in an oval form, the 
under part of which is convex, in which they make two apertures long enough 
to suffer the fingers to pass through, for the purpose of holding it more 
firmly. The upper part is covered with the skin of the reindeer, on which 
they paint in red a number of figures, and from whence several brass rings 
are seen hanging, and some pieces of the bone of the reindeer." A wooden 
hammer, or, as among the Samoyeds (1614), a hare's foot was used as a drum-
stick in the course of the incantation. An arpa or divining-rod was placed 
on a definite spot showing from its position after sounding the drum what 
magic inference might be drawn. By means of the drum, the priest could be 
placed en rapport with the spirit world, and was thus enabled to divine the 
future; to ascertain synchronous events occurring at remote distances ; to 
forecast the measure of success attending the day's hunting; to heal the 
sick; or to inflict people with disease and cause death. Although obsolete 
in Lapland these rites are still performed among the Samoyeds and other 
races of Arctic Asia and America. It is interesting to note how exactly the 
procedure among the Vaigatz Samoyeds in 1556 (Pinkerton's Voyages, London, 
1808, I.63) tallies with that of the Saklialin Amos in 1883 (J. M. Dixon in 
Trans, Asiatic Soc. of Japan, Yokohama, 1883, 47). The same practices can be 
traced eastward through Arctic America, and the drum is used in the same 
fashion by the Eskimo shaman priests in Greenland (Henry Rink's Tales, etc., 
1875, 60-61.) The shape of the drum varies a little according to locality. 
The form of the Eskimo drum is that of a tambourine.
     “Their most valuable instrument of enchantment," says Tornaeus, " is 
this sorcerer's kettle-drum, which they call Kannas or Quobdas. They cut it 
in one entire piece out of a thick tree stem, the fibres of which run 
upwards in the same direction as the course of the sun. The drum is covered 
with the skin of an animal; and in the bottom holes are cut by which it may 
be held. Upon the skins are many figures painted, often Christ and the 
Apostles, with the heathen gods, Thor, Noorjunkar, and others jumbled 
together; the picture of the sun, shapes of animals, lands and waters, 
cities and roads, in short, all kinds of drawings according to their various 
uses. Upon the drum there is placed an indicator, which they call Arpa, 
which consists of a bundle of metallic rings. The drumstick is, generally, a 
reindeer's horn. This drum they preserve with the most vigilant care, and 
guard it especially from the touch of a woman. When they will make known 
what is taking place at a distance,-as to how the chase shall succeed, how 
business will answer, what result a sickness will have, what is necessary 
for the cure of it, and the like, they kneel down, and the sorcerer heats 
the drum; at first with light strokes, but as he proceeds, with ever louder 
stronger ones, round the index, either till this has moved in a direction or 
to a figure which he regards as the answer which he has sought, or till he 
himself falls into ecstasy, when he generally lays the kettle-drum on his 
head. Then he sings with a loud voice a song which they call Jogke, and the 
men and woven who stand round sing songs, which they call Daura, in which 
the name of the place whence they desire information frequently occurs.  The 
sorcerer lies in the ecstatic state for some time, frequently for many 
hours, apparently dead, with rigid features ; sometimes with perspiration 
bursting out upon him.  In the meantime the bystanders continue their 
incantations, which have for their object that the sleeper shall not lose 
any part of his vision from memory; at the same time they guard him 
carefully that nothing living may touch him- not even a fly.  When he again 
awakes to consciousness, he relates his vision, answers the questions put to 
him, and gives unmistakable evidence of having seen distant and unknown 
things.  The inquiry of the oracle does not always take place so solemnly 
and completely. In everyday matters as regards the chase, etc., the Lapp 
consults his drum without falling into the somnambulic crisis. On the other 
hand, a more highly developed state of prophet vision may take place without 
this instrument, as has already been stated. Claudi relates, that at Bergen, 
in Norway, the clerk of a German merchant demanded of a Norwegian Finn-
Laplander what his master was doing in Germany. The Finn promised to give 
him the intelligence. He began then to cry out like a drunken man, and to 
run round in a circle, till he fell, as one dead, to the earth. After a 
while he woke again, and gave the answer, which time showed to be correct. 
Finally, that many, while wholly awake, free from convulsions and a state of 
unconsciousness, are able to become clairvoyant, is placed beyond all doubt 
by the account of Tornaeus.
     “The use which they make of their power of clairvoy-ance, and their 
magic arts, is, for the most part, good and innocent; that of curing sick 
men and animals; inquiring into far-off and future things, which in the 
confined sphere of their existence is important to them. There are instances 
however, in which the magic art is turned to the injury of others."

Larvae  (See Magic.)


Lascaris   (Alchemist of the Eighteenth Century.)  It is impossible to 
determine the date at which this mysterious personage was born, or to say, 
exactly, whence he came and where he chiefly lived. He is commonly supposed 
to have been active about the beginning of the eighteenth century, while 
Germany is held to have been the principal scene of his activities; but 
everything recorded concerning him reads like a romance, and suggests the 
middle ages rather than the day before yesterday. Sometimes he assured 
people that he was of Oriental origin, sometimes he maintained that his 
native land was the Ionian Isles, and that he was a scion of the Greek royal 
house of Lascaris; while on other occasions he declared that he was an 
archimandrite of a convent in the Island of Mytilene, and that his object in 
coming to Europe was to solicit alms for the ransom of Christian prisoners 
in the East. Such was his tale when, about 1700, he commenced wandering in 
Ger-many, and, while sojourning at Berlin, he happened to fall ill and sent 
for medical aid. This appeared shortly in the shape of a young apothecary, 
Johann Friedrich Botticher by name, who chanced to be deeply interested in 
alchemy. so a friendship sprang up between physician and patient and ere 
Lascaris left the Prussian capital he gave Botticher a packet of transmuting 
powder, at the same time instruct-ing him how to use it successfully, yet 
refraining from telling him how to manufacture the powder itself.  Nothing 
daunted, Botticher set to work speedily, concocted con-siderable quantities 
of gold and silver, grew rich, and was raised to the peerage; while 
simultaneously he began to find his society, and more especially his 
services as a scientist, courted by kings and nobles. Meanwhile, however, 
his supply of the precious powder had run short, and being unable to make 
more he found his reputation waning apace; while worse still, he had spent 
his newly-acquired wealth speedily, and now he found himself reduced to 
penury. Ultimately he was incarcerated, but during his period of durance 
vile he set himself to the manufacture of porcelain, and by the sale of this 
he eventually restored his fallen fortunes.
     We presume naturally that it was gratitude to his physi-cian which 
inspired the crafty alchemist to give Botticher the powder, but why did 
Lascaris make an analogous present at a later date ?  The recipient on this 
occasion being one Schmolz de Dierbach, a lieutenant-colonel in the Polish 
Army.  He, like the German apothecary, succeeded in making a quantity of 
gold, and, though we hear no more about him after this transmutation, we 
learn that a certain Baron de Creux was likewise favoured by Lascaris, the 
Baron's experiments proving just as successful as those of the others 
aforesaid.  Nor were these the only people on whom our alchemist bestowed 
his indulgence, for one Domenico Manuel, the son of a Neapolitan mason, was 
likewise given a packet of transmutatory powder, and, armed thus, he 
wandered through Spain, Belgium, and Austria, performing operations before 
princes and noblemen, and reaping wealth accordingly.  Pride was the 
inevitable result of this, and though there is no reason to suppose that any 
patent of nobility was ever conferred on Domenico, we find him styling 
himself now Comte Gautano, now Comte di Ruggiero; while in one town he 
maintained that he was a Prussian major-general, and elsewhere he declared 
that he was field-marshal of the Bavarian forces.  Going to Berlin in the 
course of his perambulations, he offered to make gold in the presence of the 
king; but alas I his operation proved utterly futile, and he was hanged as a 
charlatan in consequence. This was in 1709, and in the same year, according 
to tradition, Lascaris himself performed some successful transmutations 
before a German politician named Liebknech, a citizen of Wurtembourg. 
Nothing further is heard of the mysterious Greek alchemist, however, so it 
may be assumed that he died soon after these events. His was a curious 
career indeed : his generosity having scarcely a parallel in the whole 
history of hermetic philoso-phy.

Launay, Jean : A celebrated doctor of the Sorbonne, born in 1603 at 
Valderic, in the diocese of Contanas. He has left a pedantic dissertation On 
the Vision of St. Simon Stock, which he could not understand, being 
something of a Jansenist, It was published in Paris, in 1653 and 1663.


Laurel : A tree which Apuleius classes among the plants which preserve men 
from the influence of evil spirits.  It was also believed to give protection 
from lightning.

Laurin or Der Kleine Rosengarten  A Tyrolese romance of the late thirteenth 
century. Laurin, a  dwarf, possesses a magic rose-garden into which no one 
may enter without the loss of a hand or a foot. Dietrich and his follower 
Witege, enter it, and the latter rides through the rose bushes. Laurin, the 
dwarf, appears, on horseback and dis-mounts Witege. He is challenged by 
Dietrich and, assum-ing his cloak of invisibility, wounds him. Dietrich now 
persuades him to a wrestling match and wrenches off the dwarf's belt which 
gives him super-human strength. Thus he overthrows Laurin.  Laurin then 
invites Dietrich and his followers to his mountain home, prepares them a 
banquet, makes them tipsy, and throws them all into a dungeon. They are 
released by Kunhild, a mortal woman, who restores their weapons. They take 
Laurin prisoner and carry him to Bern where he becomes a Christian convert 
and receives Kunhild in marriage.


Law, William  English Mystic and Theologian (1686-1761.) William Law was 
born at Kingscliffe, Northamptonshire, in the year 1686. His father followed 
the humble calling of a grocer, but it is manifest that he was in tolerably 
affluent circumstances nevertheless, and ambitious besides, for in 1705 
William was sent to Cambridge University. Entering Emmanuel College, he 
became a fellow thereof in 1711, but on the accession of George I. he felt 
himself unable to sub-scribe the oath of allegiance, the inevitable 
consequence being that he forfeited his fellowship. In 1727 he went to 
Putney, having acquired there the post of tutor to the father of Edmund 
Gibbon, the historian of the Roman Empire in decline, and he acted in this 
capacity for ten years, winning universal esteem the while for his piety and 
his theological erudition. In 1737, on the death of his employer, Law 
retired to his native village of Kingscliffe, and it would seem that 
thenceforth he was chiefly supported by the purses of some of his devotees, 
notably Miss Hester Gibbon, sister of his guardian pupil, and a widow named 
Mrs. Hutcheson. These two ladies had a united income of fully f3000 a year, 
so Law must have been comfortable indeed, yet wealth and luxury did not tend 
to corrupt his piety, and it is recorded that he was wont to get up every 
morning at five, and spend several hours before breakfast in prayer and 
meditations. At a considerably earlier stage in his career he had begun 
publishing theses on mysticism, and on religion in general; and now, being 
blessed with abundance of leisure, and having acquired fresh inspiration 
from reading the works of Jacob Boehme, he produced year after year a 
considerable mass of writing. Thus his life passed away placidly, and he 
died in 1761.
     Law's works amount in all to some twenty volumes. His debut as a writer 
was made in 1717, with an examination of certain tenets lately promulgated 
from the pulpit by the Bishop of Bangor; and this was followed soon 
afterwards by a number of analogous writings, while in 1726 he em-ployed his 
pen to attack the theatre, bringing out a book entitled The Absolute 
Unlawfulness of the Stage Entertain-ment fully Demonstrated. In the same 
year he issued A Practical Treatise upon Christian Perfection, and this was 
followed shortly by A Serious Call to: a Devout and Holy Life, adapted to 
the State and Condition of all Orders of Christians. This last is the best-
known of his works, but others which it behoves to cite are The Grounds and 
Reason of Christian Regeneration (1739), The Spirit of Prayer (1749), The 
Way to Divine Knowledge (1752), The Spirit of Love (1752), and Of 
Justification by Faith and Works (1760). Most of the foregoing, but 
especially the Serious Call, have been reprinted again and again; while in 
1762 a collected edition of Law's works was published, and in 1893 there 
appeared a sort of anthology, made up of extracts from the writer, chosen by 
Dr. Alexander Whyte. In his preface the editor speaks of Law's " golden 
books," while he adds that “In sheer intellectual strength Law is fully 
abreast of the very foremost of his illustrious contemporaries, while in 
that fertilising touch which is the true test of genius, Law stands simply 
alone." Numerous other encomiums no less enthusiastic than this have been 
offered to the mystic, and it is noteworthy that he has engaged the interest 
of many great writers. Sir Leslie Stephen, for example, deals with him in 
his History of English Thought in the Eighteenth Century, and again in his 
pleasant Studies of a Biographer; while the mystic figures also in the 
brilliant pages of W. E. H. Lecky, and in Gibbon's Autobiography he is 
hailed as "a worthy and pious man, who believed all that he professed, and 
practised all that he enjoined."


Laya Yoga : That practice of the yogi by which he listens to sounds which 
can be heard within his own body when the ears are closed. These sounds are 
termed" The Nada," and are of all kinds, from the roar of the ocean to the 
humming of bees.


Lazare, Denys  A prince of Serbia who lived in the year of the Hegira, 788.  
He was author of a work entitled Dreams, published in 1686. He himself 
claimed to have had noc-turnal visions.


Le Normand, Marie  Known as "The Sybil of the Faubourg Saint Germain," was 
born at Alencon in 1772 and died at Paris in 1843. She was one of the most 
famous occultists and diviners of her day; but it might justly be said that 
her art was much more the product of sound judgment than of any supernatural 
gift. She predicted their futures to Marat, Robespierre, and St. Just, but 
we hear no more of her under the Directory. When Josephine Beauharnais came 
into prominence as the intended wife of Napoleon, Mile. La Normand was 
received at all those houses and salons where the future empress had any 
influence. Jose-phine was extremely credulous, and used to read her own 
fortunes to herself on the cards; but when she found that MIle. Le Normand 
was an adept at this art, she often had her in attendance to assist her in 
it. Even Napoleon himself who was not without his own superstitions, had his 
horoscope read by her. She soon set up her own salon in Paris where she read 
people's fortunes by means of the cards. It is not stated whether these 
cards were of the nature of Tarot cards, but it is more than likely that 
they were; but we know that she occasionally divined the fortunes of others 
through playing the games of piquet, sept, and other card games. She did not 
hide her methods from others, but the Parisian society of her day appears to 
have thought that her power of divination lay not in the cards she 
manipulated but in her personality. It has been stated by Migne that she did 
use the Tarot, but as he calls them " German cards," one cannot attach much 
importance to his statement. After the fall of the Emperor she was the rage 
amongst the Russian, German and English officers in Paris, and even the 
Emperor Alexander and other potentates consulted her. Shortly after this she 
went to Brussels, where she read the fortune of the Prince of Orange, but as 
she tried to cheat the customs she soon found herself the occupant of a 
Belgian prison. By the year 1830 she had become quite forgotten, and when 
the newspapers announced her death on June 25th, 1843, the majority of 
people failed to remember her name. There is very little doubt that she was 
a harmless charlatan, though several contemporary historians appear to 
consider that she possessed mischievous tendencies ; but the air of 
omniscience and mystery with which she surrounded herself was 50 absurd that 
by the majority of people she was looked upon, probably with justice, as a 
mere impostor.

Lescoriere, Marie: A witch of the sixteenth century, arrested at the age of 
ninety years. On being examined she declared that she was no longer a witch; 
that she prayed daily; and that she had not visited the Sabbath for forty 
years. Questioned on the subject of the Sabbath, she confessed that she had 
seen the devil, and that he had visited her in the shape of a dog or a cat. 
On one occasion, she said, she had killed a neighbour by praying to the 
devil.

Levi, Eliphas : Alphonse Louis Constant, better known by his pen-name of 
Eliphas Levi, was a French occultist of the nineteenth century, who has been 
called "the last of the magi." He was born about 1810, the son of a 
shoemaker, and through the good offices of the parish priest was educated 
for the church at St. Sulpice.  In due course he became a deacon, taking a 
vow of celibacy. Shortly after this he was expelled from St. Sulpice for 
teaching doctrines contrary to those of the Church. How he lived during the 
ensuing years is not known, but about 1839 under the influence of a 
political and socialistic prophet named Ganneau, he wrote a pamphlet 
entitled The Gospel of Liberty, for which he received six months 
imprisonment. In Paris, notwithstanding his vow of celibacy, he married a 
beautiful girl of sixteen, who afterwards bad the marriage annulled. It was 
probably not until Madame Constant had left him that he studied the occult 
sciences. At all events his writings previous to this show little trace of 
occult influence. In 1855 he published his Doctrine of Transcendental Magic, 
followed in 1856 by the Ritual of Transcendental Magic; in 1860 was issued 
his History of Magic ; in 1861 The Key of the Grand Mysteries ; Fables and 
Symbols in 1864; Le Sorcier de Mendon and La Science des Esprits in 1865. 
Most of his works have been trans-lated by Mr. A. E. Waite. He died in 1875.
     Levi's knowledge of the occult sciences was much more imaginative than 
circumstantial, and in perusing his works the reader requires to be on his 
guard against the adoption
of hasty generalisations and hypotheses. 

Leviathan : (See Devil.)


Levitation: A term in use among spiritualists to denote the raising in the 
air of the human body or other objects without visible means, and presumably 
through the agency of disembodied spirits. Thus the levitation of tables and 
other more or less weighty objects is a common feat among physical" mediums, 
whether or not a supernatural explanation be required. The witches of olden 
times, too, were popularly supposed to make use of some occult mode of 
locomotion in their nocturnal travels, being transported through the air by 
the arts of their master, the Devil. And the poltergeist was also thought to 
suspend in the air, without visible means of support, the agent through whom 
he manifested himself. As a spiritualistic phenomenon levitation of the 
human body became known at an early stage of the movement, being recorded in 
connection with the medium Gordon so early as 185:. But the most im-portant 
of levitated. mediums was D. D. Home, and many accounts of his feats in this 
direction are given by witnesses who were themselves convinced of their 
genuineness. It may be noted, however, that levitations usually occurred in 
a darkened seance-room, when the only indication of any untoward happening 
was furnished by the medium's own exclamations, by the fact that his voice 
seemed to come from high in the air, and sometimes by his boots scraping the 
back of a chair or the hand of one of the sitters. The Rev. Stainton Moses, 
who also was levitated on several occasions, seems to have held his seances 
in darkness also, or at most by the light of the fire. Mrs. Guppy (see 
Nicholls) was before her marriage several times levitated, notwithstanding 
the fact that she was extremely stout, and a curious story concerning a 
later levitation is told in a letter in the Echo of June 8th, 1871, for 
whose (anonymous) author's trustworthiness the editor vouches. About that 
time the writer attended a circle with Messrs. Herne and Williams as 
mediums, the spirits present being the famous John and Katie King. One of 
the sitters jokingly expressed a wish that Mrs. Guppy (then in her home some 
three miles distant might be brought to the seance-room, and to this Katie 
King was heard to assent. While the company were laughing at the absurdity 
of the idea, there was a loud bump, followed by shrieks and exclamations. A 
match was struck, and there in the centre of the table stood Mrs. Guppy, an 
account-book in one hand, a pen in the other, and apparently in a state of 
trance. Less than three minutes elapsed between the expression of the wish 
and the appear-ance of Mrs. Guppy. The writer adds: "The possibility of her 
being concealed in the room is as absurd as the idea of her acting in 
collusion with the media."
     Pseudo-historical instances of levitation may be found in abundance, 
especially among the early saints. St. Dunstan, archbishop of Canterbury, 
was observed to rise from the ground shortly before his death in 988. St. 
Bernard Ptolomei, St. Philip Benitas, St. Albert of Sicily, and St. Dominic, 
founder of the Dominican order, were all seen to be levitated while engaged 
in their devotions. An ecstatic nun "rose from the ground with so much 
impetu-osity, that five or six of the sisters could hardly hold her down." 
It is related by his biographers that Savonarola, shortly before he perished 
at the stake, remained suspended at a considerable height above the floor of 
his dungeon, absorbed in prayer. And such instances might easily be 
multiplied.


Leviticon : A gospel adopted by the French Templars, and alleged by them to 
have been discovered in the Temple at Paris, along with other objects. It 
was supposed to have been composed in the fifteenth century by a Greek monk, 
Nicephorus, who sought to combine Moslem tenets with Christianity.


Lewis, Matthew Gregory: Commonly known as  “Monk" Lewis, English Author 
(1775-1818). Matthew Gregory Lewis was born in London in 1775. His father 
was Matthew Lewis, deputy secretary of war, and proprietor of several 
valuable estates in Jamaica; while his mother was Anna Maria Sewell, a lady 
of cultured tastes, devoted to music and various other arts. The future 
author showed precocity while yet a child, and on reaching boyhood he was 
sent to Westminster School, but while he was there an ugly cloud rose to dim 
his horizon, his parents quarrelling and agreeing to  separate.  Matthew  
contrived  to remain friendly with both his father and mother, and in 1771 
he visited Paris, while about the same time he made his first literary 
efforts, and in 1792 he went to Weimar in Germany where he made the 
acquaintance of Goethe, and also learnt German thoroughly.  Two years later 
he was appointed attache to the British Embassy at the Hague, and while 
staying there he wrote his mystical story, Ambrosio, or the Monk, which 
earned him his now familiar sobriquet of" Monk Lewis "while in 1796 he 
entered Parliament as member for Hindon, in Wiltshire, and during the next 
few years he necessarily resided chiefly in London, or near it, becoming 
friendly the while with most of the notable people of the day.  Meantime his 
interest in the occult had been developing apace, and in 1798 there was 
staged at Drury Lane a play of his, Castle Spectre, in which ghosts and the 
like play a prominent part, and which won great popularity among people 
interested in things of that nature; while in 1788 lie issued his Tales of 
Terror, and in 1801 a volume entitled Tales of Wonder, this being virtually 
an anthology of popular occult verses, some of which were supplied by Sir 
Walter Scott.
     In 1812 Lewis's father died, and the author accordingly found himself a 
very rich man.  His conscience was troubled, nevertheless, by the fact that 
his wealth was derived from slave labour, and so, in 1815, he sailed to 
Jamaica, intent on making arrangements for the generous treatment of the 
negroes on his estates. Returning to England in 1816, he went soon 
afterwards to Geneva, where he met Byron and Shelley, while in 1818 he paid 
a last visit to the West Indies, and died at sea while re-turning home.


Libellus Merlini : (Little Book of Merlin.)  A Latin tract on the subject of 
the prophecies of Merlin written by Geoffrey of Monmouth about 1135. 
Geoffrey prefaces his account of the prophecies with one concerning the 
deeds of a super-natural youth named Ambrosius whom he deliberately 
confounded with Merlin. Vortigern, King of the Britons, asks Ambrose Merlin 
the meaning of a vision in which appear two dragons red and white in combat.  
Merlin replies that the Red Dragon signifies the British race which would be 
conquered by the Saxon, represented by the White Dragon.  A long prophetic 
rhapsody follows, relating chiefly to the Saxon wars, and with this the 
work, as given in the Seventh Book of Geoffrey's Historia Regum Brit-anniae, 
concludes.  It was, however, known in Iceland before 1218 in a form 
independent of the Historia.  (H. C. Leach, Modern Philology, viii., pp.607 
et seq.)  This tract must not be confounded with the Vita Merlini (1145 or 
1148) generally attributed to Geoffrey.


Licking, a Charm: The following was believed to be a remedy for enchantment 
: to lick the child's forehead first upward, then across, and lastly up 
again; and then to spit behind its back.
It is said that if on licking a child's forehead with the tongue a salt 
taste is perceived, this is an infallible proof of fascination.


Life Waves according to Theosophists, are three in number. It is necessary 
to remember that the Deity, the Logos (q.v.) has three aspects corresponding 
to the Christian Trinity.  These aspects are first that of Will ; second, 
that of Wisdom; and third, that of Activity, and each has its definite scope 
in the creation of a universe.  When the Logos Sets about the great work of 
creation he sends the first life wave through his aspect of Activity into 
the multitude of bobbles in the ether, and thereby forms the various kinds 
of matter. The universe having been thus far prepared, he through his aspect 
of Wisdom sends the second life wave, which bringing with it life as we 
usually understand that term and penetrating matter from above, gradually 
descends to the grosser forms and again ascends to the finer forms.  In its 
descent, this life wave makes for an ever-increasing heterogeneity, but in 
its ascent the process is reversed and it makes for an 
ever increasing homogeneity.  The work of creation is now far enough 
advanced to permit of the creation of man, for matter has now been infused 
with the capacity of form and provided with life, and the Logos, therefore, 
through his aspect of Will, bears forth the Divine Spark, the Monad, and, 
along with the form and the life, ensouls man.  (See Theosophy, Logos, 
Ether, Evolution, Solar System, Monad.)


Light : Spiritualistic Journal.  (See Spiritualism.)


Lignite is a beautiful stone like glass; being hung about a child it 
preserves it from witchcraft, and if bound on the forehead it stops the 
bleeding of the nose, restores the loss of senses, and helps to foretell 
future events.


Likho : (See Slavs.)


Lilith :  According to Wierus and other demonologists; Lilith was the prince 
or princess who presided over the demons known as succubi. The demons under 
Lilith bore the same name as their chief, and sought to destroy new-born 
infants.  For this reason the Jews wrote on the four corners of a birth-
chamber a formula to drive Lilith away. (See Babylonia.)


Limachie : This little curiosity, resembling a chip of a man's nail, is to 
be squeezed out of the head of a slug, which must be done the instant it is 
seen.  It is a good amulet to pre-serve from fever.

Lippares or Liparia : He who has this stone " needs no other invention to 
catch wild beasts."  On the other hand, no animal can be attacked by dogs or 
huntsman if it look upon
it.

Litanies of the Sabbath: On Wednesdays and Saturdays, if the accounts speak 
truly, it was the custom to sing at the witches' Sabbath the following 
Litanies :-Lucifer, Beelzebub, Leviathan, have pity on us. Baal, prince of 
the seraphim; Baalberith, prince of the cherubim; Astaroth, prince of the 
thrones; Rosier, prince of denominations; Carreau, prince of the powers; 
Belial, prince of the vertues ; Perrier, prince of the principalities; 
Oliver, prince of the arch angels ; Junier, prince of the angels; Sarcueil, 
Fume-bouche, Pierre-le-Feu, Carniveau, Terrier, Contellier, Candelier, 
Behemoth, Oilette, Belpuegor, Sabathan, Garandier, Dolers, Pierre-Fort, 
Axaphat, Prisier, Kakos, Lucesme, pray for us.
     It must be remarked that Satan is evoked in these litanies only in 
company with a crowd of others.


Lithomancy : A species of divination performed by stones, but in what manner 
it is difficult to ascertain.  Gale, in a "note upon lamblichus," confesses 
that he does not clearly understand the nature of it ; whether it refers to 
certain motions observable in idols, or to an insight into futurity obtained 
by demons (familiars) enclosed in particular stones. That these supernatural 
beings might be so commanded is clear from a passage of Nicephorus. The 
Rabbis have attributed Lev. XXVI., I to Lithomancy; but the prohibition of 
stones there given is most probably directed against idolatry in general.  
Bulenger has a short chapter on Lithomancy.  He shows from Tzetzes, that 
Helenus ascertained the fall of Troy by the employment of a magnet, and that 
if a magnet be washed in spring water, and interrogated, a voice like that 
of a sucking child will reply.
     The pseudo-Orpheus has related at length this legend of Helenus.  "To 
him," he says, " Apollo gave the true and vocal sideritis, which others call 
the animated ophites, a Stone possessing fatal qualities, rough, hard, 
black, and heavy, graven everywhere with veins like wrinkles.  For
one and twenty days Helenus abstained from the nuptial couch from the bath, 
and from animal food. Then, washing ibis intelligent stone in a living 
fountain, he cherished it as a babe in soft clothing; and having propitiated 
it as a god, he at length gave it breath by his hymn of mighty virtue. 
Having lighted lamps in his own puri-fied house, he fondled the divine stone 
in his hands, bearing it about as a mother bears her infant; and you, if ye 
wish to hear the voice of the gods, in like manner provoke a similar 
miracle, for when ye have sedulously wiped and dandled the stone in your 
arms, on a sudden it will utter the cry of a new-born child seeking milk 
from the breast of its nurse. Beware, however, of fear, for if you drop the 
stone upon the ground, you will rouse the anger of the immortals. Ask boldly 
of things future, and it will reply. Place it near your eyes when it has 
been washed, look steadily at it, and you will perceive it divinely 
breathing. Thus it was that Helenus, confiding in this fearful stone, 
learned that his country would be overthrown by the Atridae."
     Photius, in his abstract of the life of Isodorus by Dam-ascius, a 
credulous physician of the age of Justinian, speaks of - an oracular stone, 
the baetulum, to which Lithomancy was attributed. A physician named Eusebius 
used to carry one of these wonder-working stones about with him. One night 
it seems, actuated by an unaccountable impulse, he wandered Out from the 
city Emesa to the summit of a mountain dignified by a temple of Minerva. 
There, as he sat down fatigued by his walk, he saw a globe of fire falling 
from the sky and a lion standing by it. The lion dis-appeared, the fire was 
extinguished, and Eusebius ran and picked up a baetulum. He asked it to what 
god it apper-tamed, and it readily answered, to Gennaeus, a deity wor-
shipped by the Heliopolitae, under the form of a lion in the temple of 
Jupiter. During this night, Eusebius said he travelled not less than 210 
stadia, more than 26 miles. He never became perfectly master of the 
baetulum, but was obliged very humbly to solicit its responses. It was of a 
handsome, globular shape, white, a palm in diameter, though sometimes it 
appeared more, sometimes less; occasionally, also, it was of purple colour. 
Characters were to be read on it, impressed in the colour called tingari-
binus. Its answer seemed as if proceeding from a shrill pipe, and Eusebius 
himself interpreted the sounds. Dam-ascius believed its animating spirit to 
be divine; Isodorus, on the other hand, thought it demoniacal, that is, not 
belonging to evil or material demons, not yet to those which are quite pure 
and immaterial. It was with one of these stones, according to Hesychius, 
that Rhea fed Saturnus, when he fancied that he was devouring Jupiter, its 
name being derived from the skin in which it was wrapped, and such the 
commentator supposed to have been the Lapides divi, or vivi, which the 
insane monster Heliogabalus wished to carry off from the temple of Diana, 
built by Orestes at Laodicea. Bochart traces the name and the reverence paid 
to the baetylia, to the stone which Jacob anointed at Bethel. Many of these 
baetylia, Photius assures us from Damascius, were to be found on Mount 
Libanus.


Little, Robert Wentworth : (See Rosicrucians.)


Little World  The name given to a secret society which conspired in England, 
in the eighteenth century, to re-establish the Stuart dynasty. Many stories 
are told of this society-as, for instance, that the devil presided over 
their assemblies in person. The members were Freemasons.


Loathly Damsel, The  Kundrie or Kundry. The Grail Messenger. One would 
imagine that the holder of such an office would be saint-like, but Christian 
describes her as a damsel more hideous than could be pictured outside hell." 
Wolfram refers to her in his work as " Kundri la Sorciere." Kundry in 
Wagner's music-drama " Parsifal" represents sin.


Lodestone: A precious stone believed to possess magical properties of 
diverse kinds. If one is ill, one must hold it in one's hands and shake it 
well. It cures wounds, snake-bites, weak eyes, headaches and restores 
hearing. The possessor of the lodestone may walk through reptiles in safety, 
even when they are accompanied by" black death." Orpheus says that" with 
this stone you can hear the voices of the gods and learn many wonderful 
things; " that it has the property of unfolding the future; and if held 
close to the eyes it will inspire with a divine spirit.


Lodge, Sir Oliver  (See Spiritualism.)


Logos : Fohat-is the term very commonly used in theosophy to designate the 
Deity. Along with the great religions, theosophy has as the beginning of its 
scheme a Deity who, in Himself, is altogether beyond human knowledge or' 
conception, whether in the ordinary or the clairvoyant states. But when the 
Deity manifests Himself to man through his works of creation, He is known as 
the Logos. Essentially He is infinite but when He encloses a "ring pass-not" 
within which to build a kosmos, He has set limits to Himself, and what we 
can know of Him is con-tained in these limits. To us He appears in a triple 
aspect-the Christian Trinity-but this is, of course, merely an appearance, 
and in reality He is a unity. This triple aspect shews Him as Will, Wisdom 
and Activity, and from each of these came forth one of the creative life 
waves which formed the universe. From the third came the wave which created 
matter, from the second, the wave which aggregated diffuse matter into form, 
and from the first, the wave which brought with it the Monad; that 
scintillation of Himself which took posession of formed matter, to start 
thereby the evolutionary process.

Loki : (See Devil.)


Lombroso, Professor Cesare: A celebrated Italian anthro-pologist. A few 
years before his death be took up the study of spiritualism and experimented 
extensively with the well-known medium Eusapia Palladino, in company with 
Messieurs Richet, Maxwell, Flammarion, and Pro-fessor Schiaparelli.  He 
embodied the results of his investi-gations in several well-known works, and 
concluded that although man was probably not immortal, his "shell" or 
shadow, a mere conglomeration of thought forces, remained on earth behind 
him for some considerable time after his demise.  (See "After Death-What?" 
1909.)


London Dialectical Society : In 1869 an important enquiry into the phenomena 
of spiritualism was undertaken by the London Dialectical Society. A 
committee of more than thirty members-including Alfred Russel Wallace, 
Sergeant Cox, Charles Bradlaugh, H. G. Atkinson, and Dr. James Edmunds-was 
formed, and resolved itself into six sub-committees. During the eighteen 
months over which their' labours extended, the committee received a large 
quantity of evidence from believers in the phenomena, but very little from 
those antagonistic to the spirit hypothesis. In "The Dialectical Society's 
Report on Spiritualism," published by the Society, particulars are given 
both of the members' own experiences and of testimonies from witnesses whose 
character and position made their evidence valuable. Practically every form 
of manifestation, both physical and automatic, is covered in the report, 
which concluded thus:
     “In presenting their report, your Committee, taking into consideration 
the high character and great intelligence of many of the witnesses to the 
more extraordinary facts, the extent to which their testimony is supported 
by the reports of the sub-committees, and the absence of any proof of 
imposture or delusion as regards a large portion of the phenomena; and 
further, having regard to the exceptional character of the phenomena, and 
the large number of persons of every grade of society and over the whole 
civilised world who are more or less influenced by a belief in their 
supernatural origin, and to the fact that no philo-sophical explanation of 
them has yet been arrived at, deem it incumbent upon them to state their 
conviction that the subject is worthy of more serious attention and careful 
investigation than it has hitherto received."
     The Dialectical Society's investigations are noteworthy as the first 
organised attempt to elucidate the problem of spiritualistic phenomena.


Lopez, Senor Manoel : (See Spain.)


Lopoukine, Chevalier : A Russian theologian to whom is attributed a tract, 
said to be translated from the Russian and entitled Characteristics of the 
Interior Church (1801). His teaching is similar to that of Eckhartshausen 
whose work has elsewhere been briefly described-it is a kind of Christian 
transcendentalism and in its tenour, resembles the higher literature of the 
Graal.


Lords of the Flame or Children of the Fire Mist, are, according to 
theosophists, adepts sent from the planet Venus to aid terrestrial 
evolution.  It is necessary to explain that, in the evolution of the Solar 
System (q.v.) Venus is considerably in advance of the Earth, but by the 
efforts of these adepts directed towards intellectual development-the 
inhabitants of the earth are now really farther advanced than in ordinary 
course they would be. These adepts are not per-manently inhabitants of the 
Earth, and, while a few yet remain, most of them have returned whence they 
came, the time of crisis at which they assisted having now passed. (See 
Theosophy, Evolution, Chains.)


Lost Word of Kabbalism: Lost Word in Masonry. A word relating to some mystic 
plan, which though it is held to have disappeared, will at some time be 
restored, and will then make the whole system plain.  It is not really lost, 
only withheld for a season.  In the same way the Graal was not lost, but 
withdrawn to its own place and the search for it occupied the noblest 
figures in chivalry.  It repre-sents the Key to the enigma of Creation; in

Loudun, Nuns of : In the year 1633, the convent of Ursulines established at 
Loudun in France was the scene of an out-break of diabolical possession. The 
numerous nuns who inhabited the convent showed signs of diabolic possession, 
spoke with tongues. and behaved in the most extraordinary and hysterical 
manner. The affair grew in volume until practically all the nuns belonging 
to the institution were in the same condition of temporary insanity. The 
Mother Superior of the convent, Jeanne de Belfiel, appears to have been of 
hysterical temperament, and she was not long in infecting the other inmates 
of the institution.  She, with a sister named Claire and five other nuns, 
were the first to be obsessed by the so-called evil spirits. The outbreak 
spread to the neighbouring town and so scandalous did the whole affair 
become that Richelieu appointed a commission to examine into it.  The devils 
were subjected to the process of exorcism, which, however. proved to be 
fruitless in this instance. and the attacks of the nuns continued. But on a 
more imposing ceremony being held, they took themselves off, but only for a 
little while, returning again with greater violence than ever.  Suspicion, 
or rather injustice, fixed upon the person of Urbain Grandier (q.v.), 
confessor. of the convent, as the head and source of the whole affair.  He 
was arrested and accused of giving over the nuns to the possession of the 
Devil by means of the practice of sorcery. The truth is that the 
neighbouring clergy were madly jealous of Grandier because he had obtained 
two benefices in their diocese, of which lie was not a native, and they had 
made up their minds to compass his destruction at the first possible moment.  
Despite his protests of innocence, the unfortunate priest was haled before a 
council of judges of the neighbouring presidencies, who found upon his body 
the various marks which were the undoubted signs of a sorcerer, and it is 
said that the inquest brought to light the fact that Grandier had none too 
good a reputation. We must be very careful, however, to refrain from 
believing the worst about him, as the sources regarding this are undoubtedly 
tainted by religious prejudice. It is said that on his papers being seized 
much matter subversive of religious practice was found amongst them. They 
failed, however, to find that pact with Satan for which they had looked, 
although afterwards several versions of it were published by more or less 
credulous persons and sold as broadsheets. The unfortunate man was condemned 
to be burnt at the stake-a sentence which was duly carried out. After his 
death, however, the possession of the hysterical sisters did not cease ; the 
demons became more obstreperous than ever and flippantly answered to their 
names of Asmodeus, Leviathan, and Behemoth, and so forth. A very holy 
Brother called Surin was delegated to put an end to the affair. Frail and 
unhealthy, he possessed, however, an indomitable spirit, and after much 
wrestling in prayer succeeded in finally exorcising the demons. The whole 
affair is set forth in the Historie des Diables de Loudun, published in 
1839. which gave a detailed account of one of the most extraordinary 
obsessions of modern times.

Loyer, Pierre Le: Sieur de la Brosse, royal councillor and demonographer, 
was born at Huille in Anjou in 1550.  He was the author of a work entitled 
Discours et histoires des spectres, visions et apparitions des esprits, 
anges, demons et ames se montrant aux hommes.  The work is divided into 
eight books dealing with the marvellous visions and prodi-gies of all the 
centuries. and the most celebrated authors sacred as well as profane, who 
have dealt with occult sub-jects, the cause of apparitions, the nature of 
good and evil spirits, of demons, of ecstasy, of the essence, nature and 
origin of souls, of magicians and sorcerers, of the manner of their 
communication, of evil spirits, and of impostors It was published at Paris 
in 1605 in one quarto volume. The first book deals with spectres, 
apparitions and spirits; the second with the physics of Loyer's time, the 
illusions to which the senses are prone, wonders, the elixirs and 
metamorphases of sorceries and of philtres ; the third book establishes the 
degrees, grades and honours of spirits, gives a resume of the history of 
Philinnion and of Poly-crites, and recounts diverse adventures-with spectres 
and demons; the fourth book gives many examples of spectral appearances, of 
the speech of persons possessed of demons, of the countries and dwelling-
places of these spectres and demons, of marvellous portents, and so forth ; 
the fifth treats of the science of the soul, of its origin, nature, its 
state after death, and of haunting ghosts; the sixth division is entirely 
taken up with the apparition of souls, and shows how the happy do not return 
to earth, but only those whose souls are burning in purgatory; in the 
seventh book the case of the Witch of Endor, and the evocation of the soul 
of Samuel, are dealt with, as is evocation in general and the methods 
practised by wizards and sorcerers in this science ; the last book gives 
some account of exorcism, fumigations, prayers, and other methods of casting 
out devils, and the usual means employed by exorcists to destroy these.  The 
work as a whole is exceedingly curious if disputatious and a little dull in 
parts, and throws con-siderable light upon the occult science of the times.


Lubin : The fish whose gall was used by Tobias to restore his father's 
sight.  It is said to be very powerful against ophthalmia, and its heart is 
potent in driving away demons.


Lucifer: Literally light-bringer, a name applied to the con-ception of the 
devil, who has often been likened to a fallen star or angel. The Miltonic 
conception of Lucifer as a force potent for good or evil, one who might have 
done good greatly, intensely proud and powerful exceedingly, is one which is 
inconsistent with enlightenment.  He represents simply the absence of good; 
a negative not a positive entity.
      He presides over the east, according to the ideas of the old 
magicians.  He was invoked on Mondays, in a circle in the centre of which 
was his name.  As the price of his complaisance in appearing to the magician 
he asked only a mouse.  Lucifer commands Europeans and Asiatics. He appears 
in the shape of a beautiful child.  When he is angry his face is flushed, 
but there is nothing monstrous about him.  He is, according to some students 
of demon-ology, the grand justiciary of Hades.  He is the first to be 
invoked in the litanies of the Sabbath.  (See Devil-worship.)


Lugh : In Irish romance, son of Kian, and father of Cuchulain. He was 
brought up by his uncle Goban, the Smith, and by Duach, King of Fairyland. 
It was prophesied of Lugh that he should eventually overcome his father's 
old enemy Balor, his own grandfather. So instead of killing the three 
murderers of his father, Kian, he put them on oath to obtain certain 
wonders, including the magical spear of the King of " Persia" and the pig-
skin of the King of Greece, which, if laid on a patient, would heal him of 
his wound or cure him of his sickness. Thus equipped, Lugh entered the 
Battle of Moytura, against the Fomorians, and by hurling a stone which 
pierced through the eye to the brain of Balor, fulfilled the druidic 
prophecy.  Lugh was the Irish Sun-god; his final conquest of the Fomorians 
and their leader symbolises the victory of light and intellect over 
darkness.  Balor was god of darkness, and brute force as embodied in the 
Fomorians. By his title of Ildanach, or " All Craftsman," Lugh is comparable 
to the Greek Apollo. He was widely worshipped by Continental Celts.


Lully, Raymond: The life of this alchemist was a curious and eventful one, 
and all its diverse chapters bespeak him a man of titanic physical and 
mental energy, quite incapable of doing anything in dilettante fashion, but 
instead throw-ing himself heart and soul into every quest which chanced to 
appeal to him.  Raymond's father was a Spanish knight, who, having won the 
approval of John I.. King of Arragon. was granted an estate in Majorca; and 
it was in that island of the Balearic group that the future alchemist was 
born, probably in the year 1229. but the date is uncertain. Thanks to the 
royal favour which his father enjoyed, Raymond was appointed Seneschal of 
the Isles while he was still a mere youth; but hardly had he acquired this 
position ere, much to the chagrin of his parents, he began to show a strong 
predilection for debauchery.  He paid amorous addresses to women of all 
sorts, while at length. becoming enamoured of a married lady named Eleonora 
de Castello, he began to follow her wherever she went, making no attempt to 
conceal his illicit passion.  On one occasion, indeed, he actually sought 
the lady while she was attend-ing mass. And, so loud was the outcry against 
this bold, if not sacrilegious act, that Eleonora found it essential to 
write in peremptory style to her cavaliere servente, bidding him desist from 
his present course.  The letter failed to cool the youth's ardour, but anon, 
when it transpired that the lady was smitten with the deadly complaint of 
cancer, her admirer's frame of mind began to alter speedily. Sobered by the 
frustration of his hopes, he vowed that henceforth he would live 
differently, consecrating his days to the service of God.
     So Raymond espoused holy orders, but, as was natural in the case of a 
man of such active and impetuous tempera-ment, he felt small inclination for 
monastic life. His aim was to carry the Gospel far afield, converting the 
children of Mahomet, and with this in view he began to study
Arabic; while having mastered that tongue he proceeded to Rome, eager to 
enlist the Pope's sympathy in his project. Raymond failed in the latter 
particular, yet, nothing daunted he embarked on his own account at Genoa 
about the yeas 1291, and having reached Tunis he commenced his crusade. His 
ardour resulted in his being fiercely persecuted and ultimately banished so 
perforce he returned for a while to Europe, visiting Paris, Naples and Pisa, 
and exhorting all good Christians to aid his beloved enterprise.  But in 
1308 he ventured to go back to Africa, and at Algiers he made a host of 
converts, yet was once more forced to fly for his life before the angry 
Mussulmans.  He repaired to Tunis, thinking to escape thence to Italy, but 
his former activities in the town were remembered, and consequently he was 
seized and thrown into prison.  Here he languished for a long time, never 
failing to seize every opportunity which presented itself of preaching the 
gospel, but at last some Genoese merchants contrived to procure his release, 
and so he sailed back to Italy.  Proceeding to Rome, he made further and 
strenuous efforts towards obtaining the Pope's support of a well-equipped 
foreign mission; but Raymond's importunity herein proved abortive, and, 
after resting for a brief space at his native Majorca, the heroic zealot 
took his life in his hands, and returned to Tunis.  Here he even pro-claimed 
his presence publicly, but scarcely had he begun preaching when he reaped 
the inevitable harvest, and after being savagely attacked he was left lying 
on the sea-shore, his assailants imagining him dead.  He was still 
breathing, however, when some Genoese found him, and carrying him to a ship 
they set sail for Majorca.  But the missionary did not rally, and he died 
while in sight of his home, the date being 1315.
     Raymond's  proselytising ardour had made his name familiar throughout 
Europe, and, while many people regarded him as a heretic because he had 
undertaken a mission without the pope's sanction, there were others who 
admired him so much that they sought to make him a saint.  But he was never 
canonized, and the reason, per-haps, lay in the well-known fact that he had 
engaged in alchemy.  He is reported to have made a large sum of gold for the 
English king, and, while there is really no proof that he ever visited 
Britain, the remaining part of the story holds a certain significance.  For 
it is said that Lully made the money on the strict understanding that it 
should be utilised for equipping a large and powerful band of missionaries, 
and the likelihood is that he thought to. employ his chymical skill on 
behalf of his beloved object, and approached some European Sovereign with 
this in view, thus giving rise to the tradition about his dealings with the 
English monarch.  Be that as it may, Raymond's voluminous writings certainly 
include a number of aichem--istic works, notably Alchimia Magic Naturalis, 
De Aquis Super Accurtationes, De Secretis Medicina Magna and De 
Conservatione Vitae; and it is interesting to find that several of these won 
considerable popularity and were-repeatedly reprinted, while so late as 1673 
two volumes of Opera Alchima purporting to be from Raymond's pen were issued 
at London.  Five years before this a biography by Vernon had been published 
at Paris, while at a later date a German historian of chemistry, Gruelin, 
referred to Lully as a scientist of exceptional skill, and mentioned him as 
the first man to distil rosemary oil.

Luminous Bodies  Dead bodies are frequently supposed to glow in the dark 
with a sort of phosphorescent light. Possibly the belief arose from the idea 
that the soul was like a fire dwelling in the body.


Luther, Martin : The Rosicrucian.  (See Rosicrucians.)


Lutin, The : The Lutin of Normandy in many respects resembled Robin 
Goodfellow.  Like him he had many names and like him had the power of 
assuming many forms. but the Lutin's pranks were usually of a more serious 
nature than those of the tricky spirit of Merrie England.  Many a man laid 
his ruin at the Lutin's door, although it must be confessed that in these 
cases neighbours were uncharitable enough to say, that the Lutin had less to 
do with it than habits of Want-of-Thrift and Self-Indulgence. Thus, on 
market days, when a farmer lingered late over his ale, whether in driving a 
close bargain or in enjoying the society of a boon companion, he declared 
the Lutin was sure to play him some spiteful trick on his way home his horse 
would stumble-he would be thrown-he would lose his purse-or else his way.  
If the farmer persisted in these habits, more serious would become the 
Lutin's tricks; the sheep-pens would be unfastened, the cow-house and stable 
doors left open, and the flocks and cattle be found moving among the 
standing corn and unmown hay; while every servant on the farm would swear to 
his own innocence, and unhesitatingly lay the blame on the Lutin. Similar 
tricks were played on the fishermen by the Nain Rouge-another name for the 
Lutin. He opened the meshes of the nets and set the fish free ; he removed 
the floats and let the nets sink to the bottom, or the sinkers, and let the 
nets float away on the retiring tide.  True, if closely questioned, the 
fishermen would confess that on these occasions the night was dark and 
stormy, the botby warm, and the grog plentiful, and that instead of drawing 
their nets at the proper time, they had delayed it till morn-mg.  Again, he 
would appear like a black nag, ready bridled and saddled, quietly feeding by 
the way-side; but woe to the luckless wight who mounted him !-unless, 
indeed, he did so for some charitable or holy purpose, in which case he was 
borne with the speed of the wind to his destination.  In this form the Lutin 
played his wildest pranks and was called Le Cheval Bayard.


Lux : (See Spain.)


Lycanthropy : The transformation of a human being into an animal.  The term 
is derived from the Greek words, lukos a wolf, and anthropos a man, but it 
is employed regarding a transformation into any animal shape.  It is chiefly 
in these countries where wolves are numerous that we find such tales 
concerning them. (See Wer-wolf.) But in India, and some parts of Asia, the 
tiger takes the place of the wolf; in Russia and elsewhere the bear, and in 
Africa the leopard.
It is usually savage animals regarding which these beliefs are prevalent, 
but even harmless ones also figure in them. There is considerable confusion 
as to whether such trans-formations were voluntary, or involuntary, 
temporary or permanent.  The man as transformed into the animal may be the 
very individual himself, or, on the other hand may be only his double, that 
is his spirit may enter the animal and his body remain unchanged.  Magicians 
and witches were credited with the power of transforming themselves into 
wolves and other animal shapes, and it was asserted that if the animal were 
wounded that the marks of the wound would be discovered upon the wizard's 
body.
     The belief is current amongst many savage tribes that every individual 
possesses an animal form which he enters at death, or at will.  This is 
effected either by magic or natural agency.
     As has been said, the wolf is a common form of animal transformation in 
Europe.  In ancient Greece the belief was associated with the dog, which 
took the place of the wolf. Other similar beliefs are found in India and 
Java and in the former country we find the wer-wolf in a sort of vampire 
form.
     Guyon relates the history of an enchanter who used to change himself 
into different beasts.
     "Certain people," said he, "persuaded Ferdinand, first Emperor of that 
name, to command the presence of a Polish enchanter and magician in the town 
of Nuremberg to learn the result of a difference he had with the Turks, 
concerning the kingdom of Hungary; and not only did the magician make use of 
divination, but performed various other marvels, so that the king did not 
wish to see him, but the courtiers introduced him into his chamber.  There 
he did many wonderful things, among others, he transformed himself into a 
horse, anointing himself with some grease, then he took the shape of an ox, 
and thirdly that of a lion, all in less than an hour. The emperor was so 
terrified by these transformations that he commanded that the magician 
should be immediately dismissed, and declined to hear the future from the 
lips of such a rascal."
     “It need no longer be doubted," adds the same writer, "that Lucius 
Apuleius Plato was a sorcerer, and that he was transformed into an ass, 
forasmuch as he was charged with it before the proconsul of Africa, in the 
time of the Emperor Antonine I., in the year 150 A.D., as Apollonius of 
Tyana, long before, in the year 60, was charged before Domitian with the 
same crime.  And more than three years after, the rumour persisted to the 
time of St. Augus-tine, who was an African, who has written and confirmed 
it; as also in his time the father of one Prestantius was transformed into a 
horse, as the said Prestantius declared. Augustine's father having died, in 
a short time the son had wasted the greater part of his inheritance in the 
pursuit of the magic arts, and in order to flee poverty he sought to marry a 
rich widow named Pudentille, for such a long time that at length she 
consented. Soon after her only son and heir, the child of her former 
marriage, died. These things came about in a manner which led people to 
think that he had by means of magic entrapped Pudentille, who had been wooed 
in vain by several illustrious people, in order to obtain the wealth of her 
son. It was also said that the profound knowledge he possessed-for he was 
able to solve difficult questions which left other men bewildered-was 
obtained from a demon or familiar spirit he possessed. Further, certain 
people said they had seen him do many marvellous things, such as making 
himself invisible, transforming himself into a horse or into a bird, 
piercing his body with a sword without wounding himself, and similar per-
formances. He was at last accused by one Sicilius OEmilia-nus, the censor, 
before Claudius Maximus, proconsul of Africa, who was said to be a 
Christian; but nothing was found against him.
     Now, that he had been transformed into an ass, St. Augustine regards as 
indubitable, he having read it in cer-tain true and trustworthy authors, and 
being besides of the same country; and this transformation happened to him 
in Thessaly before he was versed in magic, through the spell of a sorceress, 
who sold him, and who recovered him to his former shape after he had served 
in the capacity of an ass for some years, having the same powers and habits 
of eating and braying as other asses, but with a mind still sane and 
reasonable as he himself attested. And at last to show forth his case, and 
to lend probability to the rumour, he wrote a book entitled The Golden Ass, 
a melange of fables and dialogues, to expose the vices of the men of his 
time, which he had heard of, or seen, during his transformation, with many 
of the labours and troubles he had suffered while in the shape of an ass.
     “However that may be, St. Augustine in the book of the City of God, 
book XVIII., chapters XVII. and XVIII., relates that in his time there were 
in the Alps certain sorceresses who gave a particular kind of cheese to the 
passers by, who, on partaking of it, were immediately changed into asses or 
other beasts of burden, and were made to carry heavy weights to certain 
places. When their task was over, they were permitted to regain their human 
shape."
     “The bishop of Tyre, historian, writes that in his time, probably about 
1220, some Englishmen were sent by their king to the aid of the Christians 
who were fighting in the Holy Land, and that on their arrival in a haven of 
the island of Cyprus a sorceress transformed a young English soldier into an 
ass.  He, wishing to return to his com-panions in the ship, was chased away 
with blows from a stick, whereupon he returned to the sorceress who made use 
of him, until someone noticed that the ass kneeled in a church and did 
various other things which only a reasoning being could do. The sorceress 
who followed him was taken on suspicion before the authorities, was obliged 
to give him his human form three years after his transforma-tion, and was 
forthwith executed."
      "We read," says Loys Guyon, "that Ammonius, a peripatetic philosopher, 
about the time of Lucius 
Sep-timius Severus, in the year 196 A.D., had present at his lessons an ass 
whom he taught. I should think that this ass had been at one time a man, and 
that he quite under-stood what Ammonius taught, for these transformed 
persons retain their reason unimpaired, as St. Augustine and other writers 
have assured us."
     “Fulgose writes, book VIII., chapter II., that in the time of Pope 
Leon, who lived about the year 930, there were in Germany two sorceresses 
who used thus to change their guests into beasts, and on one occasion she 
changed a young mountebank into an ass, who, preserving his human 
understanding, gave a great deal of amusement to the passers-by. A neighbour 
of the sorceresses bought the ass at a good price, but was warned by them 
that he must not take the beast to a river, or he would lose it. Now the ass 
escaped one day and running to a near-by lake plunged into the water, when 
he returned to his own shape. Apuleirs says that he regained his human form 
by eating roses.
     “There are still to be seen in Egypt asses which are led into the 
market-place to perform various feats of agility and tricks, understanding 
all the commands they receive, and executing them: such as to point out the 
most beauti-ful woman of the company, and many other things that one would 
hardly believe; and Belon, a physician, relates in his observations that lie 
has seen them, and others also, who have been there, and who have affirmed 
the same to me."
     “One day there was brought to St. Macarius, the Egyptian," says Calmet, 
"an honest woman who had been transformed into a mare by the wicked art of a 
magician. Her husband and all who beheld her believed that she had really 
been changed into a mare.  This woman remained for three days without taking 
any food, whether suitable for a horse or for a human being. She was brought 
to the priests of the place, who could suggest no remedy. So they led her to 
the cell of St. Macarius, to whom God had revealed that she was about to 
come. His disciples wished to send her away, thinking her a mare, and they 
warned the saint of her approach, and the reason for her journey. He said to 
them: ' It is you who are the animals, who think you see that which is not; 
this woman is not changed, but your eyes are bewitched." As he spoke he 
scattered holy water on the head of the woman, and all those present saw her 
in her true shape.  He had something given her to eat and sent her away safe 
and sound with her husband."


Lytton, Bulwer : Author (1803-1873). According to his baptismal certificate, 
the full name of this once famous author was Edward George Earle Lytton 
Bulwer-Lytton, and in signing some of his early writings he used all these 
names with occasional variations in their order, an act which was regarded 
by many people as springing from pride and pompousness, and which elicited 
the withering satire of Thackeray in Punch.  Lytton was born at London in 
1803, and his father was a Norfolk squire, Bulwer of Heydon Hall; while his 
mother was Elizabeth Barbara Lytton, a lady who claimed kinship with 
Cadwaladr Vendigaid, the semi-mythical hero who led the Strathclyde Welsh 
against the Angles in the seventh century. As a child the future novelist 
was delicate, but he learnt to read at a surprisingly early age, and began 
to write verses before he was ten years old.  Going first to a small private 
school at Fulham, he soon passed on to another one at Rottingdean; and here 
he continued to manifest literary tastes, Byron and Scott being his chief 
idols at this time.  So clever was the boy thought, indeed, that his 
relations decided it would be a mistake to send him to a public school; and 
accordingly he was placed with a tutor at Ealing, under whose care he pro-
gressed rapidly with his studies. Thereafter he proceeded to Cambridge, 
where he took his degree easily; and won many academic laurels, while on 
leaving the University he travelled for a while in Scotland and in France, 
and then bought a commission in the army.  He sold it soon after-wards, 
however, while in 1827 he was married, and now he began to devote himself 
seriously to writing, his first publications of note being the novels of 
Falkland, Pelkam and Eugene Aram. These won an instant success, and placed 
considerable wealth in the author's hands, the result being that in 1831 he 
entered parliament as liberal member for St. Ives, Huntingdonshire; and 
during the next ten years he was an active politician yet found time to 
produce a host of stories, for instance The Last Days of Pompei and Ernest 
Maltravers, Zanoni and The Last of the Barons. These were followed shortly 
by The Cartons, and simul-taneously Lytton achieved some fame as a 
dramatist, perhaps his best play being The Lady of Lyons; while in 1851 he 
was instrumental in founding a scheme for pen-sioning authors, in 1862 he 
increased his reputation greatly by his novel entitled A Strange Story, and 
four years later his services to literature and politics were rewarded by a 
peerage.  He now began to work at yet another story, Kenelm Chillingly, but 
his health was beginning to fail, and he died in 1873 at Torquay.
     The works cited above constitute but a fragment of Lytton's voluminous 
achievement. Besides further novels too numerous to mention, he issued 
several volumes of verses notably Ismael and The New Union, while he did 
trans-lations from German, Spanish and Italian, he produced a history of 
Athens, he contributed to endless periodicals, and was at one time editor of 
The New Monthly Magazine. But albeit so busy throughout the whole of his 
career, and while winning vast fame and opulence, Lytton's life was not 
really a happy one, various causes conducing to make it otherwise. Long 
before meeting his wife he fell in love with a young girl who died 
prematurely, and this loss seems to have left an indelible scar on his 
heart, while his marriage was anything but a successful one, the pair being 
divorced comparatively soon after their union. Now as a mere child Lytton 
had evinced a predilection for mysticism, while he had surprised his mother 
once by asking her whether she was "not sometimes overcome by the sense of 
her own identity" (almost exactly the same question was put to his nurse in 
boyhood by another mystic, William Bell Scott) ; Lytton sedulously developed 
his leaning towards the occult, and it is everywhere manifest in his 
literary output.  It transpires, for example, in his poem The Tale of a 
Dreamer, and again in Kenelm Chillingly, while in A Strange Story he tries 
to give a scientific colouring to old-fashioned magic; but neither this 
essay nor those others are really to be called triumphant in the artistic 
sense, and, as Sir Leslie Stephen shrewdly observes, Lytton's " attempts at 
the mysterious too often remind us of spirit-rapping rather than excite the 
thrill of super-natural awe."  In a word Lytton's outlook on life was 
theatrical and his mysticism was not a little stagey.

Madre Natura : An old and powerful secret society, of Italy, who worshipped 
and idealised nature, and which seems to have been founded by members of the 
ancient Italian priesthood.  It had a tradition that one of the Popes as 
Cardinal de Medici became a member of the fraternity, and for this there is 
good documentary evidence.  It accepted the allegorical interpretation which 
the Neo-Platonists had placed upon the Pagan creeds during the first ages of 
Christianity.


Magi : Priests of ancient Persia, and the cultivators of the wisdom of 
Zoroaster. They were instituted by Cyrus when he founded the new Persian

(Philosophy of History), "they were not so much a hereditary sacerdotal 
caste as an order or association, divided into various and successive ranks 
and grades, such as existed in the mysteries - the grade of apprenticeship-
that of mastership--that of perfect mastership."  In short, they were a 
theosophical college ; and either its professors were indifferently" magi," 
or magicians, and " wise men" or they were distinguished into two classes by 
those names.  Their name pronounced "Mogh" by the modern Persians, and 
"Magh" by the ancients signified " Wise," and such is the interpretation of 
it given by the Greek and Roman writers.  Stobaeus expressly calls the 
science of the magi, the service of the gods, so Plato.  According to 
Ennemoser, " Magiusiah, Madschusie, signified the office and knowledge of 
the priest, who was called " Mag, Magius, Magiusi," and after-wards magi and 
" Magician."  Brucker maintains that the primitive meaning of the word is ' 
fire worshipper," worship of the light," an erroneous opinion.  In the 
modern Persian the word is " Meg," and " Mogbed" signifies high priest.  The 
high priest of the Parsees at Surat, even at the present day, is called, " 
Mobed."  Others derive the word from ' Megh," " Meb-ab" signifying something 
which is great and noble, and Zoroaster's disciples were called " 
Meghestom."  Salverte states that these Mobeds are still named in the Pehivi 
dialect " They were divided into three classes :-Those who abstained from 
all animal food ; those who never ate of the flesh of any tame animals; and 
those who made no scruple to eat any kind of meat.  A belief in the transmi-
gration of the soul was the foundation of this abstinence. They professed 
the science of divination, and for that purpose met together and consulted 
in their temples. They professed to make truth the great object of their 
study; for that alone, they said, can make man like God "whose body 
resembles light, as his soul or spirit resembles truth."  They condemned all 
images, and those who said that the gods are male and female; they had 
neither temples nor altars, but worshipped the sky, as a represen-tative of 
the Deity, on the tops of mountains; they also sacrificed to the sun, moon, 
earth, fire, water, and winds, says Herodotus, meaning, no doubt that they 
adored the heavenly bodies and the elements.  This was probably before the 
time of Zoroaster, when the religion of Persia seems to have resembled that 
of ancient India.  Their hymns in praise of the Most High exceeded, 
according to Dio Chrysostom, the sublimity of anything in Homer or Hesiod.  
They exposed their dead bodies to wild beasts. It is a question "whether the 
old Persian doctrine and wisdom or tradition of light did not undergo 
material alterations in the hands of its Median restorer, Zoroaster or 
whether this doctrine was preserved in all its purity by the order of the 
magi."  He then remarks that on them devolved the important trust of the 
monarch's education, which must necessarily have given them great weight and 
influence in the state.  They were in high credit at the Persian gates "-for 
that was the Oriental name given to the capital of the empire, and the abode 
of the prince-and they took the most active part in all the factions that 
encompassed the throne, or that were formed in the vicinity of the court.  
In Greece, and even in Egypt, the sacerdotal fraternities and associations 
of initiated, formed by the mysteries, had in general but an indirect, 
though not unimportant influence on affairs of state; but in the Persian 
monarchy they acquired a complete political ascendency.  Religion, 
philosophy, and the sciences were all in their bands, they were the 
universal physicians who healed the sick in body and in spirit, and, in 
strict con-sistency with that character, ministered to the state, which is 
only the man again in a larger sense. The three grades of the magi alluded 
to are called by Herber the " disciples,'.' the" professed," and the" 
masters."  They were originally from Bactria, where they governed a little 
state by laws of their own choice, and by their incorporation in the Persian 
empire, they greatly promoted the consolidation of the conquests of Cyrus, 
Their fall dates from the reign of Darius Hystaspes, about 500 B.C., by whom 
they were fiercely persecuted; this produced an emigration which extended to 
Cappadocia on the one hand, and to India on the other, but they were still 
of so much consideration at a later period, as to provoke the jealousy of 
Alexander the Great.  (See Persia.)


Magla Posthuma : A short treatise on Vampirism published at Olmutz in 1706, 
and written by Ferdinand de Schertz. Reviewing it Calmet (q.v.) says in his 
Dissertation on Vampires:  "The author relates a story of a woman that died 
in a certain village, after having received all the sacra-ments, and was 
buried with the usual ceremonies, in the Churchyard.  About four days after 
her death, the inhabi-tants of the village were affrighted with an uncommon 
noise and outcry, and saw' a spectre, sometimes in the shape of a dog, and 
sometimes in that of a man, which appeared to great multitudes of people, 
and put them to excessive pain by squeezing their throats, and pressing 
their breasts, almost to suffocation. There were several whose bodies he 
bruised all over, and reduced them to the utmost weak-ness, so that they 
grew pale, lean, and disfigured.  His fury was sometimes so great as not to 
spare the very beasts, for cows were frequently found beat to the earth, 
half dead ; at other times with their tails tied to one another, and their 
hideous lowings sufficiently expressed the pain they felt.  Horses were 
often found almost wearied to death, foaming with sweat, and out of breath, 
as if they had been running a long and tiresome race; and these calamities 
continued for several months."
     The author of the treatise examines into the subject in the capacity of 
a lawyer, and discusses both the matter of fact and the points of law 
arising from it.  He is clearly of opinion that if the suspected person was 
really the author of these noises, disturbances, and acts of cruelty, the 
law will justify the burning of the body, as is practised in the case of 
other spectres which come again and molest the living.  He relates also 
several stories of apparitions of this sort, and particularises the 
mischiefs done by them. One, among others, is of a herdsman of the village 
of Blow near the town of Kadam in Bohemia, who appeared for a considerable 
time together, and called upon Several persons, who all died within eight 
days.  At last, the inhabitants of Blow dug up the herdsman's body, and 
fixed it in the ground, with a stake driven through it.  The man, even in 
this condition, laughed at the people that were em-ployed about him, and 
told them they were very obliging to furnish him with a stick to defend 
himself from the dogs. me same night he extricated himself from the stake, 
frightened several persons by appearing to them, and occasioned the death of 
many more than he had hitherto done.  He was then delivered into the hands 
of the hang-man, who put him into a cart, in order to burn him without the 
town.  As they went along, the carcass shrieked in the most hideous manner, 
and threw about its arms and legs, as if it had been alive, and upon being 
again run through with a stake, it gave a loud cry, and a great quantity of 
fresh, florid blood issued from the wound.  At last the body was burnt to 
ashes, and this execution put a final stop to the spectres appearing and 
infesting the village.
     The same method has been practised in other places, where these 
apparitions have been seen and upon taking them out of the ground, their 
bodies have seemed fresh and florid, their limbs pliant and flexible, 
without any worms or putrefaction, but not without a great stench. The 
author quotes several other writers, who attest what he relates concerning 
these spectres, which, he says, still appear in the mountains of Silesia and 
Moravia.  They are seen, it seems, both by day and night, and the things 
which formerly belonged to them are observed to stir and change their place, 
without any person's being seen to touch them. And the only remedy in these 
cases, is to cut off the head, and burn the body of the persons that are 
supposed to appear.


Magic  Short for " magic art," from Greek magein the science and religion of 
the priests of Zoroaster ; or, accord-ing to Skeat, from Greek megas, great, 
thus signifying the
“great " science.
     History.-The earliest traces of magical practice are found in the 
European caves of the middle Paleolithic Age. These belong to the last 
interglacial period of the Pleistocene period, which has been named the 
Aurignacian, after the cave-dwellers of Aurignac, whose skeletons, artifacts 
and drawings link them with the Bushmen of South Africa. In the cave of 
Gargas, near Bagneres de Luchon, occur, in addition to spirited and 
realistic drawings of animals, numer-ous imprints of human hands in various 
stages of mutilation. Some hands had been first smeared with a sticky 
substance and then pressed on the rock; others had been held in position to 
be dusted round with red ochre, or black pig-ment.  Most of the imprinted 
hands have mutilated fingers; in some cases the first and second joints of 
one or more fingers are wanting; in others the stumps only of all fingers 
remain.  A close study of the hand imprints makes it evident that they are 
not to be regarded as those of lepers.  There can be little doubt that the 
joints were removed for a specific purpose, and on this point there is 
general agreement among anthropologists.  A clue to the mystery is obtained 
by the magical custom among the Bushmen of similarly removing finger joints.  
Mr. G. W. Stow in his The Native Races of South Africa makes refer-ence to 
this strange form of sacrifice.  He once came into contact with a number of 
Bushmen who "had all lost the first joint of the little finger" which had 
been removed with a " stone knife" with purpose to ensure a safe journey to 
the spirit world.  Another writer tells of an old Bushman woman whose little 
fingers of both hands had been mutilated, three joints in all having been 
removed. She explained that each joint had been sacrificed as a daughter 
died to express her sorrow.  No doubt, however, there was a deeper meaning 
in the custom than she cared to confess.  F. Boas in his Report on the N. W. 
Tribes of Canada gives evidence of the custom among these peoples. When 
frequent deaths resulted from disease, the Canadian Indians were wont to 
sacrifice the joints of their little fingers so as, they explained, "to cut 
off the deaths." Among the Indian Madigas (Telugu Pariahs) the evil eye is 
averted by sacrificers who dip their hands in the blood of goats or sheep 
and impress them on either side of a house door.  This custom is not unknown 
even to Brahmans. Impressions of hands are also occasionally seen on the 
walls of Indian Mohammedan mosques. As among the N.W. Canadian tribes, the 
hand ceremony is most frequently practised in India when epidemics make a 
heavy toll of lives.  The Bushmen also remove finger joints when stricken 
with sickness.  In Australia, where during initia-tion ceremonies the young 
men have teeth knocked out and bodies scarred, the women of some tribes 
mutilate the little fingers of daughters with purpose to influence their 
future careers.  Apparently the finger chopping customs of Paleolithic times 
had a magical significance.  On some of the paintings in the Aurignacian 
caves appear symbols which suggest the slaying with spears and cutting up of 
animals.  Enigmatical signs are another feature.  Of special interest are 
the figures of animal-headed demons, some with hands upraised in the 
Egyptian attitude of adoration, and others apparently dancing like the 
animal-headed dancing gods of the Bushmen.  In the Marsonlas Paleolithic 
cave there are semi-human faces of angry demons with staring eyes and 
monstrous noses.  In the Spanish Cave at Cogul several figures of women 
wearing half-length skirts and shoulder shawls, are represented dancing 
round a nude male.  So closely do these females resemble such as usually 
appear in Bushmen paintings that they might well, but for their location, be 
credited to this interesting people.  Religious dances among the Bushman 
tribes are associated with marriage, birth and burial ceremonies ; they are 
also performed to exorcise demons in cases of sickness.  " Dances are to us 
what prayers are to you," an elderly Bushman once informed a European.  
whether the cave drawings and wood, bone and ivory carvings of the 
Magdalenian, or late Paleolithic period at the close of the last ice epoch, 
are of magical significance is a problem on which there is no general agree-
ment.  It is significant to find, however, that several carved ornaments 
bearing animal figures or enigmatical signs are perforated as if worn as 
charms.  On a piece of horn found at Lorthet, Hautes Pyrenees, are beautiful 
incised drawings of reindeer and salmon, above which appear mystical 
symbols.  An ape-like demon carved on bone was found at Mas d'Azil: on a 
reindeer horn from Laugerie Basse a prostrate man with a tail is creeping up 
on all fours towards a grazing bison.  These are some of the instances which 
lend colour to the view that late Paleolithic art had its origin in magical 
beliefs and practices-that hunters
carved on the handles of weapons and implements, or scratched on cave walls, 
the images of the animals they desired to capture-sometimes with the secured 
co-opera-tion of demons, and sometimes with the aid of magical spells.
     Coming to historic times we know that the ancient Egyptians (See Egypt) 
possessed a highly-developed magical system, as did the Babylonians (See 
Semites), and other pristine civilisations.  Indeed from these the medieval 
European system of magic was finally evolved.  Greece and Rome (both of 
which see) also possessed distinct national systems, which in some measure 
were branches of their religions; and thus like the Egyptian and Babylonian 
were preserves of the priesthood.
     Magic in early Europe was, of course, merely an appen-dage of the 
various religious systems which obtained throughout that continent ; and it 
was these systems which later generated into witchcraft (q.v.)  But upon the 
foundation of Christianity, the church soon began to regard the practice of 
magic as foreign to the spirit of its religion. Thus the Thirty-sixth Canon 
of the (Ecumenical Council held at Laodicea in 364 A.D. forbids clerks and 
priests to become magicians, enchanters, mathematicians or astrolo-gers.  It 
orders. moreover, that the Church shall expel from its bosom those who 
employ ligatures or phylacteries. because it says phylacteries are the 
prisons of the soul.  The Fourth Canon of the Council of Oxia, A.D. 525, 
prohibited the consultation of sorcerers, augurs, diviners, and divina-tions 
made with wood or bread; and the Sixtieth Canon of the Council of 
Constantinople A.D. 692, excommunicated for a period of six years diviners, 
and those who had recourse to them.  The prohibition was repeated by the 
Council of Rome in 721.  The Forty-second Canon of the Council of Tours in 
6s 3 is to the effect that the priests shall teach to the people the 
inefficacy of magical practices to restore the health of men or animals, and 
later Councils practically endorsed the church's earlier views.
     It does not appear, however, that what may be called " medieval magic" 
took final and definite shape until about the twelfth century.  Modelled 
upon the systems in vogue among the Byzantines and Moors of Spain, which 
were evolved from the Alexandrian system 
(See Neopla-tonism), what might be called the " oriental" type of magic 
gained footing in Europe, and quite superseded the earlier and semi-
barbarian systems in use among the various countries of that continent, most 
of which, as has been said, were the relics of older pagan practice and 
ritual.  To these relics clung the witch and the wizard and the pro-fessors 
of lesser magic ; whereas among the disciples of the imported system we find 
the magician-black and white,-the necromancer and the sorcerer. The manner 
in which the theosophy and the magic of the East was imported was probably 
two-fold ; first, there is good evidence that it was imported into Europe by 
persons returning from the Crusades; and secondly, we know that in matters 
of wisdom, Byzantium fell heir to Alexandria, and that from Constantinople 
magic was disseminated throughout Europe. along with other sciences.  It is 
not necessary to deal in the course of this article with the history of 
witchcraft and lesser sorcery, as that has already been done in the article 
witchcraft " (q.v.) ; and we will confine ourselves strictly to the history 
of the higher branches of magic.  But it is competent to remark that Europe 
had largely obtained its pneumotology from the orient through Christianity, 
from Jewish and early Semitic sources; and it is an open question how far 
eastern demonology coloured that of the Catholic Church.
     Medieval magic of the higher type has practically no landmarks save a 
series of great names.  Its tenets ex-perienced but Little alteration during 
six centuries.  From the eighth to the thirteenth century. there does not 
appear to have been much persecution of the professors of magic. but after 
that period the opinions of the church underwent a radical change, and the 
life of the magus was fraught with considerable danger.  However, it is 
pretty clear that he was not victimised in the same manner as his lesser 
brethren, the sorcerers and wizards; but we find Paracelsus con-sistently 
baited by the medical profession of his day, Agrippa constantly persecuted, 
and even mystics like Boehme imprisoned and ill-used.  It is difficult at 
this distance to estimate the enormous vogue that magic experienced, whether 
for good or evil during the middle ages. Although severely punished, if 
discovered or if its pro-fessors became sufficiently notorious to court 
persecution, the power it seems to have conferred upon them was eagerly 
sought by scores of people-the majority of whom were quite unfitted for its 
practice, and clumsily betrayed themselves into the hands of the 
authorities.  In the article  entitled " Black  Magic," we have  outlined 
the history of that lesser magic known as sorcery or" black magic," and 
there have shown what persecutions overtook those who practised it.
     As has already been mentioned, the history of higher magic in Europe is 
a matter of great names, and these are somewhat few. They do not include 
alchemists, who are strictly speaking not magicians, as their application of 
arcane laws was particular and not universal; but this is not to say that 
some alchemists were not also magicians. The two great names which stand out 
in the history of European magic are those of Paracelsus and Agrippa, who 
formulated  the science of medieval magic in  its entirety. They were also 
the greatest practical magicians of the middle ages, as apart from pure 
mystics, alchemists and others, and their thaumaturgic and necromantic ex-
periences were probably never surpassed. With these medieval magic comes to 
a close and the further history of the science in Europe will be found 
outlined in the division of this article entitled " Modern Magic."
     Scientific Theories regarding the Nature of Magic.-General agreement as 
to the proper definition of magic is wanting, as it depends upon the view 
taken of religious belief. According to Frazer, magic and religion are one 
and the same thing, or are so closely allied as to be almost identical. This 
may be true of peoples in a savage or barbarian condition of society, but 
can scarcely apply to magic and religion as fully fledged, as for example in 
medie-val times, however fundamental may be their original unity. The 
objective theory of magic would regard it as entirely distinct from 
religion, possessed of certain well-marked attributes, and traceable to 
mental processes differing from those from which the religious idea springs.  
Here and there the two have become fused by the superimposition of religious 
upon magical practice.  The objective idea of magic, in short, rests on the 
belief that it is based on magical laws which are supposed to operate with 
the regularity of those of natural science. The subjective view, on the 
other hand, is that many practices seemingly magical are in reality 
religious. and that no rite can be called magical which is not so designated 
by its celebrant or agent.  It has been said that religion consists of an 
appeal to the gods, whereas magic is the attempt to force their compliance.  
Messrs. Hubert and Mauss believe that magic is essentially traditional.  
Holding as they do that the primitive mind is markedly unoriginal, they have 
satisfied themselves that magic is therefore an art which does not exhibit 
any frequent changes amongst primitive folk, and is fixed by its laws.  
Religion, they say, is official and organised, magic prohibited and secret.  
Magical power appears to them to be determined by the contiguity. simi-
larity and contrast of the object of the act, and the object to be effected.  
Mr. Frazer believes all magic to be based on the law of sympathy - that is 
the assumption that things act on one another at a distance because of their 
being secretly linked together by invisible bonds.  He divides sympathetic 
magic into homeopathic magic and contagious magic.  The first is imitative 
or mimetic, and may be practised by itself ; but the latter usually necessi-
tates the application of the imitative principle.  Well-known instances of 
mimetic magic are the forming of wax figures in the likeness of an enemy, 
which are destroyed in the hope that he will perish.  Contagious magic may 
be instanced by the savage anointing the weapon which caused a wound instead 
of the wound itself, in the belief that the blood on the weapon continues to 
feel with the blood on the body.  Mr. L. Marillier divides magic into three 
classes the magic of the word or act; the magic of the human being 
independent of rite or formula ; and the magic which demands a human being 
of special powers and the use of ritual.  Mr. A. Lehmann believes magic to 
be a practice of superstition, and founds it in illusion.  The fault of all 
these theories is that they strive after too great an exact-ness, and that 
they do not allow sufficiently for the feeling of wonder and awe which is 
native to the human mind. Indeed they designate this  strained attention." 
We may grant that the attention of savages to a magical rite is " strained," 
so strained is it in some cases that it terrifies them into insanity; and it 
would seem therefore as if the limits of " attention" were overpassed. and 
as if it shaded into something very much deeper.  Moreover it is just 
possible that in future it may be granted that so-called sympathetic magic 
does not partake of the nature of magic at all, but has greater affinities 
(owing to its strictly natural and non-supernatural character) with 
pseudo--science.
     Magic is recognised by many savage peoples as a force rather than an 
art,-a thing which impinges upon the thought of man from outside. It would 
appear that many barbarian tribes believe in what would seem to be a great 
reservoir of magical power, the exact nature of which they are not prepared 
to specify. Thus amongst certain Ameri-can-Indian tribes we find a force 
called Orenda or spirit-force. Amongst the ancient Peruvians, everything 
sacred was huaca and possessed of magical power. In Melanesia, we find a 
force Spoken of called mana, transmissible and contagious, which may be seen 
in the form of flames or even heard.  The Malays use the word kramat to 
signify the same thing; and the Malagasy the term hasma.  Some of the tribes 
round Lake Tanganyika believe in such a force, which they call ngai, and 
Australian tribes have many similar terms, such as churinga and boolya. To 
hark back to America, we find in Mexico the strange creed named nagualism, 
which partakes of the same conception-every-thing nagual is magical or 
possesses an inherent spiritual force of its own.
     Theories of the Origin of Magic-Many theories have been advanced 
regarding the origin of magic-some author-ities believing that it commenced 
with the idea of personal superiority ; others through animistic beliefs 
(See Animism); and still others through such ideas as that physical pains, 
for which the savage could not account, were supposed to be inflicted by 
invisible weapons.  This last theory is. of course, in itself, merely 
animistic.  It does not seem, how-ever, that writers on the subject have 
given sufficient attention to the great influence exerted on the mind of man 
by odd or peculiar occurrences.  We do not for a moment desire to advance 
the hypothesis that magic entirely originated from such a source, but we 
believe that it was a powerful factor in the growth of magical belief.  To 
which, too, animism and taboo contributed their quota. Toe cult of the dead 
too and their worship would soon become fused with magical practice, and a 
complete demonology would thus speedily arise.
     The Dynamics of Magic..-Magical practice is governed by well-marked 
laws limited in number.  It possesses many classes of practitioner ; as, for 
example, the diviner or augur, whose duties are entirely different from 
those of the witch-doctor.  Chief among these laws, as has been already 
hinted, is that of sympathy. which, as has been said, must inevitably be 
sub-divided into the laws of similarity, contiguity and antipathy.  The law 
of simi-larity and homeopathy is again divisible into two sections: (1)-the 
assumption that like produces like-an illustration of which is the 
destruction of a model in the form of an enemy ; and (2) the idea that like 
cures like-for instance, that the stone called the bloodstone can staunch 
the flow of bleeding. The law dealing with antipathy rests on the assumption 
that the application of a certain object or drug expels its contrary.  There 
remains contiguity, which is based on the concept that whatever has once 
formed part of an object continues to form part of it. Thus if a magician 
can obtain a portion of a person's hair, he can work woe upon him through 
the invisible bonds which are supposed to extend between him and the hair in 
the sorcerer's possession.  It is well-known that if the animal familiar of 
a witch be wounded, that the wound will react in a sympathetic manner on the 
witch herself. This is called  repercussion."
     Another widespread belief is that if the magician procures the name of 
a person that he can gain magical dominion over him.  This, of course, arose 
from the idea that the name of an individual was identical with himself.  
The doctrine of the Incommunicable Name, the hidden name of the god or 
magician, is well instanced by many legends in Egyptian history,-the deity 
usually taking extra-ordinary care to keep his name secret, in order that no 
one might gain power over him.  The spell or incantation is connected with 
this concept, and with these, in a lesser degree, may be associated magical 
gesture, which is usually introduced for the purpose of accentuating the 
spoken word. Gesture is often symbolic or sympathetic ; it is sometimes the 
reversal of a religious rite, such as marching against the sun, which is 
known as walking "widdershins." The method of pronouncing rites is, too, one 
of great impor-tance.  Archaic or foreign expressions are usually found in 
spells ancient and modern ; and the tone in which the incantation is spoken, 
no less than its exactness, is also important. To secure exactness rhythm 
was often em-ployed. which had the effect of aiding memory.
     The Magician.-In early society, the magician, which term includes the 
shaman, medicine-man, piage, witch-doctor, et cetera, may hold his position 
by hereditary right; by an accident of birth, as being the seventh son of a 
seventh son; to revelation from the gods; or through mere mastery of ritual.  
In savage life we find the shaman a good deal of a medium, for instead of 
summoning the powers of the air at his bidding as did the magicians of 
medieval days, he seems to find it necessary to throw him-self into a state 
of trance and seek them in their own sphere.  The magician is also often 
regarded as possessed by an animal or supernatural being.  The duties of the 
priest and magician are often combined in primitive society, but it cannot 
be too strongly asserted that where a religion has been superseded, the 
priests of the old cult are, for those who have taken their places, nothing 
but magicians.  We do not hear much of beneficent magic among savage 
peoples, and it is only in Europe that White Magic may be said to have 
gained any hold.
     Medieval Definition of Magic.-The definitions of magic vouchsafed by 
the great magicians of medieval and modern times naturally differ greatly 
from those of anthropologists.
For example Eliphas Levi says in his History of Magic:   “Magic combines in 
a single science that which is most certain in philosophy with that which is 
eternal and infallible in religion.  It reconciles perfectly and 
incontestably those two terms so opposed on the first view-faith and reason, 
science and belief, authority and liberty.  It furnishes the human mind with 
an instrument of philosophical and religious certainty, as exact as mathe-
matics, and even accounting for the infallibility of mathe-matics 
themselves.…There is an incontestable truth, and there is an infallible 
method of knowing that truth; while those who attain this knowledge and 
adopt it as a rule of life, can endow their life with a sovereign power, 
which can make them masters of all inferior things, of wandering spirits, or 
in other words, arbiters and kings of the world."  Paracelsus says regarding 
magic:  "The magical is a great hidden wisdom, and reason is a great open 
folly.  No armour shields against magic for it strikes at the inward spirit 
of life.  Of this we may rest assured, that through full and powerful 
imagination only can we bring the spirit of any man into an image.  No 
conjuration, no rites are needful; circle-making and the scattering of 
incense are mere humbug and jugglery. The human spirit is so great a thing 
that no man can express it; eternal and unchangeable as God Himself is the 
mind of man; and could we rightly comprehend the mind of man, nothing would 
be impossible to us upon the earth.  Through faith the imagination is 
invigorated and completed, for it really happens that every doubt mars its 
perfection.  Faith must strengthen imagination, for faith establishes the 
will. Because man did not perfectly believe and imagine, the result is that 
arts are uncertain when they might be wholly certain."  Agrippa also 
regarded magic as the true road to communion with God-thus linking it with 
mysticism.
     Modern Magic: With the death of Agrippa in 1535 the old school of 
magicians may be said to have ended.  But that is not to say that the 
traditions of magic were not handed on to others who were equally capable of 
preserving them. We must carefully discriminate at this juncture between 
those practitioners of magic whose minds were illuminated by a high mystical 
ideal, and persons of doubtful occult position, like the Comte de Saint-
Germain and others.  At the beginning of the seventeenth century we find 
many great alchemists in practice, who were also devoted to the researches 
of transcendental magic, which they care-fully and successfully concealed 
under the veil of hermetic experiment.  These were Michael Meyer, Campe, 
Robert Flood, Cosmopolite, D'Espagnet, Samuel Norton, Baron de Beausoleil, 
and Van Helmont; another illustrious name is also that of Philalethes.  The 
eighteenth century was rich in occult personalities, as for example the 
alchemist Lascaris (q.v.) Martines de Pasqually, and Louis de Saint--Martin 
(q.v.) who founded the Martinist school, which still exists under the 
grand-mastership of Papus.  After this magic merges for the moment into 
mesmerism, and many of the secret magical societies which abounded in Europe 
about this period practised animal magnetism as well as astrology, Kabalism 
and ceremonial magic.  Indeed mesmerism powerfully influenced mystic life in 
the time of its chief protagonist, and the mesmerists of the first era are 
in direct line with the Martinist and the mystical magicians of the late 
eighteenth century.  Indeed mysticism and magnetism are one and the same 
thing, in the persons of some of these occultists (See Secret Tradition) the 
most celebrated of which were Cazotte, Ganneau, Comte. Wronski, Du Potet, 
Hennequin, Comte d'Ourches, and Baron de Guidenstubbe, and last of the 
initiates known to us, Eliphas Levi (all of which see)
     That Black Magic and sorcery are still practised is a well-known fact, 
which requires no amplification in this place (See Devil Worship) : but what 
of that higher magic which has, at least in modern times, attracted so many 
gifted minds ?  We cannot say that the true line of magical adapts ended 
with Levi, as at no time in the world's history are these known to the 
vulgar; but we may be certain that the great art is practised in secret as 
sedulously as ever in the past, and that men of temperament as exalted as in 
the case of the magicians of older days still privately pursue that art, 
which, like its sister religion, is none the less celestial because it has 
been evolved from lowly origins in the mind of man, whose spirit with the 
march of time reflects ever more strongly the light of heaven, as the sea at 
first dimly reddened by the dawn, at length mirrors the whole splendour of 
day.

Magic Darts: The Laplanders, who passed at one time for great magicians, 
were said to launch lead darts, about a finger-length, against their absent 
enemies, believing that with the magic darts they were sending grevious 
pains and maladies.  (See Magic.)


Magic Squares : (See Abraham the Jew.)


Magical Diagrams : These were geometrical designs, repre-senting the 
mysteries of deity and creation, therefore supposed to be of special virtue 
in rites of evocation and conjuration.
The chief of these were the Triangle, the Double Triangle, forming a six-
pointed star and known as the Sign or Seal of Solomon; the Tetragram a four-
pointed star formed by the interlacement of two pillars; and the Pentagram, 
a five-pointed star.
     These signs were traced on paper or parchment. or engraved on metals 
and glass and consecrated to their various uses by special rites.
     The Triangle was based on the idea of trinity as found in all things, 
in deity, time and creation. The triangle was generally traced on the ground 
with the magic sword or rod, as in circles of evocation where the triangle 
was drawn within it and according to the position of the magician at its 
point or base so the spirits were conjured from heaven or hell.
     The Double Triangle, the Sign of Solomon, symbolic of the Macrocosm, 
was formed by the interlacement of two triangles, thus its points 
constituted the perfect number six. The magicians wore it, bound on their 
brows and breasts during the ceremonies and it was engraved on the silver 
reservoir of the magic lamp.
     The Tetragram was symbolic of the four elements and used in the 
conjuration of the elementary spirits-sylphs of the air, undines of the 
water, the fire salamanders and gnomes of the earth. In alchemy it 
represented the magical elements, salt, sulphur, mercury and azoth; in 
mystic philosophy the ideas Spirit, Matter, Motion and Rest; in hieroglyphs 
the man, eagle, lion and bull.
     The Pentagram, the sign of the Microcosm, was held to be the most 
powerful means of conjuration in any rite.  It may represent evil as well as 
good, for while with one point in the ascendant it was the sign of Christ, 
with two points in the ascendant it was the sign of Satan.  By the use of 
the pentagram in these positions the powers of light or darkness were 
evoked.  The pentagram was said to be the star which led the Magi to the 
manger where the infant Christ was laid.
     The preparation and consecration of this sign for use in magical rites 
is prescribed with great detail.  It might be composed of seven metals, the 
ideal form for its expression or traced in pure gold upon white marble, 
never before used for any purpose.  it might also be drawn with
vermilion upon lambskin without a blemish prepared under the auspices of the 
Sun. The sign was next consecrated with the four elements ; breathed on five 
times ; dried by the smoke of five perfumes, incense, myrrh, aloes, sulphur 
and camphor. The names of five genii were breathed above it, and then the 
sign was placed successively at the north, south, east and west and centre 
of the astronomical cross pronouncing the letters of the sacred tetragram 
and various Kabalistic names.
     It was believed to be of great efficacy in terrifying phantoms if 
engraved upon glass, and the magicians traced it on their doorsteps to 
prevent evil spirits from entering and the good from departing.
     This symbol has been used by all secret and occult societies, by the 
Rosicrucians, the Illuminati, down to the Freemasons of to-day. Modern 
Occultists translate the meaning of the pentagram as symbolic of the human 
soul and its relation to God.
     The symbol is placed with one point in the ascendant. That point 
represents the Great Spirit, God. A line drawn from there to the left-hand 
angle at base is the descent of spirit into matter in its lowest form, 
whence it ascends to right-hand angle typifying matter in its highest form, 
the brain of man.  From here a line is drawn across the figure to left angle 
representing man's development in intellect, and progress in material 
civilization, the point of danger, from which all nations have fallen into 
moral corruption, signified by the descent of the line to right angle at 
base.  But the soul of man being derived from God cannot remain at this 
point, but must struggle upward, as is symbolised by the line reaching again 
to the apex, God, whence it issued.


Magical Instruments and Accessories : In magical rites these were considered 
of the utmost importance.  Indispensable to the efficacy of the ceremonies 
were the altar, the chalice, the tripod, the censer; the lamp, rod, sword, 
and magic fork or trident; the sacred fire and consecrated oils; the incense 
and the candles.
     The altar might be of wood or stone, but if of the latter, then of 
stone that has never been worked or hewn or even touched by the hammer.
     The chalice might be of different metals, symbolic of the object of the 
rites.  Where the purpose was evil, a black chalice was used as in the 
profane masses of sorcerers and witches.  In some talismans the chalice is 
engraved as a symbol of the moon.
     The tripod and its triangular stand was also made in symbolic metals.
     The censer might be of bronze, but preferably of silver.
     In the construction of the lamp, gold, silver, brass and iron must be 
used, iron for the pedestal, brass for the mirror, silver for the reservoir 
and at the apex a golden triangle.  Various symbols were traced upon it, 
including an androgynous figure about the pedestal, a serpent devouring its 
own tail, and the Sign of Solomon.
     The rod must be specially fashioned of certain woods and then 
consecrated to its magical uses. A perfectly straight branch of almond or 
hazel was to be chosen. This was cut before the tree blossomed, and cut with 
n golden sickle in the early dawn. Throughout its length must be run a long 
needle of magnetized iron; at one end there should be affixed a triangular 
prism, to the other, one of black resin, and rings of copper and zinc bound 
about it. At the new moon it must be consecrated by a magician who already 
possesses a consecrated rod.
     The secret of the construction and consecration of magical rods was 
jealously guarded by all magicians and the rod itself was displayed as 
little as possible, being usually concealed in the flowing sleeve of the 
magician's robe.
     The sword must be wrought of unalloyed steel, with copper handle in the 
form of a crucifix.  Mystical signs were engraved on guard and blade and its 
consecration took place on a Sunday in full rays of the sun, when the sword 
was thrust into a sacred fire of cypress and laurel, then moistened with the 
blood of a snake, polished, and next, together with branches of vervain, 
swathed in silk. The sword was generally used in the service of Black Magic.
     The magic fork or trident used in necromancy was also fashioned of 
hazel or almond, cut from the tree at one blow with an unused knife, from 
whose blade must be fashioned the three prongs. Witches and sorceresses are 
usually depicted using the trident in their infernal rites.
The fire was lit with charcoal on which were cast branches of trees, 
symbolic of the end desired.  In Black Magic these generally consisted of 
cypress, alderwood, broken crucifixes and desecrated hosts.
     The oil for anointing was compounded of myrrh, cinna-mon, galingale and 
purest oil of Olive.  Unguents were used by sorcerers and witches, who 
smeared their brows, breasts and wrists with a mixture composed of human fat 
and blood of corpses, combined with aconite, belladonna and poisonous fungi, 
thinking thereby to make themselves invisible.
     Incense might be of any odoriferous woods and herbs, such as cedar, 
rose, citron, aloes, cinnamon, sandal, reduced to a fine powder, together 
with incense and storax.  In Black Magic, alum, sulphur and assafoetida were 
used as incense.
     The candles, belonging solely to practices of Black Magic were moulded 
from human fat and set in candlesticks of ebony carved in the form of a 
crescent.
     Bowls also were used in these ceremonies, fashioned of different 
metals, their shape symbolic of the heavens.  In necromantic rites skulls of 
criminals were used, generally to hold the blood of some victim or 
sacrifice.
Magical Numbers : Certain numbers and their combinations were held to be of 
magical power, by virtue of their repre-sentation of divine and creative 
mysteries.
     The doctrines of Pythagoras furnished the basis for much of this 
belief.  According to his theory numbers contained the elements of all 
things, of the natural and spiritual worlds and of the sciences.  The real 
numerals of the universe are the primaries one to ten and in their com-
bination the reason of all else may be found. To the Pythagoreans One 
represented unity, therefore God; Two was duality, the Devil; Four was 
sacred and holy, the number on which they swore their most solemn oaths; 
Five was their symbol of marriage.  They also attributed certain numbers to 
the gods, planets and elements; one represented the Sun, two the Moon; while 
five was fire, six the earth, eight the air, and twelve water.
     Cornelius Agrippa in his work Occult Philosophy pub-lished in 1533. 
discourses upon numbers as those characters by whose proportion all things 
were formed.  He enu-merates the virtues of numerals as displayed in nature, 
instancing the herb cinquefoil, which by the power of the number five 
exorcises devils, allays fever and forms an antidote to poisons. Also the 
virtue of seven as in the power of the seventh son to cure king's evil.
     One was the origin and common measure of all things. It is indivisible 
; not to be multiplied.  In the universe there is one God ; one supreme 
intelligence in the intellec-tual world, man; in the sidereal world, one 
Sun; one potent instrument and agency in the elementary world, the 
philosopher's Stone; one chief member in the human world, the heart; and one 
sovereign prince in the nether world, Lucifer.
     Two was the number of marriage. charity and social communion. It was 
also regarded sometimes as an unclean number; beasts of the field went into 
the Ark by twos. Three had a mysterious value as shown in Time's trinity - 
Past, Present and Future; in that of Space-length, breadth and thickness; in 
the three heavenly virtue - faith, hope and charity; in the three worlds of 
man-brain, the intellectual ; heart, the celestial ; and body, elemental.
     Four signifies solidity and foundation. There are four seasons, four 
elements, four cardinal points, four evangelists.
     Five, as it divides ten, the sum of all numbers, is also the number of 
justice.  There are five senses ; the Stigmata, the wounds of Christ were 
five ; the name of the Deity the Pentagram is composed of five letters ; it 
also is a pro-tection against beasts of prey.
     Six is the sign of creation, because the world was com-pleted in six 
days.  It is the perfect number, because it alone by addition of its half, 
its third and its sixth reforms itself.  It also represents servitude by 
reason of the Divine injunction  Six days shalt thou labour."
     Seven is a miraculous number, consisting of one, unity, and six, sign 
of perfection. It represents life because it contains body, consisting of 
four elements, spirit, flesh, bone and humour; and soul, made up of three 
elements, passion, desire and reason. The seventh day was that on which God 
rested from his work of creation.
     Eight represents justice and fullness.  Divided, its halves are equal; 
twice divided, it is still even.  In the Beatitude eight is the number of 
those mentioned-peace-makers, they who strive after righteousness, the meek, 
the perse-cuted, the pure, the merciful, the poor in spirit, and they that 
mourn.
     Nine is the number of the muses and of the moving spheres.
     Ten is completeness because one cannot count beyond it except by 
combinations formed with other numbers. In the ancient mysteries ten days of 
initiation were pre-scribed.  In ten is found evident signs of a Divine 
principle.
     Eleven is the number of the commandments, while Twelve is the number of 
signs in the Zodiac, of the apostles, of the tribes of Israel, of the gates 
of Jerusalem.
This theory of numbers Agrippa applied to the casting of horoscopes.  
Divination by numbers was one of the favourite methods employed in the 
Middle Ages.
     In magical rites, numbers played a great part. The instruments, 
vestments and ornaments must be duplicated. The power of the number three is 
found in the magic triangle:
in the three prongs of the trident and fork; and in the three-fold 
repetition of names in conjurations.  Seven was also of great influence, the 
seven days of the week each repre-senting the period most suitable for 
certain evocations and these corresponded to the seven magical works ; 1.-
works of light and riches; 2.-works of divination and mystery; 3.-works of 
skill, science and eloquence; 4.-works of wrath and chastisement; 5.-works 
of love; 6.-works of ambition and intrigue; 7.-works of malediction and 
death.

Magical Union of Cologne : A society stated in a MS. of the Rosicrucians at 
Cologne to have been founded in that city in the year 1115.  In the 
Rosenkreutzer in seiner blosse of Weise it is stated that the initiates wore 
a triangle as symbolising power, wisdom and love. The more exalted orders 
among them were called Magos, and these held the greater mysteries of the 
fraternity.


Magical Vestments and Appurtenances: These were prescribed needful adjuncts 
to magical rites, whose colour, name, form and substance, symbolic of 
certain powers and elements, added, it was supposed, greater efficacy to the 
evocations.
     Abraham the Jew. a magician of the Middle Ages, pre-scribed a tunic of 
white linen, with upper robe ofscarlet and girdle of white silk.  A crown or 
fillet of silk and gold was to be worn on the head and the perfumes cast on 
the fire might be incense, aloes, storax, cedar, citron or rose.
     According to other authorities on the subject it was advisable to vary 
colour of robe and employ certain jewels and other accessories according to 
the symbolism of the end desired.  A magician of the nineteenth century, 
Eliphas Levi, gives a detailed description of ritual, from which the 
following is taken.
     If the rites were those of White Magic and performed on a Sunday, then 
the vestment should be of purple, the tiara, bracelets and ring of gold, the 
latter set with a chrysolith or ruby.  Laurel, heliotrope and sunflowers are 
the sym-bolic flowers, while other details include a carpet of lion-skins 
and fans of sparrow-hawk feathers.  The appropriate perfumes are incense, 
saffron, cinnamon and red sandal.
     If, however, the ceremonial took place on a Monday, the Day of the 
Moon, then the robe must be of white embroi-dered with silver and the tiara 
of yellow silk emblazoned with silver characters ; while the wreaths were to 
be woven of moonwort and yellow ranunculi. The jewels appro-priate to the 
occasion were pearls, crystals and selenite the perfumes, camphor, amber, 
aloes, white sandal and seed of cucumber.
     In evocations concerning transcendent knowledge, green was the colour 
chosen for the vestment, or it might be green shot with various colours. The 
chief ornament was a necklace of pearls and hollow glass beads enclosing 
mer-cury.  Agate was the symbolic jewel;  narcissus, lily, herb mercury, 
fumitory, and marjoram the flowers; whilst the perfumes must be benzoin, 
mace and storax.
     For operations connected with religious and political matters, the 
magician must don a robe of scarlet and bind on his brow a brass tablet 
inscribed with various characters. His ring must be studded with an emerald 
or sapphire, and he must burn for incense, balm, ambergris, grain of para-
dise and saffron.  For garlands and wreaths, oak, poplar, fig and 
pomegranate leaves should be entwined.
     If the ceremonial dealt with amatory affairs, the vestment must be of 
sky-blue, the ornaments of copper, and the crown of violets. The magic ring 
must be set with a turquoise, while the tiara and clasps were wrought of 
lapis-lazuli and beryl.  Roses, myrtle and olive were the symbolic flowers, 
and fans must be made of swan-feathers.
     If vengeance was desired on anyone, then robes must be worn whose 
colour was that of blood, flame or rust, belted with steel, with bracelets 
and ring of the same metal.  The tiara must be bound with gold and the 
wreaths woven of absinthe and rue.
     To bring misfortune and death on a person, the vest-ment must be black 
and the neck encircled with lead. The ring must be set with an onyx and the 
garlands twined of cypress, ash and hellebore; whilst the perfumes to be 
used were sulphur, scammony, alum and assafoetida.
For purposes of Black Magic, a seamless and sleeveless robe of black was 
donned, while on the head was worn a leaden cap inscribed with the signs of 
the Moon, Venus and Saturn.  The wreaths were of vervain and cypress; and 
the perfumes burned were aloes, camphor and storax.


Maginot, Adele : One of the mediums whose trance utterances have been 
recorded by the French spiritualist Alphonse Cahagnet, who published his 
Arcanes de la vie future devoiles in 1848.  Her seances, of which Cahagnet 
strove to obtain a written account from as many as possible of those 
present, are among the most valuable evidence which spiritualism can 
produce.  Her descriptions of absent or deceased friends of the sitters were 
singularly accurate, though her supposed conversations with their spirits 
would appear to be fictitious.  At the least her seances are excel-lent 
examples of telepathic communication.

Maier, Michael: A German alchemist born at Rindsburg in Holstein about the 
year 1858.  He was one of the principal figures in the Rosicrucian 
Controversy in Germany and the greatest adept of his time. He diligently 
pursued the study of medicine in his youth and settling at Rostock practised 
with such success that the Emperor Rudolph appointed him as his physician, 
ennobling him later for his services. Some adepts eventually succeeded in 
luring him from the practical work he followed so long into the mazy and 
tortuous paths of alchemy. In order to confer with those whom he suspected 
were possessed of the transcen-dent mysteries he travelled all over Germany. 
The Biographie Universelle states that in pursuit of these ruinous 
absurdities " he sacrificed his health, fortune and time. On a visit to 
England he became acquainted with Robert Fludd the Kentish Mystic.
     In the controversy which convulsed Germany on the appearance of his 
Rosicrucian Manifestoes, he took a vigorous and enthusiastic share and wrote 
several works in defence of the mysterious society.  He is alleged to have 
travelled in order to seek for members of the " College of Teutonic 
Philosophers R.C.," and failing to find them formed a brotherhood of his 
own, based on the form of the Fama Fraternibus. There is no adequate 
authority for this statement, but it is believed that he eventually, towards 
the end of his life, was initiated into the genuine order. A posthumous 
pamphlet of Maier's called Ulysses was pub-lished by one of his personal 
friends in 1624. There was added to the same volume the substance of two 
pamphlets already published in German but which in view of their importance 
were now translated into Latin for the benefit of the European literati.  
The first pamphlet was entitled Colloquium  Rhodostauroticum  trium  
personarium  per Famem et Confessionem quodamodo revelatam de Frater-nitate 
Rosae Crucis. The second was an Echo Colloquii by Hilarion on behalf of the 
Rosicrucian Fraternity. From these pamphlets it appears that Maier was 
admitted as a member of the mystical order. He became the most pro-fuse 
writer on alchemy of his time. He died in the year 1622. Most of his works, 
many of which are adorned with curious plates, are obscure with the 
exception of his Rosi-crucian Apologies.  (See Rosicrucians.)


Maimonides, Moses (1135-1204) : A great Spanish-Hebrew philosopher and 
theologian, the author of the Guide of the Perplexed.  His theories are 
Aristotelian and rational, but there remained in his view-point a touch of 
mysticism.


Malachite : Used to preserve the cradle of an infant from spells.


Malays : Magic among the Malays is for the most part of that type known as 
"sympathetic" (See Magic), that is, it possesses more of the nature of 
pseudo-science than that of wonder.  Says Clifford
     “The accredited intermediary between men and spirits is the Pawang; the 
Pawang is a functionary of great and traditional importance in a Malay 
village, though in places near towns the office is falling into abeyance. In 
the inland districts, however, the Pawang is still a power, and is regarded 
as part of the constituted order of Society, without whom no village 
community would be complete. It must be clearly understood that he had 
nothing what-
ever to do with the official Muhammadan religion of the mosque; the village 
has its regular staff of elder- the Imam, Khatio, and Bilal-for the mosque 
service. But the Pawang is quite outside this system and belongs to a 
different and much older order of ideas; he may be re-garded as the 
legitimate representative of the primitive medicine-man,' or village-
sorcerer,' and his very existence in these days is an anomaly, though it 
does not strike Malays as such    
     "The Pawang is a person of very real significance.  In all agricultural 
operations, such as sowing, reaping, irrigation works, and the clearing of 
jungle for planting, in fishing at sea, in prospecting for minerals, and in- 
cases of sickness, his assistance is invoked.  He is entitled by custom to 
certain small fees; thus, after a good harvest he is allowed in some 
villages five gantangs of padi, one gantang of rice (beras), and two chupaks 
of emping (a preparation of rice and cocoa-nut made into a sort of 
sweetmeat) from each householder."
     The Pawang regulates taboos, and employs a familiar spirit known as 
hantu pusaka-a hereditary demon.  He also acts as a medium and divines 
through trance.  To become a magician " You must meet the ghost of a mur-
dered nian. Take the midrib of a leaf of the ' ivory cocoa-nut palm (pelepah 
niyor gading), which is to be laid on the grave, and two midribs, which are 
intended to represent canoe-paddles, and carry them with the help of a 
companion to the grave of the murdered man at the time of the full moon (the 
55th day of the lunar month) when it falls upon a Tuesday.  Then take a 
cent's worth of incense, with glowing embers in a censer, and carry them to 
the head-post of the grave of the deceased.  Fumigate the grave, going three 
times round it, and call upon the mur-dered man by name :-

'Hearken, So-and-so, And assist me
I am taking (this boat) to the saints of God, 
And I desire to ask for a little magic.'

Here take the first midrib, fumigate it, and lay it upon the head of the 
grave, repeating 
' Kur Allah' (' Cluck, Cluck, God !') seven times. You and your companion 
must now take up a sitting posture, one at the head and the other at the 
foot of the grave, facing the grave post, and use the canoe-paddles which 
you have brought. In a little while the surrounding scenery will change and 
take upon itself the appearance of the sea, and finally an aged man will 
appear, to whom you must address the same request as before."
     Malay magic may be sub-divided into preparatory rites, sacrificial, 
lustration, divination and possession.  Sacrifice takes the form of a simple 
gift, or act of homage to the spirit or deity. Lustration is 
magico-religious and puri-ficatory, principally taking place after child-
birth. It may be performed by fire or water. Divination consists for the 
most part of the reading of dreams, and is, as elsewhere, drawn from the 
acts of men or nature. Omens are strongly believed in,
     "When a star is seen in apparent proximity to the moon, old people say 
there will be a wedding shortly.
     "The entrance into a house of an animal which does not generally seek 
to share the abode of man is regarded by the Malays as ominous of 
misfortune.  If a wild bird flies into a house it must-be carefully caught 
and smeared with oil, and must then be released in the open air, a formula 
being recited in which it is bidden to fly away with all the ill-luck and 
misfortunes (sial jambalang) of the occupier. An iguana, a tortoise, and a 
snake, are perhaps the most dreaded of these unnatural visitors. They are 
sprinkled with ashes, if possible to counteract their evil influence.
     " A swarm of bees settling near a house is an unlucky omen, and 
prognosticates misfortune."
     So, too, omens are taken either from the flight or cries of certain 
birds, such as the night-owl, the crow, some kinds of wild doves, and the 
bird called the " Rice's Husband" (laki padi.)
     Astrology. Divination by astrology is, however, the most common method 
of forecasting the future.  The native practitioners possess long tables of 
lucky and unlucky periods and reasons.  These are mostly translations from 
Indian and Arabic sources.  The oldest known of these systems of propitious 
and unpropitious seasons is known as Katika Lime, or the Five Times.  Under 
it the day is divided into five parts, and five days form a cycle.  To each 
division is given a name as follows: Maswara, Kala, S'ri, Brahma, Bisnu 
(Vishnu) names of Hindu deities, the last name in the series for the first 
day being the first in that of the second day, and so on until the five days 
are exhausted.  Each of these has a colour, and according to the colour 
first seen or noticed on such and such a day will it be fortunate to ask a 
boon of a certain god.  Another version of this system, known as the " Five 
Moments" is similar in origin, but possesses a Mohammedan nomencla-ture.  
Another scheme Katiha Tujoh is based on the seven heavenly bodies, divides 
each day into seven parts, each of which is distinguished by the Arabic name 
for the sun, moon, and principal planets.  The astrology proper of the 
Malays is purely Arabic in origin, but a system of Hindu invocation is in 
vogue by which the lunar month is divided into parts called Rejang, which 
resembles the Nacshatras or lunar houses of the Hindus.  Each division has 
its symbol, usually an animal.  Each day is propitious for something, and 
the whole system has been committed to verse for mnemonic purposes.
     Demonology.-  The demoniac form common to Malaysia is that of the Jinn, 
with some leaven of the older Hindu spirit.  They are one hundred and ninety 
in number. They are sometimes sub-divided into " faithful" and "infidel," 
and further into the Jinns of the royal musical instruments, of the state, 
and of the royal weapons.  The Afrit is also known.  Angels also abound, and 
are purely of Arabic origin.  Besides these the principal supernatural 
beings are as follows -the Po/ong, or familiar; the Hantu Pem-buru, or 
spectre Huntsman; the Jadi-jadian, or wer--tiger; the Huntu, or ghost of the 
murdered ; the Jemalang, or earth-spirit.
     Minor Sorcery.-The rites of minor sorcery and witch-craft, as well as 
those of the shaman, are widely practised among the Malays, and are 
practically identical in character with those in use among other peoples in 
a similar state of culture.

Malchidael : (See Astrology.)


Mallebranche : A marker of the game of tennis, living in the Rue Sainte-
Genevieve, Paris, who in 1618 was visited by an apparition of his wife, who 
had died five years before She came to advise him to repent and live a 
better life, and to pray for her also.  Both Ma//ebranche and his wife (for 
he had married a second time) heard the voice, but the apparition did not 
become visible.  In 1618 a brochure was published at Paris, entitled :  
Histoire nouve/le et remarquab/e de l'esprit d'une femme qici c'est apparue 
au Faubourg Saint-Marcel apres qu'elle a demeue cinq ans entiers ensevelie  
elle a par/e a son mari, lui a commande de faire prier pour elle, ayant 
comnence de parler le  mardi II Decembre, 1618.


Malleus Maleficarum: A large volume published in Germany at the end of the 
fifteenth century, written by two inquisi-tors under the papal bull against 
witchcraft of 1484,-Jacob Sprenger and Henricus Institor.  Says Wright 
concerning it : " In this celebrated work, the doctrine of witchcraft was 
first reduced to a regular system, and it was the model and groundwork of 
all that was written on the subject long after the date which saw its first 
appear-ance.  Its writers enter largely into the much-disputed question of 
the nature of demons ; set forth the causes which lead them to seduce men in 
this manner; and show why women are most prone to listen to their proposals, 
by reasons which prove that the inquisitors had but a mean estimate of the 
softer sex.  The inquisitors show the most extraordinary skill in explaining 
all the difficulties which seemed to beset the subject ; they even prove to 
their entire satisfaction that persons who have become witches may easily 
change themselves into beasts, particularly into wolves and cats; and after 
the exhibition of such a mass of learning, few would venture any longer to 
entertain a doubt. They investigate not only the methods employed to effect 
various kinds of mischief, but also the counter-charms and exorcisms that 
may be used against them. They likewise tell, from their own experience, the 
dangers to which the inquisitors were exposed, and exult in the fact that 
they were a class of men against whom sorcery had no power.  These writers 
actually tell us, that the demon had tried to frighten them by day and by 
night in the forms of apes, dogs, goats, etc. ; and that they frequently 
found large pins stuck in their night-caps, which they doubted not came 
there by witchcraft.  When we hear these inquisitors asserting that the 
crime of which the witches were accused, deserved a more extreme punish-ment 
than all the vilest actions of which humanity is capable, we can understand 
in some degree the complacency with which they relate how, by their means, 
forty persons had been burnt in one place, and fifty in another, and a still 
greater number in a third.  From the time of the publication of the Malleus 
Maleficarum, the continental press during two or three generations teemed 
with publi-cations on the all-absorbing subject of sorcery.
     "One of the points on which opinion had differed most was, whether the 
sorcerers were carried bodily through the air to the place of meeting, or 
whether it was an imaginary journey, suggested to their minds by the agency 
of the evil one. The authors of the Malleus decide at once in favour of the 
bodily transmission.  One of them was personally acquainted with a priest of 
the diocese of Frisingen, who declared that he had in his younger days been 
carried through the air by a demon to a place at a very great distance from 
the spot whence he had been taken. Another priest, Iris friend, declared 
that he had seen him carried away, and that he appeared to him to be borne 
up on a kind of cloud.  At Baldshut, on the Rhine, in the diocese of 
Constance, a witch confessed, that offended at not having been invited to 
the wedding of an acquaintance, she had caused herself to be carried through 
the air in open daylight to the top of a neighbouring mountain, and there, 
having made a hole with her hands and filled it with water, she had, by 
stirring the water with certain incantations caused a heavy storm to burst 
forth on the heads of the wedding-party; and there were witnesses at the 
trial who swore they had seen her carried through the air. The inquisitors, 
however, confess that the witches were some-times carried away, as they term 
it, in the spirit ; and they give the instance of one woman who was watched 
by her husband; she appeared as if asleep, and was insen-sible, but he 
perceived a kind of cloudy vapour arise out of her mouth, and vanish from 
the room in which she lay-this after a time returned, and she then awoke, 
and gave an account of her adventures, as though she had been carried bodily 
to the assembly.     
     " The witches of the Malleus Maleficarum appear to have been more 
injurious to horses and cattle than to mankind. A witch at Ravenspurg 
confessed that she had killed twenty-three horses by sorcery. We are led to 
wonder most at the ease with which people are brought to bear witness to 
things utterly beyond the limits of belief. A man of the name of Stauff in 
the territory of Berne, declared that when pursued by the agents of justice, 
he escaped by taking the form of a mouse; and persons were found to testify 
that they had seen him perform this transmutation.
     “The latter part of the work of the two inquisitors gives minute 
directions for the mode in which the prisoners are to be treated, the means 
to be used to force them to a confession, the degree of evidence required 
for conviction of those who would not confess, and the whole process of the 
trials. These show sufficiently that the unfortunate wretch who was once 
brought before the inquisitors of the holy see on the suspicion of sorcery, 
however slight might be the grounds of the charge, had very small chance of 
escaping out of their claws.
     “The Malleus contains no distinct allusion to the pro-ceedings at the 
Sabbath. The witches of this period differ little from those who had fallen 
into the hands of the earlier inquisitors at the Council of Constance. We 
see plainly how, in most countries, the mysteriously indefinite crime of 
sorcery had first been seized on to ruin the cause of great political 
offenders, until the fictitious importance thus given to it brought forward 
into a promi-nent position, which they would, perhaps, never otherwise have 
held, the miserable class who were supposed to be more especially engaged in 
it. It was the judicial prose-cutions mid the sanguinary executions which 
followed, that stamped the character of reality on charges of which it 
required two or three centuries to convince mankind of the emptiness and 
vanity. One of the chief instruments in fixing the belief in sorcery, and in 
giving it that terrible hold on society which it exhibited in the following 
century, was the compilation of Jacob Sprenger and his fellow inquisitor.  
In this book sorcery was reduced to a system but it was not yet perfect; and 
we must look forward, some half a century before we find it clothed with all 
the horrors which cast so much terror into every class of society."


Malphas : Grand president of the infernal regions, where he appears under 
the shape of a crow. When he appears in human form he has a very raucous 
voice. He builds impregnable citadels and towers, overthrows the ramparts of 
his enemies, finds good workmen, gives familiar spirits, receives 
sacrifices, and deceives the sacrificers. Forty legions are under his 
command.


Mamaloi : An obeah priestess.  (See West Indian Islands.)


Mana : (See Magic.)


Mananan: Son of the Irish sea-god Lir, magician and owner of strange 
possessions. His magical boat" Ocean-sweeper" steered by the wishes of its 
occupant; his horse Aonban, able to travel on sea or land; and his sword 
Fragarach, a match for any mail; were brought by Lugh from "The Land of the 
Living" (Fairyland). As lord 'of the sea he was the Irish Charon, and his 
colour-changing cloak would flap gaily as he marched with heavy tread round 
the camp of the hostile force invading Erin. He is comparable with the 
Cymric Manawiddan and resembles the Hellenic Proteus.


Mandragoras : Familiar demons who appear in the figures of little men 
without beards. Delrio states that one day a mandragora, entering at the 
request of a sorcerer, who was being tried before a court for wizardry, was 
caught by the arms by the judge, who did not believe in the existence of the 
spirit, to convince himself of its existence, and thrown into the fire, 
where of course it would escape un-harmed.  Mandragoras are thought to be 
little dolls or figures given to sorcerers by the Devil for the purpose of 
being consulted by them in time of need; and it would seem as if this 
conception had sprung directly from that of the fetish, which is nothing 
else than a dwelling-place made by a shaman or medicine-man for the 
reception of any wandering spirit who chooses to take up his abode therein. 
The author of the work entitled Petit Albert says that on one occasion, 
whilst travelling in Flanders and passing through the town of Lille, he was 
invited by one of his friends to accompany him to the house of an old woman 
who posed as being a great prophetess. This aged person conducted the two 
friends into a dark cabinet lit only by a single lamp, where they could see 
upon a table covered with a cloth a kind of little Statue or mandragora, 
seated upon a tripod and having the left hand extended and hold-ing a hank 
of silk very delicately fashioned, from which was suspended a small piece of 
iron highly polished. Plac-ing under this a crystal glass so that the piece 
of iron was suspended inside the goblet, the old woman commanded the figure 
to strike the iron against the glass in such a manner as she wished, saying 
at the same time to the figure: " I command you, Mandragora, in the name of 
those to whom you are bound to give obedience, to know if the gentleman 
present will be happy in the journey which he is about to make. If so, 
strike three times with the iron upon the goblet." The iron struck three 
times as demanded without the old woman having touched any of the apparatus, 
much to the surprise of the two spectators. The sorceress put several other 
questions to the Mandragora, who struck the glass once or thrice as seemed 
good to him. But, as the author shows, the whole was an artifice of the old 
woman, for the piece of iron suspended in the goblet was extremely light and 
when the old woman wished it to strike against the glass, she held in one of 
her hands a ring set with a large piece of magnetic stone, the virtue of 
which drew the iron towards the glass.
     The ancients attributed great virtues to the plant called mandragoras 
or mandrake, which was supposed to be somewhat in the shape of a man, and 
when plucked from the earth to emit a species of human cry. It was also worn 
to ward off various diseases.  (See Exorcism.)

Marigny, Enguerrand de : A minister of Louis X., king of France.  His wife 
and her sister were accused of having recourse to enchantments to harm the 
king, his brother Charles, and other batons, with the intention of freeing 
Enguessand, who was imprisoned. The ladies were arrested. Jacques Dulot, a 
magician, who was believed to have helped in these sorceries, was also 
committed to prison, where he took his own life, after his wife had been 
burnt. Dulot's suicide was considered a conclusive proof of Marigny's guilt, 
and the ex-minister was tried, condemned, and hanged on a gibbet which he 
himself had had erected during his term of office. The tide of popular 
opinion turned at the sight of his misfortune, and the judges dared not 
condemn his wife and sister-in-law. The king himself repented of having 
abandoned Marigny to his enemies, and in his will left a sum of money to his 
family.

Marshall, Mrs.: An English medium who gave open seances from 1858 onwards.  
Unlike many of the early mediums she practised professionally, and was for 
some time the only professional medium of note in this country. The 
phenomena witnessed included communication by means of rapping, playing on 
musical instruments, touchings by invisible hands, and all the more familiar 
forms. A writer in All the Year Round, July 28th, 1860, characterised Mrs. 
Marshall's performance as a "dull and barefaced imposi-tion," but Robert 
Bell, the celebrated dramatist, writing in the Cornhill Magazine was 
satisfied that the phenomena were genuine spirit manifestations.  (See 
Spiritualism.)


Marsi, The : According to Pliny, these people were from the earliest times 
skilled in magical practices and sorceries. They were able to charm 
poisonous serpents by means of songs.


Marthese, J. N. T. : (See Holland.)


Martian Language : A language purporting to be that of the inhabitants of 
the planet Mars, written and spoken by the medium known as Helene Smith.  
Heelene, the medium studied by a celebrated investigator, M. Flournoy, pro-
fessor of psychology at Geneva, had in 1892 joined a spiritualistic circle, 
where she developed marvellous me-diumistic powers. In 1896, after Professor 
Flournoy had begun his investigations, she was spirited during a trance to 
the planet Mars, and thereafter described to the circle the manners and 
customs and appearance of the Martians. She learned their language, which 
she wrote and spoke with ease and consistency.  Unlike most of the " unknown 
tongues" automatically produced the Martian language was intelligible, its 
words were used consistently, and on the whole it had every appearance of a 
genuine language. That it was in any way connected with Mars is out of the 
question. The descriptions of that planet and its inhabitants are quite 
impossible. And the language itself bears a remarkable resemblance to 
French, the native tongue of the medium. The grammar and construction of 
both languages are the same, and even the vowel-sounds are identical, so 
that the source of the Martian language is not fat to seek.


Martin, Saint (exorcist)   (circa 316-400). Most of the pristine luminaries 
of the Christian Church are credited with working miracles, and indeed the 
great majority of them maintained that, would the rude populace be won for 
Christ, the one sure way was to show them extraordinary marvels. Even 
Columba, most engaging of saints, was not averse to practising deception 
with a view to making converts'; and it has often been suggested, not 
without considerable reason, that some of these early thaumaturgists brought 
science to their aid. Perhaps St. Martin was among those who essayed this 
practice, and certainly the muster-roll of his miracles is formidable, for 
he is tradition-ally credited with considerably over two hundred.
     Martin was born about the year 316 at Sabaria, in Pannonia. His parents 
were heathen, yet he very soon came into contact with Christians, and their 
teaching impressed him greatly. As a young man he entered the army, and it 
was soon after this step that, while stationed with his regiment at Amiens, 
he performed his famous act of charity, dividing his cloak with a beggar who 
was shivering with cold. The night after this generous act he was vouchsafed 
a vision, Christ appearing to him and giving him his blessing; and thereupon 
Martin espoused the Christian faith formally, he was baptised and renounced 
soldiering once and for all. Going to Poitiers, he then made the 
acquaintance of Hilary, who wished to make him a deacon, but at his own 
request ordained him to the humbler office of an exorcist; and a little 
later, during a visit to his home, Martin experienced the joy of winning his 
mother from heathendom to the new faith.  However, his open zeal in opposing 
the Arians raised persecution against him, and for a considerable space he 
found it advisable to live at the island of Gallinaria, near Genoa, in which 
quiet retreat he had ample leisure for scientific researches and theological 
studies; but by the year 365 he was back with Hilary at Poitiers, when he 
founded the Monasterium Locociagense. Then, in 37!, the people of Tours 
chose him as their bishop, and for some time subse-quently he showed great 
activity in trying to extirpate idolatry in his diocese, and in extending 
the monastic system. Nevertheless, he was anything but a fierce 
proseletyser, and at Treves, in 385, he entreated that the lives of the 
Priscillianist heretics should be spared, while he ever afterwards refused 
to have anything to do with those bishops who had sanctioned their 
execution. Meanwhile, being anxious for another period of quiet study, 
Martin had established the monastery of Marmontier les Tours, on the banks 
of the Loire; and here much of his remaining life was spent, yet it was at 
Candes that his death occurred about the year 400.
     Martin left no writings behind him, the Confessio with which he is 
sometimes credited being undoubtedly spurious. His life was written by his 
ardent disciple, Sulpicius Severus, and a curious document it is, filled 
with accounts of the miracles and marvels worked by the quondam bishop. 
Thanks to his triumphs herein, Martin was duly sanctified by the church, and 
he is commemorated on the 11th of November; but the feast of Martinmas, 
which occurs on that date, and which of course derives its name from him, 
is, nevertheless, a survival of an old pagan festival; and it inherited 
certain usages thereof, this accounting for the fact that Martin is regarded 
as the patron saint of deep potations. Certain of his miracles, and other 
incidents in his life, were figured by numerous painters of note, perhaps 
the finest picture of him being one by the Flemish master, Hugo van der 
Goes, which is now in the Municipal Museum at Glasgow; while it behoves to 
add that the term Martinet, signifying a severe and punctilious person, is 
not derived from the saint's name, but from one Jean Martinet, a French 
soldier who, during the reign of Louis XIV., won fame by his ardour in 
promoting discipline in his regiment.

Materialisatlon  A term denoting the formation by a spirit of a temporary 
physical organisation, visible and palpable, by means of which it can come 
into touch with material objects.  Materialisation is the most important of 
the physical phenomena of spiritualism, and in its earlier stages was 
confined to the materialising of heads and hands, or vague luminous figures.  
In common with much of the physical phenomena, it had its origin in America, 
where it was known at a comparatively early period in the history of the 
movement.  So early as 1860 stances were held with the Fox sisters by Robert 
Dale Owen and others, at which veiled and luminous figures were witnessed  
One sitter, Mr. Livermore, saw and recognised the spirit of his dead wife 
many times during a series of stances with Kate Fox, extending over some six 
years.  In this case, however, there were no other sitters, and the stances 
were held in the dark, the whole atmosphere being peculiarly favourable to 
fraud.  In 1871 another American medium, Mrs. Andrews, held sittings at 
which materialised forms were seen, and in the following year Mrs. Guppy and 
another medium attempted the production of a similar phenomenon in England, 
but without marked success. The mediums, Herne and Williams, succeeded a few 
months later in materialising shadowy forms and faces in a dark stance-room.  
It was, however, Miss Florence Cook, to whose phenomena Sir William Crookes 
has so abundantly testified, who was to give the most remarkable 
demonstration of this form of spirit manifestation.  Miss Cook was, at the 
commencement of her spiritualistic career, a young girl of sixteen or 
seventeen years, described by a contemporary writer as  a pretty, Jewish-
like little girl."  She was at that time a private medium, though at the 
outset she held some materialisation stances with Herne.  From her 
childhood, it was said, she had been attended by a spirit-girl, who stated 
that her name on earth had been Annie Morgan, but that her name in the 
spirit-world was Katie King.  Under the latter name Miss Cook's control was 
destined to become very famous in spiritualistic circles. Usually the medium 
was put in a sort of cupboard, or cabinet, tied to her chair, and the cords 
sealed.  A short interval would ensue, during which the sitters sang 
spiritual-istic hymns, and at length there would emerge from the cabinet a 
form clad in flowing white draperies, and not to be distinguished from an 
ordinary human being.  On one occasion a stance was held at Mr. Cook's 
house, at which several distinguished spiritualists were present.  Among the 
invited guests was Mr. W. Volckman, who thought to test for himself the good 
faith of the medium and the genuineness of  Katie."  After some forty 
minutes close observance of the materialised spirit Mr. Volckman con-cluded 
that Miss Cook and Katie were one and the same, and just as the white-robed 
figure was about to return to the cabinet he rushed forward and seized her.  
His indig-nant fellow-sitters released the  “spirit," the light was 
extinguished, and in the confusion that followed the spirit disappeared.  
Miss Cook was found a few minutes later bound as when she was placed in the 
cabinet, the cords unbroken, the seal intact,  She wore a black dress, and 
there was no trace of white draperies in the cabinet.  Sir William Crookes, 
whose investigations into the phenomena of this medium extended over a 
period of some years, had better opportunity of examining Katie's 
pretensions than Mr. Volckman had, and he had le it on record that the 
spirit form was taller than the medium, had a larger face and longer 
fingers; and whereas Florence Cook had black hair and a dark complexion, 
Katie's complexion was fair, and her hair a light auburn.  Moreover Sir 
William, enjoying as he did the complete confidence of Katie, had on more 
than one occasion the privilege of seeing her and Miss Cook at the same 
time.  But Miss Cook was not the only medium who was controlled by Katie 
King, who, with her father, John King, became in time a most popular spirit 
with materialisation mediums.  From that time onwards materialisation was 
extensively practised both by private and professional mediums, among the 
number being Mrs. Showers and her daughter, Rita, Miss Lottie Fowler, 
William Eglinton and D. D. Home; while in recent years materialisations are 
stated to have occurred in the presence of Eusapia Palladino. Many sitters 
claimed to see in these draped figures and veiled faces the form and 
features of deceased relatives and friends, though frequently there was but 
the smallest ground for such a claim--parents recognised their daughter by 
her hair, a man recognised his mother by the Sort of cap she wore, and so 
on. There is no doubt that fraud entered, and still enters, very largely 
into materialisation stances.  Lay figures, muslin draperies, false hair, 
and similar properties have been found in the possession of mediums; accom-
plices have been smuggled into the stance-room; lights are frequently turned 
low or extinguished altogether.. Add to this the fact that other spirits 
besides  Katie have on being grasped resolved themselves into the person of 
the medium, and it will be seen that scepticism is not altogether. 
unjustified. Then, as already mentioned, the rash and premature recognition 
of deceased friends in draped forms whose resemblance to the medium is 
patent to the less-interested observer, has also done much to ruin the case 
for genuine spirit moterialisation,  Yet that there is a case we must 
believe on the assertion of some of the most distinguished of modern 
investigators, men fully alive to the possibilities of fraud, trained to 
habits of correct observation. M. Flammarion felt constrained to attribute 
the materialisations he had witnessed in the presence of Eusapia Palladino 
to fluidic emanations from the medium's person,. while judging the 
recognition accorded to them the result of illusion.' Others state that the 
physical organisation formed by the spirit is composed of fine particles of 
matter drawn from the material world. By way of explaining the numerous 
exposures that have been made from time to time various theories of a more 
or less ingenious character have been advanced by spiritualists. In a case 
of obvious fraud they declare that the spirits have controlled the medium to 
secrete wigs and draperies in the cabinet.  If a spirit on being held by a 
sitter proves to be the medium herself an explanation is also forthcoming. 
The medium, it is said, imparts to the spirit a certain portion of her vital 
energy, so that the spirit may " mani-fest."  When the latter is ruthlessly 
grasped these two portions of the medium's vital spirits tend to re-unite, 
so that either the medium will draw the spirit into the cabinet, or the 
spirit will draw the medium out,  the reason that the union generally takes 
place without the cabinet is that the medium has imparted to the control 
more of her energy than she had retained.

Matikon  A mystical work printed at Frankfort in 1784, whose theories 
resemble the doctrines of the Brahmins. The following is an example of its 
teachings,  Before the Fall, Adam was a pure spirit, a celestial being, 
surrounded by a mystic covering which rendered him incapable of being 
affected by any poison of nature, or by the power of the elements. The 
physical body, therefore, is but a coarse husk in which, having lost his 
primitive invulner-ability, man shelters from the elements. In his condition 
of perfect glory and perfect happiness Adam was a natural king, ruling all 
things visible and invisible, and showing forth the power of the Almighty. 
He also bore "a fiery, two-edged, all-piercing lance,"-a living word, which 
united all powers within itself, and by means of which he could perform all 
things.

Medea: An enchantress, daughter of the king of Colchis, who fell in love 
with Jason when he came to that country, and enabled him to slay the 
sleepless dragon that guarded the golden fleece.  She fled from Colchis with 
Jason who made her his wife, and from whom she exacted a pledge never to 
love another woman.  Her young brother, having been found on board the ship 
they sailed in, she tore him in pieces and flung him into the sea.  She 
accompanied Jason to Greece, where she was looked on as a barbarian, but 
having conciliated King Peleus who was now a very old man, she induced him 
to try to regain youth by bathing in a magic cauldron of which she was to 
prepare the contents. So great was his faith in her powers, that the old man 
unhesitatingly plunged into her cauldron and was boiled alive.  Her reason 
for this frightful act of cruelty was to hasten the succession to the throne 
of Jason, who in due course would have succeeded Peleus; but now the Greeks 
would have none of either him or Medea, and he was forced to leave Iolcos.  
Growing tired of the formidable enchantress to whom he had bound himself, 
Jason sought to contract an alliance with Glauce, a young prin-cess.  
Dissembling her real intentions, Medea feigned friendship with the bride-
elect and sent her as a wedding present a garment. which as soon as Glauce 
put it on, caused her to die in the greatest agony.  She - Medea - parted 
from Jason; having murdered her two children by him, she fled from Corinth 
in her car drawn by dragons, to Athens, where she married Argeus, by whom 
she had a son, Medus.  But the discovery of an attempt on the life of 
Theseus, forced her to leave Athens.  Accompanied by her son, she returned 
to Colchis, and restored her father to the throne, of which he had been 
deprived by his own brother Perses.  A great amount of literature has been 
written around Medea: Euripides, Ennius, Aeschylus, and later, Thomas 
Corneille having made her the theme of tragedies.  (See Greece.)

Medicine, Occult : " The whole power of the occult physi-cian," says Eliphas 
Levi, " is in the conscience of his will, while his whole art consists in 
exciting the faith of his patient.  ' If you have faith,' says the Master, 
'all things are possible to him who believes.'  The confidence must be 
dominated by expression, tone, gesture;  confidence must be inspired by a 
fatherly manner, and cheerfulness stimulated by seasonable and sprightly 
conversations. Rabelais, who was a greater magician than he seemed, made 
pantagruelism his special panacea.  He compelled his patients to laugh, and 
all the remedies be subsequently gave them succeeded better in consequence; 
he established a magnetic sympathy between himself and them, by means of 
which he communicated to them his own confidence and good humour; he 
flattered them in his prefaces, termed them his precious, most illustrious 
patients, and dedicated his books to them. So are we convinced that 
Gargantua and Pantagruel cured more black humours, more tendencies to 
madness, more atrabilious whims, at that epoch of religious animosities and 
civil wars, than the whole Faculty of medicine could boast.  Occult medicine 
is essentially sympathetic.  Reciprocal affection, or at least real good 
will, must exist between doctor and patient. Syrups and juleps have very 
little inherent virtue; they are what they become through the mutual opinion 
of operator and subject hence homeopathic medicines dispenses with them and 
no serious inconvenience follows. Oil and wine, combined with salt or 
camphor, are sufficient for the healing of all afflictions, and for all 
external frictions or soothing applications, oil and wine, are the chief 
medica-ments of the Gospel tradition. They formed the balm of the Good 
Samaritan, and in the Apocalypse. when des-cribing the last plagues, the 
prophet prays the avenging powers to spare these substances, that is, to 
leave a hope and a remedy for so many wounds. What we term extreme unction 
was the pure and simple practice of the Master's traditional medicine, both 
for the early Christians and in the mind of the apostle Saint James, who has 
included the precept in his epistle to the faithful of the whole world. Is 
any man sick among you,' he writes, ' let him call in the priests of the 
church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of 
the Lord.' This divine therapeutic science was lost gradually, and Extreme 
Unction came to be regarded as a religious formality necessary as a 
preparation for death. At the same time, the thaumaturgic virtue of 
consecrated oil could not be altogether effaced from remembrance by the 
traditional doctrine, and it is perpetuated in the passage of the cate-chism 
which refers to Extreme Unction. Faith and charity were the most signal 
healing powers among the early Christians. The source of most diseases is in 
moral disorders; we must begin by healing the soul, and then the cure of the 
body will follow quickly."


Medieval Magic : In the belief of the medieval professors of the science of 
magic, it conferred upon the adept power over angels, demons, elementary 
spirits and the souls of the dead, the possession of esoteric wisdom, and 
actual knowledge of the discovery and use of the latent forces and 
undeveloped energies resident in man. This was supposed to be accomplished 
by a combination of will and aspiration. which by sheer force germinate a 
new intellectual faculty of psychological perception, enabling the adept to 
view the wonders of a new world and communicate with its inhabitants. To 
accomplish this the ordinary faculties were almost invariably heightened by 
artificial means. The grandeur of the magical ritual overwhelmed the neo-
phyte, and wondrously quickened his senses. Ceremonial magic was a 
marvellous spur to the latent faculties of man's psychic nature, just as 
were the rich concomitants of religious mysticism. In the medieval mind, as 
in other periods of man's history, it was thought that magic could be 
employed both for good and evil purposes,-its branches being designated 
"white," and " black," as it is used for benevolent or wicked ends.  The 
term " red " magic is also occasionally employed. as indicating a more 
exalted type of the art, but the designation is fanciful. White magic, to a 
great extent, concerned itself with the evocation of angelic forces and of 
the spirits of the elements.  The angelology of the Catholic Church was 
undoubtedly derived from the ancient faith of Israel, which in turn was 
indebted to Egypt and Babylon; and the Alexandrian system of successive 
emanations from the one and eternal substance, evolved a complex hierarchy 
of angels, all of whom appear to have been at the bidding of him who was in 
possession of the Incommunicable Name,-a concept borrowed purely from that 
of the Name of Power so greatly made use of in Egyptian magic (See Egypt.) 
The letters which composed this name were thought to possess a great measure 
of occult significance, and a power which in turn appears to have been 
reflected upon the entire Hebrew alphabet (See Kabala), which was thus 
endowed with mystical meaning, each of the letters representing a vital and 
creative number. Just as a language is formed from the letters of its 
alphabet, so from the secret powers which resided in the Hebrew alphabet, 
were evolved magical variations.  From the letter ' aleph " to that of " jod 
" the angelical world was symbolised.  From " caf" to " tsed '  were 
represented the several orders of angels who inhabited the various spheres, 
each of which 'gas under the direction of a particu-lar intelligence.  From 
" tsed " to " than " is in secret correspondence with the elemental world ; 
so that there were intelligences in correspondence with each of the Hebrew 
letters,-
"aleph" with the Haioth-ha-kodesch of the seraphim, the first and supreme 
angelical rank;
beth " the second letter with the ophanim or angels of the second order; " 
gimel " with the aralim or angels of the third order, and so on to the tenth 
letter" jod," which com pletes the enumeration of the angelical spheres.  
The rest of the Hebrew alphabet, however, corresponds to individual 
principalities and powers-all of whom hold an important place in the 
mystical universe.  Thus  caf the eleventh letter is in correspondence with 
Mettatron who belongs to the first heaven of the astronomic world. Final " 
caf," the next letter, corresponds to the intelligences of the secret order 
whose supreme chief is Raziel ; “and lamed " the twelfth letter corresponds 
to those of the third sphere, that of Saturn, whose lord is Schebtaiel: and 
so on : these intelligences under their queen, with the sixteenth letter  am   
and " pe" the seventeenth of the Hebrew alphabet, refer to the first of the 
mystical elements-that of Fire, which is ruled over by the seraphim.  Final 
“pe " corresponds to the air where dwell the sylphs, who are presided over 
by Ariel.  
"Tsade" refers to water where dwell the nymphs under their queen Tharsis; 
and koph" corresponds to earth, the sphere of the gnomes, ruled over by the 
cherubim.  The twentieth letter “resh”
applies to the animal kingdom, including man.   “Shin" corresponds to the 
vegetable world.  'Tau" the last symbol of the Hebrew alphabet refers to the 
world of minerals.  There are besides these many other species of angels and 
powers, as will be seen from reference to the articles on  ' Angels"  and  ' 
Kabala."  More exalted intelligences were conjured by rites to be found in 
the ancient book known as the Key of Solomon, and perhaps the most 
satisfactory collection of formulae for the invoca-tion of the higher angels 
is that included in the anonymous Theosophia Pneumatica, published at 
Frankfort in 1686, which bears a strong family resemblance to the Treatise 
on Magic by Arbatel. The names in this work do not tally with those which 
have been already given, but as it is admitted by occult students that the 
names of all unseen beings are really unknown to humanity, this does not 
seem of such importance as it might at first sight.  It would seem that such 
spiritual knowledge as the medieval magus was capable of attaining was 
insufficient to raise him above the intellectual limitations of his time, so 
that the work in question possesses all the faults of its age and type.  But 
that is not to say that it is possessed of no practical value: and it may be 
taken as well-illustrating the white magic of medieval times.  It classifies 
the names of the angels under the title of Olympic or Celestial Spirits, who 
abide in the firmament and constellations  they administer inferior 
destinies and accomplish and teach whatever is portended by the several 
stars in which they are insphered.  They are powerless to act without a 
special command from the Almighty. The stewards of Heaven are seven in 
number-Arathron, Bethor, Phaleg, Och, Hagith, Ophiel, and Phul.  Each of 
them has a numerous host at his command, and the regions in which they dwell 
are 196 in all.  Arathron appears on Saturday at the first hour, and answers 
for his territory and its inhabitants; as do the others, each at his own day 
and hour  and each presides for a period of 490 years.  The functions of 
Bethor began in the fiftieth year before the birth of Christ 430.  Phagle 
reigned till A.D. 920; Och till the year 1410; Hagith governed until A.D. 
1900. The others follow in succession. These intelligences are the stewards 
of all the elements, energising the firmament and, with their armies, 
depending from each other in a regular hierarchy.  The names of the minor 
Olympian spirits are interpreted in divers ways, but those alone are 
powerful which they themselves give, which are adapted to the end for which 
they have been summoned.  Generic-ally, they are called Astra, and their 
power is seldom prolonged beyond one hundred and forty years. The heavens 
and their inhabitants come voluntarily to man and often serve against even 
the will of man, but how much more if we implore their ministry. That evil 
and troublesome spirits also approach men is accomplished by the cunning of 
the devil, at times by conjuration or attrac-tion, and frequently as a 
penalty for sins  therefore, shall he who would abide in familiarity with 
celestial intelligences take pains to avoid every serious sin; be shall 
diligently pray for the protection of God to vanquish the impediments and 
schemes of Diabolus, and God will ordain that the devil himself shall work 
to the direct profit of the Theoso-phist. Subject to Divine Providence, some 
spirits have power over pestilence and famine, some are destroyers of 
cities, like those of Sodom and Gomorrah, some are rulers over kingdoms, 
some guardians of provinces, some of a single person. The spirits are the 
ministers of the word of God, of the Church and its members, or they serve 
creatures in material things, sometimes to the salvation of soul and body, 
or, again, to the ruin of both.  But nothing, good or bad, is done without 
knowledge, order, and administration.
     It is unnecessary to follow the angelical host farther here, as we have 
outlined it elsewhere.  Many preparations, however, are described by the 
author of the Theosophia Pneumatica for the successful evocation of these 
exalted beings. The magus must ponder during his period of initiation on the 
method of attaining the true knowledge of God, both by night and day.  He 
must know the laws of the cosmos, and the practical secrets which may be 
gleaned from the study of the visible and invisible creatures of God.  He 
must further know himself, and be able to distinguish between his mortal and 
immortal parts, and the several spheres to which they belong.  Both in his 
mortal and immortal natures, he shall strive to love God, to adore and to 
fear him in spirit and in truth.  He must sedulously attempt to find out 
whether he is fitted for the practice of magic, and if so to what branch he 
should turn his talents, experimenting in all to discover in which be is 
most naturally gifted.  He must hold inviolate such secrets as are 
communicated to him by spirits, and he must accustom himself to their 
evocation.  He must keep him-self, however, from the least suspicion of 
diabolical magic, which has to do with Satan, and which is the perversion of 
the theurgic power concealed in the word of God.  When he has fulfilled 
these conditions, and before he proceeds to the practice of his art, he 
should devote a prefatory period to deep contemplation on the high business 
which he has voluntarily taken in hand, and must present himself before God 
with a pure heart, undefiled mouth and innocent hands. He must bathe 
frequently and wear clean gar-ments, confess his sins and abstain from wine 
for the space of three days.  On the eve of operation, he must dine sparely 
at noon, and sup on bread and water, and on the day he has chosen for the 
invocation he must seek a retired and uncontaminated spot, entirely free 
from observation. After offering up prayer, he compels the spirit which he 
has chosen to appear: that is, he has passed into a con-dition, when it is 
impossible that the spirit should remain invisible to him.  On the arrival 
of the angel, the desire of the magus is briefly communicated to him, and 
his answer is written down. More than three questions should not be asked, 
and the angel is then dismissed into his special sphere.  Besides having 
converse with angels, the magus had also power over the spirits of the 
elements. The reader is referred to the special article upon these, and we 
shall confine ourselves in this place to describing the manner of their 
evocation.  To obtain power over the salamanders for example, the Comte de 
Gabalis gives the following receipt:   If you would recover empire over the 
salaman-ders, purify and exalt the natural fire that is within you. Nothing 
is required for this purpose but the concentration of the Fire of the World 
by means of concave mirrors in a globe of glass.  In that globe is formed 
the ‘solary’ powder, which being of itself purified from the mixture of 
other elements, and being prepared according to Art be-comes in a very short 
time a sovereign process for the exaltation of the fire that is within you, 
and transmutes you into an igneous nature." There is very little matter 
extant to show in what manner the evocation of Elementary spirits was 
undertaken, and no ritual has survived which will acquaint us with the 
method of communicating with them.  In older writers it is difficult to 
distinguish between angels and elementary spirits, and it is probable that 
the lesser angels of the older magicians were the sylphs of Paracelsus, and 
the more modern professors of the art. The lower hierarchies of the 
elementary spirits were also frequently invoked by the black magician.  
Eliphas Levi provides a method for the interrogation and government of 
elementary spirits ; but he does not acquaint us with its source, and it is 
merely fragmentary.   It is necessary," he says,  in order to dominate these 
intelligences, to undergo the four trials of ancient initiation, and as 
these are unknown, their room must be supplied by similar tests.  To 
approach the salamanders, therefore, one must expose himself in a burning 
house.  To draw near the sylphs he must cross a precipice on a plank, or 
ascend a lofty mountain in a storm; and he who would win to the abode of the 
undines must plunge into a cascade or whirl-pool.  Thus power being acquired 
through courage and indomitable energy this fire, earth and water must be 
consecrated and exorcised."
     The air is exorcised by the sufflation of the four cardinal points, the 
recitation of the prayer of the sylphs, and by the following formula -The 
Spirit of God moved upon the water, and breathed into the nostrils of man 
the breath of life.  Be Michael my leader, and be Sabtabiel my ser-vant, in 
the name and by the virtue of light.  Be the power of the word in my breath, 
and I will govern the spirits of this creature of Air, and by the will of my 
soul, I will restrain the steeds of the sun,, and by the thought of my mind, 
and by the apple of my right eye.  I exorcise thee O creature of Air, by the 
Petagrammaton, and in the name Tetragrammaton, wherein are steadfast will 
and well-directed faith.  Amen.  Sela.  So be it.
     Water is exorcised by the laying on of hands, by breath-ing and by 
speech, and by mixing sacred salt with a little of the ash which is left in 
an incense pan. The aspergillus is made of branches of vervain, periwinkle, 
sage, mint, ash, and basil, tied by a thread taken from a virgin's distaff, 
with a handle of hazelwood which has never borne fruit. and on which the 
characters of the seven spirits must be graven with the magic awl. The salt 
and ashes of the incense must be separately consecrated.  The prayer of the 
undines should follow.
     Fire is exorcised by casting salt, incense, white resin, camphor and 
sulphur therein, and by thrice pronouncing the three names of the genii of 
fire-Michael, Samael, and Anael, and then by reciting the prayer of the 
salamanders.
     The Earth is exorcised by the sprinkling of water, by breathing, and by 
fire, and the prayer of the gnomes. Their signs are the hieroglyphs of the 
Bull for the Gnomes who are commanded with the magic sword ; of the Lion for 
the Salamanders, who are commanded with the forked rod, or magic trident; of 
the Eagle for the Slyphs, who are ruled by the holy pentacles; and, finally, 
of Aquarius for the Undines, who are evoked by the cup of libations. Their 
respective sovereigns are Gob for the Gnomes, Djin for the Salamanders, 
Paralda for the Sylphs, and Necksa for the Undines.  These names, it will be 
noticed, are borrowed from folklore.
     The " laying " of an elementary spirit is accomplished by its 
adjuration by air, water, fire, and earth, by breath-ing, sprinkling, the 
burning of perfumes, by tracing on the ground the' Star of Solomon and the 
sacred Pentagram, which should be drawn either with ash of consecrated fire 
or with a reed soaked in various colours, mixed with pure loadstone. The 
Conjuration of the Four should then be repeated, the magus holding the 
pentacle of Solomon in his hand and taking up by turns the sword, red and 
cup,-this operation being preceded and terminated by the Kabal-istic sign of 
the cross. In order to subjugate an elementary spirit, the magus must be 
himself free of their besetting sins; thus a changeful person cannot rule 
the sylphs, nor a fickle one the undines, an angry man the salamanders, or a 
covetous one the gnomes.  We have given elsewhere (See Necromancy) the 
formula for the evocation of spirits, so there is no necessity to repeat it 
in this place. The white magician did not concern himself as a rule with 
such matters as the raising of demons, animal transformations and the like, 
his whole desire being the exaltation of his spiritual nature; and the 
questions put by him to the spirits he evoked were all directed to that end.

Medina, Michael : (See Healing by Touch.)


Medium : A person supposed to be qualified in some special manner to form a 
link between the dead and the living Through him the spirits of the departed 
may communicate with their friends still on earth, either by making use of 
the material organism of the medium himself (" automatic phenomena") or by 
producing in the physical world certain manifestations which cannot be 
explained by known physical laws.  The essential qualification of a medium 
is an abnormal sensitiveness, which enables him to be readily  controlled " 
by disembodied spirits.  For this reason mediums are also known as 
sensitives.  There is some doubt as to whether mediumship is an inherent 
faculty, or whether it may be acquired; and among some spiritualists at 
least, the belief is held that all men are mediums, though in varying 
degrees, and consequently that all are in communication with the spirits, 
from whom proceeds what we call  inspiration."  Those who are ordinarily 
designated  mediums" are but gifted with the common faculty in a higher 
degree than their fellows.
     Mediumship, like all the central doctrines of spiritualism, dates back 
to very early times.  Demoniac possession affords an excellent instance ; so 
also does witchcraft, while the somnambule of the mesmerists was identical 
with the modern medium.  In its usual application, how-ever, the term medium 
is used only of those sensitives who belong to the modern spiritualistic 
movement, which had its origin in America in 1848 (See Spiritualism.) In 
this sense, then, Mrs. Fox and her daughters, the heroines of the Rochester 
Rappings, were the earliest mediums. The phenomena of their stances 
consisted mainly of knockings, by means of which messages were conveyed from 
the spirits to the sitters.  Other mediums rapidly sprang up, first in 
America, and later in Britain and the Continent.  Their mediumship was of 
two kinds,  physical" and automatic. These phases were to be found either 
separately or com-bined in one person, as in the case of the Rev. Stainton 
Moses (q.v.)  Indeed, it was practically impossible to find a trance speaker 
who did not at one time or another practise the physical manifestations, 
until the time of Mrs. Piper, whose phenomena were purely subjective.  The 
early rappings speedily developed into more elaborate manifesta-tions.  For 
a few years an epidemic of table-turning (q.v.) caused wide-spread 
excitement, and the motions of the table became a favourite means of 
communicating with the spirits.  The playing of musical instruments without 
visible agency was a form of manifestation which received the attention of 
mediums from an early date, as was also the bringing into the stance-room of 
"apports" of fruit, flowers, perfume, and all manner of portable property. 
Darkness was found to facilitate the spirit-manifestations, and as there are 
certain physical processes, such as those in photography, to which darkness 
is essential, no logical objection could be offered to the dimness of the 
stance-room. The members of the circle were generally seated round a table, 
holding each other's hands, and they were often enjoined to sing or talk 
pending the materialisation of a spirit.  All this, though offering grounds 
of suspicion to the incredulous, was plausibly explained by the spiritual-
ists.  As time went on, and the demand for physical mani-festations 
increased, these became more daring and more varied.  The moving of objects 
without contact, the levitation of heavy furniture, and of the persons of 
medium or sitters, the elongation of the human body, the fire-ordeal, were 
all practised by the medium Home.  At the stances of the Davenport Brothers 
musical instruments were played and moved about the room, and objects moved 
without being touched, while the mediums were bound hand and foot in a small 
cabinet.  The slate-writing of " Dr." Slade and William Eglinton had a 
considerable vogue.  The tying of knots in endless cords, the passage of 
solids, through solids, were commonplaces of the mediumistic circle.  The 
crowning achievement, however, was the materialisation of the spirit-form.  
Quite early in the history of spiritualism hands were materialised, then 
faces, and finally the complete form of the ' control." Thereafter the 
materialised spirits allowed themselves to be touched, and even 
condescended, on occasion, to hold conversations with the sitters.  Further 
proof of the actuality of the spirit " control " was offered by spirit 
photography (q.v.).
     To those for whom spiritualism was a religion, however, much the most 
important part of the mediumistic per-formances is the trance-utterances and 
the like which come under the heading of   automatic," or psychological 
phenomena.  These dealt largely with the conditions of life on the other 
side of the grave, and in style they tended to be verbose and incoherent.  
The spirit-drawings, also, were lacking in depths and distinction.  
Clairvoyance and crystal vision are included in tile psychological 
phenomena, and so also are the pseudo-prophetic utterances of mediums, and 
the speaking in unknown tongues.  According to the spiritualistic hypothesis 
already referred to, that  all men are mediums," it would be necessary to 
class inspiration, not only the inspiration of genius, but all good or evil 
impulses-as spiritual phenomena, and that in turn suggests that the every-
day life of the normal individual is to some extent directed by spirit " 
controls." And therein lies the responsibility of mediumship, for if he 
would be con trolled by pure spirits from the higher spheres, it behoves the 
medium to live a well-conducted and principled life. Misuse of the divine 
gift of mediumship carries with it its own punishment, for the medium 
becomes the sport of base human spirits and elementals (q.v.), his will is 
sapped, and his whole being degraded.  Likewise he must be wary of a    up 
his personality to the first spirit who comes his way, for the low and 
earth-bound spirits have least difficulty in communicating with the living, 
having still more affinity with the things of the earth than with those of 
the spirit.
     Of the physical mediums perhaps the most successful was Daniel Dunglas 
Home (1833-1886), who claimed to be of Scottish birth. He went to America, 
however, at an early age. and it was there that his mediumistic powers were 
first developed, though not until he came to Britain in 1855 did he rise to 
fame.  It is worthy of note that Home was never detected in fraud-as the 
bulk of physical mediums have been at one time or another-though his 
performances were similar in kind to those of other mediums. This may be due 
in part to the fact that he did not act as a professional medium, and his 
sitters, being either his guests or his hosts, were doubtless restrained by 
courtesy from a too close enquiry into his methods.  Again, all who came 
into contact with him were impressed by his simple manners, and frank and 
affectionate disposition, so that he possessed the most valuable asset of a 
medium-the ability to inspire confidence in his sitters.  Mediums of a 
different stamp, though widely popular in their day, were the brothers 
Davenport.  Their performance consisted of allowing themselves to be 
securely bound in a cabinet by the sitters, and while thus handicapped 
producing the usual medium-istic phenomena. The Davenports were shown to be 
mere conjurers. however, and when Maskelyne and Cook success-fully imitated 
their feats the exposure was complete. Slate-writing, which proved one of 
the most widely-accepted forms of psychic phenomena, had as its principal 
exponents Henry Slade and William Eglinton.  The best argument which can be 
advanced against their feats is to be found in the pseudo-stances of Mr. S. 
J. Davey, given in the interests of the Society for Psychical Research.  Mr. 
Davey's slate-writing exhibitions were so like to those of the professional 
mediums that the spiritualists refused to believe that he was conjuring, and 
hailed him as a renegade medium!  Automatic drawing was principally 
represented by David Duguid, a Glasgow medium who attained con-siderable 
success in that line.  Prominent trance speakers and writers were Duguid, J. 
J. Morse, Mrs. Hardinge Britten, and Mrs. Cora L. V. Tappan-Richmond.  One 
of the best-known and most respected of private mediums was the Rev. 
Stainton Muses (1839-92), a clergyman and schoolmaster, whose normal life, 
at least, was beyond reproach.  He produced both automatic and physical 
manifestations, the former including the writing of a work Spirit Teachings, 
dictated from time to time by his spirit controls," while the latter 
comprised levitations, lights. "apports," and so on.  His position, 
character, and education gave to his support of spiritualism a stability of 
considerable value.
     It is to later mediums, however, that we must look for proof worthy of 
scientific consideration, and of these the most important are Eusapia 
Palladino and Mrs. Piper. Eusapia Palladino, an Italian medium, was born in 
1854, and for a good many years had acted as medium for scientific 
investigators.  In 1892 stances were held at Milan, at which were present 
Professors Schiaparelli, Brofferio, Lobmroso, Richet, and others.  In 1894 
Professor Richet conducted some experiments with Eusapia at his house in the 
Ile Roubaud, to which he invited Professor Lodge, Mr.Myers, and Dr. 
Ochorowiez. The phenomena occurring in Eusapia's presence were the ordinary 
manifestations of the mediumistic seance, but their interest lay in the fact 
that all the distinguished investigators professed themselves satisfied that 
the medium, with her hands, head, and feet controlled by the sitters, could 
not of herself produce the phenomena.  Credible witnesses asserted that 
Eusapia possessed the ability to project false or psychic limbs from her 
person.  Professor Lodge and Mr. Myers were disposed to look for a new force 
(ectenic force) emanating from the medium.  In 1895, however, some seances 
with Eusapia were held at Mr. Myers' house at Cambridge, where it became 
apparent that she habitually freed a hand or a foot-in short, habitually 
resorted to fraud. Yet even these exposures were not conclusive for in 1898, 
after a further series of experiments, Mr. Myers and Professors Lodge and 
Richet once more declared their belief in the genuineness of this medium's 
phenomena.
     Mrs. Piper, the Boston medium whose trance utterances and writings 
contain the best evidence forthcoming in recent years for the truth of 
spiritualism, first fell into a spontaneous trance in 1884, and in the 
following year was observed by Professor James of Harvard.  Thereafter her 
case was carefully studied by the Society for Psychical Research.  Her first 
important " control" was a French physician, Dr. Phinuit, who was probably a 
fiction, but in 1892 she was controlled by George Pelham, a young author who 
had died in February of that year.  So complete was her impersonation of 
Pelham that more than thirty of his friends claimed to recognise him, and so 
well did he establish his identity by the mention of many private matters, 
known only to himself and a few of his friends that the hypothesis of 
spirit-control was almost inevitable.  In 18g6 George Pelham gave place to" 
Imperator," " Rector," and other spirits, who had formerly controlled 
Stainton Moses.  From that time, and especially after 1900, the interest of 
the sittings declined, and they offered less material for the investigator.  
Another automatic medium, Hele'ne Smith, came under the observation of 
Professor Flournoy.  Helene's trance utterances were spoken in the Martian 
language," a variant of the " unknown tongue" of the early ecstatics, and 
she claimed to be a re-incarnation of Marie Antoinette and a Hindu princess.
     Of the various theories advanced to explain the medium-istic 
manifestations the most important is the spiritualistic explanation, which 
claims that the phenomena are pro-duced by the spirits of the dead acting on 
the sensitive organism of the medium.  The evidence for such a theory, 
though some investigators of the highest distinction have found it 
satisfactory, is nevertheless generally acknowledged to be inconclusive.  
Conscious fraud, though it is no longer considered to cover the whole 
ground, yet plays a definite part in the phenomena of both "physical" and 
trance mediums, for it has been shown that the latter frequently collect, 
through private enquiry agents, information anent possible sitters which is 
later retailed by the " controls." The spiritualist's explanation of these 
lapses into fraud is that they are instigated by the spirits themselves.  
And it does not seem impossible that a genuine medium might have resort to 
fraud during a temporary failure of his psychic powers.  Automatism. covers 
a still wider field. That automatic utterances, writing, drawing, etc., may 
be quite involuntary, and without the sphere of the medium's normal 
consciousness, is no longer to be doubted The psychological phenomena may be 
met with in small children, and in private mediums whose good faith is 
beyond question, and the state is recognised as being allied to hypnotism 
and hysteria.  Besides automatism and fraud there are some other factors to 
be considered ere the possibility of transcendental faculties be touched 
upon.
     On the part of the sitter as well as of the medium some deception may 
be practised.  It has been said that the ability to inspire confidence in 
his sitters is essential to a successful medium, and if at the same time the 
sitters be predisposed to believe in the supernatural nature of the 
manifestations, it is easy to imagine a lessening of the attention and 
observation so necessary to the investigator. The impossibility of continued 
observation for even a short period is a fact that can only be proved by 
experiment. Memory defects and proneness to exaggeration are also 
accountable for many of the marvels of the seance-room, and possible 
hallucination must be considered.  When the medium is in a trance, with its 
accompanying hyperaesthesia, unconscious suggestion on the part of the 
sitters might offer a rational explanation of so-called "clairvoyance."  But 
when all these factors are removed the root problems of mediumship still 
remain.  In the case of Mrs. Piper for instance, the least that can be said 
for her trance utterances is that they were telepathic  that she gathered 
information from the minds of her sitters, or through them from other living 
minds.  To not a few, however, they presented definite proof  of spirit 
communication.  To meet such instances Mr. Myers formulated his doctrine of 
transcen-dental faculties, crediting the medium with clairvoyance and pre-
vision.  But no really conclusive test has ever been complied with.  
Psychical researchers have left sealed letters, whose contents are known 
only to themselves, instructing that after their deaths the letters be 
submitted to a medium, but in no case have the contents been correctly 
revealed.  Again, in the case of Eusapia Palladino, Mr. Myers, Sir Oliver 
Lodge, and others have inclined to the belief in a force emanating from the 
medium herself by which the physical manifestations are produced.  Here, 
also, the evidence cannot be considered conclusive.  Skilled and scientific 
investigators have from time to time been deceived by what has actually 
proved to be sleight of hand, and, in fact, the only trustworthy evidence 
possible would be that of automatic records.
     At the same time the testimony of such distinguished gentlemen as 
Professor Richet, Sir O. Lodge, and others makes it evident that judgment 
must not be hastily pro-nounced on the medium, but rather that an earnest 
endea-vour be made to solve the problems in that connection.
     Healing Mediums.-The diagnosis and cure of disease have been 
extensively practised by spiritualistic mediums, following in the path of 
the older somnambules and magnetic subjects. These latter were wont not only 
to trace the progress of their own diseases, but also to diagnose and to 
prescribe a mode of treatment. At the outset it was not prescribed for the 
diseases of those with whom they were in rapport  and likewise the medium, 
having established rapport between his control and the patient, was 
influenced to prescribe a mode of treatment  At the outset it was not 
considered proper for the healing medium to accept any remuneration for his 
services, but later healers usually demanded a fee.  It is true that healing 
mediums, like Christian Scientists, mesmerists, magnetists, and others, have 
effected a considerable proportion of bone fide cures, but whether by spirit 
influence or suggestion is a point on which there is too much diversity of 
opinion for it to be discussed here.  It is claimed for many mediums that 
they have cured diseases of long standing, which were pronounced incurable-
heart disease, consumption, cancers, paralysis, and many more.  Some also 
have been credited with the power to heal instantaneously, as did the Cure 
d'Ars and other miraculous healers.  The marvellous potency of the waters at 
Lourdes is considered by spiritualists to be the gift of discarnate beings, 
having been in the first instance revealed to a child by her spirit guide, 
in the form of a white angel.

Melusina  The most famous of the fays of France. Being condemned to turn 
into a serpent from the waist down-wards every Saturday, she made her 
husband, Count Raymond of Lusignan, promise never to come near her on a 
Saturday. This prohibition finally exciting his curiosity and suspicion, he 
hid himself and witnessed his wife's transformation.  Melusina was now 
compelled to quit her mortal husband and destined to wander about as a 
spectre till the day of doom.  It is said also that the count immured her in 
the dungeon of his castle.


Mental World : Formerly known as the Manas Plane-is in the theosophic scheme 
of things, the third lowest of the seven worlds.  It is the world of thought 
into which man passes on the death of the astral body, and it is composed of 
the seven divisions of matter in common with the other worlds.  It is 
observed that the mental world is the world of thought, but it is necessary 
to realise that it is the world of good thoughts only, for the base have all 
been purged away during the soul's stay in the astral world.  According as 
these thoughts are, is the power to perceive the mental world.  Perfected 
man would be free of the whole of it, but the ordinary man has in his past 
imperfect experience, gathered only a comparatively small amount of thought 
and he is, therefore. unable to perceive more than a com-paratively small 
part of his surroundings.  It follows from this that though his bliss is 
inconceivably great, his sphere of action is very limited,-this limitation, 
however, becom-ing less and less with his abode there after each fresh 
incarnation.  In the Heaven world-division into which he awakes after dying 
in the astral world, he finds vast, un-thought-of means of pursuing what has 
seemed to him good, art, science, philosophy and so forth.  Here, all those 
come to a glorious fruition of which we can have no conception, and at last 
the time arrives when he casts aside his mental body and awakens in his 
casual body to the still greater bliss of the higher division of the mental 
world.  At this stage he has done with the bodies which form his mortal 
personality, and which form his home in successive incarnations, and he is 
now truly himself, a spirit, immortal and unchangeable except for increasing 
development and evolution.  Into his casual body is worked all that he has 
experienced in his physical, astral and mental bodies, and when he still 
finds that experience insufficient for his needs, he descends again into 
grosser matter in order that he may learn yet more and more.


Mephis or Memphitis: A stone which, when bruised to powder and drunk in 
water; causes insensibility to torture.


Mercury  Or quicksilver.  A metal which has been known of for many 
centuries, and which has played an important part in the history of alchemy.  
In its refined state it forms a coherent, very mobile liquid.  The early 
alchemists believed that nature formed all metals of mercury, and that it is 
a living and feminine principle.  It went through many processes, and the 
metal evolved was pure or impure according to the locality of its 
production.


Mercury of Life : (See Elixir of Life.)


Merlin : An enchanter of Britain who dwelt at the court of King Arthur.  His 
origin is obscure, but early legends concerning him agree that he was the 
offspring of Satan. He was probably an early Celtic god, who in process of 
time came to be regarded as a great sorcerer.  There appears to have been 
more than one Merlin, and we must discriminate between the Merlin of 
Arthurian romance and Merlin Caledonius; but it is probable that originally 
the two conceptions sprang from the one idea.



Mesmer, Franz Antoine : An Austrian doctor, born at Weil about the year 
'733.  In 1766 he took a degree in medicine at Vienna, the subject of his 
inaugural thesis being De planetarum Influxu (De l'influence des Planettes 
sur le corps humain)  The influence of the planets he identified with 
magnetism.  On seeing the remarkable cures of Gassner he supposed that the 
magnetic force must also reside in the human body, and thereupon dispensed 
with magnets.  In 1778 he went to Paris where he was very favourably 
received-by the public, that is, for the medical authorities there, as 
elsewhere, refused to countenance him. His method was to seat his patients 
round a large circular vat on baquet, in which various substances were 
mixed. Each patient held one end of an iron rod, the other end of which was 
in the baquet.  In due time the crisis ensued. Violent convulsions, cries, 
laughter, and various physical symptoms followed, these being in turn 
superseded by lethargy.  Many claimed to have been healed by this method.  
In 1784 the government appointed a commission of members of the Faculte de 
Medecine, the Societe Royale de Medecine, and the Academy of Sciences, the 
commission-ers from the latter body including Franklin, Bailly, and 
Lavoisier. The report of the Committee stated, in effect, that there was no 
such thing as animal magnetism, and referred the facts of the crisis to the 
imagination of the patient.  It had the effect of quenching to a 
considerable extent the public interest in mesmerism, as animal magnet-ism 
was called, for the time at least, though it was after-wards to be revived. 
Mesmer died in 1815.

Metals in Animal Magnetism It is recorded by the magnetists that the various 
metals exercised a characteristic influence on their patients.  Physical 
sensations of heat and cold numbness, drowsiness, and so on were experienced 
by the somnambules on contact with metals, or even when metals were secretly 
introduced into the room.  Dr. Elliotson, especially, gave much prominence 
to the alleged power of metal to transmit the magnetic fluid.  Gold, silver, 
plati-num, and nickel were good conductors, though the mag-netism conveyed 
by the latter was of a highly dangerous character.  Copper, tin, pewter, and 
zinc were bad con-ductors.  Elliotson found that a magnetised sovereign 
would throw into the trance his sensitives the sisters Okey, and that though 
iron would neutralise the magnetic pro-perties of the sovereign, no other 
metal would do so.  When Baron von Reichenbach propounded his theory of 
odylic force his sensitives saw a luminous emanation proceed from metals-
silver and gold shone white ; lead, blue  nickle, red, and so on.  All these 
phenomena may be referred to suggestion.


Metempsychosis, or Transmigration : The passing of the soul at death into 
another body than the one it has vacated. The belief in metempsychosis was 
very wide-spread in ancient times, and still survives in Braminism and 
Buddh-ism, as well as in European folk-tales and superstitions. The Brahmins 
and Buddhists believe that the soul may enter another human body) or that of 
one of the lower anima[s, or even a plant or tree, according to its deserts 
in the previous incarnation.  Thus it is doomed to suc-cessive- 
incarnations, till by the suppression of all desires and emotions it loses 
itself in the Supreme Being.  Very similar was the idea of Pythagoras and 
the Greeks, who believed that all material existence was a punishment for 
sins committed in a former incarnation.  Indeed it is probable that 
Pythagoras derived his theory from the Brahminical doctrine.  The ancient 
Egyptians would also seem to have believed in metempsychosis.  Among certain 
savage tribes of Africa and America transmigration is generally subscribed 
to at the present day.  These savages imagine the discarnate spirit very 
much out of its element till it has found another body to dwell in, which it 
does as speedily as possible.  Totemism may perhaps facilitate a belief in 
the passing of the soul into the body of an animal.  In Europe also in early 
times the belief in metempsychosis flourished, and several popular folk-
tiles, such as that known in Scotland as The Milk-white Doo, of which 
variants are found in many lands, contain references to the souls of the 
dead entering into beasts, birds, or fishes.  In some places it is thought 
that witches are at death transformed into hares, and for this reason the 
people of those localities refuse to eat a hare.  The Jewish Kabalists also 
believed in the doctrine of metempsychosis, and traces of it are to be found 
in the writings of Swedenborg.


Metratton : According to Jewish rabbinical legend, Met-ratton, the angel, is 
one of the agents by whom God the Father works.  He receives the pure and 
simple essence of the divinity and bestows the gift of life upon all.  He 
dwells in one of the angelic hierarchies.


Mexico and Central America : Occult science among the ancient Mexicans may 
be said to have been in that stage between the savage simplicities of 
medicine-men and the more sophisticated magical practices of the medieval 
sorcerer.  The sources which inform us regarding it are unfortunately of a 
most scanty description and are chiefly gleaned from the works of the early 
missionaries to the country, and from the legends and myths of the people 
themselves.  Writing upon the sorcerers of Mexico, Saha-gun, an early 
Spanish priest, states that the naualli or magician among the Mexicans is 
one who enchants men and sucks the blood of infants during the night. This 
would seem as if the writer had confounded the sorcerer with the vampire,-a 
mistake occasionally made by con-tinental writers on magic.  He proceeds to 
say that among the Mexicans this class is ignorant of nothing which apper-
tains to sorcery, and possesses great craft and natural address ; that they 
hire themselves out to people to work evil upon their enemies, and to cause 
madness and maladies.
     “The necromancer," he says,  is a person who has made pact with a 
demon, and who is capable of transforming himself into various animal 
shapes.  Such people appear to be tired of life and await death with 
complaisance. The astrologer practises among the people as a diviner, and 
has a thorough knowledge of the various signs of the calendar, from which he 
is able to prognosticate the for-tunes of those who employ him.  This he 
accomplishes by weighing the power of one planet against that of another, 
and thus discovering the resultant applies it to the case in point.  These 
men were called into consultation at births and deaths, as well as upon 
public occasions, and would dispute with much nicety on their art."  The 
astrological system of the Mexicans was like that of their calendar of the 
most involved description possible, and no mere summary of it could convey 
anything but a hazy notion of the system, for which the reader is referred 
to the author's Civilisation of Ancient Mexico, Sahagun's Historia, and 
Bulletin 28 of the United States Bureau of Ethnology.  In connection with 
the astrological science of the Aztecs, however, it is worthy of note that 
the seventh calendric sign, was that under which necromancers, sorcerers and 
evil-doers were usually born.  Says Sahagun: " These work their enchantments 
in obscurity for four nights running, when they choose a certain evil sign.  
They then betake themselves in the night to the houses where they desire to 
work their evil deeds and sorceries       For the rest these sorcerers never 
know contentment, for all their days they live evilly and know no peace."
     The myths of the Mexicans give us a good working idea of the status of 
the enchanter or sorcerer in Aztec society. For example we find that the 
Toltec god, Quetzalcoatl, who in early times was regarded as a description 
of culture-hero, was bewitched by the god of the incoming and rival race, 
Tezcatlipoca, who disguised himself as a physician and prescribed for an 
illness of his enemy's an enchanted draught, which made him long for the 
country of his origin-that is, the home of the rains.  From this we may 
judge that potions or philtres were in vogue amongst Mexican sorcerers.  In 
their efforts to rid themselves of the entire Toltec race, the traditional 
aborigines of Mexico, Tezcatlipoca is pictured as performing upon a magical 
drum in such a manner as to cause frenzy amongst the Toltecs, who leaped by 
thousands into a deep ravine hard by their city; and similar instances of 
the kind are occasionally to be met with. Wonderful stories are told of the 
feats of the Huaxteca, a people of Maya race, dwell-ing on the Gulf of 
Mexico.  Sahagun relates that they could produce from space a spring with 
fishes, burn and restore a hut, and dismember and resurrect themselves. The 
Ocuiltec of the Toluca Valley also possessed a wide-spread reputation as 
enchanters and magicians.
     Divination and Augury.-As has been said, divination was practised among 
the Aztecs by means of astrology; but there were other and less-intricate 
methods in use. There was in existence a College of Augurs corresponding in 
purpose. to the Auspices of Ancient Rome, the members of which occupied 
themselves with observing the flight and listening to the songs of birds, 
from which they drew their conclusions, and pretended to interpret the 
speech of all winged creatures.  The Calmecac, or training college of the 
priests, had a department where divination was taught in all its branches.  
A typical example of augury from birds may be found in the account of the 
manner in which the Mexicans fixed upon the spot for the foundation of their 
city.  Halting after years of wandering in the vicinity of the Lake of 
Tezcuco, they observed a great eagle with wings outspread perched on the 
stump of a cactus, and holding in its talons a live serpent.  Their augurs 
inter-preted this as a good omen as it had been previously announced by an 
oracle, and upon the spot where the bird had alighted, they drove the first 
piles upon which they afterwards built the city of Mexico,-the legend of the 
foundation of which is still commemorated in the arms of modern Mexico.  
Dreams and visions played a great part in Mexican divination, and a special 
caste of augurs called Teopixqui, or Teotecuhtli (masters or guardians of 
divine things) were set apart for the purpose of interpreting dreams and of 
divining through dreams and visions, which was regarded as the chief route 
between man and the supernatural.  The senses were even quickened and 
sharpened by the use of drugs and the ecstatic condition was induced by want 
of sleep, and pertinacious fixing of the mind upon one subject, the 
swallowing or inhalation of cerebral intoxicants such as tobacco, the 
maguey, coca, the snake-plant or ololiuhqui, and similar substances.  As 
among some tribes of the American-Indians, it was probably believed that 
visions came to the prophet or seer pictorially, or that acts were performed 
before him as in a play. They also held that the soul travelled through 
space and was able to visit those places of which it desired to have know-
ledge.  It is also possible that they hypnotised themselves by gazing at 
certain small highly-polished pieces of sand-stone, or that they employed 
these for the same purpose as crystal-gazers employ the globe. The goddess 
Tozi was the patron of those who used grains of maize or red beans in 
divination.
     Charms and Amulets.-The amulet was regarded in Mexico as a personal 
fetish.  The Tepitoton, or diminutive household deities of the Mexicans were 
also fetishistic. It is probable that most of the Mexican amulets were 
modelled on the various ornaments of the gods.  Thus the traveller's staff 
carved in the shape of a serpent like that of Quetzalcoatl was undoubtedly 
of this nature, and was even occasionally sacrificed to.  The frog was a 
favourite model for an amulet.  As elsewhere, the thunder-bolts thrown by 
the gods were supposed to be flint stones, and were cherished as amulets of 
much virtue, and as symbols of the fecundating rains.
     Vampirism.-As has been seen, Sahagun confounds the Mexican necromancer 
with the vampire, and it is inter-esting to note that this folk-belief must 
have originated in America independently of any European connection.  But we 
find another instance of what would seem something like vampirism in Mexico.  
This is found in connection with the ciupipiltin or ghosts of women who have 
died in child-birth.  These haunt the cross-roads, crying and wailing for 
the little ones they have left behind them.  But as in many other countries, 
notably in Burma, they are malevo-lent-their evil tendencies probably being 
caused by jealousy of the happiness of the living.  Lest they should enter 
their houses and injure their children, the Mexicans at certain times of the 
year stopped up every possible hole and crevice.  The appearance of these 
ghosts (Sahagun describes them as " goddesses ") at cross-roads is highly 
significant, for we know that the burial of criminals at such junctions was 
merely a survival of a similar disposal of the corpse of the vampire, whose 
head was cut off and laid at his side, and who was entombed at crossroads 
for the purpose of confusing him as to his whereabouts.
     Nagualism.-Both in Mexico and Central America a religio-magical system 
called Nagualism obtained, the purpose of which was to bring occult 
influence against the whites for their destruction.  The rites of this 
strange cult usually took place in caverns and other deserted localities, 
and were naturally derived to a large extent from those of the suppressed 
native religion.  Each native worshipper possessed a magical or animal 
spirit-guide, with which he was endowed early in life. This system certainly 
flourished as lately as half a century ago, and there is good reason to 
believe that it is not yet extinct.
     Central America.-Notices upon magic and sorcery amongst the Maya, 
Kiche, and other Central American peoples are even rarer than those which 
relate to Mexico, and we have to fall back almost solely upon the native 
legends to glean anything concerning the subject at all. The great 
storehouse of Central American legend is the Popol Vuh, for an account of 
which the reader is referred to the author's Popol Vuh, London, 1909.  We 
find in this interesting native mythi-history, that some of the elder gods 
are regarded as magicians, and the hero-twins,  Xblan-que and Hun-ahpu, whom 
they sent to earth to rid it of the Titan Vukub-cakix, are undoubtedly 
possessed of magical powers.  As boys we find them equipped with magic 
tools, which enable them to get through an enormous amount of work in a 
single day, and when they descend into Xibalba, the Kiche Hades, for the 
purpose of avenging their father and uncle, they take full advantage of 
their magical pro-pensities in combating the natives of that drear abode. 
Xibalba itself possesses sorcerers, for we find two within its borders, Xulu 
and Pacaw, who assist the hero-gods in many of their necromantic practices.
     As regards divination, we find that the Maya possessed a caste of 
augurs, called Cocomes or the Listeners  and prophecy appears to have been 
periodically practised by their priests.  In the so-called books of Chilan 
Balam which are native compilations of events occurring in Central  America 
previous to the Spanish Conquest, we find certain prophecies regarding, 
amongst other things, the coining of the Spaniards.  These appear to have 
been given forth by a priest who bore the title, not the name, of" Chilan 
Balam," whose offices were those of divination and astrology but these 
pronouncements seem to have been coloured at a later date by Christian 
thought, and hardly to be of a genuine aboriginal character.  There are 
certain astrolo-gical recipes in the books, all of which are simply borrowed 
from European almanacs of the century between 1550 and 1650.  Amulets were 
in great vogue amongst the Maya, and they had the same fear of the last live 
days of the year as had the Mexicans, who regarded them as nemontemi or 
unlucky, and did no work of any description upon them.  These days the Maya 
called uyayayab, and they considered that a demon entered their towns and 
villages at the beginning of this period.  To avert this, they carried an 
image of him through the village in the hopes that he might afterwards avoid 
it.


Mezazoth, The : A schedule which, when fastened on the doorpost, possessed 
talismanic qualities.  It is said in the Talmud that whoever has the mesas 
oth fixed on his door, and is provided with certain personal charms, is 
protected from sin.


Michael: An archangel; in the Hebrew, " He who is equal to God."  In 
Revelation it is said : "there was war in heaven.  Michael and his angels 
fought against the dragon" : and from this it is deduced that Michael was 
the leader of the celestial hierarchy,-as against Lucifer, the head of the 
disobedient angels.  Michael is mentioned by name four other times in the 
Scriptures; in Daniel as the champion of the Jewish Church against Persia; 
in Jude as the archangel who fought with Satan for Moses' body; by Gabriel 
he is called the prince of the Jewish Church; and in the prophecy of Enoch, 
"Michael     who commands the nations."  His design according to Randle 
Holme is a banner hanging on a cross; and he is represented as victory with 
a dart in one hand and a cross on his fore-head.  Bishop Horsley and others 
considered Michael as only another name for the Son of God.  In one of the 
Jewish rabbinical legends he is the ruler of Mercury, to which sphere he 
"imparts benignity, motion and intelli-gence, with elegance and consonance 
of speech."

Microcosm, The : Or the Pentagram, a little world (Greek Micros, small ; 
Kosmos, a world)-a five-pointed star, which represents Man and the summation 
of the occult forces.  It was believed by Paracelsus that this sign had a 
marvellous magical power over spirits; and that all magic figures and 
kabalistic signs could be reduced to two-The Microcosm, and the Macrocosm 
(q.v.).


Microprosopus, The  One of the four magical elements in the Kabala; and 
probably representing one of the four simple elements-air, water, earth, or 
fire. The word means " creator of the little world."


Mietlan, the Mexican Hades: (See Hell.)


Mid-day Demons : The ancients frequently made mention of certain demons who 
became visible especially towards mid-day to those with whom they had a 
pact. They appeared in the form of men or of beasts, and let themselves be 
enclosed in a character, a figure, a vial, or in the interior of a hollow 
ring.


Midiwiwin, The : A secret society or exclusive association of the Ojibway 
Indians of North America. The myth of the foundation of this society is as 
follows  Michabo, the Creator, looking down to earth saw that the 
forefathers of the Ojibway were very helpless. . . . Espying a black object 
floating on the surface of a lake he drew near to it and saw that it was an 
otter-now one of the sacred animals of the Midiwiwin.  He instructed it in 
the mysteries of that caste, and provided it with a sacred rattle, a sacred 
drum, and tobacco.  He built a Midiwigan, or Sacred House of Midi, to which 
he took the otter and confided to it the mysteries of the Midiwiwin.  In 
short, the society is one of these " medicine " or magical associations so 
common among the North-American Indians (q.v.). When a candidate is admitted 
to a grade and is prepared to pass on to the next, he gives three feasts, 
and sings three prayers to the Bear Spirit in order to be permitted to enter 
that grade. His progress through the various grades is assisted by several 
snake-spirits ; and at a later stage by the power of certain prayers or 
invocations,-a larger snake appears and raises its body, thus forming an 
arch under which the candidate takes his way to the higher grade. When the 
Indian belongs to the second grade he is supposed to receive supernatural 
power, to be able to see into the future, to hear what comes afar off, to 
touch friends and foes however far away they may be, and so on. In higher 
grades he can assume the form of any animal. The third grade confers 
enhanced power, and it is thought that its members can perform extraordinary 
exploits, and have power over the entire invisible world.  The fourth is 
still more exalted.
     When an Indian is ready to undergo initiation, he erects a wigwam in 
which he takes steam-baths for four days, one on each day.  On the evening 
of the day before initiation he visits his teachers in order to obtain from 
them instructions for the following day. Next morning the priests approach 
with the candidate at their head, enter the Midiwigan, and the proceedings 
commence. The publications of the Bureau of American Ethnology con-tain 
several good accounts of the ritual of this society.

Mimetic Magic  (See Magic.)


Mines, Haunted  The belief that mines are haunted is an ancient and 
universal one, probably arising from the many weird sounds and echoes which 
are heard in them, and the perpetual gloom.  Sometimes the haunting spectres 
are gigantic creatures with frightful fiery eyes.  Such was the German 
"Bergmonch, a terrible figure in the garb of a monk, who could, however, 
appear in ordinary human shape to those towards whom he was well-disposed.', 
Frequently weird knockings are heard in the mines.  In Germany these are 
attributed to the Kobolds, small black beings of a malicious disposition.  
White hares or rabbits are also seen at times. The continual danger 
attending the life underground is productive of many supernatural warnings," 
which generally take the form of mysterious voices. In the Midland Counties 
of England the "Seven Whistlers" are well known and their warnings solemnly 
attended to. A light blue flame settling on a full coal-tub was called " 
Bluecap," and his work was to move the coal-tub towards the trolley-way. 
Bluecap did not give his services for nothing.  Every fortnight his wages 
were left in a corner of the mine, and duly appropriated. A more mischievous 
elf was "Cutty Soames," who would cut the traces, or soams, yoking an 
assistant putter to the tub. Basilisks, whose terrible eyes would strike the 
miner dead, were another source of dread to the worker underground. These, 
as well as the other mysterious foes who dealt fatal blows, may be traced to 
the dreaded, but by no means ghostly, fire-damp. Mines of the precious 
metals arc still more jealously guarded by the supernatural beings. Gnomes 
the creatures of the earth-element, are the special guardians of 
subterranean treasure, and they are not over-anxious that their province be 
disturbed. Mines containing precious stones are equally well looked after. 
The Indians of Peru declare that evil spirits haunt the emerald mines, while 
a mine in the neighbourhood of Los Esmeraldos was said to be guarded by a 
frightful dragon. It has also been stated that the poisonous fumes and gases 
which oft-times destroy the lives of miners are baleful influences radiated 
by evil spirits.

Mirabilis Liber  The greater part of this book is attributed to Saint 
Cesaire. It is a collection of predictions concerning the saints and the 
sibyls. It is surprising to find in the edition of 1522 a prophecy of the 
French Revolution. The expulsion and abolition of the nobility, the violent 
death of the king and queen, the persecution of the clergy, the suppression 
of convents. are all mentioned therein, followed by a further prophecy that 
the eagle coming from distant lands would re-establish order in France.


Miraculum Mundi : (See Clauber.)


Mirendola, Giacomo Picus da :  Italian Astrologer and Kabalist (1463-1494).  
This astrologer's family played a prominent part in a number of the civil 
wars which con-vulsed medieval Italy, while they owned extensive lands in 
the neighbourhood of Modena, the most valuable of their possessions being a 
castle bearing their own name of Mirendola; and it was here, in the year 
1463, that Giacomo was born. He appears to have been something of an 
Admirable Crichton, never showing any fondness for playing children's games, 
but devoting himself to study from the very outset; and, according to 
tradition, before he was out of his teens he had mastered jurisprudence and 
mathematics, he had waded far into the seas of philosophy and theology, and 
had even, dabbled in those occult sciences wherewith his name was destined 
to be associated after-wards. A boy of this kind naturally felt small 
inclination to remain at home, and so it is not surprising to find that 
Giacomo soon left his brothers to look after the family estates, and 
proceeded to various universities in Italy and France. While in the latter 
country his interest in astrology and the like deepened apace, thanks partly 
to his making a close study of the works of Raymond Lully; and in 1486 
Giacomo went to Rome, where he delivered a series of lectures on various 
branches of science. While thus engaged his erudition won high praise from 
some of his hearers, but certain members of the clergy suspected him of 
heresy, reported his doings to the Inquisition, and even sought to have him 
excommunicated. The pope, however was of course rather averse to quarrelling 
with a member of so powerful a family as the Mirandolas, and accordingly he 
waived violent measures, instead appointing a body of Churchmen to argue 
with the scientist. A lengthy altercation ensued, and throughout it the jury 
displayed the most consummate ignorance, it being recorded, indeed that some 
of them imagined that " Kabal" was a man, who had written against 
Christianity, and that the Kaba-lists were the disciples of this hypothetic 
person. Giacomo must have been deeply chagrined by this stupidity on the 
part of his opponents, he must have felt that to argue with such people was 
utterly vain; yet he published a defence of the ideas and theories 
promulgated in his lectures, and in  1493 the pope, Alexander VI., brought 
the affair to a con-clusion by granting the offender absolution. Thereupon 
Mi'andole went to live at Florence, and here he stayed until his demise in 
1494, occasionally essaying alchemy, but chiefly busy with further 
kabalistic studies.
     Apart from the Apologia Pici Mirandoli cited above, Giacomo was author 
of several books of a theological nature, the most important of these being 
his Conausiones Philosophicae, cabalisucae rt theologicae, published in 
1486, and his Disputationes adversus Astrologiam Divinaticum, issued in 
1495. His works appear to have been keenly admired by such of his 
contemporaries as were not averse to speculative thought, and it is 
interesting to find that a collected edition of his writings was printed at 
Boulogne in 1496, and another at Venice two years later.


Mishna, The : A compilation of Hebrew oral traditions, written about the end 
of the second century by a certain Rabbi of Galilee. Its doctrines are said 
by the Jews to be of great antiquity and they believe it to be the oral law 
delivered by God to Moses, at the same time as he received the written law. 
It forms the framework of the Talmud.

Mohanes : Shamans or medicine-men of the Indians of the Peruvian Andes.  
Joseph Skinner writing of them in his State of Peru, London 1805, says: 
"These admit an evil being, the inhabitant of the centre of the earth, whom 
they consider as the author of their misfortunes, and at the mention of 
whose name they tremble.  The most shrewd among them take advantage of this 
belief, to obtain respect ; and represent themselves as his delegates.  
Under the denomination of Mohanes, or Agoreros, they are con-sulted even on 
the most trivial occasions.  They preside over the intrigues of love, the 
health of the community, and the taking of the field.  Whatever repeatedly 
occurs to defeat their prognostics, falls on themselves; and they are wont 
to pay their deceptions very dearly.  They chew a species of vegetable 
called puripiri, and throw it into the air, accompanying this act by certain 
recitals and incan-tations, to injure some, to benefit others, to procure 
rain, and the inundation of the rivers, or, on the other hand, to occasion 
settled weather, and a plentiful store of agricul-tural productions. Any 
such result having been casually verified on a single occasion, suffices to 
confirm the Indians in their faith, although they may have been cheated a 
thousand times.  Fully persuaded  that they cannot resist the influence of 
the puripiri, as soon as they know that they have been solicited by its 
means, they fix their eyes on the impassioned object, and discover a 
thousand amiable traits, either real or fanciful, which indifference had 
before concealed from their view.
     “But the principal power, efficacy, and. it may be said misfortune, of 
the Mohanes, consist in the cure of the sick. Every malady is ascribed to 
their enchantments, and means are instantly taken to ascertain by whom the 
mischief may have been wrought.  For this purpose the nearest relative takes 
a quantity of the juice of floripondium, and suddenly falls, intoxicated by 
the violence of the plant.  He is placed in a fit posture to prevent 
suffocation, and on his coming to himself, at the end of three days, the 
Mohan who has the greatest resemblance to the sorcerer he saw in his 
visions, is to undertake the cure, or if, in the interim, the sick man has 
perished, it is customary to subject him to the same fate. When not any 
sorcerer occurs in the visions, the first Mohan they encounter has the 
misfortune to represent his image."
     Methods of Medicine Men.-It cannot be denied, that the Mohanes have, by 
practice and tradition, acquired a pro-found knowledge of many plants and 
poisons, with which they effect surprising cures on the one hand, and do 
much mischief on the other; but the mania of ascribing the whole to a 
preternatural virtue, occasions them to blend with their practice a thousand 
charms and superstitions. The most customary method of cure is to place two 
ham-mocks close to each other, either in the dwelling, or in the open air: 
in one of them the patient lies extended, and in the other the Mohan, or 
Agorero.  The latter, in contact with the sick man, begins by rocking 
himself, and. then proceeds by a strain in falsetto, to call on the birds, 
quad-rupeds. and fishes, to give health to the patient.  From time to time 
he rises on his seat, and makes a thousand extravagant gestures over the 
sick man, to whom he applies his powders and herbs, or sucks the wounded or 
diseased parts.  If the malady augments. the Agorero, having been joined by 
many of the people, chants a short hymn, addressed to the soul of the 
patient, with this burden: "Thou must not go, thou must not go."  In 
repeating this he is joined by the people, until at length a terrible 
clamour is raised, and augmented in proportion as the sick man becomes still 
fainter and fainter, to the end that it may reach his ears.

Monaciello, The: The Monaciello or Little Monk seems to have lived 
exclusively in that portion of Southern Italy called Naples. The precise 
place where he dwelt does not appear to be accurately known, but it is 
supposed to have been in the remains of Abbeys and Monasteries. When the 
Monaciello appeared to mortals, it was always at the dead of night; and then 
only to those who were in sorest need, who themselves had done all that 
mortal could do to pre-vent or alleviate the distress that had befallen 
them, and after all humain aid had failed.  Then it was that the Monk 
appeared, and mutely beckoning them to follow, he led foam to where treasure 
was concealed-stipulating no conditions for its expenditure. demanding no 
promise of repayment, exacting no duty or service in return.  Men have 
vainly asked, was it actual treasure he gave, or did it merely appear so to 
the external senses, to be changed into leaves or stones when the day and 
the occasion of its requirement had' passed ?  And if actual treasure, how 
did it come in the place of its concealment, and by whom was it there 
deposited ?
     In Germany, the wood-spirit Rubezahl performed similar acts of 
beneficence and kindness to poor and deserving, persons and the money he 
gave proved to be, or passed for the current coin of the realm; while in 
Ireland, the O'Donoghue, who dwelt beneath the waters of an inland lake, and 
rode over its surface on a steed white as the foam of its waves, distributed 
treasures that proved genuine to the good, but spurious to the undeserving.


Monad is a theosophical term which literally means a unit (Greek Monas). The 
Monad is frequently described as a Divine Spark," and this impression is 
particularly apt, for it is a part of the Logos, the Divine Fire. The Logos 
has three aspects, Will, Wisdom and Activity, and, since the Monad is part 
of the Logos, it also has these three aspects It abides continually in its 
appropriate world, the monadic, but, that the divine evolutionary purposes 
may be carried out, its ray is borne downwards through the various spheres 
of matter when the outpouring of the third life wave takes place.  It first 
passes into the Spiritual Sphere by clothing itself with an atom of 
spiritual matter and thus manifests itself in an atomic body, as a spirit 
possessing three aspects. When it passes into the next sphere, the 
Intuitional, it leaves its aspect of Will behind and in the Intuitional 
Sphere, appears in an Intuitional body as a spirit possessing the aspects of 
Wisdom and Activity.  On passing in turn, from this sphere to the next the 
higher mental, it leaves the aspect of Wisdom behind, and appears in a 
casual body as a spirit possessing the aspect of activity.  To put this 
some-what abstruse doctrine in another form, the Monad has, at this stage, 
manifested itself in three spheres.  In the spiritual it has transfused 
spirit with Will, in the Intuitional it has transfused spirit with Wisdom, 
and in the higher Mental it has transfused spirit with Activity or 
Intellect. and it is now a human ego, corresponding approximately to the 
common term "soul," an ego which, despite all changes, remains the same 
until eventually the evolution-ary purpose is fulfilled and it is received 
back again into the Logos.  From the higher mental sphere the Monad descends 
to the lower mental sphere and appears in a mental body as possessing mind, 
then betakes itself to the astral sphere and appears in the astral body as 
possessing emotions, and finally to the physical sphere and appears in a 
physical body as possessing vitality. These three lower bodies, the mental, 
the astral, and the physical, constitute the human personality which dies at 
death and is renewed when the Monad, in fulfillment of the process of 
reincarnation, again manifests itself in these bodies. (See Theosophy, 
Evolution, Sphere, Life Waves, Monadic Sphere, Logos.)


Monen: A Kabalistic term covering that branch of magic which deals with the 
reading of the future by the computa-tion of time and observance of the 
heavenly bodies.  It thus includes astrology.


Money: Money which comes from the devil is of poor quality, and such wealth, 
like the fairy-money, generally turns to earth, or to lead, toads, or 
anything else worthless or repulsive.  " A youth," says Gregory of Tours,  
received a piece of folded paper from a stranger, who told him that he could 
get from it as much money as he wished, so long as he did not unfold it. The 
youth drew many gold pieces from the papers, but at length curiosity 
overcame him, he unfolded it and discovered within the claws of a cat and a 
bear, the feet of a toad and other repulsive fragments, while at the same 
moment his wealth disappeared."  In popular superstition it is supposed that 
if a person hear the cuckoo for the first time with money in his pocket, he 
shall have some all the year, while if he greet the new moon for the first 
time in the same fortunate condition, he shall not lack money throughout the 
month.

Mopses, The : A secret association imported into Germany, which celebrated 
the rites of the gnostic Sabbath.  It replaced the Kabalistic "goat" by the 
Hermetic " dog as an object of worship. The candidate for the order was 
brought into the circle of adepts with the eyes bandaged in the midst of a 
great uproar, and after saluting the idol was initiated. The sign of 
recognition was a grimace. The whole doctrine of the society was that of 
black magic. The Mopses recruited only among Catholics, and for the oath at 
reception they substituted a solemn engagement on honour to reveal no 
secrets of the order,-the practices of which much resembled the Sabbath of 
medieval sorcerers.


Morelle, Paolo : (See Italy.)


Morgan, Professor De : (See Spiritualism.)


Morgan le Fay : Sister of Arthur and wife of King Urien of Gore. Arthur 
gave, into her keeping the scabbard of his sword Excalibur, but she gave it 
to Sir Accolon whom she loved and had a forged scabbard made. Arthur, 
however, recovered the real sheath, but was again deceived by her. She 
figures as a Queen of the Land of Faerie and as such appears in French and 
Italian romance.  It was she who, on one occasion, threw Excalibur into a 
lake.  She usually presents her favourites with a ring and retains them by 
her side as does Venus in Tannhauser.  Her myth is a parallel of that of Eos 
and Tithonus and is probably derived from a sun and dawn myth.


Morien : It is commonly supposed that Morien, or Morienus as he is sometimes 
styled, was born at Rome in the twelfth century, and it is also reported 
that, like Raymond Lully and several other early chymists, he combined 
evangelical ardour with his scientific tastes. While still a mere boy. and 
resident in his native city, Morien became acquainted with the writings of 
Adfar, the Arabian philosopher, and gradually the youth's acquaintance with 
these developed into tense admiration, the result being that he became 
filled with the desire to make the personal acquaintance of the author in 
question. Accordingly he bade adieu to Rome and set out for Alexandria, this 
being the home of Adfar; and, on reaching his destination, he had not to 
wait long ere gaining his desired end.  The learned Arabian accorded him a 
hearty welcome, and a little while after-wards the two were living together 
on very friendly terms, the elder man daily imparting knowledge to the 
younger, who showed himself a remarkably apt pupil.  For some years this 
state of affairs continued, but at length Adfar died, and thereupon Morien 
left Alexandria and went to Palestine, found a retreat in the vicinity of 
Jerusalem, and began to lead a hermit's life there. 
     Meanwhile the erudition of the deceased Arabian acquired a wide 
celebrity, and some of his manuscripts chanced to fall into the hands of 
Kalid, Soldan of Egypt.  He was a person of active and enquiring mind, and 
observing that, on the cover of the manuscripts, it was stated that the 
secret of the philosopher's stone was written within, he naturally grew 
doubly inquisitive.  He found, however, that he himself could not elucidate 
the precious documents and therefore he summoned illuminati from far and 
near to his court at Cairo, and offered a large reward to the man who should 
discover the mystery at issue.  An endless number of people presented 
themselves in consequence, but the majority of them were mere charlatans, 
and thus the Soldan was duped mercilessly.
     Betimes news of these doings reached the ears of Morien. It incensed 
him to think that his old preceptor's wisdom and writings were being made a 
laughing-stock, so he decided that he must go to Cairo himself, and not only 
see justice done to Adfar's memory, but also seize what might prove a 
favourable opportunity of converting Kalid to Christianity.  The Soldan was 
inclined to be cynical when the hermit arrived, nor would he listen to the 
latter's attacks on the Mahommedan faith; yet he saw fit to grant Morien a 
house wherein to conduct researches, and here the alchemist worked for a 
long time, ultimately per-fecting the elixir. He did not, withal, make any 
attempt to gain the preferred reward; and instead he took his leave without 
the Soldan's cognizance, simply leaving the precious fluid in a vase on 
which he inscribed the suggestive words:." He who possess all has no need of 
others."
     But Kalid was at a loss to know how to proceed further, and for a long 
time he made great efforts to find Morien and bring him again to his court. 
Years went by, and all search for the vanished alchemist proved vain; but 
once, when the Soldan was hunting in the neighbourhood of Jerusalem, one of 
his servants chanced to hear of a hermit who was wont to create gold. 
Convinced that this must be none other than Morien, Kalid straightway sought 
him out; so once more the two met, and again the alchemist made strenuous 
efforts to win the other from Mahomme-danism. Many discussions took place 
between the pair, both speaking on behalf of their respective religions, yet 
Kalid showed no inclination to desert the faith of his fathers.  And 
therefore Morien relinquished the quest in despair, but it is said that, on 
parting with the Soldan, he duly instructed him in the mysteries of the 
transcendent science.
      Nothing is known about Morien's subsequent history, and the likelihood 
is that the rest of his days were spent quietly at his hermitage.  He is 
credited with sundry alchemistic writings, said to have been translated from 
Arabic, but it need hardly be said that the ascription rests on the 
slenderest evidence.  One of these works is entitled Liber de Distinctione 
Mercurii Aquarum, and it is interesting to recall that a manuscript copy 
thereof belonged to Robert Boyle, one of the founders of the Royal Society  
while another is entitled Liber de Compositione Alchemiae, and this is 
printed in the first volume of Bibliotheca Chemica Curiosa.  Yet better 
known than either of these, and more likely to be really from Morien's pen, 
is a third treatise styled De Re Metallica, Metallorum Transumtatione, et 
occulta summague Antiquorum Medicine Libellus, which was repeatedly 
published, the first edition appearing at Paris in 1559.


Morrell, Theobald : (See Spiritualism.)


Morse, J. J. : A well-known English trance or inspirational medium who began 
to practice about 1870.  Early in his career the phenomenon of " elongation" 
was witnessed in connection with him, but these physical manifestations soon 
ceased, and he developed trance-speaking faculties of a high order, and 
delivered numerous eloquent discourses to spiritualists throughout the 
country.

Moses, Rev. William Stainton : One of the best known mediums connected with 
modern spiritualism, and probably, after Home, one of the most successful.  
He was born in 1839, at Donington, in Lincolnshire, the son of a school-
master, and was educated at Bedford Grammar School and Exeter College, 
Oxford.  He made good progress at the University, but before his final 
examination his health broke down, and he was forced to go abroad.  On his 
return he graduated Master of Arts, and in 1863 was ordained.  From that 
time until 1870 he was a curate, first in the Isle of Man and afterwards in 
Dorsetshire. Again his health gave way, and he was obliged to abandon parish 
work, and seek a change of occupation.  In 1870 he became tutor to the son 
of Dr. and Mrs. Stanhope Speer, with whom he resided. and who were 
henceforth among his staunchest supporters. A year or two later he was 
appointed English master in University College School, but increasing ill-
health compelled him to retire in 1899. Towards the close of his ijfe Mr. 
Moses suffered greatly from depression and kindred nervous disorders.  His 
life as a clergyman and as a schoolmaster was beyond reproach, and his 
duties were discharged in a way that won respect alike for his intelligence 
and efficiency.
     His attention was first directed to spiritualism by the reading of R. 
Dale Owen's book on The Debatable Land, in 1872.  He attended numerous 
seances, held by such medium" as Home, and soon afterwards he himself devel-
oped powerful mediumistic tendencies, and gave seances to the Speers and a 
few select friends. The best accounts of his sittings are those written by 
Dr. and Mrs. Speers who kept separate records of the performances, and there 
are occasional accounts by others who were admitted to the circle. The 
phenomena were at first confined to raps and levitations of furniture, but 
gradually the manifestations became more varied and more pronounced.  Toilet 
articles in Mr. Moses' room moved about of themselves and formed a cross on 
his bed, "apports" of perfume, pincushions, pearls, and other articles were 
brought by the spirits, and the medium himself would float about the room. 
Towards the end of the year "spirit lights" began to make their appearance, 
and seem to have created a profound impression on the sitters, though to 
judge from the descriptions they give, it would seem that Mr. Podmore's 
explanation of “bottles of phosphorus"  is not far from the truth. Musical 
instruments also were heard playing in the air, besides raps, thuds, and 
other noises.
     Perhaps his most important manifestations, however, were the automatic 
writings published under the title of Spirit Teachings. These purported to 
come from several spirits, " Imperator," " Rector," and others, and were 
mostly of a theological caste.  Though of a high ethical tendency, they 
evinced a departure from Christianity, and suggested the religion of 
spiritualism as the only rational human creed.  Unlike many automatic 
writings Mr. Moses' productions were not written in extravagantly high-flown 
language, nor were they altogether meaningless. But it must be remembered 
that he was a man of education and not likely to fall into such errors.
     Other work done by him in connection with Spiritualism was his 
assistance in the founding of the British National Association of 
Spiritualism, and to serve on the Councils of the Psychological Society, and 
the Society for Psychical Research.  He severed his connection with the 
latter body, however, because of the position they took up with regard to 
certain professional mediums.  He was also president of the London Spiritual 
Alliance from 1884 onwards. Among his most popular works, besides Spirit 
Teachings, were Psychography, Spirit Identity, and The Higher Aspects of 
Spiritualism.
     Why did Stainton Moses become a medium? There are few questions more 
puzzling than this to the student of spiritual psychology. That professional 
mediums, and those private mediums who have anything to gain by their 
performances, should carry on deception from year to year, is 
comprehensible.  But that a clergyman, who had hitherto led an uneventful 
and exemplary life, should deliberately and systematically practise a series 
of puerile tricks for the purpose of mystifying his friends, is certainly 
not so. We are forced to admit, then, either that his observers were victims 
to hallucination and self-deception, or that the phenomena he produced were 
genuine manifestations from the spirit-world.


Moss-Woman The : The Moss or Wood Folk, dwelt in the forests of Southern 
Germany.  Their stature was small and their form strange and uncouth, 
bearing a strong resem-blance to certain trees with which they flourished 
and decayed.  They were a simple, timid, and inoffensive race, and had 
little intercourse with mankind; approach-ing only at rare intervals the 
lonely cabin of the wood-man or forester, to borrow some article of domestic 
use, or to beg a little of the food which the good wife was preparing for 
the family meal.  They would also for similar purposes appear to labourers 
in the fields which lay on the outskirts of the forests.  A loan or gift to 
the Moss-people was always repaid manifold.  But the most highly-prized and 
eagerly-coveted of all mortal gifts was a draught from the maternal breast 
to their own little ones; for this they held to be a sovereign remedy for 
all the ills to which their natures were subject.  Yet was it only in the 
extremity of danger that they could so overcome their natural diffidence and 
timidity as to ask this boon-for they knew that mortal mothers turned from 
such nurslings with disgust and fear. It would appear that the Moss or Wood 
folk also lived in some parts of Scandinavia. Thus we are told that in the 
churchyard of Store Hedding, in Zealand, there are the remains of an oak 
wood which were trees by day and warriors by night.


Mountain Cove Community, The : A spiritualistic community founded in 
Mountain Cove, Fayette Co., Virginia, in the autumn of 1851, under the 
leadership of the Rev. James Scott and the Rev. T. L. Harris.  Both mediums 
had settled in Auburn in the previous year, and had obtained a considerable 
following.  While Harris was absent in New York the command to form a 
community at Mountain Cove was given through the mediumship of Scott, and 
about a hundred persons accompanied him to Virginia. The members were 
obliged to deliver up all their possessions, again at the command of the 
spirits.  Dissensions arose and pecuniary difficulties were experienced, and 
only the advent of T. L. Harris in the summer of 1852 saved the community 
from dissolution.  However, the dissensions and difficulties remained, and 
early in 1853 the community finally broke up.


Muscle-reading  The concentration of thought on any particu-lar object 
produces a tendency to muscular activity.  Thus if a name be thought of the 
muscles of the larynx may range themselves as if for the pronunciation of 
that name. This is known as  subconscious whispering."  Or there may be an 
unconscious movement towards the object in the mind.  It is the 
interpretation of these involuntary movements by a second person, or 
percipient, that fre-quently passes for genuine telepathy.  The thought- 
reading exhibited on the public platform, when it is not the result of 
fraud, may be in reality muscle-reading.  The act of reading these slight 
muscular indications of the thoughts may be unconscious or instinctive-
indeed, must be so, since they are much too fine to be perceived by the 
grosser consciousness.


Myers, Frederic William Henry (1843-1901): Poet, essayist, and student of 
psychic science, was born at Keswick, Cumberland, and educated at Cheltenham 
and Cambridge. In 1865 he became classical lecturer there, but in 1872 
abandoned this post for that of school inspector.  He published several 
volumes of poems and essays, some of the former of considerable beauty, 
though it is chiefly as an essayist that he is known.  He has done excellent 
work in the region of psychic science, being one of the original group who 
founded the Society for Psychical Research in 1882, and remaining to the end 
of his life one of its most useful members. Though he did not belong to the 
sceptical school of which Mr. F. Podmore is the chief representative, Mr. 
Myers' view-point was decidedly not that of the average spiritualist.  The 
evidence for the survival of the soul after death he found not in the 
somewhat puerile spirit " manifestations, but in the subliminal Conscious-
ness, that wide region that lies beneath the threshold of man's ordinary 
consciousness, wherein Air. Myers believed to discern traces of unused 
faculties, clairvoyance, retro-cognition, precognition, telekinesia, and so 
on.  All the phenomena of trance,  hypnotism,  automatism,  and spiritualism 
he grouped together as phenomena of the subliminal consciousness. The 
results of his researches were embodied in a posthumous work entitled Human 
Personality and its Survival of Bodily Death (1903).  He also wrote the 
introduction to Gurney's Phantasms of the Living.  He died at Rome in 1901 
and was buried at Keswick.


Myomancy was a method of divination by rats or mice and is supposed to be 
alluded to in Isaiah lxvi., 17.  Their peculiar cries, or some marked 
devastation committed by them, was taken for a prognostic of evil.  AElian 
relates that Fabius Maximus resigned the dictatorship in conse-quence of a 
warning from these creatures; and Cassius Flaminius, according to Varro, 
retired from the command of the cavalry for no greater reason.  From 
Herodotus we learn that the army of Sennacherib, when he invaded Egypt was 
infested by mice in the night, and their quivers and bows gnawed in pieces ; 
in the morning, therefore, being without arms, they fled in confusion, and 
many of them were slain.  Such a foreboding of evil could not very well be 
questioned, or its consequences averted, by the com-mander, but very 
different was the case when one of Cato's soldiers told him in affright that 
the rats had gnawed one of his shoes.  Cato replied that the prodigy would 
have been much greater if the shoe had gnawed a rat l  Hor-apollo in his 
curious work on the Hieroglyphics of Egypt, describes the rat as a symbol of 
destruction, and, what is more to our purpose, the Hebrew name of this 
animal is from a root which signifies to separate, divide, or judge; and it 
has been remarked by one of the commentators on Horapollo that the mouse has 
a finely discriminating taste. An Egyptian MS. in the " Bibliotheque Royale"  
at Paris, contains the representation of a soul going to judg-ment, in which 
one of the figures is depicted with the head of a rat and the well-known 
wig.  It is understood that the Lybian rats and the mouse of Scripture are 
the same as the Arabian jerboa, which is characterised by a long tail, bushy 
at the end, and short fore-legs. The mice and emerods of gold, I. Sam. v., 
6, 7 were essentially charms having a precise symbolic meaning.


Mysteries : From the Greek work muein, to shut the mouth, and mustes an 
initiate : a term for what is secret or con-cealed.  Although certain 
mysteries were undoubtedly part of the initiatory ceremony of the priests of 
ancient Egypt, we are ignorant of their exact trend, and the terra is 
usually used in connection with certain semi-religious ceremonies held by 
various cults in ancient Greece.  The mysteries were indeed secret cults, to 
which only certain initiated people were admitted after a period of 
preliminary preparation.  After this initial period of purification came the 
mystic communication or exhortation, then the revela-tion to the neophyte of 
certain holy things, the crowning with the garlands, and lastly the 
communion with the deity. But the mysteries appear to have circled round the 
semi-dramatic representation or mystery-play of the life of a deity.
     It has often been advanced as a likely theory to account for the 
prevalence of these mystic cults in Greece, that they are of pre-Hellenic 
origin, and that the Pelasgic aboriginal people of the country strove to 
conceal their religions from the eyes of their conquerors.  But against this 
has to be weighed the evidence that for the most part the higher offices of 
these cults were in the hands of aristocrats, who, it may he reasonably 
inferred, had but little to do with the inferior strata of the population 
which represented the Pelasgic peoples.  Again, the divinities worshipped in 
the mysteries possess for the most part Greek names, and many of them are 
certainly gods evolved upon Hellenic soil at a comparatively late period. We 
find a number of them associated with the realm of the dead.  The earth-god 
or goddess is in most countries often allied with the powers of darkness.  
It is from the underworld that grain arises, and therefore we are not 
surprised to find that Demeter, Go, and Aglauros, are identified with the 
underworld. But there were also the mysteries of Artemis, of Hecate, and the 
Cherites,-some of which may be regarded as forms of the great earth-mother.
     The worships of Dionysus, Trophonious, and Zagreus were also of a 
mysterious nature. The Eleusinian and Orphic mysteries are undoubtedly those 
of most importance to the occult student; and from the results of 
archaeology, such as vase-painting and so forth, we have been able to glean 
some general idea of the trend of these.  That is not to say that the heart 
of the mystery is revealed to us by any such illustrations, but these 
supplemented by what the Christian fathers were able to glean regarding 
these mystic cults, enable us to push our investigations in the proper 
quarters.  Important as such matter is, however, it is extremely slight in 
character.
     Eleusis.-The mysteries of Eleusis had for their primal adoration 
Demeter, Kore or Persephone,-the mother and the daughter-whose myth is too 
well-known to require repetition here.  Pluto, the third figure in the drama 
is so unimportant as to be relegated to the back-ground.  Other "nameless" 
divinities appear to have been associated with these, under the name of " 
the gods and "the goddesses" ; hut the theory that those are supposed to 
descend from an aboriginal period, when gods were nameless, is too absurd 
for discussion. The nameless god is of no value to anyone. not even a 
savage, and a mere nodding acquaintance with mythological science is surely 
sufficient to show that such nameless gods are merely those whose higher 
names are hidden and unspoken.  In Egypt, for example, the concept of the 
Concealed Name was extremely common.  The "name of power" of a god, if 
discovered, bestowed on the discoverer sway over that deity, and we must 
therefore dismiss tile idea of the nameless divinities of Eleusis as not in 
accordance with mythological fact.  A more probable view is that which would 
make these gods later titles of the married pair Pluto and Kore; but this, 
in view of the facts just stated, is also unlikely.  Dionysus is also a 
figure of some import-ance in the Eleusinian mystery, and it has been 
thought that Orphic influence brought about his presence in the cult; but 
traces of Orphic doctrine have not been dis-covered in what is known of the 
mysteries.  A more baffling personality in the great ritual drama is that of 
Iacchus, who appears to be none other than Dionysus under another name.  But 
Dionysus or lacehus does not appear to be a primary figure of the mystery
     We find in early Greek legends allusions to the sacred character of the 
Eleusinian mysteries.  From the fifth century their organisation was in the 
hands of the Athenian city,-the royal ruler of which undertook the general 
management, along with a committee of supervision. The rites took place at 
the city of Eleusis, and were celebrated by a hereditary priesthood, the 
Eumolpedie.. They alone, or rather their high priest, could penetrate into 
the inner-most holy of holies ; but there were also priestesses and female 
attendants or' the goddesses.
     The celebration of the mysteries, so far as can be gleaned, was 
somewhat as follows: In the month of September, the Eleusinian Holy Things 
were taken from the sacred city to Athens, and placed in the Eleusinian.  
These probably consisted to some extent of small statues of the goddesses. 
Three days afterwards the catechumens assembled to hearken to the 
exhortation of one of the priests, in which those who were for any reason 
unworthy of initiation were solemnly warned to depart.  All must be Greeks 
or Romans above a certain age, and women and even slaves were admitted; but 
foreigners and criminals might not partake. The candidates were questioned 
as to their purification, and especially as regards the food which they had 
eaten during that period.  After this assembly, they betook themselves to 
the sea-shore and bathed in the sea, being sprinkled afterwards with the 
blood of pigs.  A sacrifice was offered up, and several days afterwards the 
great Eleusinian pro-cession commenced its journey along the sacred 'way, 
its central figure being a statue of Iacchus.  Many shrines were visited on 
the way to     Eleusis, where, upon their arrival, they celebrated a 
midnight orgy.
      It is difficult to come at what occurred in the inner circle; but 
there appear to have been two grades in the celebration, and we know that a 
year elapsed before a person who had achieved one grade became fit for 
election to the higher. Regarding the actual ritual in the hall of mystery, 
a great deal of controversy has taken place, but it is certain that a 
dramatic representation was the central point of interest, the chief 
characters in which were probably Demeter and Kore, and that the myth of the 
lost daughter and the sorrowing mother was enacted before a highly-impressed 
audience.  It has been stated that the birth of Iacchus was announced during 
the ceremony; but this has not been handed down to us on good authority. Of 
scenic display, there was probably little or none, as excavation has proved 
that there was not room for it, and we find nothing regard-ing scenery in 
the accounts presented in many inscriptions; but the apparel of the actors 
was probably most magnificent, and was heightened by the Rembrandtesque 
effect of gloom and torchlight.
     But certain sacred symbols were also displayed before the eyes of the 
elect. These appear to have been small idols of the goddesses. of great 
antiquity and sanctity. We know that the original symbols of deity are 
jealously guarded by many savage priesthoods. For example, the Uapes of 
Brazil keep careful watch over the symbols of Jurupari, their god, and these 
are shown only to the initia-ted - any woman who casts eyes on them being 
instantly poisoned. It is also stated by Hippolytus that the ancients were 
shown a cut corn stalk, the symbol of Demeter and Kore. This, however, can 
hardly be trusted any more than the theory that the Eleusinians worshipped 
the actual Corn as a clan totem. Corn as a totem is not un-known elsewhere, 
as for example in Peru, where the cconopa or godlings of the maize fields 
were probably originally totemic; and we know that amongst savage people 
totem-ism often carries in its train the concept of the full-fledged 
mystery. But if the Eleusinian corn was a totem, it was certainly the only 
corn totem known to Greece, and corn totems are rare. The totem has usually 
initiated with the hunting condition of man: when he arrives at the agricul-
tural stage we generally find that a fresh pantheon has slowly evolved, in 
which full-fledged gods took the place of the old totemic deities. The corn 
appears to him as a living thing. It is growth, and within it resides a 
spirit. Therefore the deity which is evolved from this concept is more 
likely to be of animistic than of totemistic origin.
     The neophyte was then made one with the deity, by partaking of holy 
food or drink. It will be recalled that when Persephone reached the dark 
shores of Hades she partook of the food of the dead-thus rendering it im-
possible for her to return. Once the human soul eats or drinks in Hades, it 
may not return to earth. This belief is universal, and it is highly probable 
that it was symbolised in the Eleusinian mysteries. There was nothing, 
however, particularly secret about this sacrament, as it is painted on many 
vases which have been brought to light. A great deal of the ritual 
undoubtedly partook of the character of agricultural magic, -description of 
sympathetic sorcery. Among barbarians the medicine-man sprinkles water over 
the soil to incite the rain-spirit to do likewise. It is not long ago since, 
in the Isle of Mull, a long carved stone in a certain churchyard was filled 
with water, until the depressions upon it overflowed, to symbolise a well-
watered country. All sorts of imitative rites took place on similar occasion 
- most of which will be familiar to students of folklore, It has been 
thought that the token of the grow-ing corn may have served as an emblem of 
man's resurrec-tion, and the fact that most persons approach the Elenusinian 
mysteries for the purpose of ensuring themselves a happy immortality. would 
go far to prove this. M. Foucart has ingeniously put forward the theory that 
the object of the Eleusinian mysteries was much the same as that of the 
Egyptian Book of the Dead,-to provide the initiates with elaborate rules for 
avoiding the dangers of the under-world, and to instruct them in the 
necessary magical formulae. But it does not appear than any such purpose was 
attained in the mysteries; and we know of no magic formulae recited in 
connection with them. Friendship with the Holy Mother and Daughter was to 
the Eleusinian votary the chief assurance of immortality.
     A great many offshoots of the Eleusinian cult were established in 
several parts of Greece.
     Dionysiac.-The most important cult next to the Eleu-sinian was the 
Orphic, which probably arose in Phrygia, and which came to be associated 
with the name of Dion-ysus, originally a god of vegetation, who was of 
course also a divinity of the nether world. In this case, it was also 
desired to enter into communion with him, that immortality might be assured. 
His celebrations were marked by orgies of a bacchic description, in which it 
was thought that the neophyte partook for the nonce of the character and the 
power of the deity himself. The rites of the cult of Dionysus were on a much 
lower grade than those of Eleusis, and partook more of the barbarian 
element, and the devouring of an animal victim was supposed to symbolise the 
incar-nation, death and resurrection of the divinity. Later the Dionysiac 
mysteries became purified, but always retained something of their earlier 
hysteric character. The cult possessed a fairly wide propaganda, and does 
not appear to have been regarded by the sages of its time with great 
friendliness. The golden tablets relating to the Orphic mystery found in 
tombs in Greece, Crete and Italy, contain fragments of a sacred hymn. As 
early as the third century B.C. it was buried with the dead as an amulet to 
protect him from the dangers of the underworld, and the fragments bear upon 
them incantations of a magical character.
     Attis and Sybele.-These mysteries arrived at a later period on Hellenic 
soil.  Passionate and violent in the extreme, they yet gained considerable 
sway in a more degenerate age, and communimi with the deity was usually 
attained by bathing in blood in the taurobolium or by the letting of blood.
     These Phrygian mysteries were full of the conception of the re-birth of 
the god Attis, who was also of an agrarian character; and in brief it may be 
said of these mystic cults as a whole that they were primarily barbarian 
agricul-tural rites to some extent intellectualised.
     Mittraic Mysteries.-The Mithraic cult was of Persian origin, Mithra, a 
personification of Light being worshipped in that country some five hundred 
years before the Christian era.  Carried into Asia Minor by small colonies 
of magi, it was largely influenced by the religions with which it was 
brought into contact. Chaldean Astrology contributed much of the occult 
traditions surrounding the creed of the Sun-god, while to a certain extent 
it became hellenized when the Magi strove to bring the more barbaric portion 
of their dogma and its usages into harmony with the Hellenic ideal. To the 
art of Greece also it owed that ideal repre-sentation of Mithra Tauroctonous 
which formed the central object in the temples of the cult.  The wide 
geographical area it traversed and the immense influence thus exercised was, 
however, due to the Romans.  The rites originally reached Rome, Plutarch 
tells us, through the agency of Cilician priates conquered and taken there 
by Pompey. Another source, doubtless, was through the large number of 
Asiatic slaves employed in Roman households. Again the Roman soldiery must 
have carried the Mithraic cult to Rome as they certainly were the means of 
its diffusion, as far north as the mountains of Scotland, and southwards to 
the borders of the Sahara Desert.
     Mithraism may be said to have been the only living religion which 
Christianity found to combat.  It was strong enough to exert a formative 
influence on certain Christian doctrines, such as those relative to the end 
of the world and the powers of hell.  Mithra was essentially the divinity of 
beneficence.  He was the genius of celestial light, endowing the earth with 
all its benefits.  As in his character of the Sun he puts darkness to flight 
so by a natural transition he came to represent ethically truth and 
integrity, the sun of goodness which conquers the night of evil.  To him was 
ascribed the character of Mediator betwixt God and man; his creed promised a 
resurrection to a future life of happiness and felicity.  Briefly the story 
of Mithra is this  His life he owed to no mortal mother.  In the gloom of a 
cavern Mithra sprang to being from the heart of a rock, seen by none but 
humble shepherds. He grew in strength and courage, excelling all, and used 
his powers to rid the world of evil.  Of all his deeds of prowess, however, 
that one became the central motive of his cult wherein, by slaying a bull, 
itself possessed of divine potentialities, he dowered the earth with 
fruitfulness and miraculous crops.  From the spinal cord of the bull sprang 
the wheat of man's daily bread, from its blood the vine, source of the 
sacred drink of the Mysteries, and from its seed all the different species 
of useful animals.  After this beneficent deed Mithra ruled in the heavens, 
yet still keeping watch and ward over mankind, granting the petitions asked 
in his name. Those who followed him, who were initiated into his mysteries 
passed under his divine protection, especially after death when he would 
rescue their souls from the powers of darkness which fain would seize upon 
the dead.  And yet again Mithra would come, when the earth was failing in 
her life-sustaining powers, and again he would slay a divine bull and give 
to all abun-dant life and happiness.
     The mysteries and rites inspired the votaries with awe while giving to 
their hearts hope of a future life, transcend-ing that which they had known. 
The temples, mithraeums as they were called, were either built underground 
or were caves and grottoes in the depths of dark forests, symbolising the 
birthplace of their god.  Among his worshippers were slaves and soldiery, 
high officials and dignitaries, all ming-ling fraternally in a religion 
which called them Brethren. The rites were of magical significance.  In 
order to bring their lives into closer communion with the divinity of 
Mithra, the neophytes must pass through seven degrees of initiation 
successively assuming the names of Raven, Occult, Soldier, Lion, Persian, 
Runner of the Sun and Father.  Each of these grades carried with them 
symbolic garments and masks, donned by the celebrants. The masks represented 
birds and animals and would seem to indicate the existence of belief in the 
doctrine of metempsychosis; or perhaps they were a remnant of totemic 
belief.  An almost ascetic habit of life was demanded, including prolonged 
fasting and purification. The oath of silence regarding the rites was taken, 
and before entering the higher grades a ceremony called the Sacrament was 
held where consecrated bread and wine were partaken of. Dramatic trials of 
strength, faith and endurance were gone through by all, a stoical attitude 
and unflinching moral courage being demanded as sign of fitness in the 
participant.  The drinking of the sacred wine, and the baptism of blood, 
were supposed to bring to the initiate not only material benefit but wisdom; 
they gave power to combat evil, the power to attain to an immortality such 
as that of their god. An order of priests were connected with this cult, who 
faithfully carried on the occult tradition and usages, such as that of 
initiation, the rites of which were arduous; the tending of a perpetual fire 
on the altars; prayers to the Sun at dawn, noon and evening. There were 
sacrifices and libations, musical rites including long psalmodies and mystic 
chants. The days of the week were each sacred to a Planet, the day of the 
Sun being held especially holy. There were seasonal festivals, the birth of 
the Sun being solemnized on the 25th of December, and the equinoxes were 
days of rejoicing, while the initiations were held preferably in the spring, 
in March or April. It is believed that in the earliest days of the cult some 
of the rites were of a savage and barbaric character, especially the 
sacrificial element, but these, as indicated, were changed and ennobled as 
the beneficence of Mithra took precedence of his warlike prowess. The 
Mithraic brotherhoods took temporal interests as well as spiritual ones 
under their care were in fact highly organised communities, including 
trustees, councils, senates, attor-neys and patrons, people of high status 
and wealth. The fact of belonging to such a body gave to the initiate, be he 
of noble birth or but a slave, a sense of brotherhood and comradeship which 
was doubtless a powerful reason of the ascendancy which the Mithraic cult 
gained over the Roman army, whose members, dispersed to the ends of the 
earth in lonely solitudes amid wild and barbaric races, would find in this 
feeling of fraternity, this sharing in the worship and ritual of the Sun-
god, an infinite comfort and solace.

Mysticism : The attempt of man to attain to the ultimate reality of things 
and enjoy communion with the Highest. Mysticism maintains the possibility of 
intercourse with God, not by means of revelation, or the ordinary religious 
channels, but by dint of introspection, culminating in the feeling that the 
individual partakes of the divine nature. Mysticism has been identified with 
pantheism by some authorities  but it differs from pantheism in that its 
motive is religious.  But mysticism is greatly more specula-tive than 
ordinary religion and instead of commencing its flights of thought from the 
human side, starts from the divine nature rather than from man. The name 
mysticism cannot be applied to any particular system.  Whereas religion 
teaches submission of the will and the ethical har-monies of life, mysticism 
strains after the realisation of a union with God Himself.  The mystic 
desires to be as close to God as possible, if not indeed part of the Divine 
Essence Itself; whereas the ordinary devotee of most religious systems 
merely desires to walk in God's way and obey His will.
     Mysticism may be said to have originated in the East, where it probably 
evolved from kindred philosophic con-cepts. The unreality of things is 
taught by most Asiatic religions, especially by Brahminism and Buddhism, and 
the sense of the worth of human personality in these is small (See India). 
The Sufis of Persia may be said to be a link between the more austere Indian 
mystics and those of Europe. We find Sufism first arising in the ninth 
century among the Persian Mahommedans, probably as a protest against the 
severe monotheism of their religion; but in all likelihood more ancient 
springs contribute to its revival. In the Persia of Hafiz and Saadi, 
pantheism abounded, and their magnificent poetry is read by Mahommedans as 
having a deep mystical significance, 'although for the most part it deals 
with love and intoxication. In all probability more is read into these poems 
than exists beneath the surface, but at the same time it is certain that 
many of them exhibit the fervour of souls searching for communion with the 
highest.  The rise of Alexandrian Neoplatonism (q.v.) was the signal for the 
introduction of mysticism to a waiting Europe, and as this stage of 
mysticism has been fully reviewed in a special article on the subject, there 
is no necessity to follow it here.  It may be mentioned, however, that 
Neoplatonism made a definite mark upon early Christianity, and we find it 
mirrored in many of the patristic writings of the sixteenth century. It was 
Erigena who in the ninth century transmitted to Europe the so-called 
writings of Dionysius the Areopagite thus giving rise to both the 
scholasticism and mysticism of the middle ages. Erigena based his own system 
upon that of Dionysius. This was the so-called " negative theology" which 
places God above all categories and designates Him as Nothing, or The 
Incomprehensible Essence from which the world of primordial causes is 
eternally created.  This creation is the Word or Son of God, in Whom all 
substantial things exist; but God is the beginning and end of everything.  
On this system Christian mysticism may be said to have been founded with 
little variation. With Erigena reason and authority were identical, and in 
this he agrees with all speculative mystics; whereas scholasticism is 
characterised by the acceptance by reason of a given matter which is pre-
supposed even when it cannot be understood. It seemed to Erigena that in the 
scholastic system religious truth was external to the mind, while the 
opposite view was fundamental to mysticism. That is not to say that 
mysticism according to Erigena is a mere subordination of reason to faith.  
Mysticism indeed places every confidence in human reason, and it is 
essential that it should have the unity of the human mind with the divine as 
its main tenet ; but it accepts nothing from without, and it posits the 
higher faculty of reason over the realisation of absolute truth.
     Medieval mysticism may be said to have originated from a reaction of 
practical religion against dialectics in which the true spirit of 
Christianity was then enshrined. Thus St. Bernard opposed the dry 
scholasticism of Abelard.  His mysticism was profoundly practical, and deals 
chiefly with the means by which man may attain the knowledge of God. This is 
to be accomplished through contemplation and withdrawal from the world.  
Thus asceticism is the soul of medieval mysticism ; but he mistakenly 
averred regarding self-love that it is proper to love ourselves for God's 
sake, or because God loved us; thus merging self-love in love for God.  We 
must, so to speak, love ourselves in God, in Whom we ultimately lose 
ourselves.  Thus St. Bernard is almost Buddhistic, and indeed his mysticism 
is of the universal type.  Perhaps Hugh of St. Victor, a contemporary of St. 
Bernard's, did more to develop the tenets of mysticism ; and his monastery 
of Augustinians near Paris became, under his influence, a great centre of 
mysticism.  One of his apologists, Richard of St. Victor, declares that the 
objects of mystic contem-plation are partly above reason, and partly, as 
regards intuition, contrary to reason.  The protagonists of this theory, all 
of whom issued from the same monastery, were known as the Victorines, who 
put up a stout fight against the dialecticians and schoolmen.  Bonaventura, 
who died in 1274, was a disciple of this school, and believer in the faculty 
of mystic intuition.  In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, the 
worldliness of the church aroused much opposition amongst laymen, and its 
cold formalism created a reaction towards a more spiritual regime.  Many 
sects arose such as the  Waldenses, the Kathari, and the Beguines, all of 
which strove to infuse into their teachings a warmer enthusiasm than that 
which burned in the heart of the church of their time.  In Germany, 
mysticism made great strides, and Machthild of Magdeburg, and Elizabeth of 
Thuringia, were, if not the originators of mysticism in Germany, perhaps the 
earliest supporters of it.  Joachim of Flores and Amalric of Bena wrote 
strongly in favour of the reformed church, and their writings are drenched 
with mystical terms, derived for the most part from Erigena. Joachim mapped 
out the duration of the world into three ages, that of the Father, that of 
the Son, and that of the Spirit,-the first of which was to commence with the 
year 1260, and to be inaugurated by the general adoption of the life 
monastic and contemplative.  A sect called The New Spirit, or The Free 
Spirit, became widespread through northern France, Switzerland and Germany; 
and these did much to infuse the spirit of mysticism throughout the German 
land.
     It is with Eckhart, who died in 1327, that we get the juncture of 
mysticism with scholastic theology.  Of his doctrine it has been said:   The 
ground of your being lies in God.  Reduce yourself to that simplicity, that 
root, and you are in God.  There is no longer any distinction between your 
spirit and the divine,-you have escaped personality and finite limitation.  
Your particular, creature self, as a something separate and dependent on 
God, is gone.  So also, obviously, your creaturely will.  Hence-forth, 
therefore, what seems an inclination of yours is in fact the divine good 
pleasure. You are free from law. You are above means. The very will to do 
the will of God is resolved into that will itself. This is the Apathy, the 
Negation, the Poverty, he commends.  With Eckhart personally this self-
reduction and deification is connected with a rigorous asceticism and 
exemplary moral excellence Yet it is easy to see that it may be a merely 
intellectual process, consisting in a man's thinking that he is thinking 
himself away from his personality.  He declares the appearance of the Son 
necessary to enable us to realize our sonship; and yet his language implies 
that this realiza-tion is the perpetual incarnation of that Son - does, as 
it were, constitute him.  Christians are accordingly not less the sons of 
God by grace than is Christ by nature. Believe yourself divine, and the Son 
is brought forth in you.  The Saviour and the saved are dissolved together 
in the blank absolute substance.
      With the advent of the black death, a great spirit of remorse swept 
over Europe in the fourteenth century, and a vast revival of piety took 
place. This resulted in the foundation in Germany of a society of Friends of 
God, whose chief object was to strengthen each other in intercourse with the 
Creator.  Perhaps the most distinguished of these were Tauler, and Nicolas 
of Basle, and the society numbered many inmates of the cloister, as well as 
wealthy men of commerce and others.  Ruysbroeck (q.v.) the great Dutch 
mystic, was connected with them; but his mysticism is perhaps more intensely 
practical than that of any other visionary.  It is the machinery by which 
the union with God is to be effected which most attracts him.  In 
Ruysbroeck's life-time a mystical society arose in Holland called the 
Brethren of the Common Lot, who founded an establishment at which Groot 
dispensed the principles of mysticism to Radewyn and Thomas a Kempis.
     The attitude of mysticism at the period of the Reforma-tion is 
peculiar. We find a mystical propaganda pretend-ing to be sent forth by a 
body of Rosicrucians denouncing Roman Catholicism in the fiercest terms, and 
we also observe the spirit of mysticism strongly within those bodies which 
resisted the coldness and formalism of the Roman Church.  On the other hand, 
however, we find the principles of Luther strongly opposed by some of the 
most notable mystics of his time.  But the Reformation past, mysticism went 
on its way, divided, it is true, so far as the outward theological 
principles of its votaries were concerned, but strongly united in its 
general principles.
     It is with Nicholas of Kusa, who died in 1464, that mysticism triumphs 
over scholasticism.  Nicolas is the protagonist of super-knowledge, or that 
higher ignorance which is the knowledge of the intellect in contra-
distinction to the mere knowledge of the understanding.  His doctrines 
coloured those of Giordano Bruno and his theosophy cer-tainly preceded that 
of Paracelsus. The next great name we meet with in mysticism is that of 
Boehme (q.v.), who once and for all systematised German philosophy.  The 
Roman Church produced many mystics of note in the sixteenth and seventeenth 
centuries, notably Francis of Sales, Mme. Guyon and Molinos,-the last two of 
which were the protagonists of Quietism, which set forth the theory that 
there should be no pleasure in the practice of mysticism, and that God did 
not exist for the enjoyment of man. Perhaps the greatest students of Boehme 
were William Law (q.v.), i686 to 1765, and Saint Martin (q.v.), 1743 to 
1803.
     But all mysticism is not necessarily identified with sect, although 
undoubtedly its strongholds in this country to-day are to be found in 
certain circles of the Church of England. There are still with us mystics 
who, professing no definite theological tenets, are yet mystics in virtue of 
their desire for unity with, or proximity to the Deity, by what they call 
"magical" methods. These are obscure, and are probably the result of 
personal experiences, which it is not given to everyone to comprehend ; but 
which,. nevertheless, may be very real indeed. For a good sum-mary of such 
mysticism the reader is referred to Mr. A. E. Waite's Azoth or the Star in 
the East ;  See also Evelyn Underhill's Mysticism and The Mystic Way.

Napellus : A plant with narcotic properties, with which Van Helmont 
experimented.  He says that, having on one occasion roughly prepared the 
root, he tasted it with his tongue, and in a very short time found that the 
centre of thought and intellect was situated in the pit of his stomach. An 
unusual clarity and distinctness of thought rendered the experience a 
pleasant one, and he sought on future occasions to repeat it by the same 
means, but without success.  After about two hours he felt a slight 
dizziness and thereupon thought in the normal fashion with his brain.  But 
throughout the strange- experience he was conscious that his soul still 
remained in the brain as a governing power.

Nature Spirits or Elementals, according to theosophy,
have bodies composed of the finer kinds of matter. There are countless hosts 
of them, divided into seven classes, which allowing for two unmanifested, 
belong to the ether, air, fire, water, and earth,-the last four being called 
by the Kabalists, sylphs, salamanders, undines, and gnomes respectively; and 
at the head of each class is a deva or inferior god.  Nature spirits work in 
unsuspected ways, sometimes lending their aid to human beings in the form of 
certain faculties, and those in the astral world are en-gaged in the 
creation of form out of the matter which the outpouring of the Logos has 
quickened, hence it is they who form minerals, flowers, and so on.  These 
nature spirits of the astral worlds of course have bodies of astral matter, 
and they frequently from mischievous or other impulses, change the 
appearance of these bodies. They are just without the powers of ordinary 
vision, and many people of more acute vision can see them, while the action 
of drugs also may make them visible,

Naylor, James : An English impostor of the seventeenth century, born in the

the good opinion of the people, he resolved to set himself up for a sort of 
deity, and entered Bristol in 1656, mounted on a horse led by a man and a 
woman, while others ran behind chanting" Holy, holy, holy, is the god of 
Sabaoth." He was duly punished by having his tongue pierced with a hot iron, 
and his forehead marked with the letter " B" (blasphemer). This done, he was 
forced to ride into Bristol in disgrace, his face turned towards the horse's

Ndembo, The : Or Kita is a secret society which has wide-spread 
ramifications on the lower Congo, and especially in the districts lying to 
the south of that river.  Initiation is made through the ganga, or chief, 
who instructs the neophyte at a given signal suddenly to lie down as if 
dead. A shroud is spread over him, and he is carried off to an enclosure 
outside the village called vela, and is pronounced to have died a Ndembo. 
Perhaps twenty, thirty, or even fifty candidates ' die" at the one time.  It 
is then assumed that. persons "dying" in this manner decay until only a 
single bone remains, and this the ganga takes charge of. The process varies 
from three months to as many years, and the ganga is supposed by art magic 
to bring every one of the dead back to life within that period.  On a 
festival day of the Ndembo, the members march through the village in a grand 
procession amidst universal joy, carrying with them the persons who are 
supposed to have died.  The neophytes who are supposed to have perished, 
comport themselves as if in reality they had come from another world. They 
take new' names, pretend that everything in the terrestrial sphere is new to 
them, turn a deaf ear to their parents and relatives. and even affect not to 
know how to eat. They further desire to have everything they set eyes on, 
and if it is not granted to them immediately, they may fall upon the unhappy  
owner and beat and even kill him without any Consequence to themselves; as 
it is assumed that they are mere children in the affairs of the terrestrial 
sphere, and therefore know no better.
     Those who have gone through this rite are called Nganga, or the" 
knowing ones," while the neophytes are designated Vanga.  During their 
occupation of the vela they learn an esoteric language, which they 
constantly employ. Perhaps the best picture of their cult has been given by 
Bastian, who says:-
     “The Great Nkissi (who here replaces the fetish) lives in the interior 
of the woodlands where nobody can see him. When he dies the Nganga carefully 
collect his bones in order to bring them back to life, and nourish them that 
they may again put on flesh and blood. But it is not well to speak about it. 
In the Ambamba country everybody must have died once, and when the Nganga 
(replacing the fetish-priest) shakes his calabash against a village, those 
men and youths whose hour is come fall into a state of lifeless torpor, from 
which they generally rise up in three days. But the man whom the Nkissi 
loves he carries off to the bush and often buries him for a series of years.  
When he again awakens to life, he begins to eat and drink as before, but his 
mind is gone, and the Nganga must himself educate him and instruct him in 
every movement, like the smallest child. At first that can only be done with 
the rod, but the senses gradually return, so that you can speak with him. 
and when his education is finished the Nganga takes him back to his parents.  
These would seldom recognise him but for the positive assurance of the 
Nganga, who at the same time reminds them of earlier occurrences. Whoever 
has not yet undergone the experience in Ambamba is universally despised. and 
is not allowed to join in the dances."


Necromancy  Or divination by means of the spirits of the dead, from the 
Greek words nekros, dead;  and manteia, divination. It is through its 
Italian form nigromancia that it came to be known as the "Black Art." With 
the Greeks it originally signified the descent into Hades in order to 
consult the dead rather than summoning the dead into the mortal sphere 
again. The art is of almost universal usage. Con-siderable difference of 
opinion exists among modern adepts as to the exact methods to be properly 
pursued in the necromantic art, and it must be borne in mind that necro-
mancy, which in the Middle Ages was called sorcery, shades into modern 
spiritualistic practice.  There is no doubt however, that necromancy is the 
touch-stone of occultism, for if, after careful preparation the adept can 
carry through to a successful issue, the raising of the soul from the other 
world, he has proved the value of his art.  It would be fruitless in this 
place to enter into a psychological dis-cussion as to whether this feat is 
possible of accomplishment or not, and we will confine ourselves to the 
material which has been placed at our disposal by the sages of the past, who 
have left full details as to how the process should be approached.
     In the case of a compact existing between the conjuror and the devil, 
no ceremony is necessary, as the familiar is ever at hand to do the behests 
of his masters.  This, however, is never the case with the true sorcerer, 
who pre-serves his independence, and trusts to his profound know-ledge of 
the art and his powers of command ; his object therefore is to " constrain" 
some spirit to appear before him, and to guard himself from the danger of 
pro-voking such beings.  The magician, it must be understood always has an 
assistant, and every article flamed is pre-pared according to rules well 
known in the black art. In the first place they are to fix upon a spot 
proper for such a purpose; which must be either in a subterraneous vault, 
hung round with black, and lighted by a magical torch; or else in the centre 
of some thick wood or desert, or upon some extensive unfrequented plain, 
where several roads meet. or amidst the ruins of ancient castles, abbeys, 
monasteries, etc., or amongst the rocks on the sea shore, in some private 
detached churchyard, or any other solemn, melancholy place between the hours 
of twelve and one in the night, either when the moon shines very bright, or 
else when the elements are disturbed with storms of thunder, lightning, 
wind, and rain; for, in these places, times, and seasons, it is contended 
that spirits can with less difficulty manifest themselves to mortal eyes, 
and continue visible with the least pain, in this elemental external world.
     When the proper time and place is fixed on, a magic circle is to be 
formed, within which, the master and his associate are carefully to retire. 
The dimensions of the circle are as follow -A piece of ground is usually 
chosen, nine feet square, at the full extent of which parallel lines are 
drawn one within the other, having sundry crosses and triangles described 
between them, close to which is formed the first or outer circle, then, 
about half-a-foot within the same, a second circle is described, and within 
that another square correspondent to the first, the centre of which is the 
seat or spot where the master and associate are to be placed  "The vacancies 
formed by the various lines and angles of the figure are filled up with the 
holy names of God, having crosses and triangles described between them. The 
reason assigned by magicians and others for the institution and use of 
circles, is, that so much ground being blessed and consecrated by such holy 
words and ceremonies as they make use of in forming it, hath a secret force 
to expel all evil spirits from the bounds thereof, and, being sprinkled with 
pure sanctified water, the ground is purified from all uncleanness; besides, 
the holy names of God being written over every part of it, its force becomes 
so powerful that no evil spirit hath ability to break through it, or to get 
at the magician or his companion, by reason of the antipathy in nature they 
bear to these sacred names. And the reason given for the triangles is, that 
if the spirit be not easily brought to speak the truth, they may by the 
exorcist be conjured to enter the same, where, by virtue of the names of the 
essence and divinity of God, they can speak nothing but what is true and 
right. The circle, therefore, according to this account of it, is the 
principal fort and shield of the magician, from which he is not, at the 
peril of his life, to depart, till he has completely dis-missed the spirit, 
particularly if he be of a fiery or infernal nature.  Instances are recorded 
of many who perished by this means;  particularly " Chiancungi,"  the famous 
Egyptian fortune-teller, who was so famous in England in the 17th century.  
He undertook for a wager, to raise up the spirit " Bokim," and having 
described the circle, he seated his sister Napula by him as his associate.  
After frequently repeating the forms of exorcism, and calling upon the 
spirit to appear, and nothing as yet answering his demand, they grew 
impatient of the business, and quitted the circle, but it cost them their 
lives ; for they were instantaneously seized and crushed to death by that 
infernal spirit, who happened not to be sufficiently constrained till that 
moment, to manifest himself to human eyes."
     There is a prescribed form of consecrating the magic circle, which we 
omit as unnecessary in a general illustra-tion.  The proper attire or" 
pontificalibus" of a magician. is an ephod made of fine white linen, over 
that a priestly robe of black bombazine, reaching to the ground, with the 
two seals of the earth drawn correctly upon virgin parch-ment, and affixed 
to the breast of his outer vestment. Round his waist is tied a broad 
consecrated girdle, with the names Ya, Ya,-Aie, Aaie,-Elibra,-Elchim,-Sadai,
-Pah Adonai,-tuo robore,-Cinctus sum.  Upon his shoes must be written 
Tetragrammaton, with crosses round about; upon his head a high-crowned cap 
of sable silk, and in his hand a Holy Bible, printed or written in pure 
Hebrew. Thus attired, and standing within the charmed circle, the magician 
repeats the awful form of exorcism; and presently, the infernal spirits make 
strange and frightful noises, howlings, tremblings, flashes, and most 
dreadful shrieks and yells, as the forerunner of their becoming visible.  
Their first appearance is generally in the form of fierce and terrible lions 
or tigers, vomiting forth fire, and roaring hideously about the circle; all 
which time the exorcist must not suffer any tremour of dismay; for, in that 
case, they will gain the ascendency, and the consequences may touch his 
life. On the contrary, he must summon up a share of resolution, and continue 
repeating all the forms of constriction and confinement, until they are 
drawn nearer to the influence of the triangle, when their forms will change 
to appearances less ferocious and frightful, and become more submissive and 
tractable. When the forms of conjuration have in this manner been 
sufficiently repeated, the spirits forsake their bestial shapes, and enter 
the human form, appearing like naked men of gentle countenance and 
behaviour, yet is the magician to be warily on his guard that they deceive 
him not by such mild gestures, for they are exceedingly fraudu-lent and 
deceitful in their dealings with those who con-strain them to appear without 
compact, having nothing in view - but to suborn his mind, or accomplish his 
destruc-tion.  With great care also must the spirit be discharged after the 
ceremony is finished, and he has answered all the demands made upon him.  
The magician must wait patiently till he has passed through all the terrible 
forms which announce his coming, and only when the last shriek has died 
away, and every trace of fire and brimstone has disappeared, may he leave 
the circle and depart home in safety.  If the ghost of a deceased person is 
to be raised, the grave must be resorted to at midnight, and a different 
form of conjuration is necessary.  Still another, is the infernal sacrament 
for "any corpse that hath hanged, drowned, or otherwise made away with 
itself;" and in this case the conjurations are performed over the body, 
which will at last arise, and standing upright, answer with a faint and 
hollow voice the questions that are put to it.
     Eliphas Levi, in his Ritual of Transcendent Magic says that 'evocations 
should always have a motive and a becom-ing end, otherwise they are works of 
darkness and folly, dangerous for health and reason."  The permissible 
motive of an evocation may be either love or intelligence. 
Evoca-tions of love require less apparatus and are in every respect easier. 
The procedure is as follows "We must, in the first place, carefully collect 
the memorials of him (or her) whom we desire to behold, the articles he 
used, and on which his impression remains; we must also prepare an apartment 
in which the person lived, or otherwise one of a similar kind, and place his 
portrait veiled in white therein, sur-rounded with his favourite flowers, 
which must be renewed daily.  A fixed date must then be observed, either the 
birthday of the person, or that day which was most fortu-nate for his and 
our own affection, one of which we may believe that his soul, however 
blessed elsewhere, cannot lose the remembrance ; this must be the day for 
the evoca-tion, and we must provide for it during the space of fourteen 
days.  Throughout this period we must refrain from extending to anyone the 
same proofs of affection which we have the right to expect from the dead; we 
must observe strict chastity, live in retreat, and take only one modest and 
light collation daily. every evening at the same hour we must shut ourselves 
in the chamber consecrated to the memory of the lamented person, using only 
one small light, such as that of a funeral lamp or taper.  This light should 
be placed behind us, the portrait should be uncovered and we should remain 
before it for an hour, in silence; finally, we should fumigate the apartment 
with a little good incense, and go out backwards.  On the morning of the day 
fixed for the evocation, we should adorn ourselves as if for a festival, not 
salute anyone first, make but a single repast of bread; wine, and roots, or 
fruits ; the cloth should be white, two covers should be laid, and one 
portion of the bread broken should be set aside; a little wine should also 
be placed in the glass of the person we design to invoke.  The meal must be 
eaten alone in the chamber of evocations. and in presence of the veiled 
portrait; it must be all cleared away at the end, except the glass belong-
ing to the dead person, and his portion of bread, which must be placed 
before the portrait.  In the evening, at the hour for the regular visit, we 
must repair in silence to the chamber, light a clear fire of cypress-wood, 
and cast incense seven times thereon, pronouncing the name of the person 
whom we desire to behold.  The lamp must then be extinguished, and the fire 
permitted to die out. On this day the portrait must not be unveiled. When 
the flame is extinct, put more incense on the ashes, and invoke God 
according to the forms of the religion to which the dead person belonged, 
and according to the ideas which he him-self possessed of God. While making 
this prayer we must identify ourselves with the evoked person, speak as he 
spoke, believe in a sense as he believed ; then, after a silence of fifteen 
minutes, we must speak to him as if he were present, with affection and with 
faith, praying him to manifest to us.  Renew this prayer mentally, covering 
the face with both hands; then call him thrice with a loud voice; tarry on 
our knees, the eyes closed and covered, for some minutes; then call again 
thrice upon him in a sweet and affectionate tone, and slowly open the eyes.  
Should nothing result, the same experiment must be renewed in the following 
year, and if necessary a third time, when it is certain that the desired 
apparition will be obtained, and the longer it has been delayed the more 
realistic and striking it will be
     "Evocations of knowledge and intelligence are made with more solemn 
ceremonies.  If concerned with a celebrated personage, we must meditate for 
twenty-one days upon his life and writings, form an idea of his appearance, 
converse with him mentally, and imagine his answers; carry his portrait, or 
at least his name, about us; follow a vegetable diet for twenty-one days, 
and a severe fast during the last seven.  We must next construct the magical 
oratory. This oratory must be invariably darkened; but if we operate in the 
daytime, we may leave a narrow aperture on the side where the sun will shine 
at the hour of the evocation, and place a triangular prism before the 
opening, and a crystal globe, filled with water, before the prism. If the 
operation be arranged for the night the magic lamp must be so placed that 
its single ray shall upon the altar smoke.  The purpose of the preparations 
is to furnish the magic agent with elements of corporeal appearance, and to 
ease as much as possible the tension of imagination, which could not be 
exalted without danger into the absolute illusion of dream. For the rest, it 
will be easily understood that a beam of sunlight, or the ray of a lamp, 
coloured variously, and falling upon curling and irregular smoke, can in no 
way create a perfect image.  The chafing-dish con-taining the sacred fire 
should be in the centre of the oratory, and the altar of perfumes close by. 
The operator must turn towards the east to pray, and the west to invoke; he 
must be either alone or assisted by two persons preserving the strictest 
silence ; he must wear the magical vestments, which we have described in the 
seventh chapter, and must be crowned with vervain and gold.  He should bathe 
before the operation, and all his under garments must be of the most intact 
and scrupulous cleanliness.  The cere-mony should begin with a prayer suited 
to the genius of the spirit about to be invoked and one which would be 
approved by himself if he still lived.  For example, it would be impossible 
to evoke Voltaire by reciting prayers in the style of St. Bridget.  For the 
great men of antiquity, we may see the hymns of Cleanthes or Orpheus, with 
the adjuration terminating the Golden Verses of Pythagoras. In our own 
evocation of Apollonius, we used the magical philosophy of Patricius for the 
ritual, containing the doctrines of Zoroaster and the writings of Hermes 
Trisme-gistus.  We recited the Nuctemeron of Apollonius in Greek with a loud 
voice and added the following conjura-tion :-          
     “Vouchsafe to be present, O Father of All, and thou Thrice Mighty 
Hermes, Conductor of the Dead.  Asclepius son of Hephaistus, Patron of the 
Healing Art; and thou Osiris, Lord of strength and vigour, do thou thyself 
be present too.  Arnebascenis, Patron of Philosophy, and yet again 
Asclepius, son of Imuthe, who presidest over poetry.
     “Apollonius, Apollonius, Apollonius, Thou teachest the Magic of 
Zoroaster, son of Oromasdes; and this is the worship of the Gods."
     For the evocation of spirits belonging to religions issued from 
Judaism, the following kabalistic invocation  of Solomon should be used, 
either in Hebrew, or in any other tongue with which the spirit in question 
is known to have been familiar
     “Powers of the Kingdom, be ye under my left foot and in my right hand!  
Glory and Eternity, take me by the two shoulders, and direct me in the paths 
of victory Mercy and Justice, be ye the equilibrium and splendour of my life 
!  Intelligence and Wisdom, crown me !  Spirits of Malchuth, lead me betwixt 
the two pillars upon which rests the whole edifice of the temple !  Angels 
of Netsah and Hod, strengthen me upon the cubic stone of Jesod!  O Gedulael 
! O Geburael !  O Tiphereth ! Binael, be thou my love !  Ruach Hochmael, be 
thou my light !  Be that which thou art and thou shalt be, O Ketheriel ! 
Tschim, assist me in the name of Saddai  Cherubim, be my strength in the 
name of Adonai !  Bemi-Elohim, be my brethren in the name of the Son, and by 
the power of Zebaoth !  Eloim, do battle for me in the name of Tetra-
grammation ! Malachim, protect me in the name of Jod He Vau He !  Seraphim, 
cleanse my love in the name of Elvoh !  Hasmalim, enlighten me with the 
splendours of Eloi and Shechinah !  Aralim, act!  Ophanim, revolve and 
shine!  Hajoth a Kadosh, cry, speak, roar, bellow Kadosh, Kadosh, Kadosh, 
Saddai, Adonai, Jotchaveh, Eieazereie :  Hallelu-jah, Hallelu-jah, Hallelu-
jah.  Amen.'
     It should be remembered above all, in conjurations, that the names of 
Satan, Beelzebub, Adramelek, and others do not designate spiritual unities, 
but legions of impure spirits.
     “Our name is legion, for we are many," says the spirit of darkness in 
the Gospel. Number constitutes the law, and progress takes place inversely 
in hell-that is to say, the most advanced in Satanic development, and 
consequently the most degraded, are the least intelligent and feeblest. 
Thus, a fatal law drives the demons downward when they wish and believe 
themselves to be ascending.  So also those who term themselves chiefs are 
the most impotent and despised of all.  As to the horde of perverse spirits, 
they tremble before an unknown, invisible, incomprehensible, capricious, 
implacable chief, who never explains his law, whose arm is ever stretched 
out to strike those who fail to understand him.  They give this phantom the 
names of Baal, Jupiter, and even others more venerable, which cannot, 
without profanation, be pronounced in hell.  But this Phantom is only a 
shadow and remnant of God, dis-figured by their willful perversity, and 
persisting in their imagination like a vengeance of justice and a remorse of 
truth.
     "When the evoked spirit of light manifests with dejected or irritated 
countenance, we must offer him a moral sacri-fice, that is, be inwardly 
disposed to renounce whatever offends him; and before leaving the oratory, 
we must dismiss him, saying: " May peace be with thee!  I have not wished to 
trouble thee; do thou torment me not.  I shall labour to improve myself as 
to anything that vexes thee.  I pray, and will still pray, with thee and for 
thee. Pray thou also both with' and for me, and return to thy great slumber, 
expecting that day when we shall wake together.  Silence and adieu!”
     Christian, in his Historie de le magie (Paris, 1871) says:-
     “The place chosen for the evocation is not an unimportant point.  The 
most auspicious is undoubtedly that room which contains the last traces of 
the lamented person.  If it be impossible to fulfil this condition, we must 
go in search of some isolated rural retreat which corresponds in orienta-
tion and aspect, as well as measurement, with the mortuary chamber.
     "The window must be blocked with boards of olive wood, hermetically 
joined, so that no exterior light may penetrate.  The ceiling, the four 
interior walls, and the floor must be draped with tapestry of emerald green 
silk, which the operator must himself secure with copper nails, invoking no 
assistance from strange hands, because, from this moment, he alone may enter 
into this spot set apart from all, the arcane Oratory of the Magus.  The 
furniture which belonged to the deceased, his favourite possessions and 
trinkets, the things on which his final glance may be supposed to have 
rested-all these must be assiduously collected and arranged in the order 
which they occupied at the time of his death.  If none of these souvenirs 
can be obtained, a faithful likeness of the departed being must at least be 
procured, it must be full length, and must be depicted in the dress and 
colours which he wore during the last period of his life.  This portrait 
must be set up on the eastern wall by means of copper fasteners, must be 
covered with a veil of white silk, and must be surmounted with a crown of 
those flowers which were most loved by the deceased.
     “Before this portrait there must be erected an altar of white marble, 
supported by four columns which must terminate in bull's feet.  A five-
pointed star must be emblazoned on the slab of the altar, and must be com-
posed of pure copper plates.  The place in the centre of the
star, between the plates, must be large enough to receive the pedestal of 'a 
cup-shaped copper chafing-dish, containing dessicated fragments of ,,'laurel 
wood and alder.  By the side of the chafing-dish must be placed a censer 
full of incense.  The skin of a 'white and spotless ram must be stretched 
beneath the alter, and on it must be emblazoned another pentagram drawn with 
parallel lines of azure blue, golden yellow, emerald green, and purple red.
     “A copper tripod must be erected in the middle of the Oratory; it must 
be perfectly triangular in form, it must be surmounted by another and 
similar chafing-dish, which must likewise contain a quantity of dried olive 
wood.
     "A high candelabrum of copper must be placed by the wall on the 
southern side, and must contain a single taper of purest white wax, which 
must alone illuminate the mystery of the evocation.
     "The white colour of the altar, of the ram's skin, and of the veil, is 
consecrated to Gabriel, the planetary archangel of the moon, and the Genius 
of mysteries ; the green of the copper and the tapestries is dedicated to 
the Genius of Venus.
     "The altar and tripod must both be encompassed by a magnetized iron 
chain, and by three garlands composed of the foliage and blossoms of the 
myrtle, the olive, and the rose.
Finally, facing the portrait, and on the eastern side, there must be a 
canopy, also draped with emerald silk, and supported by two triangular 
columns of olive wood, plated with purest copper.  On the North and South 
sides, between each of these columns and the wall, the tapestry must fall in 
long folds to the ground, forming a kind of tabernacle; which must be open 
on the eastern side.  At the foot of each column there must be a sphinx of 
white marble, with a cavity in the top of the head to receive spices for 
burning. It is beneath this canopy that the apparitions will manifest, and 
it should be remembered that the Magus must turn to the east for prayer, and 
to the west for evocation.
     “Before entering this little sanctuary, devoted to the religion of 
remembrance, the operator must be clothed in a vestment of azure, fastened 
by clasps of copper, enriched with a single emerald.  He must wear upon his 
head a tiara surrounded by a floriated circle of twelve emeralds, and a 
crown of violets.  On his breast must be the talis-man of Venus depending 
from a ribbon of azure silk.  On the annular finger of his left hand must be 
a copper ring containing a turquoise.  His feet must be covered with shoes 
of azure silk, and he must be provided with a fan of swan 5 feathers to 
dissipate, if needful, the smoke of the perfumes.
     “The Oratory and all its objects must be consecrated on a Friday, 
during the hours which are set apart to the Genius of Venus.  This 
consecration is performed by burning violets and roses in a fire of olive 
wood.  A shaft must be provided in the Oratory for the passage of the smoke, 
but care must be taken to prevent the admission of light through this 
channel.
When these preparations are finished, the operator must impose on himself a 
retreat of one-and -twenty days, beginning on the anniversary of the death 
of the beloved being.  During this period he must refrain from conferring on 
any one the least of those marks of affection which he was accustomed to 
bestow on the departed  he must be absolutely chaste, alike in deed and 
thought; he must take daily but one repast, consisting of bread, wine, 
roots, and fruits.  These three conditions are indispensable to success in 
evocation, and their accomplishment requires complete isolation.
     “Every day, shortly before mid-night, the Magus must assume his 
consecrated dress.  On the stroke of the mystic hour, - he must enter the 
Oratory, bearing a lighted candle in his right hand, and in the other an 
hour-glass.  The candle must be fixed in the candelabra, and the hour-glass 
on the altar to register the flight of time.  The operator must then proceed 
to replenish the garland and the floral crown.  Then he shall unveil the 
portrait, and erect it immovable in front of the altar, being thus with his 
face to the East, he shall softly go over in his mind the cherished 
recollections he possesses of the beloved and departed being.
     "When the upper reservoir of the hour-glass is empty the time of 
contemplation will be over.  By the flame of the taper the operator must 
then kindle the laurel wood and alder in the chafing-dish which stands on 
the altar; then, taking a pinch of incense from the censer, let him cast it 
thrice upon the fire, repeating the following words Glory be to the Father 
of life universal in the splendour of the infinite altitude, and peace in 
the twilight of the im-measurable depths to all Spirits of good will
     "Then he shall cover the portrait, and taking up his candle in his 
hand, shall depart from the Oratory, walking backward at a slow pace as far 
as the threshold.  The same ceremony must be fulfilled at the same hour 
during every day of the retreat, and at each visit the crown which is above 
the portrait, and the garlands of the altar and tripod must be carefully 
renewed. The withered leaves and flowers must be burnt each evening in a 
room adjoining the Oratory.
     "When the twenty-first day has arrived, the Magus must do his best to 
have no communication with any one, but if this be impossible, he must not 
be the first to speak, and he must postpone all business till the morrow.  
On the stroke of noon, he must arrange a small circular table in the 
Oratory, and cover it with a new napkin of un-blemished whiteness.  It must 
be garnished with two copper chalices, an entire loaf, and a crystal flagon 
of the purest wine.  The bread must be broken and not cut, and the wine 
emptied in equal portions into the two cups. Half of this mystic communion. 
which must be his sole nourishment on this supreme day, shall be offered by 
the operator to the dead, and by the light of the one taper he must eat his 
own share, standing before the veiled portrait. Then he shall retire as 
before, walking backward as far as the threshold, and leaving the ghost's 
share of the bread and wine upon the table.
     "When the solemn hour of the evening has at length arrived the Magus 
shall carry into the Oratory some well-dried cypress wood, which he shall 
set alight on the altar and the tripod.  Three pinches of incense shall be 
cast on the altar flame in honour of the Supreme Potency which mani-fests 
itself by Ever Active Intelligence and by Absolute Wisdom.  When the wood of 
the two chafing-dishes has been reduced to embers, he must renew the triple 
offering of incense on the altar, and must cast some seven times on the fire 
in the tripod ; at each evaporation of the consecrated perfume he must 
repeat the previous doxology, and then turning to the East, he must call 
upon God by the prayer of that religion which was professed by the person 
whom he desires to evoke.
     “When the prayers are over he must reverse his position and with his 
face to the West, must enkindle the chafing-dishes on the head of each 
sphinx, and when the cypress is fully ablaze he must heap over it well-dried 
violets and roses.  Then let him extinguish the candle which illuminates the 
Oratory, and falling on his knees before the canopy, between the two 
columns, let him mentally address the beloved person with a plenitude of 
faith and affection. Let him solemnly entreat it to appear and renew this 
interior adjuration seven times, under the auspices of the seven 
providential Genii, endeavouring during the whole of the time to exalt his 
soul above the natural weakness of humanity. 
     “Finally, the operator, with closed eyes, and with hands covering his 
face, must call the invoked person in a loud but gentle voice, pronouncing 
three times all the names which he bore.
     “Some moments after the third appeal, he must extend his arms in the 
form of a cross, and lifting up his eyes, he will behold the beloved being, 
in a recognisable manner, in front of him.  That is to say, he will perceive 
that ethereal substance separated from the perishable terrestrial body, the 
fluidic envelope of the soul, which Kabalistic initiates have termed the 
Perispirit.  This substance preserves the human form but is emancipated from 
human infirmities, and is energised by the special characteristics whereby 
the imperishable individuality of our essence is manifested. Evoked and 
Evoker can then inter-communicate intelligibly by a mutual and mysterious 
thought-transmission.
     “The departed soul will give counsel to the operator; it will 
occasionally reveal secrets which may be beneficial to those whom it loved 
on earth, but it will answer no question which has reference to the desires 
of the flesh; it will discover no buried treasures, nor will it unveil the 
secrets of a third person ; it is silent on the mysteries of the superior 
existence to which it has now attained.  In certain cases, it will, however, 
declare itself either happy or in punishment.  If it be the latter, it will 
ask for the prayer of the Magus, or for some religious observance, which we 
must unfailingly fulfill.  Lastly, it will indicate the time when the 
evocation may be renewed.
     “When it has disappeared, the operator must turn to the East, rekindle 
the fire on the altar, and make a final offering of incense.  Then he must 
detach the crown and the garlands, take up his candle, and retire with his 
face to the West till he is out of the Oratory.  His last duty is to burn 
the final remains of the flowers and leaves.  Their ashes, united to those 
which have been collected during the time of retreat, must be mixed with 
myrtle seed, and secretly buried in a field at a depth which will secure it 
from disturbance of the ploughshare."
     The last two examples are, of course, those of  white" necromancy.  The 
procedure followed by savage tribes is of course totally different.  Among 
certain Australian tribes the necromants are called Birraark.  It is said 
that a Birraark was supposed to be initiated by the " mrarts" (ghosts) when 
they met him wandering in the bush.  It was from the ghosts that he obtained 
replies to questions con-cerning events passing at a distance, or yet to 
happen, which might be of interest or moment to his tribe.  An account of a 
spiritual stance in the bush is given in Kam-ilaroi and Kurnai" (p. 254)    
The fires were let down the Birraark uttered the cry Coo-ee' at intervals.  
At length a distant reply was heard, and shortly afterwards the sound as of 
persons jumping on the ground in succession. A voice was then heard in the 
gloom asking in a strange intonation What is wanted ? '  At the termination 
of the stance, the spirit voice said, We are going.'  Finally, the Birraark 
was found in the top of an almost inaccessible tree, apparently asleep."  
(See also New Zealand.)
     In Japan, ghosts can be raised in various ways.  One mode is to  “put 
into an andon" (a paper lantern in a frame), " a hundred rushlights, and 
repeat an incantation of a hundred lines.  One of these rushlights is taken 
out at the end of each line, and the would-be ghost-seer then goes out in 
the dark with one light still burning, and blows it out, when the ghost 
might to appear.  Girls who have lost their lovers by death often try that 
sorcery."
     The mode of procedure as practised in Scotland was thus.  The haunted 
room was made ready.  Re,  who was to do the daring deed, about nightfall 
entered the room, bearing with him a table, a chair, a candle, a compass, a 
crucifix if one could be got, and a Bible.  With the com-pass he cast a 
circle on the middle of the floor, large enough to hold the chair and the 
table.  He placed within the circle the chair and the table, and on the 
table he laid the Bible and the crucifix beside the lighted candle.  If he 
had not a crucifix, then he drew the figure of a cross on the floor within 
the circle.  When all this was done, he rested himself on the chair, opened 
the Bible, and waited for the coming of the spirit.  Exactly at midnight the 
spirit came. Sometimes the door opened slowly, and there glided in 
noiselessly a lady sheeted in white, with a face of woe and told her story 
to the man on his asking her in the name of God what she wanted.  What she 
wanted was done in the morning, and the spirit rested ever after.  Some-
times the spirit rose from the floor, and sometimes came forth from the 
wall.  One there was who burst into the room with a strong bound, danced 
wildly round the circle, and flourished a long whip round the man's head, 
but never dared to step within the circle.  During a pause in his frantic 
dance he was asked, in God's name, what he wanted.  He ceased his dance and 
told his wishes.  His wishes were carried out, and the spirit was in peace."
     In Wraxall's " Memoirs of the Courts of Berlin, Dresden, Warsaw, and 
Vienna" there is an amusing account of the raising of the ghost of the 
Chevalier de Saxe.  Reports had been circulated that at his palace at 
Dresden there was secreted a large sum of money, and it was urged that if 
his spirit could be compelled to appear, interesting secrets might be 
extorted from him.  Curiosity, combined with avarice, accordingly prompted 
his principal heir, Prince Charles, to try the experiment. and, on the 
appointed night, Schrepfer was the operator in raising the apparition.  He 
commenced his proceedings by retiring into the corner of the gallery, where, 
kneeling down with many mysterious ceremonies, lie invoked the spirit to 
appear.  At length a loud clatter was heard at all the windows on the 
outside, resembling more the effect produced by a number of wet fingers 
drawn over the edge of glasses than anything else to which it could well be 
compared.  This sound announced the arrival of the good spirits, and was 
shortly followed by a yell of a frightful and unusual nature, which 
indicated the presence of malignant spirits.  Schrepfer continued his 
invocations, when " the door suddenly opened with violence, and something 
that resembled a black ball or globe rolled into the room.  It was enveloped 
in smoke or cloud, in the midst of which appeared a human face, like the 
countenance of the Chevalier de Saxe, from which issued a loud and angry 
voice, exclaiming in German,  Carl, was wollte du mit mich ? "- Charles, 
what would thou do with me ? By reiterated exorcisms Schrepfer finally 
dismissed the apparition, and the terrified spectators dispersed fully 
convinced of his magical powers.


Neoplatonism : A mystical philosophic system initiated by Plotinus of 
Alexandria A.D. 233, which combined the philosophy of ancient Greece with 
more modern spiritual cravings.  Although to some extent founded on the 
teach-log of Plato, it was undoubtedly' sophisticated by a deep mysticism, 
which in all probability emanated from the traditions of the land in which 
it originated.  To a great extent it coloured the thought of medieval 
mysticism and magic.  Plotinus, its founder, commenced the study of 
philosophy in Alexandria at the age of 28.  He early experienced an earnest 
desire to reach the truth concern-ing existence, and to that end made a deep 
study of the dialogues of Plato and the metaphysics of Aristotle.  He 
practised the most severe austerities, and attempted to live what he called 
the  angelic " life, or the life of the disembodied in the body.  He was 
greatly drawn to Apollonius of Tyana by reading his Life by Philostratus, 
and gave credence to many of the marvels recorded therein. The union of 
philosopher and priest in the character of Apollonius fired the imagination 
of Plotinus, and in his Pythagorean teachings the young student discovered 
the elements of both Orientalism and Platonism,-for both Pythagoras and 
Plato strove to escape the sensuous, and to realise in contemplative 
abstraction that tranquility superior to desire and passion which made men 
approach the gods; but in the hands of the later Pythagoreans and 
Platonists, the principles of the Hellenic masters degenerated into a 
species of theurgic freemasonry.  Many of the Pythagoreans had joined the 
various Orphic associa-tions, and indeed had sunk to be mere itinerant 
vendors of charms.
     It is probable that at Alexandria Plotinus heard from Orientals the 
principles of eastern theosophy, which he did not find in Plato.  But 
everywhere he found a grow-ing indifference to religion as known to the more 
ancient Greeks and Egyptians.  By this time, the Pantheons of Greece, Rome 
and Egypt, had become fused in the worship of Serapis, and this fusion had 
been forwarded by the works of Plutarch, Apuleius, and Lucian.  The position 
of philosophy at this time was by no means a strong one.  In fact 
speculation had given place to ethical teaching. and philosophy was regarded 
more as a branch of literature, or an elegant recreation.  Plotinus 
persuaded himself that philosophy and religion should be one; that 
speculation should be a search after God.  It was at this time that he first 
heard of Ammonius Saccas, who shortly before had been a porter in the 
streets of Alexandria, and who lectured upon the possibilities of 
reconciling Plato and Aristotle. "Scepticism," said Ammonius, "was death." 
He recom-mended men to travel back across the past, and out of the whole 
bygone world of thought to construct a system greater than any of its parts. 
This teaching formed an epoch in the life of Plotinus, who was convinced 
that Platonism, exalted into a species of illuminism and drawing to itself 
like a magnet all the scattered truth of the bygone ages. could alone 
preserve mankind from scepticism.  He occupied himself only with the most 
abstract questions concerning knowledge and being.  "Truth," according to 
him, "is not the agreement of our comprehension of an external object with 
the object itself, but rather the agree-ment of the mind with itself.  For 
the philosopher the objects we contemplate, and that which comtemplates are 
identical: both are thought."  All truth is then easy. Reduce the soul to 
its most perfect simplicity, and we find it is capable of exploration into 
the infinite; indeed it becomes one with the infinite. This is the condition 
of ecstasy, and to accomplish it a stoical austerity and ascetic-ism was 
necessary.  The Neoplatonists were thus ascetics and enthusiasts.  Plato was 
neither.  According to Plotin-us, the mystic contemplates the divine 
perfection in him-self; all worldly things and logical distinctions 
vanishing the period of ecstasy. This, of course, is purely Oriental and not 
Platonic at all.  Plotinus regards the individual existence as phenomenal 
and transitory, and subordinates reason to ecstasy where the Absolute is in 
question.  It is only at the end of his chain of reasoning that he 
introduces the supernatural.  He is flist a rational-ist, afterwards a 
mystic, and only a mystic when he finds that he cannot employ the machinery 
of reason. The letter of Plotinus, written about 200 A.D. well embodies his 
ideas on these beads, and is as follows:-
“Plotinus to Flaccus.-I applaud your devotion to philosophy; I rejoice to 
hear that your soul has set sail, like the returning Ulysses.;...for its 
native land-that glorious, that only real country-the world of unseen truth. 
To follow philosophy, the senator Rogatianus, one of the noblest of my 
disciples, gave up the other day all but the whole of his patrimony, set 
free his slaves, and surrendered all the honours of his station.
     “Tidings have reached us that Valerian has been defeated and is now in 
the hands of Sapor. The threats of Franks and Allemanni, of Goths and 
Persians, are alike terrible by turns to our degenerate Rome.  In days like 
these, crowded with incessant calamities, the inducements to a life of con-
templation are more than ever strong.  Even my quiet existence seems now to 
grow somewhat sensible of the advance of years.  Age alone I am unable to 
debar from my retirement.  I am weary already of this prison-house, the 
body, and calmly await the day when the divine nature within me shall. be 
set free from matter.
     “The Egyptian priests used to tell me that a single touch with the wing 
of their holy bird could charm the crocodile into torpor; it is not thus 
speedily, my dear friend, that the pinions of your soul will have power to 
still the untamed body.  The creature will yield only to watchful, strenuous 
constancy of habit.  Purify your soul from all undue hope and fear about 
earthly things, mortify the body, deny self,-affections as well as 
appetites, and the inner eye will begin to exercise its clear and solemn 
vision.
     "You ask me to tell you how we know, and what 'is our criterion of 
certainty. To write is always irksome to me. But for the continual 
solicitations of Porphyry, I should not have left a line to survive me. For 
your own sake, and for your father's, my reluctance shall be overcome.
     “External objects present us only with appearances. Concerning them, 
therefore, we may be said to posses opinion rather than knowledge. The 
distinctions in the actual world of appearance are of import only to 
ordinary and practical men. Our question lies within the ideal reality which 
exists behind appearance. How does the mind perceive these ideas? Are they 
without us, and is the reason, like sensation, occupied with objects 
external to itself? What certainty could we then have, what assurance that 
our perception was infallible ? The object perceived would be a something 
different from the mind perceiving it. We should have then an image instead 
of reality. It would be monstrous to believe for a moment that the mind was 
unable to perceive ideal truth exactly as it is, and that we had not 
certainty and real knowledge concerning the world of intelligence. It 
follows, therefore, that this region of truth is not to be investigated as a 
thing external to us, and so only imperfectly known. It is within us. Here 
the objects we contemplate and that which contemplates are identical,-both 
are thought. The subject cannot surely know an object different from itself. 
The world of ideas lies within our intelligence. Truth, therefore, is not 
the agreement of our apprehension of an external object with the object 
itself. It is the agreement of the mind with itself  Consciousness, 
therefore, is the sole basis of certainty. The mind is its own witness. 
Reason sees in itself that which is above itself as its source and again, 
that which is below itself as still itself once more.
     “Knowledge has three  degrees - Opinion, Science, Illumination.  The 
means or instrument of the first is sense; of the second, dialectic; of the 
third intuition. To the last I subordinate reason.  It is absolute 
knowledge founded on the identity of the mind knowing with the object known. 
     “There is a raying out of all orders of existence, an external  
emanation from the ineffable One (prudos).   There is again a returning 
impulse, drawing all upwards and inwards towards the centre from whence all 
came (epistrophe).  Love, as Plato in the Banquet beautifully says, is the 
child of Poverty and Plenty.  In the amorous quest of the soul after the 
Good, lies the painful sense of fall and deprivation.  But that Love is 
blessing, is salva-tion, is our guardian genius; without it the centrifugal 
law would overpower us, and sweep our souls out far from their source toward 
the cold extremities of the Material and the Manifold. The wise man 
recognises the idea of the Good within him. This he develops by withdrawal 
into the Holy Place of his own soul. He who does not understand how the soul 
contains the Beautiful within itself, seeks to realize beauty without, by 
laborious pro-duction. His aim should rather be to concentrate and simplify, 
and so to expand his being; instead of going out into the Manifold, to 
forsake it 'for the One, and so to float upwards towards the divine fount of 
being whose stream flows within him.
     "You ask, how can we know the Infinite?  I answer, not by reason.  It 
is the office of reason to distinguish and define.  The Infinite, therefore, 
cannot be ranked among its objects.  You can only apprehend the Infinite by 
a faculty superior to reason, by entering into a state in which you are your 
finite self no longer, in which the Divine Essence is communicated to you.  
This is Ecstasy. It is the liberation of your mind from its finite 
conscious-ness.  Like only can apprehend like; when you thus cease to be 
finite, you become one with the Infinite.  In the reduction of your soul to 
its simplest self (aplosis), its divine essence, you realize this Union, 
this Identity (enosin)
     “But this sublime condition is not of permanent dura-tion.  It is only 
now and then that we can enjoy this elevation (mercifully made possible for 
us) above the limits of the body and the world.  I myself have realized it 
but three times as yet, and Porphyry hitherto not once. All that tends to 
purify and elevate the mind will assist you in this attainment, and 
facilitate the approach and the recurrence of these happy intervals.  There 
are, then, different roads by which this end may be reached. The love of 
beauty which exalts the poet; that devotion to the One and that ascent of 
science which makes the am-bition of the philosopher; and that love and 
those prayers by which some devout and ardent soul tends in its moral purity 
towards perfection.  These are the great highways conducting to that height 
above the actual and the particu-lar where we stand in the immediate 
presence of the Infinite, who shines out as from the deeps of the soul."
     Plotinus appears to have been greatly indebted to Numenius for some of 
the ideas peculiar to his system. Numenius attempted to harmonise Pythagoras 
and Plato, to elucidate and confirm the opinions of both by the relig-ious 
dogmas of the Egyptians, the Magi and the Brahmans; and he believed that 
Plato was indebted to the Hebrew as well as to the Egyptian theology for 
much of his wisdom. Like Plotinus he was puzzled that the immutable One 
could find it possible to create the Manifold without self-degradation, and 
he therefore posited a Being whom he calls the Demi-urge, or Artificer, who 
merely carried out the will of God in constructing the universe.
     Taken in a nutshell, the mysticism of Plotinus is as follows: One 
cannot know God in any partial or finite manner; to know him truly we must 
escape from the finite, from all that is earthly, from the very gifts of God 
to God Himself, and know him in the infinite way by receiving, or being 
received into him directly.  To accom-plish this, and to attain this 
identity, we must withdraw into our inmost selves, into our own essence, 
which alone is Susceptible of blending with the Divine Essence.  Hence 
inmost is the highest, and as with all systems of mystic-ism introversion is 
ascension, and God is found within.
     Porphyry entered the school of Plotinus when it had become an 
institution' of some standing.  At first he strongly opposed the teachings 
of his master, but soon became his most devoted scholar.  He directed a 
fierce assault on Christianity, and at the same time launched strictures at 
Paganism; hot both forces were too strong for him. The attempt of the school 
to combine religion and philosophy robbed the first of its only power, and 
the last of its only principle.  Religion in the hands of the Neoplatonists 
lost all sanctity and authoritativeness, and philosophy all scientific 
precision, and the attempt to philosophise superstition ended in mere 
absurdity. But they succeeded in one thing, and that was in making 
philosophy superstitious-no very difficult task.
     Porphyry modified the doctrine of Plotinus regarding ecstasy, by 
stating that in that condition the mind does not lose its consciousness of 
personality. He calls it a dream in which the soul, dead to the world, rises 
to a species of divine activity, to an elevation above reason, action and 
liberty. He believed in a certain order of evil genii, who took pleasure in 
hunting wild beasts, and others of whom hunted souls that had escaped from 
the fetters of the body; so that to escape them, the soul must once more 
take refuge in the flesh. Porphyry's theosophic conceptions, based on those 
of Plotinus, were strongly and ably traversed by the theurgic mysteries of 
lamblichus, to whom the priest was a prophet full of deity. Criticising 
Porphyry, lamblichus says
     “Often, at the moment of inspiration, or when the afflatus has 
subsided, a fiery Appearance is seen,-the entering or departing Power. Those 
who are skilled in this wisdom can tell by the character of this glory the 
rank of divinity who has seized for the time the reins of the mystic's soul, 
and guides it as he will. Sometimes the body of the man subject to this 
influence is violently agitated, sometimes it is rigid and motionless. In 
some instances sweet music is heard, in others, discordant and fearful 
sounds.  The person of the subject has been known to dilate and tower to a 
superhuman height; in other cases, it has been lifted up into the air. 
Frequently, not merely the ordinary exercise of reason, but sensation and 
animal life would appear to have been suspended; and the subject of the 
afflatus has not felt the application of fire, has been pierced with spits, 
cut with knives, and been sensible of no pain. Yea, often, the more the body 
and the mind have been alike enfeebled by vigil and by fasts, the more 
ignorant or mentally imbecile a youth may be who is brought under this 
influence, the more freely and unmixedly will the divine power be made 
manifest. So clearly are these wonders the work, not of human skill or 
wisdom, but of supernatural agency l Characteristics such as these I have 
mentioned, are the marks of the true inspiration.
     “Now, there are, O Agathocles, four great orders of spiritual 
existence,-Gods, Daemons, Heroes or Demi-gods, and Souls. You will naturally 
be desirous to learn how the apparition of a God or a Daemon is 
distinguished from those of Angels, Principalities, or Souls.  Know, then, 
that their appearance to man corresponds to their nature, and that they 
always manifest themselves to those who invoke them in a manner consonant 
with their rank in the hierarchy of spiritual natures.  The appearances of 
Gods are uniform, those of Daemons various.  The Gods shine with a benign 
aspect.  When a God mani-fests himself, he frequently appears to hide sun or 
moon, and seems as he descends too vast for earth to contain. Archangels are 
at once awful and mild; Angels yet more gracious;  Daemons terrible.  Below 
the four leading classes I have mentioned are placed the malignant Daemons, 
the Anti-gods.
     “Each spiritual order has gifts of its own to bestow on the initiated 
who evoke them.  The Gods confer health of body, power and purity of mind, 
and, in short, elevate and restore our natures to their proper principles.  
Angels and Archangels have at their command only subordinate bestowments.  
Daemons, however, are hostile to the aspirant,-afflict both body and mind, 
and hinder our escape from the sensuous. Principalities, who govern the 
sublunary elements, confer temporal advantages. Those of a lower rank, who 
preside over matter, often display their bounty in material gifts. Souls 
that are pure are, like Angels, salutary in their influence.  I heir 
appearance encourages the soul in its upward efforts.  Heroes stimu-late to 
great actions.  All these powers depend, in a descending chain, each species 
on that immediately above
it.  Good Daemons are seen surrounded by the emblems of blessing, Daemons 
who execute judgment appear with the instruments of punishment.
     "There is nothing unworthy of belief in what you have been told 
concerning the sacred sleep, and divination by dreams.  I explain it thus :-
     "The soul has a two-fold life, a lower and a higher. In sleep that soul 
is freed from the constraint of the body, and enters, as one emancipated, on 
its divine life of intelli-gence.  Then, as the noble faculty which beholds 
the objects that truly are--the objects in the world of 
intelli-gence - stirs within, and awakens to its power, who can be surprised 
that the mind, which contains in itself the principles of all that happens, 
should, in this its state of liberation, discern the future in those 
antecedent principles which will make that future what it is to be? The 
nobler part of the soul is thus united by abstraction to higher natures, and 
becomes a participant in the wisdom and foreknowledge of the Gods.
     “Recorded examples of this are numerous and well-authenticated; 
instances occur, too, every day.  Numbers of sick, by sleeping in the temple 
of AEsculapius, have had their cure revealed to them in dreams vouchsafed by 
the god. Would not Alexander's army have perished but for a dream- in which 
Dionysius pointed out the means of safety ?  Was not the siege of Aphutis 
raised through a dream sent by Jupiter Ammon to Lysander?  The night-time of 
the body is the day-time of the soul."
     We thus see how in the process of time the principles on which the 
system of Plotinus rested were surrendered little by little, while 
divination and evocation were prac-tised with increasing frequency.  
Plotinus had declared the possibility of the absolute identification of the 
divine 'with human nature-the broadest possible basis for mysticism.  
Porphyry took up narrower ground and contended that in the union which takes 
place in ecstasy, we still retain consciousness of personality.  lamblichus 
diminished the real principle of mysticism still farther in theory, and 
denied that man has a faculty, eternally active and in accessible, to 
passion: so that the intellectual ambition. so lofty in Plotinus subsided 
among the followers of lamblichus into magical practice.
      Proclus was the last of the Greek Neoplatonists.  He elaborated the 
Trinity of Plotinus into a succession of impalpable triads, and surpassed 
lamblichus in his devotion to the practice of theurgy.  With him, theurgy 
was the art which gives man the magical passwords that carry him- through 
barrier after barrier, dividing species from species of the upper 
existences, till at the summit of the hierarchy he arrives at the highest.  
Above all being is God, the Non-Being, who is apprehended only by negation. 
When we are raised out of our weakness and on a level with God, it seems as 
though reason were silenced for then we are above reason.  In short we 
become intoxicated with God. Proclus was an adept in the ritual of 
invocations among every people in the world, and a great magical figure. 
With the advance of Byzantinism, he represented the old world of Greek 
thought, and even those who wrote against him as a heathen show the 
influence he exercised on their doctrines.  Thus Dionysius attempted to 
accommodate the philosophy of Proclus to Christianity, and greatly admired 
his asceticism. The theology of the Neoplatonists was always in the first 
instance a mere matter of logic. They confounded Universals with Causes.  
The highest became with them merely the most comprehensive.  As has been 
said Neoplatonism exercised great power among the scholiasts and magicians 
of the middle ages.  In fact all that medievalism knew of Plato was through 
the medium of the Neoplatonists.  In Germany in the four-teenth century it 
became a vivifying principle; for although its doctrine of emanation was 
abandoned, its allegorical explanation, its exaltation of the spirit above 
the letter was retained, and Platonism and mysticism together created a 
party in the church-the sworn foes of scholas-ticism and mere lifeless 
orthodoxy.

New Motor, The : A strange machine constructed in 1854 by John Murray Spear 
(q.v.) at the instigation of the" Associa-tion of Electricizers," one of the 
bands of spirits by whom he was controlled. It was to derive its motive 
power from the magnetic store of nature, and was therefore to be as 
independent of artificial sources of energy as was the human body. The 
machine was hailed as a god-the "Physical Saviour of the race," the "New 
Messiah "-and a certain lady, in obedience to a vision, went to the High 
Rock (Lynn, Mass.) whereon stood the New Motor', and for two hours suffered 
"birth-pangs," whereby she judged that the essence of her spiritual being 
was imparted to the machine. At the end of that time it was averred that 
pulsations were apparent in the motor. A. J. Davis expressed the belief that 
the design was the work of spirits of a mechanical turn of mind, but was of 
no practical value. The New Motor was finally smashed by the inhabitants of 
Randolph (N.Y.) whither it had been taken. In all it cost its builder some 
two thousand dollars. In common fairness to the Spiritualists it may be said 
that the majority had no sympathy whatever with such an absurd scheme,

New Thought: A present-day religion which in some of its tenets is akin to 
Christian Science, or faith-healing.  Unlike Christian Science, however, it 
does not affect entirely to dispense with all material aids, as drugs, the 
setting of broken bones, and so on. Nor does it give the whole credit for 
the cure to the imagination of the patient, as does hypnotism. But striking 
a point midway between the two it gives considerable prominence to the mind 
in the healing process, while not altogether despising the doctor. Mind is 
considered as highly refined matter, and therefore the " mind" cure is in a 
measure a material cure. It is clear that that part of the New Thought which 
deals with bodily healing has its roots in the Animal Magnetism and 
Mesmerism of bygone times.  So much have they in common that it is needless 
to trace mental-healing further back than Dr. Phineas Parkhurst Quimby 
(1802-I866) the first to make use of the terms ' mental-healing" and 
Christian Science."  Dr. Quimby was the son of a New Hampshire blacksmith, 
and was himself apprenticed to a clockmaker, having had but little 
education.  At the age of thirty-six he attended a lecture on Mesmerism, and 
there-after practised for himself.  With the aid of a clairvoyant youth lie 
cured diseases, and so successful was his treat-ment that he soon adopted 
magnetic healing as a profession. At length, however, he got a glimpse of 
the true reason for his success-the expectation of the patient.  The 
diagnoses of his clairvoyant he attributed to the latter's telepathic 
reading of the patient's own thoughts, and he judged that the treatment 
prescribed depended for its efficacy on the confidence it inspired rather 
than on its intrinsic merits. From this point he gradually evolved his 
doctrine that disease was a mere delusion, a traditional error that had 
fixed itself in men's minds, which it behoved them to be rid of as soon as 
might be.  The way to cure disease, therefore, was to destroy the error on 
which it rested. Besides Christian Science, Quimby called his doctrine the 
Science of Health, or the Science of Health and Happiness. He had many 
disciples, among whom were Mrs. Mary Baker G. Eddy, the founder of the 
Christian Science Church. Others whose influence was felt more in the 
direction of the New Thought movement were the Rev. W. F. Evans and Mr. and 
Mrs. Julius Dresser, whose son, Horatio W. Dresser, remains one of the 
ablest exponents of the New Thought As has been said, the method of healing 
practised by this school is not considered to be entirely immaterial.  It is 
no longer believed, of course, that a fluid emanates from the finger-tips of 
the operator, or that he radiates a luminous odic force; but Mr. Dresser 
himself states that the com-munication is of a vibratory character, made up 
of ethereal undulations directed and concentrated by the thought of the 
healer.  The power is equally efficacious at a distance and may be used 
without the patient's knowledge or even against his will. This belief in 
action at a distance is some-thing of a bug-bear to the New Thinker, who 
fears the ascendency of an evil influence as the superstitious of the Middle 
Ages feared bewitchment.  But there is a spiritual aspect of the New Thought 
as well as a physical one.  The health of the soul is as fully considered as 
the health of the body.  Spiritual sanity, then, is to be procured by 
lifting oneself to a higher plane of existence, by shutting out the things 
of the earth and living ' in tune with the infinite." We must realise our 
own identity with the Infinite Spirit and open our lives to the Divine 
inflow.  Ralph Waldo Trine, himself a New Thinker, says in an expressive 
meta-phor, " To recognise our own divinity and our intimate relation to the 
Universal, is to attach the belt of our machinery to the power-house of the 
Universe."  In short, we must have sufficient self-confidence to cast our 
fears aside and rise unfettered into the Infinite.


New Zealand  Maori superstitions.  Amidst the mythologi-cal personages of 
New Zealand "the spirits of the dead" ever play a very prominent part, and 
our chief interest in noticing the Maoris, lies in the fact, that belief in, 
and open communion with these spirits, still exist.  The priests or 
"Tohungas"  are unmistakably "Mediums," in the modern sense of the term.  
Sometimes they are born with their gift, and sometimes they are devoted to 
the priestly office by their parents and acquire their power after the 
fashion of Eastern ecstatics, by prayer, fasting and con-templation.  That 
good prophets exist amongst the Maoris has been abundantly proved.  During 
the time when Great Britain busied herself in colonizing New Zealand, her 
officials frequently wrote home, that the Maori. would never be conquered 
wholly; information of the parties sent out to attack them; the very colour 
of the boats, and the hour when they would arrive; the number of the enemy, 
and all particulars essential to their safety, being invariably communicated 
to the tribes beforehand by their prophets or Tohungas.
     The best natural prophets and seers amongst the Maoris are of the 
female sex; and although the missionaries try to account for the marvellous 
powers they exhibit, above all for the sound of the Spirit voice, which is a 
common phase in their communion with the dead - on the hypothe-sis that the 
women who practise ' the arts of sorcery," are ventriloquists - this 
attempted explanation rarely covers the ground of the intelligence which is 
received.
     In his Old New Zealand General Cummings cites an interesting case of 
Tohungaism.  A certain young chief had been appointed Registrar of births 
and deaths, then he suddenly came to a violent end.  The book of registries 
was lost, and much inconvenience ensued.  The man's relatives notified their 
intention of invoking his spirit, and invited General Cummings to be present 
at the ceremony, an invitation which he accepted.  "The appointed time came.  
Fires were lit.  The Tohunga repaired to the darkest corner of the room.  
All was silent, save the sobbing of the sisters of the deceased warrior-
chief.  There were thirty of us, sitting on the rush-strewn floor, the door 
shut and the fire now burning down to embers.  Suddenly there came a voice 
out from the partial darkness, ' Salutation, salutation to my family. to my 
tribe, to you, pakeha, my friend! '  Our feelings were taken by storm.  The 
oldest sister screamed, and rushed with extended arms in the direction from 
whence the voice came.  Her brother, seizing, restrained her by main force.  
Others exclaimed. ‘Is it you ?  Is it you ?  Truly it is you!  aue!  aue! 
and fell quite insensible upon the floor.  The older women and some of the 
aged men were not moved in the slightest degree, though believing it to be 
the spirit of the chief.
     “Whilst reflecting upon the novelty of the scene, the darkness visible' 
and the deep interest manifest, the spirit spoke again, ' Speak to me my 
family; speak to me, my tribe : speak to me, the pakeha!'  At last the 
silence gave way, and the brother spoke: ' How is it with you? Is it well 
with you in that country?'  The answer came, though not in the voice of the 
Tohunga-medium, but in strange sepulchral sounds :  ' It is well with me; my 
place is a good place.  I have seen our friends; they are all with me I'  A 
woman from another part of the room now anxiously cried out, ' Have you seen 
my sister ? Yes, I have seen her; she is happy in our beautiful country.' ' 
Tell her my love so great for her will never cease. Yes, I will bear the 
message.'  Here the native woman burst into tears, and my own bosom swelled 
in sympathy.
     “The spirit speaking again, giving directions about property and 
keepsakes, I thought I would more thoroughly test the genuineness of all 
this : and I said, ' We cannot find your book with the registered names; 
where have you concealed it ? '  The answer came instantly, ' I concealed it 
between the tahuhu of my house, and the thatch; straight over you, as you go 
in at the door.'  The brother rushed out to see.  All was silence.  In five 
minutes he came hurriedly back, with the book in his hand I  it astonished 
me.
     “It was now late, and the spirit suddenly said, ' Fare-well my family, 
farewell, my tribe; I go.'  Those present breathed an impressive farewell, 
when the spirit cried out again, from high in the air, ' Farewell!
     “This, though seemingly tragical, is in every respect literally true.  
But what is that ?  ventriloquism, the devil, or what!…”
     Mrs. Britten, in her Nineteenth Century Miracles says: 
     “The author has herself had several proofs of the Medium-istic power 
possessed by these  'savages'  but as her experiences may be deemed of too 
personal a character, 'Se shall select our examples from other sources.  One 
of these is furnished by a Mr. Marsden, a person who was well-known in the 
early days of New Zealand's colonial history. as a miner, who grew rich ' 
through spiritual communications.'  Mr. Marsden was a gentleman who had 
spent much time amongst the Manna, and who still keeps a residence in the 
King country,' that is - the district of which they hold control. Mr. 
Marooned informed the author, that his success as a gold miner, was entirely 
due to a communication he had received through a native Woman who claimed to 
have the power of bringing down spirits-the Maoris, be it remembered, always 
insisting that the spirits descend through the air to earth to visit 
mortals.  Mr. Marsden had long been prospecting un-successfully in the gold 
regions.  He had a friend in partner-ship with him, to whom he was much 
attached, but who had been accidentally killed by a fall from a cliff.  The 
Spirit of this man came unsolicited, on an occasion when Mr. Marsden was 
consulting a native seeress, for the purpose of endeavouring to trace out 
what had become of a valuable watch which he had lost.  The voice of the 
spirit was first heard in the air, apparently above the roof of the hut in 
which they sat, calling Mr. Marsden by his familiar name of ' Mars.'  
Greatly startled by these sounds, several times repeated, at the Medium's 
command, he remained perfectly still until the voice of his friend speaking 
in his well-remembered Scotch accent sounded close to his ear, whilst a 
column of grey misty substance reared itself by his side.  This apparition 
was plainly visible in the subdued light of the hut, to which there was only 
one open entrance, but no window'.  Though he was much startled by what he 
saw and heard, Mr. Marsden had presence of mind enough to gently put his 
hand through the misty column which remained intact, as if its substance 
offered no resist-ance to the touch.  Being admonished by an earnest whisper 
from the Maori woman, who had fallen on her knees before the apparition, to 
keep still, he obeyed, when a voice - seemingly from an immense distance 
off-yet speaking unmistakably in his friend's Scotch accents, advised him to 
let the watch alone - for it was irreparably gone-but to go to the stream on 
the banks of which they had last had a meal together trace it up for six 
miles and a half, and then, by following its course amidst the forest, he 
would come to a pile, which would make him rich, if he chose to remain so.  
Whilst he was waiting and listening breathlessly to hear more, Mr. Marsden 
was startled by a slight detonation at his side.  Turning his head he 
observed that the column of mist was gone, and in its place, a quick flash, 
like the reflection of a candle, was all that he beheld. Here the stance 
ended, and the astonished miner left the hut, convinced that he had heard 
the Spirit of his friend talking to him.  He added, that he followed the 
directions given implicitly, and came to a mass of surface gold lying on the 
stones at the bottom of the brook in the depth of the forest.  This he 
gathered up, and though he prospected for several days in and about that 
spot, he never found another particle of this precious metal.  That which he 
had secured he added, with a deep sigh. was indeed enough to have made him 
independent for life, had it not soon been squandered in fruitless 
speculations."
      So deeply has the Maori mind been saturated with ages of superstition 
that among the civilised, well-educated classes there may to-day be observed 
numerous expressions and actions which have their origin in an instinctive 
dread of the supernatural.  Many degrees of superstition exist among the 
Maoris of the present day, says a writer in the Pall Mall Gazette.  In the 
recesses of the Urewera country for example, diablerie has lost little of 
its early potency the tohunga there remains a power in the land.  Among the 
more enlightened natives a precautionary policy is generally followed; it is 
always wiser and safer, they say, to avoid conflict with the two mysterious 
powers tapu and makuta.  Tapu is the less dangerous of the two; a house, an 
individual, or an article may be rendered tapu, or sacred, and if the tapu 
be disregarded harm will befall someone.  But makuta is a powerful evil 
spell cast for the deliberate purpose of accomplishing harm, generally to 
bring about death.  The tohunga is understood to be in alliance with the 
spirits of the dead.  The Maori dreads death, and he fears the dead.  Places 
of burial are seldom approached during the day, never at night.  The spirits 
of the dead are believed to linger sometimes near places of burial. Without 
going to experts in Maori lore, who have many and varied theories to set 
forth, a preferable course is to discover what the average Maori of to-day 
thinks and believes respecting the strange powers and influences he deems 
are at work in the world around him.
     A Maori of this type who can read and write, is under forty years of 
age, and fairly intelligent-was drawn into a lengthy conversation with the 
writer.  He believed, magistrates notwithstanding, that tohungas, somehow, 
had far more power than ordinary men.  He did not think they got that power 
from the "tiapo" (the devil?)  they just were able to make themselves 
masters of men and of many things in the world.  There are many degrees of 
Tohungaism. An ordinary man or woman was powerless against a tohunga, but 
one tohunga could overcome another. The speaker knew of an instance of one 
tohunga driving the tohunga power entirely out of a weaker rival. It was a 
fairly recent east coast occurrence. Three Maoris had accidentally permitted 
their pigs to trespass into the tohunga's potato paddock, and much damage 
and loss was the result. The tohunga was one of the dangerous type, and 
being very wroth, he mekutued the three men, all of whom promptly died. 
Nobody was brave enough to charge the tohunga with causing the death of the 
men; they were all afraid of this terrible makuta.  At length another 
tohunga was heard of, one of very great power. This oracle was consulted, 
and he agreed to deal effectively with tohunga number one, and punish him 
for killing the owner of the pigs. So, following his instructions, the 
first-mentioned individual was seized, and much against his will, was 
conveyed to the home of the greater magician. Many Maoris, it should be 
known, stand in awe of hot water, they will not handle it, even for purposes 
connected with cooking or cleaning.  Into a large tub of hot water the minor 
tohunga struggling frantically, was placed, then he was given a page torn 
from a Bible, which he was ordered to chew' and swallow.  The hot water 
treatment, combined with the small portion of the white man's sacred volume, 
did the expected work; the man was no longer a tohunga, and fretting over 
his lost powers, he soon afterwards died."
     Spiritualism.-Amongst the earliest investigators in Dunedin, was a Mr. 
John Logan.  Before he had become publicly identified with the cause of 
Spiritualism, an association had been formed, the members of which steadily 
pursued their investigations in private circles and semi-public gatherings.  
One of the most marked events in connection with the early development of 
Spiritualism in Dunedin, however, was the arraignment and church trial of 
Mr. Logan, the circumstances of which may be briefly summed up as follows.  
This gentleman, although holding a high position in the first Presbyterian 
church of the city, had attended circles and witnessed Spiritualistic 
phenomena and it was currently reported that one of his own near relatives 
was a very remarkable Medium.  On the 19th of March, 1873, Mr. Logan was 
summoned to appear before a Church Convocation, to be held for the purpose 
of trying his case, and if necessary, dealing with his" delin-quency.'  Mr. 
Logan was in the event deprived of his church membership.
     In many of the principal towns besides Dunedin, circles held at first 
in mere idle curiosity, have produced their usual fruit of mediumistic 
power, and this again has extended into associative action, and organisation 
into local societies.  For over a year, the Spiritualists and Liberalists of 
Dunedin secured the services of Mr. Charles Bright as their lecturer.  This 
gentleman had once been attached to the editorial staff of the Melbourne 
Argus, and had obtained a good reputation as a capable writer, and liberal 
thinker.  Mr. Bright's lectures in Dunedin were highly appreciated, and by 
their scholarly style and attrac-tive manner, served to band together the 
liberal element in the city.  In Auckland, the principal town of the North 
Island, the same good service was rendered to the cause of religious 
thought, by the addresses of the Rev. Mr. Edgar, a clergyman whose 
Spiritualistic doctrines, had tended to sever him from sectarian 
organisations, and draw around him, the Spiritualists of the town.  Besides 
the good work effected by these gentlemen, the occasional visits of Messrs. 
Peebles, Walker, J. Tyerman, and the effect of the many private circles held 
in every portion of the islands, tended to promote a general, though quiet, 
diffusion of Spiritual thought and doctrine, throughout New Zealand.

Nichusch : Prophetic indication.  In accordance with the Kabalistic view 
that all events and natural happenings have a secret connection, and 
interact upon one another, it is believed that practically everything can 
become an object of soothsaying-the flight of birds, movement of clouds, 
cries of animals, events happening to man, and so on. Man himself may become 
Nichusch by saying that if such and such a thing takes place it will be a 
good or a bad omen.


Nick, or Old Nick : A well-known British appelation of the Devil.  It seems 
probable that this name is derived from the Dutch Nikken, the devil, which 
again comes from the Anglo-Saxon naec-ae, to slay,-for as Wachter says the 
devil was ' a murderer from the beginning."  In northern countries there is 
a river spirit named " Neck," " Nikke," or ' Nokke," of the same nature as 
the water Kelpie, and the Merman or Triton.


Nicolai, Christoph Friedrich: (1733-1811), A German author and bookseller of 
Berlin, is interesting from the occult point of view because of the peculiar 
experiences which befell him, and of which he treats in his personal account 
read before the Royal Society of Berlin.  It would be impossible to present 
the circumstances of his case, which is one of the most celebrated in the 
annals of psychology, better than in his own words.
     “In the first two months of the year 1791," he says, " I was much 
affected in my mind by several incidents of a very disagreeable nature; and 
on the 24th of February a circumstance occurred which irritated me 
extremely.  At ten o'clock in the forenoon my wife and another person came 
to console me; I was in a violent perturbation of mind, owing to a series of 
incidents which had altogether wounded my moral feelings, and from which I 
saw no possibility of relief, when suddenly I observed at the dis-tance of 
ten paces from me a figure-the figure of a deceased person.  I pointed at 
it, and asked my wife whether she did not see it.  She saw nothing, but 
being much alarmed, endeavoured to compose me, and sent for the physician 
The figure remained some seven or eight minutes, and at length I became a 
little more calm; and as I was extremely exhausted, I soon afterwards fell 
into a troubled kind of slumber, which lasted for half an hour.  The vision 
was ascribed to the great agitation of mind in which I had been, and it was 
supposed I should have nothing more to appre-hend from that cause; but the 
violent affection had put my nerves into some unnatural state.  From this 
arose further consequences, which require a more detailed description.
     “In the afternoon, a little after four o'clock, the figure which I had 
seen in the morning again appeared.  I was alone when this happened, a 
circumstance which, as may be easily conceived, could not be very agreeable.  
I went therefore to the apartment of my wife, to whom I related it. But 
thither also the figure pursued me.  Sometimes it was present, sometimes it 
vanished, but it was always the same standing figure.  A little after six 
o'clock several stalking figures also appeared; but they had no connection 
with the standing figure.  I can assign no other cause for this apparition 
than that, though much more composed in my mind, I had not been able so soon 
entirely to forget the cause of such deep and distressing vexation, and had 
reflected on the consequences of it, in order, if possible, to avoid them; 
and that this happened three hours after dinner, at the time when digestion 
just begins.
      “At length I became more composed with respect to the disagreeable 
incident which had given rise to the first apparition; but though I had used 
very excellent medicines and found myself in other respects perfectly well, 
yet the apparitions did not diminish, but on the contrary rather increased 
in number, and were transformed in the most extraordinary manner.
     "The figure of the deceased person never appeared to me after the first 
dreadful day, but several other figures shewed themselves afterwards very 
distinctly, sometimes such as I knew, mostly, however, of persons I did not 
know, and amongst those known to me, were the semblance of both living and 
deceased persons, but mostly the former, and I made the observation, that 
acquaintance with whom I daily conversed never appeared to me as phantasms; 
it was always such as were at a distance.
     “It is also to be noted, that these figures appeared to me at all 
times, and under the most different circumstances, equally distinct and 
clear.  Whether I was alone, or in company, by broad day-light equally as in 
the night-time, in my own as well as in my neighbour's house; yet when I was 
at another person's house, they were less frequent, and when I walked the 
public street they very seldom appeared. When I shut my eyes, sometimes the 
figures disappeared, sometimes they remained even after I had closed them. 
If they vanished in the former case, on opening my eyes again, nearly the 
same figures appeared which I had seen before.
     “I sometimes conversed with my physician and my wife concerning the 
phantasms which at the time hovered around me; for in general the forms 
appeared oftener in motion than at rest. They did not always continue 
present-they frequently left me altogether, and again appeared for a short 
or longer space of time, singly or more at once; but, in general, several 
appeared together. For the most part I saw human figures of both sexes; they 
commonly passed to and fro as if they had no connection with each other, 
like people at a fair where all is bustle; sometimes they appeared to have 
business with one another. Once or twice I saw amongst them persons on 
horseback, and dogs and birds; these figures all appeared to me in their 
natural size, as distinctly as if they had existed in real life, with the 
several tints on the uncovered parts of the body, and with all the different 
kinds and colours of clothes. But I think, however; that the colours were 
somewhat paler than they are in nature.
     "None of the figures had any distinguishing characteris-tic, they were 
neither terrible, ludicrous, nor repulsive most of them were ordinary in 
their appearance,-some were even agreeable.
     “On the whole, the longer I continued in this state, the more did the 
number of the phantasms increase, and the apparitions became more frequent. 
About four weeks afterwards I began to hear them speak  sometimes the 
phantasms spoke with one another, but for the most part they addressed 
themselves to me, these speeches were in general short, and never contained 
anything disagreeable. Intelligent and respected friends often appeared to 
me, who endeavoured to console me in my grief, which still left deep traces 
on my mind.  This speaking I heard most frequently when I was alone; though 
I sometimes heard it in company, intermixed with the conversation of real 
persons; frequently in single phrases only, but sometimes even in connected 
discourse.
     “Though at this time I enjoyed rather a good state of health both in 
body and mind, and had become so very familiar with these phantasms. that at 
last they did not excite the least disagreeable emotion, but on the contrary 
afforded me frequent subjects for amusement and mirth yet as the disorder 
sensibly increased, and the figures appeared to me for whole days together, 
and even during the night, if I happened to awake, I had recourse to several 
medicines."
     He then recounts how the apparitions vanished upon blood being let.
     “This was performed on the 20th of April, at eleven o'clock in the 
forenoon.  I was alone with the surgeon; but during the operation, the room 
swarmed with human forms of every description, which crowded fast one on 
another.  This continued till half-past four o'clock, exactly the time when 
the digestion commences.  I then observed that the figures began to move 
more slowly; soon after-wards the colours became gradually paler; every 
seven minutes they lost more and more of their intensity, without any 
alteration in the distinct figure of the apparitions. At about half-past six 
o'clock all the figures were entirely white, and moved very little; yet the 
forms appeared perfectly distinct ; by degrees they became visibly less 
plain, without decreasing in number, as had often formerly been the case.  
The figures did not move off, neither did they vanish, which also had 
usually happened on other occasions.  In this instance they dissolved 
immediately into air; of some even whole pieces remained for a length of 
time, which also by degrees were lost to the eye.  At about eight o'clock 
there did not remain a vestige of any of them, and I have never since 
experienced any appearance of the same kind.  Twice or thrice since that 
time I have felt a propensity. if I may be allowed to express myself, or a 
sensation as if I saw something which in a moment again was gone.  I was 
even surprised by this sensation whilst writing the present account, having, 
in order to render it more accurate, perused the papers of 1791, and 
recalled to my memory all the circumstances of that time.  So little are we 
sometimes, even in the greatest composure of mind, masters of our 
imagination."

Night, Mystical, of the Sufis : It was believed by the Sufis that to attain 
to the coveted state of mystical contempla-tion, it was necessary to close 
the gateway of the physical senses, so that the inner or spiritual senses 
might operate more freely.  This injunction was sometimes taken literally, 
as by the Brahmin Yogis, who carefully closed eyes, ears, nose and mouth, in 
order to attain to visionary ecstasy.  The Mystical Night is thus a shutting 
out of all external sense-impressions, of hope, fear, consciousness of self, 
and every human emotion, so that the interior light may be more clearly 
perceived.


Nightmare : (Old English night and mara, a spectre), A disorder of the 
digestive functions during sleep, inducing the temporary belief that some 
animal or demon is sitting on the chest.  Among savages and primitive people 
it is thought that the affection proceeds from the attentions of an evil 
spirit.  Keysler in his very curious work, Antiquitates selectae 
Septentrionales et Celticae, has collected many inter-esting particulars 
concerning the nightmare.  Nachtmar, he says, is from Mair, an old woman, 
because the spectre which appears to press upon the breast and impede the 
action of the lungs is generally in that form.  The English and Dutch words 
coincide with the German. The French cochemar is Mulier incumbens or Incuba. 
The Swedes use Mara alone, as we learn from the Historia Seucorum Gotho-
rumque of Eric Olaus, where he states that Valender, the son of Suercher, 
succeeded to the throne of his father, who was suffocated by a daemon in his 
sleep, of that kind which by the scribes is called Mara. Others," we suppose 
Germans," continues Keysler, "call it Hanon Tramp.  The French peasantry 
call it Dianus which is a corruption either of Diana or of Daemonium 
Meridianum for it seems there is a belief (which Keysler, not improbably 
thinks may be derived from a false interpretation of an expression in the 
91st Psalm ('the destruction that wasteth at noon-day') that persons are 
most exposed to such attacks at that time and, therefore, women in childbed 
are then never left alone.  But though the Daemonium Meridianum is often 
used for the Ephialtes, nevertheless it is more correctly any sudden and 
violent attack which deprives. the patient of his senses.  In some parts of 
Germany, the name given to this disorder is den alp, or des Alp-dructen, 
either from the 'mass' which appears to press on the sufferer or from Alp or 
A If (elf).  In Franconia it is die Drud or das Drud-dructen, from the Druid 
or Weird Women, and there is a belief that it may not only be chased away, 
but be made to appear on the morrow in a human shape, and lend some-thing 
required of it by the following charm

"Druid to-morrow 
So will I borrow."

     These Druids, it seems, were not only in the habit of riding men, but 
horses also, and in order to keep them out of the stables, the salutary 
pentalpha (which bears the name of Druden-fuss, Druid's foot) should be 
written on the stable doors, in consecrated chalk, on the night of St. 
Walburgh.  We must not omit that our English familiar appellation ' Trot' is 
traced up to ' Druid' " a decrepit old woman such as the Sagas might be," 
and the same may perhaps be said of a Scottish Saint, Triduana or Tredwin.
     In Ihre's Glossary, a somewhat different account of the Mara is given.  
Here again, we find the 'witch-riding' of horses, against which a stone 
amulet is provided by Aubrey, similar to one which we are about to notice 
imme-diately below.
     Among the incantations by which the nightmare may be chased away, 
Reginald Scot has recorded the following in his Discovery of Witchcraft.

“St. George, St. George, our lady's knight,
He walked by day so did he by night:
Until such times as. he her found,
He her beat and he her bound,
Until her troth to him plight,
He would not come to her that night."

     "Item," continues the same ingenious author, "hang a stone over the 
afflicted person's bed, which stone bath naturally such a bole in it, as 
wherein a string may be put through it, and so be hanged over the diseased 
or bewitched party, be it man, woman, or horse."
     Every reader of the above lines will be reminded of the similar charm 
which Shakespeare has put into the mouth of Edgar as Mad Tom in King Lear.

“Saint Withold footed thrice the Wold
He met the night-mare and her ninefold
Bid her alight,
And her troth plight
And aroint thee, witch, aroint thee."

     Another charm of earlier date occurs in Chaucer's Miller's Tale. When 
the simple Carpenter discovers the crafty Nicholas in his feigned 
abstraction, he thinks he may perhaps be hag-ridden, and addresses him 
thus:-

“I crouch the fro Elves and fro wikid wightes
And therewith the night-spell he seide arightes,
On four halvis of the house about,
And on the dreshfold of the dore without,
'Jesu Christ, and Seint Benedight,.
Blesse this house from evrey wikid wight,
Fro the night's mare, the wite paternoster,
Where wennist thou Seint Peter's sister."

     A more modern author has pointed to some other formu-laries, and has 
noticed that Asmodeus was the fiend of most evil repute on these occasions.  
In the Otia Imperiala of Gervase of Tilbury, some other protecting charms 
are said to exist.  To turn to the medical history of the Incubus Pliny has 
recommended two remedies for this complaint; one sufficiently simple, wild 
paeny seed.  Another, which it would not be easy to discover in any modern 
pharmaco-poeia, is a decoction in wine and oil of the tongue, eyes, liver, 
and bowels of a dragon, wherewith, after it has been left to cool all night 
in the open air, the patient should be anointed every morning and evening.
     Dr. Bond, a physician, who tells us that he himself was much afflicted 
with the nightmare, published an Essay on the Incubus in 1753.  At the time 
at which he wrote, medical attention appears to have been very little called 
to the disease, and some of the opinions hazarded were sufficiently wild and 
inconclusive.  Thus Dr. Willis said it was owing to some incongruous matter 
which is mixed with the nervous fluid in the cerebellum (de Anima Brutorum) 
; and    Bellini thought it imaginary, and to be attributed to the idea of 
some demon which existed in the mind the day before. Both of these writers 
might have known better if they would have turned to Fuchsius (with whom Dr. 
Bond appears to be equally acquainted) who in his work de Curandi Ratione, 
published as early as 1548, has an excellent chapter (I., 31) on the causes, 
symptoms, and cure of nightmare, in which he attributes it to repletion and 
indigestion, and recom-mends the customary discipline.

Norton, Thomas : The exact date of this alchemist's birth is wrapped in 
mystery, while comparatively little is recorded about his life in general.  
But at least it is known that Bristol was his native place, and that, in the 
year 1436, he was elected to represent that town in Parliament.  This points 
to his having been an upright and highly-esteemed person, and the conjecture 
is buttressed in some degree by the fact that Edward IV. made him a member 
of his privy council, and employed him repeatedly as an ambassador. At an 
early age Norton showed himself curious concerning alchemy and the like, 
demonstrating his predilection herein by attempting to make the personal 
acquaintance of George Ripley (q.v.), who, sometime Canon of Bridlington, 
was reputed a man of extraordinary learning, and was author of numerous 
alchymical works. For many months Norton sought this person in vain, but at 
length the Canon, yielding to the other's importunity, wrote to him in the 
following manner    I shall not longer delay; the time is come; you shall 
receive this grace. Your honest desire and approved virtue, your love of 
truth, wisdom, and long perseverance, shall accomplish your sorrowful 
desires.  It is necessary that, as soon as convenient, we speak together 
face to face, lest I should by writing betray my trust.  I will make you my 
heir and brother in this art, as I am setting out to travel in foreign 
countries.  Give thanks to God, Who next to His spiritual servants, honours 
the sons of this sacred science."
     After receiving this very friendly and encouraging letter, Norton 
hurried straightway to Ripley's presence, and there-after for upwards of a 
month the two were constantly together, the elder man taught the novice many 
things, while he even promised that, if he showed himself an apt and worthy 
pupil, he would impart to him the secret of the medicinal stone.  And in due 
course this promise was fulfilled, yet it is reported that Norton's own 
chymical researches met with various signal disappointments. On one 
occasion, for instance, when he had almost perfected a certain tincture, his 
servant absconded with the crucible containing the precious fluid; while at 
a later time, when the alchemist was at work on the same experiment, and 
thought he was just about to reach the goal. his entire paraphernalia was 
stolen by a Mayoress of Bristol. And this defeat must have been doubly 
galling to the unfortunate philosopher, for soon afterwards the Mayoress 
became very wealthy, presumably as a result of her theft.
     Norton himself does not appear to have reaped pecuniary benefit at any 
time from his erudition, but to have been a comparatively poor man 
throughout the whole of his life; and the fact is a little surprising. for 
his Ordinall of Alchimy was a popular work in the middle ages, and was 
repeatedly published. The original edition was anonymous, but the writer's 
identity has been determined because the initial syllables in the first six 
lines of the seventh chapter compose the following couplet

‘Thomas Norton of Briseto
A parfet master you may him trow."

     Norton died in 1477, and his predilections descended to one of his 
grandsons.  This was Samuel Norton, who was born in 1548, studied science at 
St. John's College. Cam-bridge, and afterwards became a Justice of the Peace 
and Sheriff of Somersetshire.  He died about 1604, and in 1630 a collection 
of his alchemistic tracts was published at Frankfort.

O

Oak Apples, as diviners.  It is said that if one wishes to discover whether 
a child be bewitched, one may do so by following this procedure  drop three 
oak apples into a basin of water under the child's cradle, at the same time 
pre-serving the strictest silence; if they float the child is not 
fascinated, but if they sink it is.


Oak Tree : The oak, from time immemorial, has held a high place as a sacred 
tree.  The Druids worshipped the oak, and performed many of their rites 
under the shadow of its branches.  When Augustine preached Christianity to 
the ancient Britons, he stood under an oak tree.  The ancient Hebrews 
evidently held the oak as a sacred tree. There is a tradition that Abraham 
received his heavenly visitors under an oak.  Rebekah's nurse was buried 
under an oak, called afterwards the oak of weeping.  Jacob buried the idols 
of Shechem under an oak.  It was under the oak of Ophra, Gideon saw the 
angel sitting. who gave him instruc-tions as to what he was to do to free 
Israel. When Joshua and Israel made a covenant to serve God, a great stone 
was set up in evidence under an oak that was by the sanctuary of the Lord.  
The prophet sent to prophesy against Jeroboam was found at Bethel sitting 
under an oak. Saul and his sons were buried under an oak, and, according to 
Isaiah, idols were made of oak wood.  Abimelech was made king by the oak 
that was in Shechem.   During the eigh-teenth century its influence in 
curing diseases was believed in.  The toothache could be cured by boring 
with a nail the tooth or gum till blood came, and then driving the nail into 
an oak tree. A child with rupture could be cured by splitting an oak branch, 
and passing the child through the opening backwards three times; if the 
splits grew together afterwards, the child would be cured.

Obercit, Johnan Hermann:  Swiss Mystic and Alchemist, 1725-1798.	Born 
in 1725 at Arbon, in Switzerland, Johann Obercit was the son of a scientist 
keenly interested in Hermetic philosophy, and no doubt the boy's own taste 
therefore developed the more speedily on account of the parental 
predilection. Very soon Johann became deter-mined to discover the 
philosopher's stone, hoping thereby to resuscitate the fortunes of his 
family, which he found at a low ebb, presumably because the elder Obercit 
had expended large sums on his alchemistic pursuits; and the young man 
worked strenuously to gain his ends, maintain-ing all along that whoso would 
triumph in this endeavour must not depend on scientific skill, but rather on 
constant communion with God. Notwithstanding this pious theory of his, he 
soon found himself under the ban of the civic authorities, who came to his 
laboratory, and forced him to forego further operations, declaring that 
these constituted a danger to public health and safety. That, at least, they 
gave as their reason; but the likelihood is that, in their ignorance, they 
looked askance upon all scientific researches. Obercit, bitterly incensed, 
appears to have left his native place, and to have lived for some time 
thereafter with one Lavater, a brother of the noted physiognomist of that 
name; while it would seem that, at a later date, he re-nounced the civilised 
world altogether, and took up his abode in the lofty fastnesses of the Alps.  
No hermit's life did he live here, however; for, according to his own 
recital, he took to himself as bride a seraphic shepherdess named Theantis, 
with whom he dwelt peacefully during a number of subsequent years. Whether 
children were born of this union between the terrestrial and the ethereal is 
not re-corded, and the alchemist's account of the affair reads rather like 
Joe Smith's tale about receiving sacred books from an angel on the summit of 
a mountain overlooking Salt Lake City; nor is there much to be said for two 
further works from Obercit's pen, the one entitled Les Promenades de 
Gamaliel, juif Philosophe, and the other La Connexion Originaire des Esprits 
et des Corps, d'apres les Principes de Newton (Augsburg, 1776).  Still, if 
our alchemist cannot be called an able writer, he must be hailed as a 
picturesque character; and it is matter for regret that so little is known 
about his life, which extended to the year 1798.


Oberion A spirit.  (See England.)


Obsession and Possession: Obsession, from Latin obsessionem - obsidere, to 
besiege, is a form of insanity caused, accord-ing to traditional belief, by 
the persistent attack of an evil spirit without, this being the opposite of 
possession, control by an evil spirit from within, both meaning how-ever the 
usurpation of the individuality and control of the body by a foreign and 
discarnate entity. This belief may be found in the earliest records of human 
history, and in the magical rites and formulae of ancient religions, used as 
charms against and exorcism of these invading influences. Indian, Greek and 
Roman literature teem with instances, the Bible also furnishing many from 
the case of Saul" troubled with an evil spirit" only to be dispossessed by 
the music of David's harping, to the miracles of Jesus Christ who cast out 
legions of possessing spirits. Plato in his Republic not only speaks of 
demons of various grades, but mentions a method of treating and providing 
for those obsessed by them. Sophocles and Euripides describe the possessed 
and mention of the subject is also to be found in Herodotus, Plutarch, 
Horace, and many others of the classics. Terrible and appalling episodes in 
the Middle Ages are to be traced to the unquestioned belief in the 
possibility of possession and obsession by the Devil and his legions.  All 
madness was caused thereby, was indeed the visible manifestation of the Evil 
One, only to be exorcised by charms, averted by the observance of sacred 
rites, or later, to be burned and destroyed bodily for the good of the 
tortured soul within. The rites of Black Magic, in all ages and places, 
deliberately evoke this possession by the Devil and his demons for the 
communication and benefit of the infallible knowledge it was believed they 
conferred and its consequent power and control of man and his destinies.
     Modern science with its patient and laborious researches into human 
psychology, has given the key to this baffling mystery, showing the human 
mind to be an incomparably delicate instrument, peculiarly at the mercy of 
the per-ceptions of the senses and their multitudinous im-pressions on the 
brain, its balance so easily shaken by a shock, a drug, a momentary 
excitement, oftener by pro-longed and intense concentration upon single 
groups of ideas. It is to be noted that in the hallucinatory epidemics of 
all ages and countries there is to be found this unvarying characteristic: 
they are connected with some dominant cause, train of thought or religious 
sentiment prevalent at the time. In the Middle Ages when there flourished an 
intense belief in the positive apparitions of angels, saints and devils, the 
people's imagination was dominated and rendered intensely dramatic thereby. 
The transmigration of the human soul into animals was another popular belief 
and to this again can be traced the terrible superstition of Lycanthropy 
(q.v.) which possessed large numbers of people in France and Germany in the 
fourteenth and six-teenth centuries. The Flagellant mania took its rise at 
Perouse in the thirteenth century, caused by the panic attendant upon an 
outbreak of plague. These people maintained that there was no remission of 
sins without flagellation. This they preached with fanatical fervour and 
bands of them, gathering adherents everywhere, roamed through city and 
country, clad in scanty clothing on which were depicted skeletons and with 
frenzied movements publicly lashed themselves. It was to these exhibitions, 
the name of the" Dance of Death" was first applied. The Danc-ing mania, 
accompanied by aberration of mind and maniacal distortions of the body was 
very prevalent in Germany in the fourteenth century, and in the sixteenth 
century in Italy where it was termed "Tarantism" and as a variant in source, 
was ascribed to the bite of the Tarantula spider. The music and songs 
employed for the cure are still pre-served. Edmund Parrish in his work 
Hallucinations and Illusions makes the following observations on this 
subject:
     “If not reckoned as true chorea, the epidemic of dancing which raged in 
Germany and the Netherlands in the Middle Ages comes under this head. 
Appearing in Aix it spread in a few months to Liege, Utrecht and the 
neighbouring towns, visited Metz, Cologne and Strasburg (1418) and after 
lingering into the sixteenth century gradually died out. This malady 
consisted in convulsions, contortions accompanying the dancing, 
hallucinations and so forth. The attack could be checked by bandaging the 
abdomen as well as by kicks and blows on that part of the body. Music had a 
great influence on the dancers, and for this reason it was played in the 
streets in order that the attacks might by this means reach a crisis and 
disappear the sooner. Quite trifling circumstances could bring on these 
seizures, the sight of pointed shoes for instance, and of the colour red 
which the dancers held in horror.  In order to prevent such outbreaks the 
wearing of pointed shoes was forbidden by the authorities.  During their 
dance many of the afflicted thought they waded in blood, or saw heavenly 
visions.
     The same author remarks on other instances    To this category also 
belongs the history of demoniacal possession. The belief of being possessed 
by spirits, fre-quently met with in isolated cases, appeared at certain 
periods in epidemic form.  Such an epidemic broke out in Brandenburg, and in 
Holland and Italy in the sixteenth century, especially in the convents.  In 
1350-60 it attacked the convent of St. Brigitta, in Xanthen, a convent near 
Cologne, and others.  The nuns declared that they were visited by the Devil, 
and had carnal conversation with him. These and other  possessed' wretches 
were sometimes thrown into dungeons, sometimes burnt. The convent of the 
Ursulines at Aix was the scene of such a drama (1609-l1) where  two 
possessed nuns, tormented by all kinds of apparitions, accused a priest of 
witchcraft on which charge he was burnt to death (See Grandler, Urbain). The 
famous case of the nuns of Loudun (1632-39) led to a like tragic conclusion, 
as well as the Louvier case (1642) in which the two chief victims found 
their end in lifelong imprisonment and the stake."
     The widespread belief in and fear of magic and witch-craft operating on 
superstitious minds produced the most extraordinary hallucinations.  
Religious ecstasy partakes of the same character, the difference being that 
it is possession by and contact with so-called good spirits.  The sacred 
books of all nations teem with instances of this and profane history can 
also furnish examples.  The many familiar cases of ecstatic visions and 
revelations in the Old Testament may be cited, as well as those found in the 
legends of saints and martyrs, where they either appear as revelations from 
heaven or temptations of the Devil.  In the latter case, a scientific 
authority, Krafft-Ebing, points out the close connection of religious 
ecstasy with sexual disturbances.  That this condition of " ecstasy"  was 
and is sought and induced the following passage amply proves    Among 
Eastern and primitive peoples such as Hindoos, American Indians, natives of 
Greenland, Kamts-chatka and Yucatan, fetish-worshipping Negroes, and 
Polynesians, the ecstatic state accompanied with hallu-cinations is 
frequently observed, sometimes arising spon-taneously, but more often 
artificially induced.  It was known also among the nations of antiquity.  
The means most often employed to induce this state are beating of magic 
drums and blowing of trumpets, howlings and hour-long prayers, dancing, 
flagellation, convulsive movements and contortions, asceticism, fasting and 
sexual abstinence. Recourse is also had to narcotics to bring about the 
desired result.  Thus the flyagaric is used in Western Siberia, in San 
Domingo the herb coca, tobacco by some tribes of American Indians, and in 
the East opium and hashish.  The ancient Egyptians had their intoxicating 
drinks, and receipts for witch's salves and philtres have come down to us 
from mediaeval times."  In many countries this condition of possession is 
induced for religious and prophetic purposes, also for mere fortune-telling.  
The extent to which this belief in obsession and possession obtains at the 
present day is testified by Tylor in Primitive Culture    It is not too much 
to assert that the doctrine of demoniacal possession is kept up, 
substantially the same theory to account for substantially the same facts, 
by half the human race, who thus stand as consistent repre-sentatives of 
their forefathers back in primitive antiquity." In the cults of Modern 
Spiritualism and Theosophy it may be found as a leading tenet of their 
creeds.  The obsessional theory is used to account for all forms of insanity 
and crime. The following passage taken from the publication of a modern seer 
Diakka and their Victims by A. J. Davis indicates this modern belief :-" The 
country of the diakka is where the morally deficient and the affectionately 
unclean enter upon a strange probation      They are continually victimizing 
sensitive persons still in the flesh making sport of them and having a jolly 
laugh at the expense of really honest and sincere people. They (these demon-
like spirits) teach that they would be elevated and made happy if only they 
could partake of whiskey and tobacco, or gratify their burning free-love 
propensities    Being unprincipled intellectualities their play is nothing 
but pastime amusement at the expense of those beneath their influence." 
These creatures are also said to be of a malignant and blood-thirsty nature, 
inciting the beings they possess to murder, often of a terrible character.
     Signs of Demoniac Possession.-Melanchthon, in one of his letters, says 
that though there may occasionally be some natural causes for a frenzy or 
mania, it is also quite certain that devils enter certain persons and there 
cause torment and fury with or without natural causes, just as one sees at 
times maladies cured with remedies which are not natural. Moreover, such 
spectacles are in the nature of wonders and forecasts of things to come. 
Twelve years before a woman of Saxony, who could neither read nor write, 
being controlled by a devil, spoke, after the torment was over, words in 
Greek and Latin to the effect that there would be great distress among the 
people.
     Dr. Ese gives the following as possible signs of possession :-
i.	Imagining oneself possessed.
ii.	Leading an evil life.
iii.	Living alone.
iv.	Chronic ailments, unusual symptoms, a deep sleep, the vomiting of 
strange things.
v.	Blaspheming and frequent reference to the Devil.
vi.	Making a compact with the Devil.
vii.	Being controlled by spirits.
viii.	Having a face that inspires horror and fear.
ix.	Being tired of living and the giving up of hope.
x.	Being enraged and violent in action.
xi.	Making the cries and noises of a beast.
     In an account of those possessed in Loudon, we find the questions put 
to the University of Montpellier by Santerre, priest and founder of the 
bishopric and diocese of Nimes touching on the signs and the judicial 
answers of this University.
     Q.-Whether the bending and moving of the body, the head at times, 
touching the soles of the feet, with other contortions and strange positions 
are good signs of pos-sessions
     A.-Mimics and acrobats make such strange movements, bending and 
twisting themselves in so many ways that one must conclude that there is no 
sort of position which men and women cannot take up, after long practice and 
applica-tion, even being able, with the ease of experience, to extend and 
spread out abnormally the legs and other parts of the body, by the extension 
of the nerves, muscles and tendon-such performances are not without the 
bounds of nature.
     Q.-Whether the rapidity of the movement of the head backwards and 
forwards, touching the chest and the back, is an infallible sign of 
possession ?
     A.-This movement is so natural that nothing need be added to what has 
been said about the movements of the other parts of the body.
     Q.-Whether the sudden swelling of the tongue, the throat and the face, 
and the sudden changing of colour, are sure signs of possession ?
     A.-The swelling and disturbance of the chest through interruption are 
the efforts of breathing or inspiration the normal actions in respiration-
and possession cannot be inferred from them. The swelling of the throat may 
proceed from the retention of the breath and that of the other parts from 
the melancholic vapours which are often observed wandering through all parts 
of the body. Hence it follows that this sign of possession is inadmissible.
     Q.-whether a feeling, stupidly heedless, or the lack of feeling, to the 
point of being pricked or pinched without complaining or moving and not even 
changing colour are certain signs of possession ?
     A.-The young Lacedemonian who allowed himself to be bitten by a fox 
which he had stolen without seeming to feel it, and those who flog 
themselves, even to death, before the altar of Diana, without turning a 
hair, they all show that, with resolution, pin-pricks can be endured without 
complaining. Moreover, it is certain that in the human body, small areas of 
skin are met with in some persons, which are insensitive, although the 
neighbouring parts may be quite sensitive, a condition which occurs the more 
frequently after some previous illness. Such a condition has, therefore, no 
bearing on possession.
     Q.-whether the total lack of bodily movement which, at the command of 
the exorciser, occurs in those supposedly possessed during, and in the 
middle of, their most violent actions, is an undeniable sign of a true 
diabolic possession?
     A.-The movements of the parts of the body being voluntary it is natural 
for well-disposed persons to move themselves or not at will, so that such a 
cessation of move-ment, if there is not entire lack of feeling; is not 
sufficient ground from which to infer a diabolic possession.
     Q.-Whether the yelping or noise like that of a dog, which comes from 
the chest rather than from the throat, is a mark of possession ?
     A.-Human skill adapts itself so easily to the counter-feiting of all 
kinds of expressions, that persons are met with every day who can give 
perfectly the expressions, cries and songs of all sorts of animals, and that 
with a practically imperceptible movement of the lips. Again, many are to be 
found who form their words in the stomach and they would seem to come from 
some other object rather than from the one who forms them. Such persons are 
called ventrilo-quists. However, such a condition is natural, as Pasquier 
shows, in Chap. 38 of his Researches, with one, Constantin, a jester, as an 
example.
     Q.-Whether keeping the gaze fixed on some object without moving the 
eye, is a good sign of possession?
     A.-The movement of the eye is voluntary, like that of the other parts 
of the body, and it is natural to move it or keep it still-there is 
therefore, nothing of note in this.
     Q.-Whether the answers, given in French, to questions rut in Latin, to 
those supposedly possessed, are a mark of possession ?
     A.-We assert that to understand and speak languages which one has not 
learnt is certainly supernatural, and would lead to the supposition that it 
occurred through the ministrations of the Devil or from some other cause 
beyond; but merely to answer some questions suggests nothing more than long 
practice, or that one of the number is in league with them and able to 
contribute to such answers making it appear a fallacy to say that the devils 
hear the questions put to them in Latin and answer in French and in the 
tongue natural to the one who is to pass for the demoniac.  If follows from 
this that such a result does not infer the occupation by a demon, more 
especially if the questions are of few words and not involved.
     Q.-Whether the vomiting of such things as one has swallowed is a sign 
of possession ?
     A.-Delrio, Bodin, and other authors say that by witch craft, sorcerers 
sometimes manage to vomit nails, pins, and other strange things, by the work 
of the devil, who is able
to do the same for the truly possessed. But to vomit things one has 
swallowed is natural, there being people with weak stomachs who keep down 
for several hours what they have swallowed and then return it as they have 
taken it; also the lientery returns food through the bowel as it has been 
taken by the mouth.
     Q.-Whether pricks with a lancet, in different parts of the body, 
without the drawing of blood, are a good sign of possession?
     A.-This is related to the composition of the melancholic temperament, 
in which the blood is so thick that it cannot issue from such small wounds 
and it is because of this that many when pricked by the surgeon's lancet, 
even in their very veins, do not bleed a drop, as is shown by experience. 
There is thus nothing extraordinary here.
     Recorded Incidents of Possession.-Bouloese tells how twenty-six devils 
came out of the body of the possessed Nicoli, of Laon: "At two o'clock in 
the afternoon, the said Nicoli, being possessed of the Devil, was brought to 
the said church, where the said de Motta proceeded as before with the 
exorcism. In spite of all entreaty the said Beelze-bub told them in a loud 
voice that he would not come out. Returning to their entreaties after 
dinner, the said de Motta asked him how many had come out, and he answered, 
'twenty-six’.' 'You and your followers,' then said de Motta, ' must now come 
out like the others.' 'No,' he replied,' I will not come out here, but if 
you like to take me to Saint Restitute, we will come out there. It is 
sufficient for you that twenty-six are out.' Then the said de Motta asked 
for a convincing sign of how they had come out.  For witness he told them to 
look in the garden of the treasury over the front gate. for they had taken 
and carried away three tufts (i.e. branches) from a green may-pole (a small 
fir) and three slates from above the church of Liesse, made into a cross, as 
others in France commonly, all of which was found true as shown by the Abbot 
of Saint-Vincent, M. de Velles, Master Robert de May, canon of the Church 
Notre-Dame of Laon, and others."
     The same author gives an account of the contortions of the demoniac of 
Laon: he says :-" As often as the reverend father swung the sacred host 
before her eyes, saying, 'Begone, enemy of Cod,' so did she toss from side 
to side, twisting her face towards her feet, and making horrible noises. Her 
feet were reversed, with the toes in the position of the heel, and despite 
the restraining power of eight or the men, she stiffened herself and threw 
herself into the air a height of six feet, the stature of a man, so that the 
attendants, sometimes even carried with her into the air, perspired at their 
work. And although they bore down with all their might, still could they not 
restrain her, and torn away from the restraining hands, she freed herself 
without any appearance of being at all ruffled.
     "The people, seeing and hearing such a horrible sight, one so 
monstrous, hideous and terrifying cried out, ' Jesus, have mercy on us !'  
Some hid themselves not daring to look; others, recognising the wild cruelty 
of such excessive and incredible torment, wept bitterly, reiterating 
piteously, Jesus, have mercy on us!' The reverend father then gave 
permission to those who wished to touch and handle the patient, disfigured, 
bent, and deformed, and with the rigidity of death. Chief among these were 
the would-be reformers, such men as Francois Santerre, Christofle, Pasquot, 
Gratian de la Roche, Masquette, Jean du Glas, and others well-known for 
their tendencies towards reform, all vigorous men. They all endeavoured, but 
in vain, to straighten her limbs, and bring them to a normal position, and 
to open her eyes and mouth-it was futile. Further, so stiff and rigid was 
she, that the limbs would have broken rather than give, as also the nose and 
ears. And then, as she said afterwards) she was possessed, declaring that 
she
was enduring incredible pain.  That is, by the soul tor-ment, the devil 
makes the body become stone or marble."
Jean Le Breton gives the following concerning those possessed in Louviers:-
     “The fourth fact is that many times a day they show transports of rage 
and fury, during which they call them-selves demons, without, however, 
offending anyone or even hurting the fingers of the priests, which were put 
into their mouths at the height of their fury.
     “The fifth is that during these furies they show strange convulsions 
and contortions, bending themselves back, among other things, in the form of 
a circle, without the use of the hands, and in such a way that their bodies 
are supported as much on the forehead as oh the feet.  The rest of the body 
is unsupported and remains so for a long time-the position being repeated 
seven or eight times. After such feats as this and many others, kept up 
some-times for four hours, chiefly during the exorcism and during the 
warmest parts of the dog days, they are found on coming to, to be as normal, 
as fresh and with a pulse as even as if nothing had happened to them.
     “The sixth is that some of them faint away at will during the exorcism 
and this condition occurs at a time when the face is the most suffused with 
blood and the pulse is the strongest. They come to of themselves and the 
recovery is more remarkable than the swooning-it begins as a move-ment of 
the toe, then of the foot and in their order, of the leg, thigh, abdomen, 
chest and throat, the movement of the, last three being one of wide 
dilation.  The face, meanwhile is apparently devoid of expression, which 
finally returns with grimaces and shootings, the spiritual element returning 
at the same time with its former disturbing contortions."
     Doctor Ese gives the following as the case of Sister Mary, of the 
Convent at Louviers
     “The last was Sister Mary of St. Esprit, supposedly possessed by Dagon, 
a large woman, 
slender-waisted, and of good complexion, with no evidence of illness. She 
came into the refectory. . . head erect and eyes wandering from side to 
side, singing, dancing and skipping. Still moving about and touching lightly 
those around her, she spoke with an elegance of language expressive of the 
good feeling and good nature which were his (using the person of the devil.) 
All this was done with movements and carriage alike haughty, following it up 
with a violence of blasphemy, then a reference to his dear little friend 
Magdalen, his darling and his favourite mistress. And then, without 
springing or using effort of any kind, she projected herself into a pane of 
glass and hanging on to a central bar of iron passed bodily through it, but 
on making an exit from the other side the command was given in Latin, ' est 
in nomine Jesu rediret non per aliam sed per eadem viam.'  After some 
discussion and a definite refusal to return she, how-ever, returned by the 
same route, whereupon the doctors examined her pulse and tongue, all of 
which she endured while laughing and discussing other things.  They found no 
disturbance such as they had expected, nor any sign of the violence of her 
actions and words, her coming to being accompanied with some trivial 
remarks.  The company then retired."
     Another writer on those possessed in Louviers gives the following 
astonishing fact:-
     “Placed in the middle of the nave of this chapel was a vase of some 
kind of marble, some two feet in diameter and a little under a foot deep, 
with sides about three fingers breadth in thickness.  So heavy was it that 
three of the most robust persons would have had difficulty in raising it 
while on the ground, yet this girl, to all appearances of very low vitality, 
came into the chapel and grasping the vase merely by the ends of her 
fingers, raised it from the pedestal on which it was placed, turned it 
upside down and threw it on to the ground with as much ease as if it had 
been a piece of cardboard or paper.  Such great strength in one so weak 
astonished all those present.  Moreover, the girl, appearing wild and 
possessed, ran hither and thither with movements so abrupt and violent that 
it was difficult to stop her.  One of the clerics present, having caught her 
by the arm, was surprised to find that it did not prevent the rest of her 
body from turning over and over as if the arm wert fixed to the shoulder 
merely by a spring.  This wholly unnatural performance was carried out some 
seven or eight times and that with an ease and speed difficult to imagine."
     The Relation des Ursulines possedees d'Auxonne contains the following:-
     "M. de Chalons was no sooner at the altar (at midnight> than from the 
garden of the monastery and around the house was heard a confused noise, 
accompanied by un-known voices and some whistling; at times loud cries with 
strange and indistinct sounds as from a crowd, all of which was rather 
terrifying among the shadows of the night.  At the same time stones were 
thrown from different places against the windows of the choir where they 
were celebrating holy mass and this despite the fact that these windows were 
a good distance from the walls which enclosed the monastery which made it 
improbable that they came from without. The glass was broken in one place 
but the stone did not fall into the choir.  This noise was beard by several 
persons, inside and out.  The sentinel in the citadel on that side of the 
town took alarm at it as he said the next day, and at the altar the bishop 
of Chalons could not but feel a suspicion that something extraordinary was 
going on in the house and that demons or sorcerers were making some attempts 
at that moment which he repelled from where he was by secret imprecations 
and inward exorcisms."
     "The Franciscan nuns of the same town heard the noise and were 
terrified by it.  They thought that the monastery shook beneath them and in 
this confusion and fear they were compelled to have recourse to prayer."
     “At the same time voices were heard in the garden, weak and moaning and 
as if asking for help.  It was nearly an hour after midnight and very dark 
and stormy.  Two clerics were sent out to see what was the matter and found 
Marguerite Constance and Denise Lamy in the monastery garden, the former up 
a tree and the latter seated at the foot of the stairway into the choir.  
They were at liberty and in the full possession of their senses, yet 
appeared dis-tracted, especially the latter, and very weak and pale, though 
with blood on her face; she was terrified and had difficulty in composing 
herself.  The other had blood on her face also though she was not wounded.  
The doors of the house were tightly closed and the walls of the garden were 
some ten or twelve feet high."
     “In the afternoon of the same day the bishop of Chalons, with the 
intention of exorcising Denise Lamy, sent for her and when she was not 
found, he inwardly commanded her to come to him in the chapel of St. Anne 
where he was.  It was striking to see the prompt obedience of the demon to 
this command, formulated merely in the mind, for in about a quarter of an 
hour a violent knocking was heard at the door of the chapel, as if by one 
hard pressed.  On opening the door this girl entered the chapel abruptly, 
leaping and bounding, her face changed greatly and with high colour and 
sparkling eyes.  So bold and violent was she that it was difficult to 
restrain her, nor would she allow the putting on of the stole which she 
seized and threw violently into the air despite the efforts of four or five 
clerics who did their best to stop her, so that finally it was proposed to 
bind, her, but this was deemed too difficult in the condition in which she 
was."
     “On another occasion, at the height of her frenzy the demon was ordered 
to stop the pulse in one of her arms, and it was immediately done, with less 
resistance and pain than before.  Immediate response. was also made to the 
further order to make it return.  The command being given to make the girl 
insensible to pain, she avowed that she was so, boldly offering her arm to 
be pierced and burnt as wished.  The exorcist, fortified by his earlier 
experience, took a sufficiently long needle and drove it, full length, into 
the nail and flesh, at which she laughed aloud, saying that she felt nothing 
at all.  Accordingly as he was ordered, blood was allowed to flow or not, 
and she herself took the needle and stuck it into different parts of her arm 
and hand.  Further, one of the company took a pin and, having drawn out the 
skin a little above the wrist, passed it through and through so that the two 
ends were only visible, the rest of the pin being buried in the arm.  Unless 
the order was given for some no blood issued, nor was there - the least sign 
of feeling or pain."
     The same account gives, as proofs of the possession of the Auxonne 
nuns, the following:-
     "Violent agitation of the body only conceivable to those who have seen 
it.  Beating of the head with all their might against the pavement or walls, 
done so often and so hard that it causes one to shudder on seeing it and yet 
they show no sign of pain, nor is there any blood, wound or contusion.
     "The condition of the body in a position of extreme violence, where 
they support themselves on their knees with the head turned round an 
inclined towards the ground for a foot or so, which makes it appear as if 
broken.  Their power of bearing, for hours together without moving, the head 
being lowered behind below the level of the waist; their power of breathing 
in this condition; the unruffled expression of the face which never alters 
during these disturbances; the evenness of the pulse; their coolness during 
these movements; the tranquil state they are in when they suddenly return 
and the lack of any quickening in the respirations; the turning back of the 
head, even to the ground, with marvellous rapidity.  Sometimes the movement 
to and fro is done thirty or forty times running, the girl on her knees and 
with her arms crossed in front; at other times, in the same position with 
the head turned about, the body is wound around into a sort of semicircle, 
with results apparently incompatible with nature."
     “Fearful convulsions, affecting all the limbs and accom-panied with 
shouts and cries. Sometimes fear at the sight of certain phantoms and 
spectres by which they say they are menaced, causes such a change in their 
facial expression that those present are terrified; at other times there is 
a flood of tears beyond control and accompanied by groans and piercing 
cries.  Again, the widely-opened mouth, eyes wild and showing nothing but 
the white, the pupil being turned up under cover of the lids-the whole 
returning to the normal at the mere command of the exorcist in conjunction 
with the sign of the cross.
     "They have often been seen creeping and crawling on the ground without 
any help from the hands or feet; the back of the head or the forehead may be 
touching the soles-of the feet.  Some lie on the ground, touching it with 
the pit of the stomach only, the rest of the body, head, feet and arms. 
being in the air for some length of time.  Sometimes, bent back so that the 
top of the head and the soles of the feet touch the ground, the rest of the 
body being supported in the air like a table, they walk in this position 
without help from the hands.  It is quite common for them, while on their 
knees to kiss the ground, with the face twisted to the back so that the top 
of the head touches the soles of the feet.  In this position and with the 
arms crossed on the chest they make the sign of the cross on the pavement 
with their tongues.
     “A marked difference is to be noticed between their condition when free 
and uncontrolled and that which they show when controlled and in the heat of 
their frenzy.  By reason of their sex and delicate constitutions as much as 
from illness they may be weak, but when the demon enters them and the 
authority of the church compels them to appear they may become at times so 
violent that all the power of four or five men may be unable to stop them. 
Even their faces become so distorted and changed that they are no longer 
recognisable.  What is more astonishing is that after these violent 
transports, lasting sometimes three or four hours; after efforts which would 
make the strongest feel like resting for several days ; after continuous 
shrieking and heart-breaking cries; when they become normal again-a 
momentary proceeding-they are un-wearied and quiet, and the mind is as 
tranquil, the face as composed, the breathing as easy and the pulse as 
little changed as if they had not stirred out of a chair.
     "It may be said, however, that among all the signs of possession which 
these girls have shown, one of the most surprising, and at the same time the 
most common, is the understanding of the thought and inward commands which 
are used every day by exorcists and priests, without there being any outward 
manifestation either by word or other sign. - To be appreciated by them it 
is merely necess-ary to address them inwardly or mentally, a fact which has 
been verified by so many of the experiences during the stay of the bishop of 
Chalons and by any of the clergy, who wished to investigate, that one cannot 
reasonably doubt such particulars and many others, the details of which 
cannot be given here.
     A number of archbishops or bishops and doctors in Sorbonne made the 
following notification with regard to the condition at Auxonne.
     "That among these differently-placed girls there are seculars, novices, 
postulants and professed nuns; some are young, others old; some from the 
town, others not; some of high estate, others of lesser parentage; some 
rich, others poor and of low degree. That it is ten years or more since the 
trouble began in this monastery; that it is remarkable that a reign of 
deceit was able for so long to preserve the secret among girls in such 
numbers and of conditions and interests so varied. That after research and a 
stricter enquiry, the said Bishop of Chalons has found nobody, either in the 
monastery or in the town, who could speak other than well of the innocence 
and integrity, alike of the girls and of the clergy who worked with him in 
the exorcisms, and, for himself, he finds them with the bearing of persons 
of uprightness and worth-evidence which he gives in the interest of truth 
and justice."
     "Added to the above is the certificate of Morel, doctor and present at 
everything, who asserts that all these things exceed the bounds of nature 
and can only occur as the work of a demon; in short, we consider that all 
the extra-ordinary findings with these girls 'are beyond the powers of human 
nature and can only be instigated by a demon possessing and controlling 
their bodies."
     Goulart culls from Wier many stories of demoniacs.
     “Antoine Benivenius in the eighth chapter of the Livre des causes 
cachees des maladies tells of having seen a girl of sixteen years whose 
hands contracted curiously whenever she was taken with a pain in the 
abdomen.  With a cry of terror her abdomen would swell up so much that she 
had the appearance of being eight months pregnant-later the swelling went 
down and, not being able to lie still, she tossed about all over the bed, 
sometimes putting her feet above her head as if trying a somersault. This 
she kept up throughout the throes of her illness and until it had gone down 
by degrees. When asked what had happened to her, she denied any remembrance 
of it.  But on seeking the causes of this affection we were of opinion that 
it arose from a choking of the womb and from the rising of malig-nant 
vapours affecting adversely the heart and brain.  We were at length forced 
to relieve her with drugs but these were of no avail and becoming more 
violent and congested she at last began to throw up long iron nails all 
bent, brass needles stuck into wax, and bound up with hair and a part of her 
breakfast-a mass so large that a man would have had difficulty in swallowing 
it all.  I was afraid, after seeing several of these vomitings, that she was 
possessed by an evil spirit, who deluded those present while he removed 
these things and afterwards we heard predictions and other things given 
which were entirely beyond human comprehension."
     “Meiner Clath, a nobleman living in the castle of Bouten-brouch in the 
duchy of Juliers, had a valet named William who for fourteen years had had 
the torments of a possession by the devil, and when, at the instigation of 
the devil, he began to get ill, he asked for the cure of St. Gerard as 
confessor     who came to carry out his little part. but failed entirely.  
Seeing him with a swollen throat and discoloured face and with the fear of 
his suffocating, Judith, wife of Clath and an upright woman, with all in the 
house, began to pray to God.  Immediately there issued from William's mouth, 
among other odds and ends, the whole of the front part of the trousers of a 
shepherd, stones, some whole and other broken, small bundles of thread, a 
peruke such as women are accustomed to use, needles, a piece of the serge 
jacket of a little boy, and a peacock's feather which William had pulled 
from the bird's tail eight days before he became ill.  Being asked the cause 
of his trouble he said that he had met a woman near Camphuse who had blown 
in his face and that his illness was the result of that and nothing else.  
Some time after he had recovered he contradicted what he had said and 
confessed that he had been instructed by the devil to say what he had.  He 
added that all those curious things had not been in his stomach but had been 
put into his throat by the devil despite the fact that he was seen to vomit 
them.  Satan deceives by illusions. The thought comes at times to kill 
oneself or to run away.  One day, having got into a hog-shed and protected 
more carefully than usual he remained with his eyes so firmly closed that it 
was impossible to open them. At last Gertrude, the eldest daughter of Clath, 
eleven years old, came along and advised him to pray to God for the return 
of his sight, but he asked her to pray and the fact of her praying, to the 
great surprise of both, opened his eyes.  The devil exhorted him often not 
to listen to his mistress or anyone else who bowed the head at the name of 
God, who could not help him as he had died once, a fact which was openly 
preached."
     “He had once attempted rudely to touch a kitchen-maid and she had 
reproved him by name, when he answered in a voice of rage that his name was 
not William but Beel-zebub, at which the mistress asked-' Do you think we 
fear you ?  He Whom we serve is infinitely more powerful than you are.'  
Clath then read the eleventh chapter of St. Luke where mention is made of 
the casting out of the dumb devil by the power of the Saviour and also of 
Beel-zebub, prince of devils.  Finally William began to rest and slept till 
morning like a man in a swoon, then taking some broth and feeling much 
relieved he was sent home to his parents, after having thanked his master 
and mistress and asked God to reward them for the trouble they had been 
caused by his affliction.  He married afterwards and had children, but was 
never again tormented by the devil."
     On the 18th March, 1566, there occurred a memorable case in Amsterdam, 
Holland, on which the Chancellor of Gueldres, M. Adrian Nicolas, made a 
public speech, from which is the following :-" Two months or so ago thirty 
children of this town began to be strangely disturbed, as if frenzied or 
mad.  At intervals they threw themselves on the ground and for half an hour 
or an hour at the most this torment lasted.  Recovering, they remembered 
noth-ing, but thought they had had a sleep and the doctors, sorcerers, and 
exorcists were all equally unable to do any good.  During the exorcism the 
children vomited a number of pins and needles, finger-stalls for sewing, 
bits of cloth, and of broken jugs and glass, hair and other things. The 
children didn't always recover from this but had recurrent attacks of it-the 
unusualness of such a condition causing great astonishment."
     Jean Languis, a learned doctor, gives the following, in the first book 
of his Epitres, as having happened in 1539 in Fugenstall, a village in the 
bishopric of Eysteten and sworn to by a large number of witnesses
     "Ulric Neusesser, a ploughman in this village, was greatly troubled by 
a pain in the side.  On an incision being made into the skin by a surgeon an 
iron nail was removed, but this did not relieve the pain, rather did it 
increase so that, becoming desperate, the poor man finally committed 
suicide. Before burying him two surgeons opened his stomach, in front of a 
number of persons, and in it found some long round pieces of wood, four 
steel knives, some sharp and pointed, others notched like a saw, two iron 
rods each nine inches long and a large tuft of hair,  One wondered how and 
by what means this mass of old iron could be collected together into the 
space of his stomach, There is no doubt that it was the work of the devil 
who is capable of anything which will maintain a dread of him."
     “Antoine Lucquet, knight of the order of the Fleece, of high repute 
throughout Flanders, and privy counsellor of Brabant, had married in Bruges, 
and his wife, soon after the nuptials, began to show the torments of an evil 
spirit, so much so that at times, even in company, she was suddenly taken up 
and dragged through rooms and thrown from one corner to another, despite the 
efforts of those around to restrain and hold her.  She was little conscious 
of her bodily welfare while in this frenzy and it was the general opinion 
that her condition had been induced by a former lover of her young and 
light-hearted husband. Meanwhile she became pregnant without a cessation in 
the evil torment and the time of her delivery being at hand the only woman 
present was sent for the midwife but instead, she came in and herself acted 
as midwife which disturbed the invalid so much that she fainted.  She found, 
on recovering, that she had been delivered, yet to the aston-ishment of both 
there was no sign of a child.  The next day on wakening up she found a child 
in swaddling clothes in the bed and she nursed it a couple of times.  
Falling asleep shortly afterwards the child was taken from her side and was 
never seen again.  It was reported that notes with the hall-mark of magic 
had been found inside the door."
     Goulart gives an account from Wier, of the multitude of terrible 
convulsions suffered by the nuns of the convent of Kentorp near Hammone,  
"Just before and during the attack their breath was fetid and sometimes 
continued so for hours.  While affected they did not lose their power of 
sound judgment nor of hearing and recognising those around them, despite the 
fact that owing to the spasm of the tongue and respiratory organs they could 
not speak during the attack. All were not equally affected but as soon as 
one was affected the others, though in different rooms, were immediately 
affected also.  A soothsayer, who was sent for, said they had been poisoned 
by the cook, Else Kamense, and the devil taking advantage of the occasion 
increased their torment, making them bite and strike each other and throw 
each other down.  After Else and her mother had been burnt some of the 
inhabitants of Hammone began to be tormented by an evil spirit. The minister 
of the Church took five of them home to warn them and strengthen them 
against the machinations of the enemy.  They laughed at him and mentioned 
certain women of the place whom they would like to visit on their goats, 
which were to carry them there.  Immediately one straddled a stool calling 
out that he was off, while another, squatting down, doubled himself up and 
rolled towards the door of the room which opened suddenly and through which 
he went falling to the bottom of the steps without hurting himself."
     "The nuns of the Convent of Nazareth at Cologne (according to the same 
writer) were affected much the same as those of Kentorp.  After being 
troubled for along time and in various ways by the devil they were more 
terribly affected in 1564 when they would lie out on the ground, with 
clothing disordered, as if for the companion-ship of man. During this their 
eyes would be closed and they would open them later with shame and feeling 
that they had endured some deep injury. A young girl of fourteen named 
Gertrude who had been shut -op in this convent was subject to this 
misfortune. She had often been troubled by wild apparitions in bed as 
witness her mocking' laughter, although she tried in vain to overcome
it.  A companion slept near her specially to protect her from the apparition 
but the poor girl was terrified at the noise from Gertrude's bed, the devil 
finally controlling the latter and putting her through a variety of 
contortions. The beginning of all this trouble was in the acquaintance 
picked up with one or two of the nuns on a neighbouring tennis court by some 
dissolute young man who kept up their amours over the walls."
     “The torments suffered by the nuns in Wertet in the county of Home are 
also wonderful.  The beginning is traced to a poor woman who borrowed from 
the nuns during Lent some three pounds of salt and returned double the 
amount before Easter.  From that they began to find in their dormitory small 
white balls like sugar-plums, and salt to the taste, which they did not eat, 
nor did they know whence they came.  Shortly after they heard a moaning as 
of a sick man, then warnings to rise and go to the help of a sick sister, 
which they would do but would find nothing. Sometimes in endeavouring to use 
a chamber it would be pulled away suddenly with a consequent soiling of the 
bed. At times they were pulled out by the feet, dragged some length, and 
tickled so much on the soles of the feet that they nearly died with 
laughter.  Pieces of flesh were pulled out of some, while others had their 
legs, arms and heads twisted about.  Thus tormented some would throw up a 
large quantity of black fluid, although for six weeks previously they had 
taken nothing but the juice of horse-radish without bread.  This fluid was 
so bitter and so sharp that it blistered their mouths and one could evolve 
nothing which would give them an appetite for anything else.  Some were 
raised into the air to the height of a man and as suddenly thrown to the 
ground again. When some thirty of their females visited this convent to 
congratulate those who seemed relieved and practically cured, some of them 
immediately fell backwards from the table they were at, losing the power of 
speech and of recognising anyone, while others were stretched out as if dead 
with arms and legs turned around.  One of them was raised into the air 
against the restraining efforts of those present and then brought again to 
the ground so forcibly that she seemed dead.  She rose, however, as if from 
a deep sleep and left the convent uninjured.  Some moved about on the fronts 
of their legs as if lacking feet and as he dragged in a loose sack from 
behind.  Others even climbed trees like cats and came down as easily.  The 
Abbess told Margaret, Countess of Bure, that she cried aloud when pinched in 
the
leg; it was as severe as if a piece had been pulled out, and that she was 
carried to bed at once and the place became black and blue, but she finally 
recovered.  This derange-ment of the nuns was an open secret for three years 
but has been kept dark since."
     “What we have just said applies equally to the early case of the Budget 
nuns in their convent near Xanthus. Now, they gambol or bleat like sheep or 
make horrible noises.  Sometimes they were pushed from their seats in church 
where their veils would be fastened above their heads.  At other times their 
throats would be so stopped up that they could swallow no food, and this 
affliction lasted for ten years in some of them.  It was said that the cause 
of all this was a young nun whose parents had refused to allow her to marry 
the young man she loved Further that the devil in the form of this young man 
had come to her at the height of her passion and had advised her to return 
to the convent which she did at once and when there she became frenzied and 
her actions were, strange and terrible.  The trouble spread like the plague 
through the other nuns, and the first, one abandoned herself to her warder 
and had two children. - Thus does Satan both within and without the convent, 
carry out his hateful schemes."
     "Cardan relates that a ploughman     often threw up glass, nails and 
hair and, on recovering, felt within a large quantity of broken glass which 
made a noise like that from a sackful of broken glass. This noise he said 
troubled him greatly and for some eighteen nights towards seven o'clock, 
although he had not observed the time and although he had felt cured for 
some eighteen years, he had felt blows in his heart to the number of hours 
which were to strike. All this he bore not without great agony."
     "I have often seen," says Goulart, "a demoniac named George, who for 
thirty years on and off was tormented by an evil spirit and often I have 
seen her swell up, and become so heavy that eight strong men could not raise 
her from the ground.  Then, exhorted and encouraged in the name of God and 
the hand of some good man extended to her, she would rise to her feet and 
return home, bent and groaning. She did harm to no one whether by day or 
night while in this condition, and she lived with a relative who had a 
number of children so used to her ways that when they saw her twisting her 
arms, striking her hands and her body swelling up in this strange way, they 
would gather in some part of the house and commend her to God and their 
prayers were never in vain.  Finding her one day in another house of the 
village in which she lived I exhorted her to patience. . . She began to roar 
in a strange way and with a marvellous quickness shot out her left hand at 
me and enclosed in it my two hands, holding me as firmly as if I had been 
bound with stout cords.  I tried, but in vain, to free myself, although I am 
of average strength.  She interfered with me in no other way nor did she 
touch me with her right hand. - I was held as long as it has taken to tell 
the incident and then she let me go suddenly, begging my pardon, and I 
commended her to God and led her quietly home. . . . Some days before her 
death being much tormented she went to bed with a low fever. The fury of the 
evil one was then so much curtailed that the patient, wonderfully 
strengthened inwardly, continued to praise God who bad been so merciful to 
her in her affliction and comforting all who visited her. . . . I may add 
that Satan was overcome, and that she died peacefully, calling on her 
Saviour."
      According to Goulart " there was, in the village of Leuensteet and 
duchy of Brunswick, a young girl of twenty years, Margaret Achels, who lived 
with her sister.  Wishing to clean some shoes one day in June she took a 
knife some six inches long and sat down in a corner of the room for she was 
still weak from a fever of long standing, whereupon an old woman entered and 
inquired how she was and whether she still had the fever and then left 
without further words. After the shoes were cleaned she let the knife fall 
in her lap but subsequently could not find it despite a diligent search.  
The girl was frightened and still more so when she found a black dog under 
the table.  She drove it out, hoping to find the knife, but the dog got 
angry, showed its teeth and growlingly made its way into the street and 
fled. The girl at once seemed to feel something indefinable which passed 
down her back like a chill and fainting suddenly she remained so for three 
days when she began to breathe better and to take a little food.  When 
carefully questioned as to the cause of her illness she said that the knife 
which had fallen into her lap had entered her left side and that there she 
felt pain.  Although her parents contradicted her, attributing her condition 
to a melancholic disposition, her long abstinence and other things she did 
not cease to complain, to cry and to keep a continuous watch, so much so 
that her mind became deranged and sometimes for two days at a time she would 
take nothing even when kindly entreated to do so, so that sometimes force 
had to be used.  Her attacks were more severe at times than others and her 
rest was broken by the continuous pains which beset bar, being forced as she 
was to hold herself doubled over a stick.  What increased her pain and 
lessened the chance of relief was her firm belief that the knife was buried 
in her body and the stubborn contradiction of the others who said it was 
impossible and thought it nothing but a phantom of the mind, since they saw 
nothing which would give them ground for believing her unless it were her 
continual com-plaints and tears.  These were kept up for some months and 
until there appeared on her left side between the two false ribs a tumour as 
large as an egg which fluctuated in size with the changes in her own girth.  
Then the girl said to them:  Up to the present you haven't wanted to believe 
that the knife was in my side, but you will soon see now that it is.'  On 
the 30th June, that is after almost thirteen months of the trouble, the 
ulcer which developed on her side poured out so much material that the 
swelling began to go down and the point of the knife showed and the girl 
wanted to pull it out but her parents prevented her and sent for the surgeon 
of Duke Henry who was at the Castle of Walfbutel.  This surgeon arrived on 
the 4th July and begged the curate to comfort, instruct and encourage the 
girl, and to take particular note of her answers since she was regarded as a 
demoniac.  She agreed to be attended by the surgeon, not without the idea 
that a quick death would follow.  The latter, seeing the point of the knife 
projecting, grasped it with his instruments and found that it was just like 
the other in the sheath and very much worn about the middle of the blade.  
The ulcer was finally cured."
     Goulart, quoting Melanchthon, says that "there was a girl in the 
marquisate of Brandebourg who pulled some hairs off the clothing of some 
person and that these hairs wore at once changed into coins of the realm 
which tile girl chewed with a horrible cracking of the teeth.  Some of these 
coins are kept still by persons who snatched them away from the girl and 
found them real.  From time to time this girl was much tormented but after 
some months got quite well and has remained so since.  Prayers, but nothing 
more, are often offered up for her."
     The same author also says : " I have heard that there was in Italy a 
demented woman who when controlled by a devil and asked by Lazare Bonami for 
the best verse of Virgil, answered at once:
‘Discite Justitiam Moniti et non temnere divos.'
    That,' she added, ' is the best and most-deserving verse that Virgil 
every wrote; begone and don't come back here again to try me.'
     Louise Maillat, a young demoniac who lived in 1598 lost the use of her 
limbs and was found to be possessed by five demons who called themselves, 
wolf, cat, dog, beauty and a griffin.  At first two of these demons came out 
from her mouth in the form of balls the size of the fist, the first fire-
red, the second, which was the cat, quite black; the others left her with 
less violence.  On leaving her they all made a few turns round the hearth 
and disappeared. Frances Secretain was known to have made this girl swallow 
these devils in a crust of bread the colour of manure."


Od Force : (See Emanations.)


Odyle (also Od, Odic Force, Odyllic Force) : The term first used by Baron 
von Reichenbach to denote the subtle effluence which he supposed to emanate 
from every sub-stance in the universe, particularly from the stars and 
planets, and from crystals, magnets and the human body. the odyle was 
perceptible only to sensitives, in whom it produced vague feelings of heat 
or cold, according to the substance from which it radiated; or a 
sufficiently sensi-tive person might perceive the 
odyllic light, a clear flame of definite colour, issuing from the human 
finger-tips, the poles of the magnet, various metals, chemicals, etc., and 
hovering like a luminous cloud over new-made graves. The colours varied with 
each substance; thus silver and gold had a white flame; cobalt, a blue; 
copper and iron, a red. The English mesmerists speedily applied 
Reichenbach's methods to. their own sensitives, with results that passed 
their expectations. The thoroughness of  Reichenbach's experiments, and the 
apparent soundness of his scientific methods, made a deep impression of the 
public mind. The objections of Braid, who at this time advanced his theory 
of suggestion, were ignored by the protagonists of odyle. In after years, 
when spiritualism had established itself in America, there remained a group 
of " rational" defenders of the movement, who attributed the phenomena of 
spirit-ualism as well as those of the poltergeist to the action of odylic 
force.  Table-turning and rapping were also referred to this emanation by 
many who laughed to scorn Faraday's theory of unconscious muscular action.  
Others again, such as Mr. Guppy, regarded the so-called" spirit" 
intelligences producing the manifestations as being compounded of odylic 
vapours emanating from the medium, and probably connected with an all-
pervading thought-atmosphere-an idea sufficiently like the " cosmic fluid" 
of the early magnetists.


Oil, Magical : (See Magic.)


Ointment, Witches' : It was believed in mediaeval times that all the wonders 
performed by witches-i.e., changing them-selves into animals, being 
transported through the air, etc.-were wrought by anointing themselves with 
a potent salve. As ointments are still used in Oriental countries as a means 
of inducing visions, it is possible that something of the kind may account 
for the hallucinations which the witches seem to have experienced.  Lord 
Verulam says, "The ointment, that witches use, is reported to be made of the 
fat of children, digged out of their groves ; of the juices of smallage, 
wolfe-bane, and cinque foil, mingled with the meal of fine wheat but I 
suppose that the soporiferous medicines are likest to do it, which are hen-
bane, hemlock, mandrake, moonshade, tobacco, opium, saffron, poplar leaves, 
etc."


Okey Sisters : (See Spiritualism.)


Olcott, Colonel Henry Steel : The founder, together with Madame Blavatsky, 
of the movement known as Theosophy, and president of the Theosophical 
Society.  Before he identified himself with this movement he was a well-
known authority on matters connected with agriculture.  In 1856 he founded 
in America an agricultural school on the Swiss model, was offered by the 
American Government the Chief Commissionership of Agriculture and by the 
Greek Govern-ment the Professorship of Agriculture at Athens.  He was for a 
time agricultural editor of Horace Greeley's New York Tribune, and published 
three works on agriculture. When the Civil War broke out he joined the 
Northerners, saw active service, and was invalided home.  The government 
then made him Special Commissioner of the War Depart-ment.  On the cessation 
of the war he retired into private life, and from 1875 till his death in 
1906 taught the doctrines of Theosophy and neo-Buddhism.  On the death of 
Madame Blavatsky he associated himself with Mrs. Annie Besant as the leader 
of Theosophy in India.  (See Theosophy.)


Old Hat: used for Raising the Devil : A popular mode of raising the devil in 
former times was to make a circle, place an old hat in the centre, and 
repeat the Lord's Prayer backwards.  It was really a caricature of magical 
incanta-tion.


Old man of the Mountain : (See Assassins.)


"Old Scratch" : One of the appellations given to the Evil One.  It is 
supposed to have been derived from Skrati, an old Teutonic faun or Satyr, 
half-man and half-goat, and possessed of horns.


Olympian Spirits : (See Seven Stewards of Heaven.)


Olympic Spirits: (See Arbatel.)


Om : A Sanskrit word of peculiar sanctity in the Hindu religion.  It is 
pronounced at the beginning and end of every lesson in the Veda, and is also 
the introductory word of the Puranas.  It is said in the Katha- Upanishad:
     “Whoever knows this syllable obtains whatever he wishes."  Various 
accounts are given of its origin; one that it is the term of assent used by 
the gods, and probably an old contracted form of the Sanskrit word evam 
meaning thus."  The laws of the Menu say that the word was formed by Brahma 
himself, who extracted the letters a u m from the Vedas, one from each; and 
they thus explain its mysterious power and sanctity.  Om is also the name 
given by the Hindus to the spiritual sun, as opposed to" Sooruj the natural 
sun.


Omar Khayyam: (See Assassins.)


Onimancy, or the observation of the angel Uriel, is thus performed. Upon the 
nails of the right hand of an un-polluted boy or a young virgin, or the palm 
of the hand, is put some oil of olives, or what is better, oil of walnuts 
mingled with tallow or blacking.  If money or things hidden in the earth be 
sought. the face of the child must be turned towards the east. If crime be 
inquired into, or the knowledge of a person out of affection, towards the 
south; for robbery towards the west, and for murder towards the south.  Then 
the child must repeat the seventy-two verses of the Psalms, which the Hebrew 
kabal-ists collected for the Urim and Thummim: These will be found in the 
third book of Reuclin on the kabalistical art, and in a treatise de verbo 
mirifico.  In each of these verses occurs the venerable name of four 
letters, and the three lettered name of the seventy-two angels, which are 
referred to the inquisitive name Schemhammaphoras, which was hidden in the 
folds of the lining of the tippet of the high priest.  When the curious 
student has done thus much, Saunders assures him that he " shall see 
wonders," but he omits to specify what these wonders are. Chiromancers give 
the name Onyomancy to the inspection of the natural signs on the nails.


Onion:	The Onion was regarded as a symbol of the universe among the ancient 
Egyptians, and many curious beliefs were associated with it.  It was 
believed by them that it attracted and absorbed infectious matters, and was 
usually hung up in rooms to prevent maladies.  This belief in the absorptive 
virtue of the onion is prevalent even at the present day.  "When a youth," 
says Napier," I remember the following story being told, and isuplicitly 
believed by all. There was once a certain king or nobleman who was in want 
of a physician, and two celebrated doctors applied. As both could not obtain 
the situation, they agreed among themselves that the one was to try to 
poison the other, and he who succeeded in overcoming the poison would thus 
be left free to fill the situation.  They drew lots as to who should first 
take the poison.  The first dose given was a stewed toad, but the party who 
took it immediately applied a poultice of peeled onions over his stomach, 
and thus abstracted all the poison of the toad. Two days after, the other 
doctor was given the onions to eat.  He ate them, and died.  It was 
generally believed that the poultice of peeled onions laid on the stomach, 
or underneath the arm-pits, would cure anyone who had taken poison."


Onomancy, it has been properly said, more correctly signifies divination by 
a donkey, than by a name; and the latter science ought to be termed 
Onomamancy, or Onomatomancy. The notion that an analogy existed between 
men's names and their fortunes is supposed to have originated with the 
Pythagoreans; it furnished some reveries to Plato, and has been the source 
of much small wit in Ausonius, which it may amuse the classical scholar to 
collate from his epigrams.
     Two leading rules in the science of Onomancy were first, that an even 
number of vowels in a man's name signifies something amiss in his left side; 
an uneven number a similar affection on the right; so that, between the two, 
perfect sanity was little to be expected.  Secondly, of two competitors, 
that one would prove successful the numeral letters in whose name when 
summed up exceeded the amount of those in the name of his rival; and this 
was one of the reasons which enabled Achilles to triumph over Hector.
     The Gothic King, Theodotus, is said, on the authority of Caelius 
Rhodiginus to have practised a peculiar species of Onomancy on the 
recommendation of a Jew. The diviner advised the prince, when on the eve of 
a war with Rome, to shut up thirty hogs in three different styes, having 
previously given some of them Roman and others Gothic names. On an appointed 
day, when the styes were opened, all the Romans were found alive, but with 
half their bristles fallen off-all the Goths, on the other hand, were dead; 
and from this prognostic the onomantist foreboded that the Gothic army would 
be utterly destroyed by the Romans, who, at the same time, would lose half 
their own force.

Onychomancy:  Divination by the finger-nails.  It is prac-tised by watching 
the reflection of the sun in the nails of a boy, and judging the future by 
the shape of the figures which show themselves on their surface.


Onyx:	Its properties resemble those of Jasper, besides which it increases 
saliva in boys, and is said to bring terrible shapes to the dreamer.  If 
applied to the eye it acts as if it were alive, by creeping about and 
removing anything noxious.


Ooscopy and Oomantia: Two methods of divination by eggs. An example under 
the former name is related by Suetonius, who says, that Livia, when she was 
anxious to know whether she should be the mother of a boy or girl, kept an 
egg in her bosom at the proper temperature, until a chick with a beautiful 
cockscomb came forth. The latter name denotes a method of divining the signs 
or characters appearing in eggs. The custom of pasche or paste eggs, which 
are stained with various colours, and given away at Easter, is well known, 
and is described at considerable length by Brand.  The custom is most 
religiously observed in Russia, where it is derived from the Greek Church.  
Gilded or coloured eggs are mutually exchanged both by men and women, who 
kiss one another, and if any coolness existed previously become good friends 
again on these occasions.  The egg is one of the most ancient and beautiful 
symbols of the new birth, and has been applied to natural philosophy as well 
as the spiritual creation of man.


Opal : Recreates the heart, preserves from contagion in the air, and dispels 
sadness; it is also good for weak eyes. Pliny's description of this stone 
glows with enthusiasm, and he gives the preference to those which are 
shadowed as it were with the colour of wine.  The name poederos, applied to 
the opal, is understood to indicate the beautiful complexion of youth.


Ophites : This gnostic sect seems to have dated from the second century.  A 
full system of initiation was in vogue among the members, and they possessed 
symbols to represent purity, life, spirit and fire. The whole appears to 
have been of Egyptian origin.  (See Gnostic..)


Oracles : Shrines where a god speaks to human beings through the mouths of 
priests or priestesses.  The concept of the god become vocal in this manner 
was by no means confined to Greece or Egypt. Our object here is to deal with 
the most celebrated oracles of all nations as well as those of antiquity. 
Probably all the primitive gods-those, that is to say, of the fetish class, 
now under con-sideration-were consulted as oracles; it is certain that they 
derived this character in a state of animism and that they transmitted it to 
gods of the most advanced type. In early times the great question was 
whether man would have food on the morrow or no; perhaps the first oracle 
was the spirit which directed the hungry savage in his hunting and fishing 
expeditions. The Esquimaux still consult spirits for this purpose, and their 
wizards are as familiar with the art of giving ambiguous replies to their 
anxious clients as were the well-informed keepers of the oracles of Greece. 
As advancement proceeded, the direction of the gods was obtained in all the 
affairs of private and public life.
     Greece.-The Oracle of Delphi. When Jupiter was once desirous to 
ascertain the central point of the earth, he despatched two eagles, or two 
crows, as they are named by Strabo. The messengers took flight in opposite 
courses, from sunrise and sunset; and they met at Delphi, which place was 
thenceforward dignified with the title  The navel of the earth; " an  
umbilicus" being represented in white marble within its celebrated temple. 
Delphi thus became a place of great distinction, but it was not yet 
oracular, till the fumes which issued from a neighbouring cave were first 
discovered by a shepherd named Coretas. His attention was forcibly attracted 
to a spot round which whenever his goats were browsing they gambolled and 
bleated more than was their wont. Whether these fumes arose in consequence 
of an earthquake, or whether- they were generated by demoniacal art is not 
to be ascertained; but the latter hypothesis is thought by Clasen to be the 
more probable of the two.  Coretas, on approaching the spot, was seized with 
ecstacy, and uttered words which were deemed inspired. It was not long 
before the danger arising in consequence of the excitement of curiosity 
among the neighbours, the deadly stupefaction often produced among those who 
inhaled the fumes without proper caution, and the inclination which it 
aroused in some to plunge them-selves into the depths of the cavern below, 
occasioned the fissure to be covered by a sort of table, having a hole in 
the centre, and called a tripod, so that those who wished to try the 
experiment could resort there in safety.  Eventually a young girl, of 
unsophisticated manners, became the chosen medium of the responses, now 
deemed oracular and called Pythian, as proceeding from Apollo, the slayer of 
Python, to whom Delphi was consecrated. A sylvan bower of laurel branches 
was erected over the spot, and at length the marble temple and the 
priesthood of Delphi arose where the Pythoness, seated on her throne, could 
be charged with the divine "afflatus," and was thus rendered the vehicle of 
Apollo's dictation.
     As the oracle became more celebrated, its prophetic machinery was 
constructed of more costly materials. The tripod was then formed of gold, 
but the lid, which was placed in its hollow rim, in order to afford the 
Pythoness a more secure seat, continued to be made of brass. She prepared 
herself by drinking out of a sacred fountain (Castalia). adjoining the 
crypt, the waters of which were reserved for her only, and in which she 
bathed her hair; by chewing a laurel leaf, and by circling her brows with a 
laurel crown. The person who made inquiry from the oracle, first offered a 
victim, and then having written his question in a note-book, handed it to 
the Pythoness, before she ascended the tripod; and he also as well as the 
priestess, wore a laurel crown. In early times the oracle spoke only in one 
month of the year, named "Byssus," in which it originated; and at first only 
on the seventh day of that month, which was esteemed the birth-day of 
Apollo, and was called " Polypthonus."
     Virginity was at first an indispensable requisite in the Pythoness; on 
account, as Diodorus tells us, of the purity of that state and its relation 
to Diana; moreover, because virgins were thought better adapted than others 
of their sex to keep oracular mysteries secret and inviolate. But an 
untoward accident having occurred to one of these consecrated damsels, the 
guardians of the temple, in order, as they imagined, to prevent its 
repetition for the future permitted no one to fulfil the duties of the 
office till she had attained the mature age of fifty; they still indulged 
her, however, with the use of a maiden's habit. The response was always 
delivered in Greek.
     Oracle of Dodona. Another celebrated oracle, that of Jupiter, was at 
Dodona, in Epirus, from which Jupiter derived the name of Dodonus. It was 
situated at the foot of Mount Tomarus, in a wood of oaks; and there the 
answers were given by an old woman under the name of Pelias. Pelias means 
dove in the Attic dialect, from which the fable arose, that the doves 
prophesied in the groves of Dodona.  According to Herodotus, this legend 
con-tains the following incident, which gave rise to the oracle -Two 
priestesses of Egyptian Thebes were carried away by Phoenician merchants; 
one of them was conveyed to Libya, where she founded the oracle of Jupiter 
Ammon; the other to Greece. The latter one remained in the Dodonian wood, 
which was much frequented on account of the acorns. There she had a temple 
built at the foot of an oak in honour of Jupiter, whose priestess she had 
been in Thebes; and here afterwards a regular oracle was founded. He adds, 
that this priestess was called a dove, because her language could not be 
understood.  The Dodonid and African oracles were certainly connected, and 
Herodotus distinctly states, that the manner of prophecy in Dodona was the 
same as that in Egyptian Thebes. Diana was worshipped in Dodona in 
conjunction with Zeus, and a female figure was associated with Amun in the 
Libyan Ammonium. Besides this, the dove was the bird of Aphrodite, the Diana 
of Zeus, or the Mosaic divine love, which saved mankind from complete 
destruction. According to other authors, there was a wondrous intoxi-cating 
spring at Dodona; and in later times more material means were employed to 
produce the prophetic spirit.
Several copper bowls, namely, were placed upon a column, and the statue of a 
boy beside them. When the wind moved a rod or scourge having three bones 
attached to chains, it struck upon the metallic bowls, the sound of which 
was heard by the applicants.  These Dodonian tones gave rise to a proverb: 
aes Dodonaeum - an unceasing babbler. The oracle at Dodona was dedicated to 
the Pelasgian Zeus, who was worshipped here at the same time as the almighty 
ruler of the world, and as the friendly associate of mankind. In the course 
of the theogonic process, Diana was associated with him as his wife,-the 
mother of Aphrodite. The servants of Zeus were Selles, the priests of Diana, 
the so-called Peliades. According to Homer, the Selles inhabited the sanctum 
at Dodona, sleeping upon the earth, and with naked unwashed feet; they 
served the Pelasgian Zeus. It is probable that they slept upon the earth on 
the hides of newly-sacrificed animals, to receive prophetic dreams, as was 
customary at other places, Calchos and 
Oropus, with many others.
     As regards the mantic of Dodona, it was partly natural, from the 
excitement of the mind, partly artificial. Of the latter we may mention 
three modes-the ancient oak of Zeus, with its prophetic doves, the 
miraculous spring, and the celebrated Dodonian bowls of brass.
     The far-spreading, speaking tree, the incredible wonder, as AEschylus 
calls it, was an oak, a lofty beautiful tree, with evergreen leaves and 
sweet edible acorns, which according to the belief of the Greeks and Romans, 
were the first sustenance of mankind. The Pelasgi regarded this tree as the 
tree of life. In this tree the god was supposed to reside, and the rustling 
of its leaves and the voices of birds showed his presence. When the 
questioners entered, the oak rustled, and the Peliades said, " Thus speaks 
Zeus." Incense was burned beneath it, which may be compared to the altar of 
Abraham under the oak Ogyges, which had stood there since the world's 
creation. According to the legend, sacred dove', continually inhabited the 
tree, like the Marsoor oracle at Tiora Mattiene, where a sacred hawk 
foretells futurity from the top of a wooden pillar.
     At the foot of the oak a cold spring gushes as it were from its roots, 
and from its murmur the inspired priestesses prophesied.
     Of this miraculous fountain it is related, that lighted torches being 
thrust into it were extinguished, and that extinguished torches were re-lit; 
it also rose and fell at various seasons. "That extinction and rekindling 
has," says Lassaulx, "perhaps the mystical signification that the usual 
sober life of the senses must be extinguished, that the prophetic spirit 
dormant in the soul may be aroused. The torch of human existence must 
expire, that a divine one may be lighted; the human must die that the divine 
may be born; the destruction of individuality is the awakening of God in the 
soul, or, as the mystics say, the setting of sense is the rising of truth."
     The extinguishing of a burning light shows that the spring contained 
carbonic acid gas, which possesses stupi-fying and deadly properties, like 
all exhalations arising especially from minerals. The regular rising and 
sinking of the water is a frequent phenomenon, and has been observed from 
the earliest ages.
     It appears that predictions were drawn from the tones of the Dodonian 
brass bowls, as well as from the rustling of the sacred oak and the 
murmuring of the sacred well.
     The Dodonian columns, with that which stood upon them, appears to 
express the following -The medium-sized brazen bowl was a hemisphere, and 
symbolised of heaven; the boy-like male statue a figure of the Desniurgos, 
or constructor of the universe; the bell-like notes a symbol of the harmony 
of the universe and music of the spheres. That the Demiurgos is represented 
as a boy is quite in the spirit of Egypto-Pelasgian theology as it reigned 
in Samo-thrace. The miraculous bell told all who came to Dodona to question 
the god that they were on holy ground, must inquire with pure hearts, and be 
silent when the god replied. It is easily imagined that these tones, 
independent and uninfluenced by human will, must have made a deep impression 
upon the minds of pilgrims.  Those who questioned the god were also obliged 
to take a purificatory bath in the temple, similar to that by which the 
Deiphian Pythia prepared herself for prophecy.
     Besides this artificial soothsaying from signs, natural divination by 
the prophetic movements of the mind was practised. Where there are 
prophesying priestesses, there must also be ecstatic ones, similar to those 
in the magnetic state. Sophocles calls the Dodonean priestesses divinely 
inspired: Plato (Phaesdrus) says, more decidedly, that the prophetess at 
Delphi and the priestesses at Dodona bad done much good in sacred madness, 
in private and public affairs. to their country, but in their senses little 
or nothing. We may see from this that the Delphian Pythia, as well as the 
Dodonian priestesses, did not give their oracles in the state of common 
waking consciousness, but in real ecstasy, to which the frequent incense-and 
drink-offerings would assist. Aristides states, still more clearly than the 
others, that the priestesses at Dodona neither knew, before being seized 
upon by the spirit, what would be said, nor remem-bered afterwards, when 
their natural consciousness re-turned, what they had uttered; so that all 
others, rather than they, knew it.
     Oracle of Jupiter Trophonius.-Trophonius, according to Pausanias, was 
the most skilful architect of his day. Con-cerning the origin of his oracle 
there are many opinions. Some say he was swallowed up by an earthquake in 
the cave which afterwards became prophetic; others, that after having 
completed the Adytum of Apollo at Delphi (a very marvellous specimen of his 
workmanship, which Dr. Clarke thought might at some time be discovered on 
account of its singularity), he declined asking any specific pay, but 
modestly requested the god to grant him what-ever was the greatest benefit a 
man could receive; and in three days afterwards he was found dead. This 
oracle was discovered after two years of scarcity in its neighbourhood, when 
the Pythoness ordered the starving population, who applied to her, to 
consult Trophonius in Lebedna.  The deputation sent for that purpose could 
not discover any trace of such an oracle, till Saon, the oldest among them, 
obtained the desired information by following the flight of a swarm of bees. 
The responses were given by the genius of Trophonius to the inquirer, who 
was compelled to descend into a cave, of the nature of which Pausanias has 
left a very lively representation. The votary resided for a certain number 
of days in a sanctuary of good fortune, in which he underwent customary 
lustrations, abstained from hot baths, but dipped in the river Hercyna, and 
was plentifully supplied with meat from the victims which he sacrificed. 
Many, indeed, were the sacred personages whom he was bound to propitiate 
with blood; among them were Trophonius himself and his sons, Apollo, Saturn, 
Jupiter, Vasileus, Juno Henioche, and Ceres Europa, who is affirmed to have 
been the nurse of Trophonius. From an inspection of the entrails, a 
soothsayer pronounced whether Trophonius was in fit humour for consultation. 
None of the  “exta," however favourable they might have been, were of the 
slightest avail, unless a ram, immolated to Agamedes at the mouth of the 
cave on the very night of the descent, proved auspicious. When that 
propitious signal had been given the priests led the inquirer to the river 
Hercyna, where he was anointed and washed by two Lebadaean youths, thirteen 
years of age, named " Hermai." He was then carried farther to the two 
spring-heads of the stream, and there he drank first of Lathe, in order that 
he might forget all past events and present his mind to the oracle as a " 
tabula rasa" ; and secondly of Mnemosyne, that he might firmly retain 
remembrance of every occurrence which was about to happen within the cave. 
An image, reputed to be the workmanship of Daedalus, was then exhibited to 
him, and so great was its sanctity, that no other eyes but those of a person 
about to undertake the adventure of the cave were ever permitted to behold 
it. Next he was clad in a linen robe, girt with ribbons, and shod with 
sandals peculiar to the country. The entrance to the oracle was a very 
narrow aperture in a grove on the summit of a mountain, protected by a 
marble parapet about two cubits in height, and by brazen spikes above it. 
The upper part of the cave was artificial, like an oven, but no steps were 
cut in the rock, and the descent was made by a ladder brought to the spot on 
each occasion. On approaching the mouth of the adytum itself the adven-turer 
lay flat, and holding in each hand some honeyed cakes, first inserted his 
feet into the aperture, then drew his knees and the remainder of his body 
after them, till he was caught by some bidden force, and carried downward as 
if by a whirlpool. The responses were given sometimes by a vision, sometimes 
by words; and a forcible exit was then made through the original entrance, 
and in like manner feet foremost. There was only a single instance on record 
of any person who had descended failing to return and that one deserved his 
fate; for his object was to discover treasure, not to consult the oracle.  
Immediately on issuing from the cavern, the inquirer was placed on a seat 
called that of Mnemosyne, not far from the entrance, and there the priests 
demanded a relation of everything which he had seen and beard; be was then 
carried once again to the sanctuary of good fortune, where he remained for 
some time overpowered by terror and lost in forget-fulness. By degrees his 
former powers of intellect returned, and, in contradiction to the received 
opinion, he recovered the power of smiling.
     Dr. Clarke, in his visit to Lebadaea, found everything belonging to the 
hieron of Trophonius in its original state, excepting that the narrow 
entrance to the adytum was choked with rubbish. The Turkish governor was 
afraid of a popular commotion if he gave permission for cleansing this 
aperture. Mr. Cripps, however, introduced the whole length of his body into 
the cavity, and by thrusting a long pole before him found it utterly 
stopped. The waters of Lathe and Muemosyne at present supply the washer-
women of Lebadaea.
     Oracles of Delos and Branchus. - The oracle of " Delos," 
notwithstanding its high reputation, had few peculiarities its virtue was 
derived from the nativity of Apollo and Diana in that island. At Dindyma, or 
Didyma, near Miletus, Apollo presided over the oracle of the " Branchi-dae," 
so called from either one of his sons or of his favourites Branchus of 
Thessaly, whom he instructed in soothsaying while alive, and canonized after 
death. The responses were given by a priestess who bathed and fasted for 
three days before consultation, and then sat upon an axle or bar, with a 
charming-rod in her hand, and inhaling the steam from a hot spring. 
Offerings and ceremonies were necessary to render the inspiration effectual, 
including baths, fasting, and solitude, and lamblichus censures those who 
despise them.
     Oracle of the Clarian Apollo at Colophon.-Of the oracle of Apollo at 
Colophon, lamblichus relates that it prophesied by drinking of water. " It 
is known that a subterranean spring exists there, from which the prophet 
drinks; after be has done so, and has performed many consecrations and 
sacred customs on certain nights, he predicts the future; but he is 
invisible to all who are present. That this water can induce prophecy is 
clear, but how it happens, no one knows, says the proverb."  It might appear 
that the divine spirit pervades this water, but it is not so. God is in all 
things, and is reflected in this spring, thereby giving it the prophetic 
power. This inspiration of the water is not of an entirely divine nature, 
for it only prepares us
and purifies the light of the soul, so that we are fit to receive the divine 
spirit. There the divine presence is of such a nature that it punishes every 
one who is capable of receiving the god. The soothsayer uses this spirit 
like a work-tool over which he has no control. After the moment of pre-
diction he does not always remember that which has passed; often he can 
scarcely collect his faculties. Long before the water-drinking, the 
soothsayer must abstain day and night from food, and observe religious 
customs, which are impossible to ordinary people, by which means he is made 
capable of receiving the god. It is only in this manner that he is able to 
hold the mirror of his soul to the radiance of free inspiration."
     Oracle of Amphiaraus.-Another very celebrated oracle was that of 
Amphiaraus, who distinguished himself so much in the Theban war. He was 
venerated at Oropus, in Boeotia, as a seer. This oracle was consulted more 
in sick-ness than on any other occasion. The applicants had here, also, to 
lie upon the skin of a sacrificed ram, and during sleep had the remedies of 
their diseases revealed to them. Not only, however, were sacrifices and 
lustrations per-formed here, but the priests prescribed other preparations 
by which the minds of the sleepers were to be enlightened. They had to fast 
one day, and refrain from wine three. Amphilochus, as son of Amphiaraus, had 
a similar oracle at Mallos, in Cilicia, which Pausanias calls the most 
trust-worthy and credible of the age. Plutarch speaks of the oracles of 
Amphilochus and Mopsus as being in a very flourishing state; and Lucian 
mentions that all those who wished to question the oracle had to lay down 
two oboles.
     Egyptian Oracles.-The oracles of Ancient Egypt were as numerous as 
those of Greece. It must have been due to foreign influence that the oracle, 
that played so important a part in the Greek world at this time, was also 
thoroughly established on the banks of the Nile. Herodotus knew of no fewer 
than seven gods in Egypt who spake by oracles, Of these, the most reliable 
was considered to give an intimation of their intentions by means of 
remarkable events. These are carefully observed by the Egyptians, who write 
down what follows upon these prodigies. They also consider that the fate of 
a person is fixed by the day of his birth, for every day belongs to a 
special god.  The oracle of Jupiter Ammon at the oasis of that name and the 
same deity at Thebes existed from the twentieth to the twenty-second 
Dynasty. He was consulted not only con-cerning the fate of empires but upon 
such trifling matters as the identification of a thief. In all serious 
matters, however, it was sought to ascertain his views. Those about to make 
their wills sought his oracle, and judgments were ratified by his word.
     “According to the inscriptions, intercourse between king and god was 
arranged as follows -The King present himself before the god and preferred a 
direct question, so framed as to admit of an answer by simple yes or no; in 
reply the god nodded an affirmative, or shook his head in negation.  This 
has suggested the idea that the oracles were worked by manipulating statues 
of divinities mechan-ically set in motion by the priests. But as yet no such 
statues have been found in the Valley of the Nile, and con-trivances of this 
kind could have had no other object than to deceive the people,-a 
supposition apparently excluded in this case by the fact that it was 
customary for the king to visit the god alone and in secret. Probably the 
king presented himself on such occasions before the sacred animal in which 
the god was incarnate, believing that the divine will would be manifested by 
it movements."
     The Apis bull also possessed oracles. Bes, too, god of pleasure or of 
the senses, had an oracle at Abydos.
     American Oracles.-Among the American races the oracle was frequently 
encountered. All the principal gods of aboriginal America universally act as 
oracles. With the ancient inhabitants of Peru, the huillcas partook of the 
nature of oracles. Many of these were serpents, trees, and rivers, the 
noises made by which appeared to the primitive Peruvians-as, indeed, they do 
to primitive folk all over the world-to be of the quality of articulate 
speech. Both the Huillcamayu and the Apurimac rivers at Cuzco were huillca 
oracles of this kind, as their names, ' Huillca-river "  and  "Great 
Speaker," denote.  These oracles often set the mandate of the Inca himself 
at defiance, occasionally supporting popular opinion  against his policy.
     The Peruvian Indians of the Andes range within recent generations 
continued to adhere to the superstitions they had inherited from their 
fathers. A rare and interesting account of these says that they "admit an 
evil being, the inhabitant of the centre of the earth, whom they consider as 
the author of their misfortunes, and at the mention of whose name they 
tremble.  The most shrewd among them take advantage of this belief to obtain 
respect, and represent themselves as his delegates.  Under the denomination 
of mohanes, or agoreros, they are consulted even on the most trivial 
occasions. They preside over the intrigues of love, the health of the 
community, and the taking of the field. Whatever repeatedly occurs to defeat 
their prognos-tics, falls on themselves; and they are wont to pay for their 
deceptions very dearly. They chew a species of vegetable called piripiri, 
and throw it into the air, accom-panying this act by certain recitals and 
incantations, to injure some, to. benefit others, to procure rain and the 
inun-dation of rivers, or, on the other hand, to occasion settled weather, 
and a plentiful store of agricultural productions. Any such result, having 
been casually verified on a single occasion, suffices to confirm the Indians 
in their faith, although they may have been cheated a thousand times.
     There is an instance on record of how the huillca could refuse on 
occasion to recognise even royalty itself. Manco, the Inca who had been 
given the kingly power by Pizarro, offered a sacrifice to one of these 
oracular shrines. The oracle refused to recognise him, through the medium of 
its guardian priest, stating that Manco was not the rightful Inca. Manco 
therefore caused the oracle, which was in the shape of a rock, to be thrown 
down, whereupon its guardian spirit emerged in the form of a parrot and flew 
away. It is probable that the bird thus liberated had been taught by the 
priests to answer to the questions of those who came to consult the shrine.  
But we learn that on Manco com-manding that the parrot should be pursued it 
sought another rock, which opened to receive it, and the spirit of the 
huillca was transferred to this new abode.
     Like the greater idols of Mexico, most of the principal hua-cas of Peru 
seem to have been also oracles. The guardians of the great speaking huacas 
appear to have exercised in virtue of their office an independent influence 
which was sometimes sufficiently powerful to resist the 
Apu-Ccapac--Inca himself. It was perhaps natural that they should be the 
exponents of the popular feeling which supported them, rather than of the 
policy of the sovereign chiefs, whose interest it was to suppress them : 
there was even a tradition that the Huillac-umu, a venerable huillac whom 
the rest acknowledged as their head, had in old times possessed jurisdiction 
over the supreme war-chiefs.
     Many Indian tribes employ fetishes as oracles, and among the ancient 
Mexicans practically all the great gods were oracular.


Orbas : The name given by the French to a species of metallic electrum. 
According to Pliny a vessel of this substance has a certain magical 
property; when it is filled with liquor is discovers poison by showing semi-
circles like rainbows, while the fluid sparkles and biases as if on the
fire.  The occult qualities of electrum are of a tell-tale nature.

Ornithomancy is the Greek work for augury, the method of divination by the 
flight or the song of birds, which, with the Romans, became a part of their 
national religion, and had a distinct priesthood.  For this reason it is 
treated in the separate article.

Orton: Alluded to by Froissart as the familiar of the Lord of Corasse, near 
Orthes. A clerk whom his lordship had wronged set this spirit the task of 
tormenting his superior, but by fair words the Lord of Corasse won him over 
to himself so that Orton became his familiar. Nightly Orton would shake his 
pillow and waken him to tell him the news of the world. Froissart says of 
their connection
     “So Orton continued to serve the Lord of Corasse for a long time. I do 
not know whether he had more than one master, but, every week, at night, 
twice or thrice. he visited his master, and related to him the events which 
had happened in the different countries he had traversed, and the lord of 
Corasse wrote of them to the Count of Foix, who took a great pleasure in 
them, for he was the man in all the world who most willingly heard news of 
strange countries.
     "Now it happened that the Lord of Corasse, as on other nights, was 
lying in his bed in his chamber by the side of his wife, who had become 
accustomed to listen to Orton without any alarm.  Orton came, and draw away 
the lord's pub's'.', for he was fast asleep, and his lord awoke, and cried, 
' Who is this ? '  He answered, ' It is I, Orton.'  ' And whence comest 
thou?' ' I come from Prague, in Bohemia.' 'And how far from hence is this 
Prague, in Bohemia ?' ' Why,' said he, 'about sixty days' journey.' 'And 
thou hast come so quickly? '  ‘Faith, I go as quickly as the wind, or even 
swifter.' ' And thou hast wings?' ' Faith, none. 'How then canst thou fly so 
quickly? '  Orton replied-It does not concern thee to know.'  ' Nay,' said 
he, ' I shall be very glad to know what fashion and form thou art of,' Orton 
answered, ' It does not concern thee to know; it is sufficient that I come 
hither, and bring thee sure and certain news.'   By G-, Orton,' exclaimed 
the lord of Corasse, ' I should love thee better if I had seen thee.' Since 
you have so keen a desire to see me,' said Orton ' the first thing thou 
shalt see and encounter to-morrow morning, when you rise from your bed, 
shall be-I.'  ' That is enough,' said the Lord of Corasse.  ' Go, therefore; 
I give thee leave for this night.'
     “When the morrow came, the Lord of Corasse began to rise, but the lady 
was so affrighted that she fell sick and could not get up that morning, and 
she said to her lord, who did not wish her to keep her bed, ' See if thou 
seest Orton. By my faith, I neither wish, if it please God, to see nor 
encounter him.'  ' But I do,' said the Lord of Corasse He leapt all nimbly 
from his bed, and seated himself upon the edge, and waited there to see 
Orton, hut saw nothing. Then he went to the windows and threw them upon that 
he might see more clearly about the room, but he saw nothing, so that he 
could say, ' This is Orton.' The day passed, the night returned. When the 
Lord of Corasse was in his bed asleep, Orton came, and began speaking in his 
wonted manner.   Go, go,' said his master, 'thou art a fibber: thou didst 
promise to show me to-day who thou wert, and thou hast not done so.'  ' 
Nay,' said he, 'but I did.' Thou didst not.' 'And didst thou not see 
anything,' inquired Orton, 'when thou didst leap out of bed?' The Lord of 
Corasse thought a little while, and said-' Yes, while sitting on my bed, and 
thinking of thee, I saw two long straws upon the pavement, which turned 
towards each other and played about.'  ' And that was I,' cried Orton; ' I 
had assumed that form.'  Said the Lord of Corasse: ' It does not content me: 
I pray thee change thyself into some other form, so that I may see and know 
thee.'  Orton replied : ' You will act so that you will lose me.' ' Not so, 
'said the Lord of Corasse: ' When I have once seen you, I shall not want to 
see you ever again.' 'Then,' said Orton, 'you shall see me to-morrow; and 
remember that the first thing you shall see upon leaving your chamber, will 
be I.'  ' Be it so,' replied the Lord of Corasse. ' Begone with you, 
therefore, now. I give thee leave, for I wish to sleep.'
     "Orton departed. When the morrow came, and at the third hour, the Lord 
of Corasse was up and attired in his usual fashion, he went forth from his 
chamber into a gallery that looked upon the castle-court. He cast therein 
his glances, and the first thing he saw was the largest sow he had ever 
seen; but she was so thin she seemed nothing but skin and bones, and she had 
great and long teats, pendant and quite attenuated, and a long and inflamed 
snout. The Sire de Corasse marvelled very much at this sow, and looked at 
her in anger, and exclaimed to his people, ' Go quickly, bring the dogs 
hither, and see that this Sow be well hunted.'  The varlets ran nimbly, 
threw open the place where the dogs lay, and set them at the sow. The sow 
heaved a loud cry, and looked up at the Lord of Corasse, who supported 
himself upon a pillar buttress in front of his chamber. She was seen no more 
afterwards, for she vanished, nor did any one note what became of her. The 
Sire de Corrasse returned into his chamber pensively, and bethought himself 
of Orton, and said, ' I think that I have seen my familiar; I repent me that 
I set my dogs upon him, for I doubt if I shall ever behold him again, since 
he has several times told me that as soon as I should provoke him I should 
lose him, and he would return no more.'  He spoke truly; never again did 
Orton return to the Lord of Corasse, and the knight died in the following 
year."


Ostiaks : (See Siberia.)


Oupnekhat, The: The Oupnekhat or Oupnekhata (Book of the Secret) written in 
Persian, gives the following instructions for the production of visions. " 
To produce the wise Maschqgui (vision), we must sit on a four-cornered base, 
namely the heels, and then close the gates of the body. The ears by the 
thumbs; the eyes by the forefingers; the nose by the middle; the lips by the 
four other fingers. The lamp within the body will then be preserved from 
wind and movement, and the whole body will be full of light. Like the 
tortoise, man must withdraw every sense within himself; the heart must be 
guarded, and then Brahma will enter into him, like fire and lightning.  In 
the great fire in the cavity of the heart a small flame will be lit up, and 
in its centre is Atma (the soul) ; and he who destroys all worldly desires 
and wisdom will be like a hawk which has broken through the meshes of the 
net, and will have become one with the great being." Thus will he become 
Brahma--Atma (divine spirit), and will perceive by a light that far exceeds 
that of the sum. " Who, therefore, enters this path be Brahma must deny the 
world and its pleasures; must only cover his nakedness, and staff in hand 
collect enough, but no more, alms to maintain life. The lesser ones only do 
this; the greater throw aside pitcher and. staff, and do not even read the 
Oupnekhata."


Owen, Robert: An early convert to spiritualism. He had. been for many years 
an advanced socialist, and though at the time he embraced the spiritualistic 
doctrines-1853-he was already in his eighty-third year, he preached the new 
faith with undiminished vigour and with characteristic scorn of caution. 
Having first published his views in his periodical, the Rational Quarterly 
Review, he brought out, in 1854, the New Existence of Man upon Earth, at 
this period the only English paper devoted to the interests of spiritualism. 
Owen's view of the movement was that it was the  inauguration of a sort of 
millennium, a social revolution, for which he had looked throughout his 
life.



P

Paigoels, The: The devils of Hindustan. Some of the Hindus believe that the 
Paigoels were originally created devils others that they were put out of 
heaven because of their great sin, and of all worlds that the earth is the 
only one with which they are allowed intercourse. Some of these devils have 
individual names, and are the tempters of men to special sins, - others 
again enter into the bodies of men and take possession of them. The Hindus 
also believe that the souls of wicked men go to join the number of the 
paigoels.


Palingenesy : A term employed by the philosophers of the seventeenth century 
to denote the 't resurrection of plants," and the method of achieving their 
astral appearance after destruction; In very early times, we find 
philosophers inclined to doubt if apparitions might not be accounted for on 
natural principles, without supposing that a belief in them was either 
referable to hallucinations, to human imagination, or to impositions that 
might have been practised. At length Lucretius attacked the popular notion 
entertained of ghosts, by maintaining that they were not spirits returned 
from the mansions of the dead, but nothing more than thin films, pellicles, 
or membranes, cast off from the surface of all bodies like the exuviae or 
sloughs of reptiles.
     An opinion, by no means dissimilar. to that of the Epicu-reans, was 
revived in Europe about the middle of the 17th century. It had its origin in 
Palingenesy, or the resurrec-tion of plants, a grand secret known to Digby, 
Kircher, Schot, Gaflerel, Vallemont, and others. These philosophers. 
performed the operation of Palingenesy after the following manner:-They took 
a plant, bruised it, burnt it, collected its ashes, and, in the process of 
calcination, extracted from it a salt. This salt they then put into a glass 
phial, and mixed with it some peculiar substance, which these chemists have 
not disclosed. When the compound was formed, it was pulverulent, and 
possessed a bluish colour. The powder was next submitted to a gentle heat, 
when its particles being instantly put into motion, there then, gradually 
arose, as from the midst of the ashes, a stem, leaves and flowers; or, in 
other words, an apparition of the plant which had been submitted to 
combustion. But as soon as the heat was taken away, the form of the plant, 
which had been thus sublimed, was precipitated to the bottom of the vessel. 
Heat was then re-applied, and the vegetable phoenix was resusitated; it was 
withdrawn, and the form once more became latent among the ashes. This 
notable experiment was said to have been performed before the Royal Society 
of England, and it satisfactorily proved to this learned body, that the 
presence of heat gave a sort of life to the vegetable apparition, and that 
the absence of caloric caused its death.
     Cowley was quite delighted with the experiment of the rose and its 
ashes, and in conceiving that he had detected the same phenomenon in the 
letters written with the juice of lemons, which were revived on the 
application of heat, he celebrated the mystic power of caloric after the 
follow-ing manner:-

Strange power of heat, thou yet dost show,
Like winter earth, naked, or cloth'd with snow,
But as the quick'ning sun approaching near,
The plants arise up by degrees,
A sudden paint adorns the trees,
And all kind nature's characters appear.
So nothing yet in thee is seen,
But when a genial heat warms thee within,
A new-born wood of various lines there grows;
Here buds an A, and there a B,
Here sprouts a V, and there a T,
And all the flourishing letters stand in rows.

     The rationale of this famous experiment made on the ashes of roses was 
attempted by Kircher.  He supposed that the seminal virtue of every known 
substance, and even its substantial form, resided in its salt.  This salt 
was concealed in the ashes of the rose.  Heat put it in motion.  The 
particles of the salt were quickly sublimed, and being moved about in the 
phial like a vortex, at length arranged themselves in the same general form 
they had possessed from nature.  It was evident, then, from the result of 
this experiment, that there was a tendency in the particles of the salt to 
observe the same order of position which they had in the living plant.  
Thus, for instance, each saline corpuscle, which in its prior state bad held 
a place in the stem of the rose-slip, sympathetically fixed itself in a 
corresponding position when sublimed in the chemist's vial.  Other particles 
were subject to a similar law, and accordingly, by a disposing affinity, 
resumed their proper position, either in the stalk, the leaves, or the 
flowers, and thus, at length, the entire apparition of a plant was 
generated.
     The next object of these philosophers was to apply their doctrine to 
the explanation of the popular belief in ghosts. As it was incontestably 
proved that the substantial form of each body resided in a sort of volatile 
salt, it was perfectly evident in what manner superstitious notions must 
have arisen about ghosts haunting churchyards.  When a dead body had been 
committed to the earth, the salts of it, during the heating process of 
fermentation, were exhaled. The saline particles then each resumed the same 
relative situation they had held in the living body, and thus a complete 
human form was induced, calculated to excite superstitious fear in the minds 
of all but Palingenesists.
     It is thus evident that Palingenesy was nothing more Lucretius had 
made, with regard to the filmy substances than a chemical explanation of the 
discovery which that he bad observed to arise from all bodies.
     Yet, in order to prove that apparitions might be really explained on 
this principle, the experimentum crucis was still wanting.  But this 
deficiency was soon supplied. Three alchemists had obtained a quantity of 
earth-mould from St. Innocent's Church, in Paris, supposing that this matter 
might contain the true philosopher's stone.  They subjected it to a 
distillatory process.  On a sudden they perceived in their vials forms of 
men produced, which immediately caused them to desist from their labours. 
This fact coming to the knowledge of the Institute of Paris, under the 
protection of Louis XIV., this learned body took up the business with much 
seriousness, and the result of their labours appears in the Miscellania 
Curiosa. Dr. Ferrier, in a volume of the Manchester Philosophical 
Transactions, went to the trouble of making an abstract of one of these 
French documents, which we prefer giving on account of its conciseness, 
rather than having recourse to the original dissertation.
     “A malefactor was executed, of whose body a grave physician got 
possession for the purpose of dissection. After disposing of the other parts 
of the body, he ordered his assistant to pulverize part of the cranium, 
which was a remedy at that time admitted in dispensatories. The powder was 
left in a paper on the table of the museum, where the assistant slept. About 
midnight he was awakened by a noise in the room, which obliged him to rise 
immediately. The noise continued about the table, without any visible agent; 
and at length he traced it to the powder, in the midst of which he now 
beheld, to his unspeakable dismay, a small head with open eyes staring at 
him; presently two branches appeared, which formed into arms and hands; then 
the ribs became visible, which were soon clothed with muscles and 
integuments;  next the lower extremities sprouted out, and when they 
appeared perfect, the puppet (for his size was small) reared himself on his 
feet; instantly his clothes came upon him, and he appeared in the very cloak 
he wore at his execution.  The affrighted spectator, who stood hitherto 
mumbling his prayers with great appli-cation, now thought of nothing but 
making his escape from the revived ruffian; but this was impossible, for the 
apparition planted himself in the way, and, after divers fierce looks and 
threatening gestures, opened the door and went out.  No doubt the powder was 
missing next day."
     But older analogous results are on record, indicating that the blood 
was the chief part of the human frame in which those saline particles 
resided, the arrangements of which gave rise to the popular notion of 
ghosts.  Dr. Webster, in his book on witchcraft, relates an experiment. 
given on the authority of Dr. Flud, in which this very satisfactory 
conclusion was drawn.
     "A certain chymical operator, by name La Pierre, near that place in 
Paris called Le Temple, received blood from the hands of a certain bishop to 
operate upon. Which he setting to work upon the Saturday, did continue it 
for a week with divers degrees of fire.  But about midnight, the Friday 
following, this artificer, lying in a chamber next to his laboratory, 
betwixt sleeping and waking, heard a horrible noise, like unto the lowing of 
kine, or the roaring of a lion; and continuing quiet, after the ceasing of 
the sound in the laboratory, the moon being at the full, and, by shining 
enlightening the chamber suddenly, betwixt himself and the window he saw a 
thick little cloud, condensed into an oval form, which, after, by little and 
little, did seem com-pletely to put on the shape of a man, and making 
another and a sharp clamour, did suddenly vanish.  And not only some noble 
persons in the next chambers, but also the host with his wife, lying in a 
lower room of the house, and also the neighbours dwelling in the opposite 
side of the street, did distinctly hear as well the bellowing as the voice; 
and some of them were awaked with the vehemency thereof.  But the artificer 
said, that in this he found solace, because the bishop, of whom he had it, 
did admonish him, that if any 0£ them from whom the blood was extracted 
should die, in the time of its putrefaction, his spirit was wont often to 
appear to the sight of the artificer, with per-turbation.  Also forthwith, 
upon Saturday following, he took the retort from the furnace, and broke it 
with the light stroke of a little key, and there, in the remaining blood, 
found the perfect representation of an human head, agreeable in face, eyes, 
nostrils, mouth, and hairs, that were somewhat thin, and of a golden 
colour."
     Regarding this narrative Webster adds :-" There were many ocular 
witnesses, as the noble person, Lord of Bour-dalone, the chief secretary to 
the Duke of Guise; and he (Flud) bad this relation from the Lord of 
Menanton, living in that house at the same time, from a certain doctor of 
physic, from the owner of the house, and many others."

Palladino, Eusapia  The most famous physical medium of recent years, and one 
whose phenomena, investigated at length by some of the most distinguished 
scientists of Britain, France, and Italy, have led many to conclude that 
they are genuine manifestations from the spirit world, or that they 
illustrate the workings of some unknown force. Eusapia was a Neapolitan 
peasant woman who from her childhood had shown herself possessed of 
mediumistic powers. In 1892 a group of scientist - Professors Schia-parelli, 
Broffeno, Geroso, the well-known spiritualist M. Aksakoff, and others-held a 
series of sittings at Milan, with Eusapia as medium. Some of the seances 
were also attended by Professors Richet and Lombroso. The phenomena 
consisted of raps, materialisation of hands, levitation of the table and 
other furniture within a radius of three or four feet, and fluctuation of 
the medium's weight in the balance, to the extent of some I 71b5. It was 
evident even then that Eusapia would not lose an opportunity of using fraud. 
Nevertheless Professor Richet was so impressed that in 1894 he organised a 
further series of sittings with the same medium at his house on the Ile 
Rouband, and on this occasion were present Professor-now Sir Oliver-Lodge, 
Mr. Myers, Dr. Ochorowicz, and at a later stage, Professor and Mrs. 
Sidgwick. The seances were held in darkness or semi-darkness, but the 
medium's hands and feet were controlled by the investigators. Mrs. Sidgwick, 
indeed, declared that Eusapia herself might easily have produced the 
phenomena, if she had the use of her hands, but Professor Lodge and others 
were inclined to attribute them to some external agency. In the following 
year further seances were held at Mr. Myer's house at Cambridge, and when it 
became evident that Eusapia frequently freed a foot or a hand Mr. Myer's own 
faith in the phenomena was temporarily-though only temporarily-destroyed. 
Professor Richet and Sir Oliver Lodge, however, retained their convictions 
unshaken. Dr. Hodgson, who had already suggested that Eusapia might use some 
such method, was also present at the Cambridge sittings. Besides the already 
mentioned, many prominent Con-tinental scientists investigated Eusapia's 
manifestations among them being M. Camille Flammarion. Professor Morselli, 
and M. and Mme. Curie. The two last mentioned were members of a committee of 
the lnstitut General Psycholo-gique of Paris, which held an important series 
of sittings with the medium in 1905, 1906, and 1907. In 1908 and 1909 again, 
the Society for Psychical Research instituted a fresh enquiry into Eusapia's 
methods. On the whole, scientific opinion is still much divided as to the 
genuineness or otherwise of the phenomena. Some authorities, taking into 
consideration the many times the Italian medium has been caught cheating, 
and the absense of really conclusive tests, incline to the belief that 
Eusapia is merely a clever conjurer.  Such were Dr. Hodgson, Mr. Podmore, 
Professor and Mrs. Sidgwick.  Others, again, such as Professors Richet and 
Lombroso, M. Camille Flammarion and Sir Oliver Lodge, are of the opinion 
that the instances of fraud are mere incidents in the career of a true 
medium, whose performances plainly demonstrate the operation in the material 
world of strange, unknown forces.

Palladium : (See Devil-worship.)


Palladium, Order of: A masonic-diabolic order, also entitled the Sovereign-
Council of Wisdom, founded in Paris on May 20th, 1737.  It initiated women 
under the name of companions of Penelope. The fact that it existed is proved 
by the circumstance that Ragou, the Masonic antiquary, published its ritual.


Palmistry  The science of divination by means of lines and marks on the 
human hand.  It is said to have been practised in very early times by the 
Brahmins of India, and to be known to Aristotle, who discovered a treatise 
on the subject written in letters of gold, which he presented 10 Alexander 
the Great, and which was afterwards translated into Latin by Hispanus. There 
is also extant a work on the subject by Melampus of Alexandria, and 
Hippocrates, Galen, and several Arabian commentators have also dealt with 
it,  In the Middle Ages the science was represented by Hartlieb (circa 
1448), and Codes (circa 1054), and Fludd, Indigane, Rothmann, and many 
others wrote on cheiromancy. D'Ar-pentigny, Desbarolles, Carus, and others 
kept the science alive in the earlier half of the nineteenth century, since 
when a very large number of treatises upon it have been written. Since i860, 
or thereabouts, palmistry has become very much more popular than ever before 
in these islands, and indeed is practised nearly all over the habitable 
globe.
     Palmistry is sub-divided into three lesser arts-cheirog-nomy, 
cheirosophy and cheiromancy.  The first is the art of recognising the type 
of intelligence from the form of the hands; the second is the study of the 
comparative value of manual formations; and the third is the art of 
divination from the form of the hand and fingers, and the lines and markings 
thereon. The palmist first of all studies the shape and general formation of 
the hand as a whole, afterwards regarding its parts and details,-the lines 
and markings being considered later. From cheirognomy and cheirosophy the 
general disposition and tendencies are ascertained, and future events are 
foretold from the reading of the lines and markings.
     There are several types of hands: the elementary or large-palmed type; 
the necessary with spatulated fingers; the artistic with conical-shaped 
fingers ; the useful, the fingers of which are square-shaped; the knotted or 
phil-osophical; the pointed, or psychic; and the mixed, in which the .types 
are blended. The principal lines are: those which separate the hand from the 
forearm at the wrist, and which are known as the rascettes, or the lines of 
health, wealth and happiness. The line of life stretches from the centre of 
the palm around the base of the thumb almost to the wrist, and is joined for 
a considerable part of its course by the line of the head. The line of the 
heart runs across two-thirds of the palm, above the head line; and the line 
of fate between it and the line of the head. nearly at right angles 
extending towards the wrist. The line of fortune runs from the base of the 
third finger towards the wrist parallel to the line of fate. If the lines 
are deep, firm and of narrow width the significance is good - excepting that 
a strong line of health shows constitutional weakness.
     At the base of the fingers, beginning with the first, lie the mounts of 
Jupiter, Saturn, Apollo, and Mercury; at the base of the thumb the mount of 
Venus; and opposite to it, that of Luna. If well-proportioned they show cer-
tain virtues, but if exaggerated they indicate the vices which correspond to 
these. The first displays religion, reasonable ambition, or pride and 
superstition; the second wisdom and prudence, or ignorance and failure; the 
third when large makes for success and intelligence, when small for meanness 
or love of obscurity; the fourth desire for knowledge and industry, or 
disinterestedness and laziness. The Lunar mount indicates sensitiveness, 
imagination, morality or otherwise; and self-will: and the mount of Venus, 
charity and affection, or if exaggerated viciousness. The phalanges of the 
fingers are also indicative of certain faculties. For example, the first and 
second of the thumb, according to their length, indicate the value of the 
logical faculty and of the will; those of the index finger in their order-
materialism, law, and order; of the middle finger-humanity, system, 
intelligence; of the third finger-truth economy, energy; and of the little 
finger goodness, pru-dence, reflectiveness. There are nearly a hundred other 
marks and signs, by which certain qualities, influences or events can be 
recognised. The line of life by its length indicates the length of existence 
of its owner. If it is short in both hands, the life will be a short one; if 
broken in one hand and weak in the other, a serious illness is denoted. If 
broken in both hands, it means death. If it is much chained it means 
delicacy.  If it has a second or sister line, it shows great vitality.  A 
black spot on the line shows illness at the time marked. A cross indicates 
some fatality. The line of life coming out far into the palm is a sign of 
long life. The line of the head, if long and well-coloured, denotes 
intelligence and power. If descending to the mount of the Moon it shows that 
the head is much influenced by the imagination.  Islands on the line denote 
mental troubles.  The head line forked at the end indicates subtlety and a 
facility for seeing all sides of the question.  A double line of the head is 
an indication of good fortune.  The line of the heart should branch towards 
the mount of Jupiter.  If it should pass over the mount of Jupiter  to  the  
edge  of  the hand and travel round the index finger, it is called " Solo-
mon's ring" and indicates ideality and romance; it is also a sign of occult 
power.  Points or dots in this line may show illness if black, and if white 
love affairs; while islands on the heart line indicate disease.  The line of 
fate, or Saturn, if it rises from the Lunar mount and ascends towards the 
line of the heart is a sign of a rich marriage.  If it extends into the 
third phalange of Saturn's finger it shows the sinister influence of that 
planet.  A double line of fate is ominous.
     In such an article as this it would be out of place to mention the very 
numerous lesser lines and marks which the hand contains, especially when so 
many excellent books of reference on the subject have recently been 
published. It but remains to say that practitioners of the science of 
palmistry are execeedingly numerous.  Some of these work on strictly 
scientific lines, while others pick it up in a merely empirical way, and 
their forecasts of events to come are only so much  patter."

Paracelsus  In the history of alchemy there is not a more striking or 
picturesque figure than Auroelus Philippus Theophrastus Paracelsus Bombast 
von Hohenheim, the illustrious physician and exponent of the hermetic 
philoso-phy who has chosen to go down to fame under the name of Paracelsus.  
He was born at Einsideln, near Zurich, in the year 1493.  His father, the 
natural son of a prince, himself practised the " art of medicine," and was 
desirous that his only son should follow the same profession.  To the 
fulfillment of that desire was directed the early training of Paracelsus-a 
training which fostered his imaginative rather than his practical 
tendencies, and which first cast his mind into the alchemical mould.  It did 
not take him long to discover that the medical traditions of the time were 
hut empty husks from which all substance had long since dried away.  " I 
considered with myself," he says, that if there were no teacher of medicine 
in the world, how would I set about to learn the art ?  No otherwise than in 
the great open book of nature, written with the finger of God."  Having thus 
freed himself from the constraining bonds of an outworn medical orthodoxy, 
whose chief resources were bleeding, purging, and emetics, he set about 
evolving a new system to replace the old, and in order that he might study 
the book of nature to better advantage he travelled extensively from 1513 to 
1524, visiting almost every part of the known world, studying metallurgy, 
chemistry, and medicine, and consorting with vagabonds of every description.  
He was brought before the Cham of Tartary, conversed with the magicians of 
Egypt and Arabia, and is said to have even reached India. At length his 
protracted wanderings came to a close, and in 1524 he settled in Basle, then 
a favourite resort of scholars and physicians, where he was appointed to 
fill the chair of medicine at the University. Never had Basle witnessed a 
more brilliant, erratic professor. His inflated language, his eccentric 
behaviour, the splendour of his conceptions flashing through a fog of 
obscurity, at once attracted and repelled, and gained for him friends and 
enemies. His antipithy to the Galenic school became ever more pro-nounced, 
and the crisis came when he publicly burned the works of Galen and Avicenna 
in a brazen vase into which he had cast nitre and sulphur.  By such a 
proceeding he incurred the hatred of his more conservative brethren, and cut 
himself off for ever from the established school of medicine.  He continued 
his triumphant career, however, till a conflict with the magistrates brought 
it to an abrupt close, He was forced to flee from Basle, and thereafter 
wandered from place to place, gaining a living as best he might. An element 
of mystery surrounds the manner of his death, which took place in 1541, but 
the best authenticated account states that he was poisoned at the 
instigation of the medical faculty.
     But interesting as were the events of his life, it is to his work that 
most attention is due.  Not only was he the founder of the modern science of 
medicine; the magnetic theory of Mesmer, the " astral" theory of modern 
spiritualists, the philosophy of Descartes, were all foreshadowed in the 
fantastic, yet not always illogical, teaching of Paracel-sus. He revived the 
" microcosmic " theory of ancient Greece, and sought to prove the human body 
analogous to the Solar System, by establishing a connection between the 
seven organs of the body and the seven planets. He preached the doctrines of 
the efficacy of will-power and the imagination in such words as these: " It 
is possible that my spirit, without the help of my body, and through an 
ardent will alone, and without a sword, can stab and wound others.  It is 
also possible that I can bring the spirit of my adversary into an image and 
then fold him up or lame him at my pleasure." " Resolute imagination is the 
beginning of all magical operations." " Because men do not perfectly believe 
and imagine, the result is, that arts are uncertain when they might be 
wholly certain." The first principle of his doctrine is the extraction of 
the quintessence, or philosophic mercury, from every material body. He 
believed that if the quintessence were drawn from each animal, plant, and 
mineral, the combined result would equal the universal spirit, or " astral 
body" in man, and that a draught of the extract would renew his youth.  He 
came at length to the conclusion that "astral bodies" exercised a mutual 
influence on each other, and declared that he himself had communicated with 
the dead, and with living persons at a considerable distances. He was the 
first to connect this influence with that of the magnet, and to use the word 
"magnetism" with its present application.  It was on this foundation that 
Mesmer built his theory of magnetic influence. While Paracelsus busied 
himself with such problems, however, he did not neglect the study and 
practice of medicine.  Indeed, astrology and the magnet entered largely into 
his treatment. When he was sought by a patient, his first care was to 
consult the planets, where the disease had its origin, and if the patient 
were a woman he took it for granted that the cause of her malady lay in the 
moon.  His anticipation of the philosophy of Descartes, consisted in his 
theory that by bringing the various elements of the human body into harmony 
with the elements of nature - fire, light, earth, etc.-old age and death 
might be indefinitely postponed. His experiment in the extraction of its 
essential spirit from the poppy resulted in the production of laudanum, 
which he prescribed freely in the form of " three black pills." The recipes 
which he gives for the Philosopher's Stone, the Elixir of Life, and various 
universal remedies, are exceed-ingly obscure.    He is deservedly celebrated 
as the first physician to use opium and mercury, and to recognise the value 
of sulphur.  He applied himself also to the solution of a problem which 
still exercises the minds of scientific men-whether it is possible to 
produce life from inorganic matter,  Paracelsus asserted that it was, and 
has, left on record a quaint recipe for a homunculus, or artificial man. By 
a peculiar treatment of certain "spagyric substances" -which he has 
unfortunately omitted to specify-he declared that he could produce a perfect 
human child in. miniature.  Speculations such as these, medical, alchemical 
and philosophical, were scattered so profusely throughout his teaching that 
we are compelled to admit that here was a master-mind, a genius, who was a 
charlatan only incidentally, by reason of training and temperament.  Let it 
be remem-bered that he lived in an age when practically all scholars and 
physicians were wont to impose on popular ignorance, and we cannot but 
remark that Paracelsus displayed, under all his arrogant exterior, a curious 
singleness of purpose, and a real desire to penetrate the mysteries of 
science.  He has left on record the principal points of the philosophy on 
which he founded his researches in his 
"Archidoxa Medi-cinae."  It contains the leading rules of the art of 
healing, as he practised and preached them. "I had resolved," he says, "to 
give ten books to the ' Archidoxa,' but I have reserved the tenth in my 
head.  It is a treasure which men are not worthy to possess, and shall only 
be given to the world when they shall have abjured Aristotle, Avicenna, and 
Galen-, and promised a perfect submission to Paracelsus." The world did not 
recant, but Paracelsus relented, and at the entreaty of his disciples 
published this tenth book, the key to the nine others, but a key which might 
pass for a lock. and for a lock which we cannot even pick.  It is entitled 
the " Tenth Dooh of the Arch-Doctrines  or, On the Secret Mysteries of 
Nature."  A brief summary of it is as follows:-
     He begins by supposing and ends by establishing that there is a 
universal spirit infused into the veins of man, forming within us a species 
of invisible body, of which our visible body, which it directs and governs 
at its will, is but the wrapping-the casket.  This universal spirit is not 
simple-not more simple, for instance, than the number 100, which is a 
collection of units.  Where, then, are the spiritual units of which our 
complex spirit is composed ? Scattered in plants and minerals but 
principally in metals, There exists in these inferior productions of the 
earth a host of sub-spirits which sum themselves up in us, as the universe 
does in God.  So the science of the philosopher has simply to unite them to 
the body-to disengage them from the grosser matter which clogs and confines 
them, to separate the pure from the impure.
     To separate the pure from the impure is, in other words, to seize upon 
the soul of the heterogeneous bodies-to evolve their " predestined element," 
" the seminal essence of beings," " the first being, or quintessence."
     To understand this latter word " quintessence," it is needful for the 
reader to know that every body, whatever it may be, is composed of four 
elements, and that the essence compounded of these elements forms a fifth, 
which is the soul of the mixed bodies, or, in other words, its
mercury,"  " I have shown," says Paracelsus, "in my book of' Elements,' that 
the quintessence is the same thing as mercury.  There is in mercury whatever 
wise men seek."  That is, not the mercury of modern chemists, but a 
philosophical mercury of which every body has its own. 'There are as many 
mercuries as there are things.  The mercury of a vegetable, a mineral, or an 
animal of the same kind, although strongly resembling each other, does not 
precisely resemble another mercury, and it is for this reason that 
vegetables, minerals, and animals of the same species are not exactly alike. 
. . . The true mercury of philosophers is the radical humidity of each body, 
and its veritable semen, or essence."
     Paracelsus now sought for a plant worthy of holding in the vegetable 
kingdom the same rank as gold in the metallic-a plant whose " predestined 
element" should unite in itself the virtues of nearly all the vegetable 
essences Although this was not easy to distinguish, he recognised at a 
glance - we know not by what signs-the supremacy of excellence in the 
melissa, and first decreed to it that phar-maceutical crown which at a later 
period the Carmelites ought to have consecrated.  How he obtained this new 
specific may be seen in the Life of Paracelsus, by
Savarien:
     "He took some balm-mint in flower, which he had taken care to collect 
before the rising of the sun.  He pounded it in a mortar, reduced it to an 
impalpable dust, poured it into a long-necked vial which he sealed 
hermetically, and placed it to digest (or settle) for forty hours in a heap 
of horse-dung.  This time expired, he opened the vial, and found there a 
matter which he reduced into a fluid by pressing it, separating it from its 
impurities by exposure to the slow heat of a  bain-niarie.  The grosser 
parts sunk to the bottom, and he drew off the liqueur which floated on the 
top, filtering it through some cotton.  This liqueur having been poured into 
a bottle he added to it the fixed salt, which he had drawn from the same 
plant when dried.  There remained nothing more but to extract from this 
liqueur the first lief or being of the plant.  For this purpose Paracelsus 
mixed the liqueur with so much' water of salt' (understand by this the 
mercurial element or radical humidity of the salt), put it in a matrass, 
exposed it for six weeks to the sun, and finally, at the expiration of this 
term, discovered a last residuum which was decidedly, according to him, the 
first life or supreme essence of the plant.  But at all events, it is 
certain that what he found in his matrass was the genie or spirit he 
required; and with the surplus, if there were any, we need not concern 
ourselves."
     Those who may wish to know what this genie was like, are informed that 
it as exactly resembled, as two drops of water, the spirit of aromatic wine 
known to-day as absinthe suisse.  It was a liquid green as emerald,-green, 
the bright colour of hope and spring-time.  Unfortunately, it failed as a 
specific in the conditions indispensable for an elixir of immortality; but 
it was a preparation more than half-celestial, which almost rendered old age 
impossible.
     By means and manipulations as subtle and ingenious as those which he 
employed upon the melissa, Paracelsus did not draw, but learned to extract, 
the "predestined element" of plants which ranked much higher in the 
vegetable aristocracy,-the " first life"  of the gilly-flower, the cinnamon, 
the myrrh, the scammony, the celandine.  All these supreme essences, which, 
according to the 5th book of "Archidoxa," unite with a mass of “magisteries" 
as precious as they are rude, are the base of so many specifics, equally 
reparative and regenerative. This depends upon the relationship which exists 
between the temperament of a privileged plant and the temperament of the 
individual who asks of it his rejuvenescence.
      However brilliant were the results of his discoveries, those he 
obtained or those he thought he might obtain, they were for Paracelsus but 
the a b c of Magic.  To the eyes of so consummate an alchemist vegetable 
life is nothing; it is the mineral - the metallic life - which is all.  So 
we may assure ourselves that it was in his power to seize the first life-
principle of the moon, the sun, Mars, or Saturn; that is, of silver, gold, 
iron, or lead.  It was equally facile for him to. grasp the life of the 
precious stones, the bitumens. the sulphurs, and even that of animals.
     Paracelsus sets forth several methods of obtaining this great arcanum.  
Here is the shortest and most simple as recorded by Incola Francus
     “Take some mercury, or at least the element of mercury, separating the 
pure from the impure, and afterwards pounding it to perfect whiteness. Then 
you shall sublimate it with sal-ammoniac, and this so many times as may be 
necessary to resolve it into a fluid.  Calcine it, coagulate it, and again 
dissolve it, and let it strain in a pelican during a philosophic month, 
until it thickens and assumes the form of a hard substance.  Thereafter this 
form of stone is incombustible, and nothing can change or alter it; the 
metallic bodies which it penetrates become fixed and incombustible, for this 
material is incombustible, and changes the imperfect metals into metal 
perfect.  Although I have given the process in few words, the thing itself 
demands a long toil, and many difficult circumstances, which I have 
expressly omitted, not to weary the reader, who ought to be very diligent 
and intelligent if he wishes to arrive at the accomplishment of this great 
work."
     Paracelsus himself tells us in his " Archidoxa," when explaining his 
own recipe for the completion of it, and profiting by the occasion to 
criticise his fellow-workers.
     “I omit," he writes, " what I have said in different places on the 
theory of the stone; I will sy only that this arcanum does not consist in 
the blast (rouille) or flowers of antimony.  It must be sought in the 
mercury of antimony, which, when it is carried to perfection, is nothing 
else than the heaven of metals ; for even as the heaven gives life to plants 
and minerals, so does the pure quintessence of antimony vitrify everything.  
This is why the Deluge was not able to deprive any substance of its virtue 
or properties, for the heaven being the life of all beings, there is nothing 
superior to it which can modify or destroy it.
     "Take the antimony, purge it of its arsenical impurities in an iron 
vessel until the coagulated mercury of the antimony appears quite white, and 
is distinguishable by the star which appears in the superficies of the 
regulus, or semi-metal.  But although this regulus. which is the
-element of mercury, has in itself a veritable hidden life, nevertheless 
these things are in virtue, and not actually.
     “Therefore, if you wish to reduce the power to action, you must 
disengage the life which is concealed in it by a living fire like to itself 
or with a metallic vinegar. To discover this fire many philosophers have 
proceeded differently, but agreeing to the foundations of the art, have 
arrived at the desired end.  For some with great labour have drawn forth the 
quintessence of the thickened mercury of the regulus of antimony, and by 
this means have reduced to action the mercury of the antimony: others have 
considered that there was a uniform quintessence in the other minerals, as 
for example in the fixed sulphur of the vitriol, or the stone - of the 
magnet, and having extracted the quintessence, have - afterwards matured and 
exalted their heaven with it, and reduced it to action. Their process is 
good, and has had its result.  Meanwhile this fire-this corporeal life-which 
they seek with toil, is found much more easily and in much greater 
perfection in the ordinary mercury, which appears through its perpetual 
fluidity-a proof that it possesses a very powerful fire and a celestial life 
similar to that which lies hidden in the regulus of the antimony. Therefore, 
he who would wish to exalt our metallic heaven, starred, to its greatest 
completeness, and to reduce into action its potential virtues, he must first 
extract from ordinary mercury its - corporeal life, which is a celestial 
fire; that is to say the - quintessence of quicksilver, or, in other words, 
the metallic - vinegar, that has resulted from its dissolution in the water 
which originally produced it, and which is its own mother; that is to say, 
he must dissolve it in the arcanum of the salt I have described, and mingle 
it with the ' stomach of Anthion,' which is the spirit of vinegar, and in 
this menstruum melt and filter and consistent mercury of the antimony, 
strain it in the said liquor, and finally reduce it into crystals of a 
yellowish green, of which we have spoken in our manual."
     As regards the Philosopher's Stone, he gives the following formula
     “Take," said he, " the electric mineral not yet mature (antimony), put 
it in its sphere, in the fire with the iron, to remove its ordures and other 
superfluities, and purge it as much as you can, following the rules of 
chymistry, so that it may not suffer by the aforesaid impurities. Make, in a 
word, the regulus with the mark. This done, cause it to dissolve in the ' 
stomach of the ostrich' (vitriol), which springs from the earth and is 
fortified in its virtue by the sharpness of the eagle' (the metallic vinegar 
or essence of mercury).  As soon as the essence is perfected, and when after 
its dissolution it has taken the colour of the herb called calendule, do not 
forget to reduce it into a spiritual luminous essence, which resembles 
amber.  After this, add to it of the ' spread eagle' one half the weight of 
the election before its preparation, and frequently distil the 'stomach of 
the ostrich' into the matter, and thus the election will become much more 
spiritualized.  When the 'stomach of the ostrich' is weakened by the labour 
of digestion, we must strengthen it and frequently distil it. Finally, when 
it has lost all its impurity, add as much tartarized quintessence as will 
rest upon your fingers, until it throws off its impurity and rises with it.  
Repeat this process until the preparation becomes white, and this will 
suffice; for you shall see yourself as gradually it rises in the form of the 
' exalted eagle,' and with little trouble con-verts itself in its form (like 
sublimated mercury) ; and that is what we are seeking.
     “I tell you in truth that there is no greater remedy in medicine than 
that which lies in this election, and that there is nothing like it in the 
whole world.  But not to digress from my purpose, and not to leave this work 
imperfect, observe the manner in which you ought to operate."
     "The election then being destroyed, as I have said, to arrive at the 
desired end (which is, to make of it a universal medicine for human as well 
as metallic bodies), take your election, rendered light and volatile by the 
method above described.
     "Take of it as much as you would wish to reduce it to its perfection, 
and put it in a philosophical egg of glass, and seal it very tightly, that 
nothing of it may respire; put it into an athanor until of itself it 
resolves into a liquid, in such a manner that in the middle of this sea 
there may appear a small island, which daily diminishes, and finally, all 
shall be changed to a colour black as ink.  This colour is the raven, or 
bird which flies at night without wings, and which, through the celestial 
dew, that rising continually falls back by a constant circulation, changes 
into what is called ' the head of the raven,' and afterwards resolves into ' 
the tail of the peacock,' then it assumes the hue of the ' tail of a 
peacock,' and afterwards the colour of the feathers of a swan' ; finally 
acquiring an extreme redness, which marks its fiery nature, and in virtue of 
which it expels all kinds of impurities, and strengthens feeble members.  
This preparation, according to all philosophers, is made in a single vessel, 
over a single furnace, with an equal and continual fire, and this medicine, 
which is more than celestial, cures all kinds of infirmities, as well in 
human as metallic bodies; wherefore no one can under-stand or attain such an 
arcanum without the help of God: for its virtue is ineffable and divine."


Paradise : From old Persian (Zeud) pairedaeza an enclosure, a walled-in 
place; Old Persian pain, around dig, to mould, form, shape (hence to form a 
wall of earth).
     Paradise has been sought for or located in many regions of the earth.  
In Tartary, Armenia, India, and China  on the banks of the Euphrates and of 
the Ganges; in Meso-potamia, Syria, Persia, Arabia, Palestine, and Ethiopia, 
and near the mountains of Libanus and Anti-libanus. Perhaps the most 
noteworthy tradition is that which fixes its situation in the Island of 
Ceylon, the Serendib of the ancient Persians, and the Taprobane of the Greek 
geogra-phers.   It is from the summit of Hamalleel or Adam’s Peak," says 
Percival in his history of Ceylon,  that Adam took his last view of Paradise 
before he quitted it never to return.  The spot on which his feet stood at 
the moment is still supposed to be found in an impression on the summit of 
the mountain, resembling the print of a man's foot, but more than double the 
ordinary size.  After taking this farewell view, the father of mankind is 
said to have gone over to the continent of Judea, which was at that time 
joined to the island, but no sooner had he passed Adam's Bridge than the sea 
closed behind him, and cut off all hopes of return.  This tradition, from 
whatever source it was derived, seems to be interwoven with the earliest 
notions of religion entertained by the Cingalese; and it is difficult to 
conceive that it could have been engrafted on them without forming an 
original part.  I have frequently had the curiosity to converse with black 
men of different castes concerning this tradition of Adam.  All of them, 
with every appearance of belief, assured me that it was really true, and in 
support of it produced a variety of testimonies, old sayings, and 
prophecies, which have for ages been current among them.  The origin of 
these traditions I do not pretend to trace; but their connection with 
Scripture history is very evident, and they afford a new instance how 
universally the opinions with respect to the origin of man coincide."  We 
are further informed by this writer that a large chair fixed in a rock near 
the summit of the mountain is said to be the workmanship of Adam.   It has 
the appearance of having been placed there at a very distant period, but who 
really placed it there, or for what purpose, it is impossible for any 
European to discover."
     Paradise is a word of Persian origin, adopted by the Greeks, and 
literally denotes an inclosure or park planted with fruit-trees, and 
abounding with various animals. Eden is not termed Paradise in Genesis, but 
simply a garden planted eastwards in the country or district so called; and 
it is this apparently indefinite locality which has caused so many 
conjectures as to its exact site.  Some place it in Judea, where is now the 
sea of Galilee; others in Armenia, near Mount Ararat; and others in Syria, 
towards the sources of the Orontes, the Chrysorrhoas, and Barrady. Some 
think that by Eden is meant the whole earth, which was of surprising beauty 
and fertility before the Fall; and it is curious that a notion proved to a 
great extent among the various nations, that the Old World was under a 
curse, and that the earth became very barren.  We are also assured that the 
Hindoos and Chinese believe that all nature is contaminated, and that the 
earth labours undre some dreadful defilement-a sentiment which could only 
result from obscure traditions connected with the first human pair.  
Josephus gravely says that the Sacred Garden was watered by one river which 
ran round the whole earth, and was divided into four parts  but he appears 
to think Paradise was merely a figurative or allegorical locality.  Some of 
the natives of Hindostan have traditions of a place resembling Paradise on 
the banks of the Ganges; but their accounts are so completely blended with 
their superstitions, and with their legends respecting the Deluge and the 
second peopling of the world, as to be, to a certain extent, unintelligible.  
A writer who had diligently studied the Indian Puranas for many years, 
opened a new source of information, and placed Eden on the Imaus Mountains 
of India.  ' It appears from Scripture," he says, "that Adam and Eve lived 
in the countries to the eastward of Eden ; for at the eastern entrance of it 
God placed the angel with the flaming sword This is also confirmed by the 
Puranics, who place the progenitor of mankind on the mountainous regions 
between Cabul and the Ganges, on the banks of which, in the hills, they show 
a place where he resorted occasionally for religious purposes.  It is 
frequented by pilgrims.  At the entrance of the passes leading to the place 
where I suppose was the Garden of Eden, and to the eastward of it, the 
Hindoos have placed a destroying angel, who appears, and it is generally 
represented like a cherub; I mean Garudha, or the Eagle, upon whom Vishnu 
and Jupiter are represented riding.  Garudha is represented generally like 
an eagle, but in his compound character somewhat like the cherub.  He is 
represented like a young man, with the countenance, wings, and talons of the 
eagle.  In Scripture the Deity is represented riding upon a cherub, and 
flying upon the wings of the wind.  Garudha is called Vahan (literally the 
Vehicle) of Vishnu or Jupiter, and he thus answers to the cherub of 
Scripture; for many com-mentators derive this word from the obsolete root 
c’harab, in the Chaldean language, a word implicitly synonymous with the 
Sanscrit Vahan."  We may here add, that the Puranics considered the north-
west part of India, about Cashmere, as the site of Paradise, and the 
original abode of the first human pair; and that there, at the offering of a 
sacrifice Daksha was murdered by his jealous brother, who was inconsequence 
doomed to become a fugitive on the earth.
     In the fabled Meru of the Hindoo mythology, on the other hand, we have 
also a descriptive representation of the Mosaical Garden of Eden. Meru is a 
conical mountain, the exact locality of. which is not fixed;  but as the 
Hindoo geographers considered the earth as a flat table, and the sacred 
mountain of Meru rising in the middle, it became at length their decided 
conviction that Meru was the North Pole, from their action that the North 
Pole was the highest part of the world.  So firmly we are told, was this 
tradition believed, that although some Hindoo writers admitted that Mount 
Meru must be situated in the central part of Asia, yet rather than 
relinquish their notion of and predilection for the North Pole as the real 
locality of their Paradise, they actually forced the sun out of the 
ecliptic, and placed the Pole on the elevated plains of the Lesser Bokhara.  
If we, however, examine the Hindoo description of this Paradise, we shall at 
once be able to trace its origin and its close analogy to the Mosaic 
account.
     The summit of Meru is considered as a circular plain of vast extent, 
surrounded by a belt of hills-a celestial earth, the abode of immortals, and 
is designated Ida--Vratta, or the Circle of Ida.  It is of four different 
colours towards the cardinal points, and is believed to be supported by four 
enormous buttresses of gold, silver, copper and iron.  Yet doubts exist as 
to its real appearance, some alleging that its form is that of a square 
pyramid, others maintain that its shape is conical; others that it resembles 
an inverted cone; while others thought, that instead of a circular belt of 
mountains, Meru terminated in three lofty peaks.  The Sawas assert that a 
vast river rises from the head of their deity Siva, and the Vaishnawas that 
it springs' from beneath the feet of Vishnu, and, after passing through the 
circle of the moon, falls upon the summit of Meru, and divides itself into 
four streams, flowing towards the four cardinal points.  Others believe that 
the four rivers of the sacred mountain spring from the roots of Jambri, a 
tree of immense size which, they say, conveys the most extensive and 
profound knowledge, and accomplishes the most desirable of human 
aspirations.  The reader will recollect the Mosaical account of the Tree of 
Knowledge, which stood in the middle of the Garden, and of the river which 
went out of Eden to water it, dividing itself into four branches or streams 
of other rivers.
     The river thus rising in Meru, the Hindoos further say, flows in four 
opposite directions to the four cardinal points and is supposed to issue 
from four rocks, carved in the shape of so many different animals, one of 
which is a cow; and this, they allege, is the origin of the Ganges.  Some 
among them, however, think that this river first flows round the sacred city 
of Brahma, and then discharges itself into a lake called Mansarovara, from 
which it issues through the rocky heads of four animals to the different 
divisions of the globe.  The cow's head, from which issues the Ganges, they 
place towards the south; and towards the north is the tiger, or lion's head.  
The horse's head is on the west, and on the east is that of the elephant.
     The traditions of Cashmere represent that country as the original site 
of Paradise, and the abode of the first human pair; and the Buddhists of 
Thibet hold opinion respecting the mountain Meru similar to those of the 
Hindoos. They locate the sacred Garden, however, at the foot of the moun-
tain, near the source of the Ganges; but the four holy rivers are made to 
issue through the heads of the same animals, which are believed to be the 
guardians of the divisions of the world.  The tree of knowledge, or of life, 
they designate Zambri, which, they say, is a celestial tree, bearing 
immortal fruit, and flourishes near four vast rocks, from which issue the 
several rivers which water the world.
     The Mussulmans inhabiting the adjacent countries have adopted the 
popular belief that Paradise was situated in Cashmere, adding that when the 
first man was driven from it, he and his wife wandered separately for some 
time. They met at a place called Bahlaka, or Balk, so called because they 
mutually embraced each other after a long absence. Two gigantic statues, 
which they say, are yet to be seen between Bahlaka and Bamiyan, represent 
Adam and Eve, and a third of smaller dimensions is that of their son Seish 
or Seth, whose tomb, or its site, is pointed out near Bahlaka.
     Some of the writers seriously maintained that Paradise was under the 
North Pole, arguing upon an idea of the ancient Babylonians and Egyptians, 
that the ecliptic or solar way was originally at right angles to the 
Equator, and so passed directly over the North Pole. The opinion generally 
entertained by the Mahomedans that it was in one of the seven heavens, is 
not more ridiculous than the preceding supposition.  Dr. Clarke sums up the 
extrava-gant theories respecting the locality of Paradise.  " Some place it 
as follows :-In the third heaven, others in the fourth, some within the 
orbit of the moon, others in the moon itself, some in the middle regions of 
the air, or beyond the earth's attraction, some da the earth, others under 
the earth, and others within the earth."
     Before leaving the East, it may be observed that the Orientals 
generally reckon four sites of Paradise in Asia the first Ceylon, already 
mentioned ; the second in Chaldea the third in a district of Persia, watered 
by a river called the Nilab; and the fourth about Damascus in Syria, and 
near the springs of the Jordan.  This last supposed site is not peculiar to 
the Oriental writers, as we find it main-tained by some Europeans, 
especially Heidegger, Le Clerc, and Hardouin.  The following are the 
traditions believed by the inhabitants of the city of Damascus-a city which 
the Emperor Julian the Apostate styled the Eye of all the East, the most 
sacred and most magnificent Damascus.
     “I understand," says Lamartine," that Arabian tra-ditions represent 
this city and its neighbourhood to form paradise the site of the lost 
Paradise, and certainly I should think that no place upon earth was better 
calculated to answer ones ideas of Eden.  The vast and fruitful plain, with 
the seven branches of the blue stream which irrigate it-the majestic 
framework of the mountains-the glittering lakes which reflect the heaven 
upon the earth-its geographical situation between the two seas-the 
perfection of the climate - every thing indicates that Damascus has at least 
been one of the first towns that were built by the children of men - one of 
the natural halts of fugitive humanity in primeval times.  It is, in fact, 
one of those sites pointed out by the hand of God for a city-a site 
predestined to sustain a capital like Constantinople."  According to the 
Orientals, Damascus stands on the site of the Sacred Garden, and without the 
city is the most beautiful meadow divided by the river Barrady, of the red 
earth of which Adam is alleged to have been formed.  This field is designa-
ted Ager Damascenus by the Latins, and nearly in the centre of it a pillar 
formerly stood, intended to mark the precise spot where the Creator breathed 
into the first man the breath of life.
     The numerous traditions which existed among ancient nations of the 
Garden of Eden doubtless originated those curious and. magnificent gardens 
designed and planted by the Eastern princes, such as the Golden Garden of 
Aristo-bulus, King of the Jews, which was consecrated by Pompey to Jupiter 
Capitolinus.  Nor is mythology deficient in similar legends. We have the 
Gardens of Jupiter, of Alcinous, and of the Fortunate Islands, but 
especially of the Hesperides, in which not oily the primeval Paradise, but 
traditions of the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil, and of the original 
promise made to the woman, are prom-inently conspicuous.  The Garden of the 
Hesperides pro-duced golden fruit, guarded by a dangerous serpent-that this 
fierce reptile encircled with its folds a mysterious tree -  and that 
Hercules procured the fruit by encountering and killing the serpent.  The 
story of the constellation, as related by Eratosthenes, is applicable to the 
Garden of Eden, and the primeval history of mankind.  "This serpent," says 
that ancient writer, alluding to the con-stellation, "is the same as that 
which guarded the golden apples, and was slain by Hercules.  For, when the 
gods offered presents to Juno on her nuptials with Jupiter, the Earth also 
brought golden apples.  Juno, admiring their beauty, commanded them to be 
planted in the garden of the gods; but finding that they were continually 
plucked by the daughter of Atlas, she appointed a vast serpent to guard 
them.  Hercules overcame and slew the monster. Hence, in this constellation 
the serpent is depicted rearing its head aloft, while Hercules, placed above 
it with one knee bent, tramples with his foot upon its head. and brandishes 
a club in his right hand."  The Greeks placed the Garden of the Hesperides 
close to Mount Atlas, and then removed it far into the regions of Western 
Africa yet all knowledge of its Asiatic site was not erased from the 
classical mythologists, for Apollodorus tells us that certain writers 
situated it not in the Libyan Atlas, hut in the Atlas of the Hyperboreans; 
and he adds, that the serpent had the faculty of uttering articulate sounds.
     Our Teutonic ancestors believed that the world was originally a 
Paradise, and its first inhabitants more than human, whose dwelling was a 
magnificent hall, glittering with fine gold, where love, and joy, and 
friendship presided. The most insignificant of their utensils were made of 
gold, and hence the appellation of the Golden age.  But this happiness was 
soon overthrown by certain women from the country of the giants, to whose 
seductions the first mortals yielded, and their innocence and integrity were 
lost for ever.  The transgression of Eve is the obvious prototype of the 
fatal curiosity of Pandora; and the arrival of women from the country of the 
giants, and their intercourse with a distinct and purer line of mortals, can 
scarcely fail of bringing forcibly to our recollection the marriages of the 
sons of Seth with the daughters of Cain, with were the principal causes of 
the universal depravity of the Ante-diluvians.
     The legends of Hindostan also supply us with accounts of the happiness 
of Paradise in the Golden Age of the classic mythology.  " There can arise 
little doubt," says Maurice, "that by the Satya age, or Age of Perfection, 
the Brahmins obviously allude to the state of perfection and happiness 
enjoyed by man in Paradise.  It is impossible to explain what the Indian 
writers assert concerning the universal purity of manners, and the luxurious 
and unbounded plenty prevailing in that primitive era, without this sup-
position.  Justice, truth, philanthrophy, were then prac-tised among all the 
orders and classes of mankind.  There was then no extortion, no 
circumvention, no fraud, used in the dealings one with another.  Perpetual 
oblations smoked on the altars of the Deity; every tongue uttered praises, 
and every heart glowed with gratitude to the Supreme Creator. The gods, in 
token of their approbation of the conduct of mortals, condescended 
frequently to become incarnate, and to hold personal intercourse with the 
yet undepraved race, to instruct them in arts and sciences; to unveil their 
own sublime functions and pure nature; and to make them acquainted with the 
economy of those celestial regions into which they were to be imme-diately 
translated, when the period of their terrestial probation expired."


Parama-Hamsas : (See India.)


Paraskeva, Saint: A saint of the Russian Calendar, whose feast day is August 
3rd.  On that day pilgrims from all parts of Russia congregate in St. 
Petersburg for the purpose of casting out devils.  A newspaper report of the 
pro-ceedings as they. occurred in 1913 is as follows:-
     "Another St. Paraskevas day has come and gone.  The usual fanatical 
scenes have been enacted in the suburbs of St. Petersburg, and the 
ecclesiastical authorities have not protested, nor have the police 
intervened.  Special trains have again been run to enable thousands of the 
lower classes to witness a spectacle, the toleration of which will only be 
appreciated by those acquainted with the writings of M. Pobiedonostzeff, the 
late Procurator of the Holy Synod.  The Church of St. Paraskeva is situated 
in a factory district of the city.  On the exterior side of one of the walls 
is an image of the Saint, to whom is attributed the power of driving out 
devils and curing epileptics, neurotics, and others by miraculous 
intervention.  At the same time, the day is made a popular holiday, with 
games and amusements of all sorts, booths and lotteries, refreshment stalls 
and drinking bars.  The newspapers publish detailed accounts of this year's 
proceedings without comment, and it is perhaps significant that the Novoe 
Vremya, a pillar of orthodoxy, ignores them altogether. Nor is this 
surprising when one reads of women clad in a single undergarment with bare 
arms being hoisted up by stalwart peasants to the level of the image in 
order to kiss it, and then having impure water and unclarified oil forced 
down their throats.  The treatment of the first sick woman is typical of the 
rest.  One young peasant lifted her in the air, two others held her arms 
fully extended, while a fourth seized her loosened hair, and, dragging her 
head from side to side and up and down, shouted " Kiss, kiss St. Paras-keva 
"  The woman's garment was soon in tatters.  She began groaning.  One of the 
men exclaimed : " Get out I Satan I  Say where thou art lodged I "  The 
woman's head was polled back by the hair, her month was forced open. and 
mod-coloured water (said to be holy water) was poured into it.  She spat the 
water out, and was heard to moan, " Oh, they are drowning me!"  The young 
man exultantly exclaimed, "So we've got you, devil, have we? Leave her at 
once or we will drown you!"  He continued pouring water into the victim's 
mouth, and after that unclarified oil.  Her lips were held closed, so that 
she was obliged to swallow it. The unfortunate woman was again raised and 
her face pressed against the image.  " Kiss it ! kiss it!, she was 
commanded, and she obeyed.  She was asked who was the cause of her being 
"possessed." "Anna," was the whispered reply.  Who was Anna? What was her 
village ?  In which cottage did she live? A regular inquisition.  The 
physical and mental sufferings of the first victim lasted about an hour, at 
the end of which she was handed over to her relatives, after a cross had 
been given to her, as it was found that she did not own one. According to 
accounts published by the Retch, Molva, etc., many other women were treated 
in the same fashion, the exercises lasting a whole day and night.  The men " 
pil-grims" would seem to have been less severely handled. It is explained 
that the idea of unclothing the woman is that there should be no knot, bow, 
or fastening where the devil and his coadjutors could find a lodgment.  And 
one is left with the picture of scores of women crawling around the church 
on their knees, invoking the aid of the Almighty for the future or His 
pardon for sins committed in the past."
     The treatment of the " possessed" is analogous to that employed by many 
barbarous peoples for the casting out of devils, and notably among the Chams 
of Cambodia (q.v.) who force the possessed to eat garbage in order to 
disgust the fiend they harbour.  (See also Obsession.)


Pasqually, Martinez de: (Kabalist and Mystic). [1715 ?-1779]. The date of 
Martinez Pasqually’s birth is not known definitely while even his 
nationality is a matter of uncertainty. It is commonly supposed, however, 
that he was born about 1715, somewhere in the south of France ; while 
several writers have maintained that his parents were Portuguese Jews, but 
this theory has frequently been contested.  It is said that from the outset 
he evinced a predilection for mysticism in its various forms, while it is 
certain that, in 1754, he instituted a Kabalistic rite, which was gleaned 
from Hebraic studies, and whose espousers were styled Cohens, this being 
simply the Hebrew for priests.  He propagated this rite in (livers masonic 
lodges of France, notably those of Marseilles, Toulouse, Bordeaux and Paris; 
while in 1768 we find him settled in the French capital, gathering round him 
many people addicted to mysticism. and impregnating them with his theories.  
His sojourn here was cut short eventually, nevertheless, for he heard that 
some property had been bequeathed to him in the island of St. Dominique, and 
he hastened thither with intent to assert his rights ; but he did not return 
to France, his death occurring in 1779 at Port-au-Prince, the principal town 
in the island aforesaid.
     Pasqually is credited with 'having written a book, La Reintigration, 
but this was never published.  As regards the philosophy which he 
promulgated, he appears to have believed partly in the inspiration of the 
Scriptures, the downfall of the angels, the theory of original sin, together 
with the doctrine of justification by faith ; but he seems to have held that 
man existed in an elemental state long before the creation detailed in 
Genesis, and was gradually evolved into his present form.  In short, 
Pasqually was something of an anticipator of endless modern theorists nor 
did he fail to find a disciple who regarded him as a prophet and master, 
this being Louis Claude de St. Martin, a theosophist frequently styled in 
France " le philosophe inconnu," who founded the sect known as Martinistes. 
The reader will find some account of St. Martin in an article headed with 
his name.


Path, The : Is a term which represents an important theo-sophical teaching, 
and it is used in different senses to denote not only the Path itself but 
also the Probationary Path along which a man must journey before he can 
enter on the former.  Impelled by profound longing for the highest, for 
service of God and his fellows, man first begins the journey and he must 
devote himself wholeheartedly to this service.  At his entrance on the 
Probationary Path, he becomes the chela or disciple of one of the Masters or 
Perfected men who have all finished the great journey, and he devotes 
himself to the acquiring of four qualifica-tions which are (1) knowledge of 
what only is real;  (2) rejection of what is unreal ; (3) the six mental 
attributes of control over thought, control over outward action, tolerance, 
endurance, faith and balance, these attributes though all necessary in some 
degree, not being necessary in perfect degree; and (4) the desire to be one 
with God. During the period of his efforts to acquire these qualifica-tions, 
the chela advances in many ways, for his Master imparts to him wise counsel; 
he is taught by meditation to attain divine heights unthought of by ordinary 
man; he constantly works for the betterment of his fellows, usually in the 
hours of sleep, and striving thus and in similar directions, he fits himself 
for the first initiation at the entrance to the Path proper, but it may be 
mentioned that he has the opportunity either during his probation or 
afterwards to forego the heavenly life which is his due and so to allow the 
world to benefit by the powers which be - has gained, and which in ordinary 
course, he would utilise in the heavenly life.  In this case, he remains in 
the astral world, from whence he makes frequent returns to the physical 
world.  Of initiations there are four, each at the beginning of a new stage 
on the Path, manifesting the knowledge of that stage.  On the first stage 
there are three obstacles or, as they are commonly termed, fetters, which 
must be cast aside and these are the illusion of self which must be realised 
to be only an illusion; doubt which must be cleared away by knowledge; and 
superstition which must be cleared away by the discovery of what in truth is 
real.  This stage traversed, the second initiation follows, and after this 
comes the consciousness that earthly life will now be short, that only once 
again will physical death be experienced, and the man begins more and more 
to function in his mental body.  After the third initiation, the man has two 
other fetters to unloose-desire and avension;  and now his knowledge becomes 
keen and piercing and he can gaze deep into the heart of things. After the 
fourth initiation, he enters on the last stage and finally frees himself of 
what fetters remain-the desire for life whether bodily or not, and the sense 
of individual difference from his fellows.  He has now reached the end of 
his journey, and is no longer trammelled with sin or with anything that can 
hinder him from entering the state of supreme bliss where he is reunited 
with the divine con-sciousness.  (See Theosophy.)

Pearls  Occult properties of. Amongst the early Greeks and Romans, the 
wearing of gems as an amulet or talisman, was much in-vogue.  For this 
purpose pearls were often made into crowns.  Rich says:  " Pope Adrian, 
anxious to secure all the virtues in his favour, wore an amulet com-posed of 
a sun-baked toad, arsenic, tormentil, pearl, coral, hyacinth, smarag, and 
tragacanth."
     It is also said that to dream of pearls means many tears. 
     Their occult virtues are brought forth by being boiled in meat, when 
they heal the quartan ague : bruised and taken with milk, they are good for 
ulcers, and clear the voice.  They also comfort the heart and render their 
possessor chaste.

Peter of Apono : Born in 1250, at Apono, near Padua, a philosopher, 
mathematician, and astrologer of no mean skill.  He practised physic in 
Paris with so great success that he soon became very rich, but his wealth 
and attain-ments were annulled by the accusation of sorcery which was 
brought against him.  He was said to receive instruction in the seven 
liberal arts from seven spirits which he kept in crystal vessels. To him was 
ascribed also the curious and useful faculty of causing the money he spent 
to return to his own purse.  His downfall was brought about by an act of 
revenge for which he was called to account by the Inquisition.' A neighbour 
of his had been possessed of a spring of excellent water in his garden, from 
which he allowed Peter of Apono to drink at will.  For some reason or 
another the permission was withdrawn, and Peter, with the assistance of the 
Devil, caused the water to leave the garden and flow uselessly in some 
distant street.  Ere the trial was finished the unfortunate physician died, 
but so hitter were the inquisitors against him that they ordered his bones 
to be dug up and burned. This public indignity to his memory was averted by 
some of his friends, who, hearing of the vindictive sentence, secretly 
removed his remains from the burying-ground where they lay.  The inquisitors 
thereupon satisfied their animosity by burning him in effigy.

Philadelphian Society : (See Visions.)


Philalethes, Eirenaeus : (circa, 1660) Alchemist.  The life of this 
alchemist is wrapped in mystery, albeit a considerable mass of writing 
stands to his credit.  The heading of this article is, of course, mere 
pseudonym, and, though some have tried hard to identify the writer who bore 
it with one Thomas Vaughan, a brother of Henry Vaughan, the “Silurist " 
poet, this theory is not supported by any very sound evidence.  Others have 
striven to identify Philalethes with George Starkey, the quack doctor and 
author of Liquor Alchahest; but then, Starkey died of the plague in London 
in 1661, whereas it is known that Eirenaeus was living for some years after 
that date.  He appears, also, to have been on intimate terms with Robert 
Boyle, and, though this points to his having spent a considerable time in 
England, it is certain on the other hand that he emigrated to America.  Now 
Starkey, it will be remembered, was born in the Bermudas, and practised his 
spurious medical crafts in the English settlements in America, where, 
according to his contemporary biographers, he met Eirenaeus Philalethes.  
This meeting, then, may have given rise to the identification at issue; 
while it is probably Starkey to whom Eirenaeus refers when, in a preface to 
one of his books, he tells of certain of his writings falling  into the 
hands of one who, I conceive, will never return them," for in 1654 Starkey 
issued a volume with the title, The Marrow of Alchemy by Eirenaeus 
Philopenus Pizilalethes.
     It is to these prefaces by Philalethes that we must chiefly look for 
any information about him, while in the thirteenth chapter of his Introitus 
Apertus ad Occlusum Regis Palatium 
(Amsterdam, 1667) he makes a few autobiographical avowals which illuminate 
his character and career.  For we are like Cain, driven from the pleasant 
society we formerly had," he writes, and this suggests that he was 
persecuted on account of his alchemistic predilections; while elsewhere he 
heaps scorn on most of the hermetic philosophers of his day, and elsewhere, 
again, he vituperates the popular worship of money-getting.  " I disdain, 
loathe, and detest the idolizing of silver and gold," he declares, "by which 
the pomps and vanities of the world are celebrated.  Ah! filthy, evil, ah! 
vain nothingness."  That is vigorously written, and indeed nearly everything 
from the pen of Philalethes, whether in Latin or in English, pro-claims him 
a writer of some care, skill and taste; while his scholarship was 
considerable also, and it is interesting to find that, in his preface to 
Ripley Revived (London, 1678), lie gives some account of the authors to whom 
he felt himself chiefly indebted.  " For my own part," he says, " I have 
cause to honour Bernard Trevisan, who is very ingenious, especially in the 
letter to Thomas of Boulogne, when I seriously confess I received the main 
light in the hidden secret.  I do not remember that ever I learnt anything 
from Raymond Lully. . . . I know of none like Ripley, though Flamel be 
eminent."
     Langlet du Fresnoy, in his Histoire de la Philosophie Hermetique, 
refers to numerous unpublished manuscripts by Eirenaeus Philalethes, but 
nothing is known about these to-day, and in conclusion it behoves only to 
cite the more important of those things by the alchemist which were issued 
in book form: Medulla Alchymiae (London, 1664), Experimenta de Praeperatione 
Mercurii Sophici (Amsterdam, 1668) and Enarratio Methodica trium Gebri 
Medicinarurn (Amsterdam, 1668.)


Philosopher's Stone  A substance which enabled adepts in alchemy to compass 
the transmutation of metals. (See Alchemy.)  It was imagined by the 
alchemists that some one definite substance was essential to the success of 
the transmutation of metals.  By the application or admixture of this 
substance all metals might he transmuted into gold or silver.  It was often 
designated the Powder of Projection.  Zosimus, who lived at the commencement 
of the fifth century is one of the first who alludes to it.  He says that 
the stone is a powder or liquor formed of diverse metals, infusioned under a 
favourable constellation.  The Philosopher's Stone was supposed to contain 
the secret not only of transmutation, but of health and life, for through 
its agency could be distilled the Elixir of Life.  It was the touchstone of 
existence.  The author of a Treatise on Philosophical and Hermetic 
Chemistry, published in Paris in 1725 says : " Modern philosophers have 
extracted from the interior of mercury a fiery spirit, mineral, vegetable 
and mutliplicative, in a humid concavity in which is found the primitive 
mercury or the universal quintessence.  In the midst of this spirit resides 
the spiritual fluid     This is the mercury of the philosophers, which is 
not solid like a metal, nor soft like quicksilver, hut between the two. They 
have retained for a long time this Secret, which is the commencement, the 
middle, and the end of their work.  It is necessary then to proceed first to 
purge the mercury with salt and with ordinary salad vinegar, to sublime it 
with vitriol and saltpetre, to dissolve it in aqua-fortis, to sublime it 
again, to calcine it and fix it, to put away part of it in salad oil, to 
distill this liquor for the purpose of separating the spiritual water, air, 
and fire, to fix the mercurial body in the spiritual water or to distill the 
spirit of liquid mercury found in it, to putrefy all, and then to raise and 
exalt the spirit with non-odorous white sulphur that is to say, sal-
ammoniac-to dissolve this sal-ammoniac in the spirit of liquid mercury which 
when distilled becomes the liquor known as the Vinegar of the Sages, to make 
it pass from gold to antimony three times and afterwards to reduce it by 
heat, lastly to steep this warm gold in very harsh vinegar and allow it to 
putrefy.  On the surface of the vinegar it will raise itself in the form of 
fiery earth of the colour of oriental pearls.  This is the first operation 
in the grand work.  For the second operation; take in the name of God one 
part of gold and two parts of the spiritual water, charged with the sal-
ammoniac, mix this noble con-fection in a vase of crystal of the shape of an 
egg : warm over a soft but continuous fire, and the fiery water will 
dissolve little by little the gold ; this forms a liquor which is called by 
the sages "chaos" containing the elementary qualities-cold, dryness, heat 
and humidity.  Allow this composition to putrefy until it becomes black; 
this black-ness is known as the ' crow's head' and the ' darkness of the 
sages,' and makes known to the artist that he is on the right track.  It was 
also known as the ' black earth.'  It must be boiled once more in a vase as 
white as snow; this stage of the work is called the ' swan,' and from it 
arises the white liquor, which is divided into two parts - one white for the 
manufacture of silver, the other red for the manufacture of gold.  Now you 
have accomplished the work, and you possess the Philosopher's Stone.
     “In these diverse operations, one finds many by-products ; among these 
is the ' green. lion ' which is called also 'azoph,' and which draws gold 
from the more ignoble elements; the ' red lion' which converts the metal 
into gold; the ' head of the crow,' called also the ' black veil of the ship 
of Theseus,' which appearing forty days before the end of the operation 
predicts its success ; the white powder which transmutes the white metals to 
fine silver; the red elixir with which gold is made; the white elixir which 
also makes silver, and which procures long life-it is also called the ' 
white daughter of the philosophers.'
     In the lives of the various alchemists we find many notices of the 
Powder of Projection in connection with those adepts who were supposed to 
have arrived at the solution of the grand arcanum.  Thus in the Life of 
Alexander Seton (q.v.), a Scotsman who came from Port Seton, near Edinburgh, 
we find that on his various travels on the continent he employed in his 
alchemical experiments a blackish powder, the application of which turned 
any metal given him into gold.  Numerous instances are on record of Seton's 
projections, the majority of which are verified with great thoroughness.  On 
one occasion whilst in Holland, he went with some friends from the house at 
which he was residing to undertake an alchemical experi-ment at another 
house near by.  On the way thither a quantity of ordinary zinc was 
purchased, and this Seton succeeded in projecting into pure gold by the 
application of his powder.  A like phenomenon was undertaken by him at 
Cologne, and elsewhere throughout Germany, and the extremist torture could 
not wring from him the secret of the quintessence he possessed.  His pupil 
or assistant, Sendivogius, made great efforts to obtain the secret from him 
before he died, hut all to no purpose.  However, out of gratitude Seton 
bequeathed him what remained of his marvellous powder, which was employed by 
his Polish successor with the same results as had been achieved in his own 
case.  The wretched Sendivogius fared badly, however, when the powder at 
last came to an end.  He had used it chiefly in liquid form, and into this 
he had dipped silver coins which immediately had become the purest gold. 
Indeed it is on record that one coin, of which he had only immersed the 
half, remained for many years as a signal instance of the claims of alchemy 
in a museum or collection somewhere in South Germany.  The half of this 
doubloon was gold, while the undipped portion had remained silver; but the 
notice concerning it is scarcely of a satisfactory nature. When the powder 
gave out, Sendivogius was driven to the desperate expedient of gilding the 
coins, which, report says, he had heretofore transmuted by legitimate means, 
and this very naturally brought upon him the wrath of those who had trusted 
him.  (See Seton.)
     In the Tale of the Anonymous Adept we also find a powder in use, and 
indeed the powder seems to have been the favoured form of the transmuting 
agency.  The term Philosopher's Stone probably arose from some Eastern 
talismanic legend.  Yet we find in Egyptian alchemy-the oldest-the idea of 
the black powder-the detritus or oxide of all the metals mingled. (See 
Egypt.)
     The Philosopher's Stone had a spiritual as well as a material 
conception attached to it, and indeed spiritual alchemy is practically 
identified with it ; but we do not find the first alchemists, nor those of 
medieval times, possessed of any spiritual ideas ; their hope was to 
manufacture real gold. and it is only in later times that we find the 
altruistic idea creeping in, to the detriment of the physical one.  Symbolic 
language was largely used by both schools, however, and we must not imagine 
that because an alchemical writer employs symbolical figures of speech that 
he is of the transcendental school, as his desire was merely to be 
understanded of his brother adepts, and to conserve his secret from the 
vulgar. (See Alchemy.)

Phreno-Magnet ,' Journal of Magnetism.  (See Spiritualism.)


Phreno-Mesmerism (or Phrenopathy)  An application of the principles of 
Mesmerism to the science of phrenology. Mesmerism and phrenology had for 
some time been regarded by the English mesmerists as related sciences when 
it was discovered that a somnambule whose "bumps" were touched by the 
fingers of the operator would respond to the stimulus by exhibiting every 
symptom of the mental trait corresponding to the organ touched.  Thus signs 
of joy, grief, destructiveness, combativeness, and friendship might be 
exhibited in rapid succession by the entranced patient.  Among those who 
claimed to have discovered the new science were Dr. Collyer, a pupil of Dr. 
Elliotson's and the Rev. Laroy Sunderland, though the former after-wards 
repudiated it.  As time went on enterprising phreno-mesmerists discovered 
many new cerebral organs as many as a hundred and fifty being found beside 
those already mapped out by Spurzheim and Gall.  Among its supporters 
phreno-mesmerism numbered the distinguished hypnotist Braid, who expressed 
himself fully satisfied of its reality.  He has recorded a number of cases 
in which the patient correctly indicated by his actions the organs touched, 
though demonstrably ignorant of phrenological laws, and inaccessible to 
outside information.  Braid himself offers but a very halting and inadequate 
physiologi-cal explanation, and since he may be supposed to have been fully 
alive to the factors of suggestion and hyperaesthesia, it would seem 
advisable to admit the possibility of mental suggestion, or telepathy, by 
means of which the expectation of the operator, reproducing itself in the 
mind of the patient, would give rise to the corresponding reactions.


Phrygian Cap   Hargrave Jennings, in his Rosicrucians. Their Rites and 
Mysteries, says that the Phrygian Cap, the classic Mithraic Cap, sacrificial 
Cap, and mitre all derive from one common ancestor.  The Mithraic or 
Phrygian Cap is the origin of the priestly mitre in all faiths.  It was worn 
by the priest in sacrifice.  When worn by a male, it had its crest, comb. or 
point, set jutting forward ; when worn by a female, it bore the same 
prominent part of the cap in reverse, or on the nape of the neck, as in the 
instance of the Amazon's helmet, displayed in all old sculptures, or
that of Pallas-Athene, as exhibited in the figures of Minerva, The peak, 
pic, or point, of caps or hats (the term " cocked hat" is a case in point) 
all refer to the same idea. This point had a sanctifying meaning afterwards 
attributed to it, when it was called the christa, crista, or crest, which 
signifies a triumphal top, or tuft. The " Grenadier Cap," and the loose 
black Hussar Cap, derive remotely from the same sacred, Mithraic, or 
emblematical bonnet, or high pyramidal cap.  It, in this instance, changes 
to black, because it is devoted to the illustration of the " fire-workers"  
(grenadiers) who, among modern military, succeed the Vulcanists, Cyclopes, 
classic " smiths," or servants of Vulcan, or Mulciber, the artful worker 
among the metals in the fire, or amidst the forces of nature.  This idea 
will be found by a reference to the high cap among the Persians, or Fire-
worshippers; and to the black cap among the Bohemians, and in the East.  All 
travellers in Eastern lands will remember that the tops of the minarets 
reminded them of the high-pointed black caps of the Persians.
     The Phrygian Cap is a most recondite antiquarian form; the symbol comes 
from the highest antiquity. It is dis-played on the head of the figure 
sacrificing in the cele-brated sculpture, called the " Mithraic Sacrifice" 
(or the Mythical Sacrifice) in the British Museum. This loose cap, with the 
point protruding, gives the original form from which all helmets or 
defensive headpieces, whether Greek or Barbarian, deduce.  As a Phrygian 
Cap, or Symbolising Cap, it is always sanguine in its colour.  It then 
stands as the" Cap of Liberty" a revolutionary form; also, in another way, 
it is even a civic or incorporated badge.  It is always masculine in its 
meaning.  It marks the " needle " of the obelisk, the crown or tip of the 
phallus, whether " human" or representative. It has its origin in the rite 
of circumcision-unaccountable as are both the symbol and the rite.
     The real meaning of the bonnet rouge, or cap of liberty, has been 
involved from time immemorial in deep obscurity, notwithstanding that it has 
always been regarded as the most important hieroglyph or figure. It 
signifies the supernatural simultaneous "sacrifice" and "triumph." It has 
descended from the time of Abraham, and it is supposed to emblem the strange 
mythic rite of the " cir-cumcisio preputii," The loose Phrygian bonnet 
conique, or " cap of liberty," may be accepted as figuring, or stand-ing 
for, that detached integument or husk, separated from a certain point or 
knob, which has various names in different languages, and which supplies the 
central idea of this sacrificial rite - the spoil or refuse of which (absurd 
and unpleasant as it may seem) is borne aloft at once as a "trophy'.' and as 
the" cap of liberty." It is now a magic sign, and becomes a talisman of 
supposedly inexpressible power-from what particular dark reason it may be 
difficult to say. The whole is a sign of " initiation," and of baptism of a 
peculiar kind.  The Phrygian Cap, ever after this first inauguration, has 
stood as the sign of the “Enlightened." The heroic figures in most Gnostic 
Gems, have caps of this kind.  The sacrificer in the sculptured group of the 
" Mithraic Sacrifice," among the marbles in the British Museum, has a 
Phrygian Cap on his head, whilst in the act of striking the bull with the 
poniard-meaning the office of the immolating priest. The bonnet conique is 
the mitre of the Doge of Venice.
     Cinteotl, a Mexican god of sacrifice, wears such a cap made from the 
thigh-skin of an immolated virgin. This head-dress is shaped like a cock's 
comb.
     Besides the bonnet rouge, the Pope's mitre-nay, all mitres or conical 
head-coverings-have their name from the terms  “Mithradic," or " Mithraic,"  
The origin of the whole class of names is Mittra, or Mithra. The cap of the 
grenadier, the shape of which is alike all over Europe, is related to the 
Tartar lambskin caps, which are dyed black; and it is black also from its 
associations with Vulcan and the " Fire-worshippers " (Smiths).  The Scotch 
Glengarry cap will prove on examination to be only a "cocked" Phrygian.  All 
the black conical caps, and the meaning of this strange symbol, came from 
the East.  The loose black fur cap derives from the Tartars.
     The " Cap of Liberty" (Bonnet Rouge), the Crista or Crest (Male), and 
the Female (Amazon) helmet, all mean the same idea ; in the instance of the 
female crest the knob is, however, depressed.

Phyllorhodomancy:	Divination by rose-leaves.  The Greeks clapped a 
rose-leaf on the hand, and judged from the resulting sound the success or 
otherwise of their desires.

Physical World : Formerly known as the Sthula Plane - is in the theosophic 
scheme of things the lowest of the seven worlds, the world in which ordinary 
man moves and is conscious under normal conditions.  It is the limit of the 
ego's descent into matter, and the matter which composes the appropriate 
physical body, is the densest of any of these worlds.  Physical matter has 
the seven divisions of solid, liquid, gas, ether, super-ether, sub-atom and 
atom, in common with the matter of the other worlds.  Besides the physical 
body, familiar to ordinary vision, there is a finer body, the etheric 
double, which plays a very important part in collecting vitality from the 
sun for the use of the denser physical body, and reference is made to the 
articles on the Etheric Body, and Chaksams.  At death, the physical body and 
the etheric double are cast aside and slowly resolve into their components.

Pierart, Z. T. : French Spiritualist and editor of La Revue Spiritualiste.  
M. Pierart was born in humble circumstances but managed to secure for 
himself an adequate education. He became in time professor at the College of 
Maubeuge, and afterwards secretary to Baron Du Potet. In 1858 he founded La 
Revue Spiritualiste, and led the French spirit-ualists, between whom and the 
spiritists under Allan Kardec there existed a certain rivalry.  Until his 
death in 1878 he continued to devote his time and talents to the movement 
with. which he had identified himself.

Piper, Mrs. : A famous trance medium, whose discourses and writings present 
the best evidence extant for the actuality of spirit communication.  A 
native of America, it was there that Mrs. Piper first became entranced, 
while consulting a professional clairvoyant in 1884.  Numerous spirits pur-
ported to control her in these early days-Mrs. Siddons, Longfellow, Bach, to 
mention only the most celebrated-but in 1885, when she came under the 
observation of the Society for Psychical Research, her principal control was 
Dr. Phinuit.  From that time forward her trance utterances and writings-for 
after 1890 the communications were generally in writing-were carefully 
recorded and analysed by members of the S.P.R., chiefly under the direction 
of Dr. Hodgson.  In 1889-90 Mrs. Piper visited this country and gave many 
stances, most of which seemed to display supernormal powers in the medium.  
It is impossible in a limited space to detail her remarkable trance 
impersonations. On his death in 1905 Dr. Hodgson became one of her controls; 
Mr. Myers and Mr. Gurney also controlled her. But perhaps the most life-like 
and convincing impersonation or spirit-manifestation-whichever it may have 
been-was that of George Pelham, a young American author and a friend of Dr. 
Hodgson, who had died suddenly in 1892. (See Trance Personalities.)  The 
information given by this control, his recognition of friends, and so on, 
were 50 accurate as to convince many that it was indeed " G.P." who spoke.
     From that time until 1896 the stances were especially productive, but 
in the latter year the medium underwent an operation. Phinuit, who often 
acted as a go-between for other controls and the sitter, now took his 
departure, and a band of other spirits, led by the " Imperator" of Stainton 
Moses, took control of Mrs. Piper's organism. The trance writings and 
utterances became fewer, and the spirits recommended that the number of 
sittings be cut down on account of the medium's health.  Nevertheless some 
excellent tests were subsequently got with the Piper--Hodgson,  Piper-Myers, 
and Piper-Gurney controls.  Mrs. Piper was also one of those who took part 
in the " cross--correspondences" sittings held in 1906 and onwards, the 
other mediums being Mrs. Thompson, Mrs. Verrall, Miss Verrall, Mrs. Holland, 
Mrs. Forbes, etc.  (See " Spiritual-ism, and Cross-Correspondences.)  It 
seems clear that in Mrs. Piper's trance phenomena there are evidences of 
some supernormal faculty, at the best, of telepathy, though to the writer 
even that hypothesis seems to be inadequate. It would, for example, be a 
very complicated form of telepathy, that would enable some of these 
automatic cross-correspondence " scripts to be written, in which, say, the 
scripts contain allusions unintelligible to the writers, and requiring a key 
provided by a third script to make them plain. Such a case inevitably 
suggests that one and the same intelligence directs all three mediums. Mrs. 
Piper's impersonation of George Pelham, again, calls for some explanation, 
since it would seem that all the information could hardly have been culled 
from the sitter's minds.  (See Spiritualism.)


Planchette : An instrument designed for the purpose of communication with 
spirits. It consists of a thin-heart-shaped piece of wood, mounted on two 
small wheel-castors and carrying a pencil, point downwards, for the third 
support. The hand is placed on the wood and the pencil writes automatically, 
or presumably by spirit control operating through the psychic force of the 
medium.
     In 1853, a well-known French spiritualist, M. Planchette, invented this 
instrument to which he gave his name. For quite fifteen years it was used 
exclusively by French spiritualists.  Then in the year 1868 a firm of toy-
makers in America took up the idea and flooded the booksellers' shops with 
great numbers of planchettes.  It became a popular mania, and the instrument 
sold in thousands there and in Great Britain.  It was, and is, largely used 
simply as a toy and any results obtained that may be arresting and seemingly 
inexplicable are explained by Animal Magnetism or traced to the power of 
subconscious thought.
     Amongst spiritualists it has been used for spirit com-munication. 
Automatic writing has often been developed by use of the planchette, some 
mediums publishing books which, they claimed, were written wholly by their 
spirit-controls through the use of planchettes.  Dr. Ashburnes, in his 
Spiritualism Chemically Explained says that the human body is a condensation 
of gases, which constantly exude from the skin in invisible vapour - 
otherwise electricity; that the fingers coming in contact with the 
planchette transmit to it an " odic force," and thus set it in motion. He 
goes on to say that some people have phosphorous in excess in their system 
and the vapour "thus exuded forms a positively living, thinking, acting 
body, capable of directing a pencil."  There are variations on the 
planchette form such as the dial-planchette which consists of a founda-tion 
of thick cardboard nine inches square on the face of which the alphabet is 
printed and also the numerals one to ten.  There are the words "Yes," " No," 
" Goodbye" and " Don't know."  These letters, words, and numerals are 
printed on the outer edge of a circle, the diameter of which is about seven 
inches.  In the centre of this circle, and firmly affixed to the cardboard, 
is a block of wood three inches square. The upper surface of this block has 
a circular channel in it and in this run balls.  Over the balls is placed a 
circular piece of hard wood, five inches in diameter. and attached to the 
outer edge of this a pointer. The upper piece of wood is attached to the 
lower by an ordinary screw, upon which the upper plate revolves when used 
for communication.  Another form is the Ouija board on which in a convenient 
order the letters of the alphabet are printed and over which a pointer 
easily moves under the direction of the hand of the person or persons acting 
as mediums.  It is stated that a form of this " mystic toy" was in use in 
the days of Pythagoras, about 540 B.C. In a French history of Pythagoras, 
the author describing his celebrated school of philosophy, asserts that the 
brother-hood held frequent seances 0 circles at which a mystic table, moving 
on wheels, moved towards signs inscribed on the surface of a stone slab on 
which the moving-table worked.  The author states that probably Pythagoras, 
in his travels among the Eastern nations, observed some such apparatus in 
use amongst them and adapted his idea from them.  Another trace of some such 
"communicating mechanism" is found in the legend told by the Scan-dinavian 
Blomsturvalla how the people of Jomsvikingia in the twelfth century had a 
high priest, one Volsunga, whose predictions were renowned for their 
accuracy throughout the length and breadth of the land.  He had in his 
posses-sion a little ivory doll that drew with " a pointed instru-ment" on 
parchment or " other substance," certain signs to which the priest had the 
key.  The communications were in every case prophetic utterances, and it is 
said in every case came true.  The writer who recounts the legend thought it 
probable that the priest had procured the doll in China.  In the National 
Museum at Stockholm there is a doll of this description which is worked by 
mechanism, and when wound up walks round and round in circles and 
occasionally uses its right arm to make curious signs with a pointed 
instrument like a stylo which is held in the hand. Its origin and use have 
been connected with the legend recounted above.


Planet : (See Planetary Chains.)


Planetary Logos, or Ruler of Seven Chains, is, in the theo-sophic scheme, 
one of the grades in the hierarchy which assists in the work of creation and 
guidance.  It is the supreme Logos who initiates this work, but in it he is 
helped by the "seven."  They receive from him the inspiration and 
straightway each in his own Planetary Chain carries on the work, directed by 
him no doubt, yet in an individual fashion, through all the successive 
stages which go to compose a Scheme of Evolution.  (See Logos, Chains.)


Planetary Spirits : In the theosophical scheme the number of these spirits 
is seven.  They are emanations from the Absolute, and are the agents by 
which the Absolute effects all his changes in the Universe.

Poltergeist: The name given to the supposed supernatural causes of outbreaks 
of rappings, inexplicable noises, and similar disturbances, which from time 
to time have mystified men of science as well as the general public.  The 
term poltergeist (i.e., Polter Geist, rattling ghost) is sufficiently 
indicative of the character of these beings, whose manifesta-tions are, at 
the best, puerile and purposeless tricks, and not infrequently display an 
openly mischievous and destructive tendency.  The poltergeist is by no means 
indigenous to any one country, nor has he confined his attentions to any 
particular period. Lang mentions several cases belonging to the Middle Ages, 
and one at least which dates so far back as 856 B.C.  In both savage and 
civilised countries this peculiar form of haunting is well known, and it is 
a curious fact that the phenomena are almost identical in every case, The 
disturbances are always observed to be particularly active in the 
neighbourhood of one person, generally a child or a young woman, and 
preferably an epileptic or hysterical subject.  According to the theory 
advanced by spiritualists, this centre of the disturbances is a natural 
medium, through whom the spirits desire to communicate with the world of 
living beings.  In earlier times such a person was regarded as a witch, or 
the victim of a witch, whichever supposition was best fitted to the 
circumstances. The poltergeist is represented as a development from witch-
craft, and the direct forerunner of modern spiritualism, and is, in fact, a 
link between the two.
     Turning our attention first to some of the earlier records, we may 
consider briefly the case of the Drummer of Tedworth (1661), and the Epworth 
Case (1716).  In both of these instances the manifestations witnessed were 
of the usual order. The spirits, if spirits they were, sought to attract 
attention by familiar childish tricks, and communicated by means of the same 
cumbrous process of knocking. The circumstances of the first-named instance 
are as follow: In 1661 a' vagrant drummer was, at the instance of Mr. 
Mompesson of Tedworth, taken before a Justice of the Peace, and deprived of 
his drum, which instrument finally found a resting-place in the house of Mr. 
Mompesson, during that gentleman's absence from home. Immediately violent 
disturbances broke out in the house. Loud knock-ings and thumpings were 
heard, and the beating of an invisible drum. Articles flew recklessly about 
the rooms, and the bedsteads (particularly those in which the younger 
children lay) were violently shaken.  After a time the drummer was 
transported, when the manifestations abruptly ceased, but a recurrence of 
the outbreak synchronised with his return.  Contemporary opinion put the 
case down to witchcraft on the part of the drummer, but Mr. Podmore and 
other moderns incline to the belief that the " two little modest girls in 
the bed " had more than a little to do with the mysterious knockings and 
scratchings of the poltergeist.  In the famous Epworth Case, where the 
phenomena is well attested by the whole Wesley family, and described in 
numerous contemporary letters, the dis-turbances comprised all the ordinary 
manifestations of levitations, loud and terrifying noises, and rappings, 
together with apparitions of rabbits, badgers, and so on. Podmore is of the 
opinion that one of the daughters, Hetty, was in some way implicated in the 
affair.  She alone did not give an account of the manifestations, though she 
had promised to do so. The poltergeist showed a decided partiality for her 
company - a circumstance which, though not unobserved, does not seem to have 
held any special significance for her family. A more recent case in which a 
charge of witchcraft is involved, is the Cideville case, described by Mr. 
Lang in his Cock Lane and Common Sense, under the heading, ' A Modern Trial 
for Witchcraft." In 1849 the Cure of Cideville, Seine Inferieure, was sum-
moned to court by a shepherd named Thorel, who alleged that the Cure had 
denounced him for sorcery. In his defence the Cure stated that Thorel 
himself had confessed to having produced by means of sorcery certain 
mysterious manifestations which had disturbed the inmates of the Abbey.  
During the trial it transpired that the Cure, when visiting a sick 
parishioner, had driven from the bedside a man of notorious character, with 
an evil reputation for sorcery, who was about to treat the patient.  The 
sorcerer retired, vowing vengeance on the Cure, and was shortly afterwards 
sent to prison.  Later when two little boys. pupils of the Cure, were at an 
auction, they were approached by Thorel, who was known as a disciple of the 
sorcerer. He placed his hand on the head of one of the children, and 
muttered some strange words.  When the boys returned to the Abbey the 
poltergeist performances commenced. Violent blows on the walls seemed about 
to demolish them, one of the children complained that he was followed by a 
man's shadow, and other witnesses declared that they had seen a grey hand 
and wreaths of smoke.  Some of those who visited the Abbey were able to hold 
a conversation with the spirits by means of knocking.  It was agreed that 
sharp-pointed irons should be driven into the walls, and on this being done, 
smoke and flames were seen to issue from the incisions.  At last Thorel 
sought the Cure' and confessed that the disturbances were the work of his 
master, the sorcerer.  The plaintiff was non-suited, and the judge, in 
summing up, said that the cause of the ' extraordinary facts " of this case 
" remained unknown.'  In February, 1851, the boys were removed from the 
Abbey, and the disturbances ceased.
     Of those instances where a spiritualistic explanation has been offered 
perhaps the most outstanding is the case of the Cock Lane Ghost, almost too 
well-known to call for recapitulation.  In 1761-2 raps and scratches were 
heard in a house in Cock Lane, generally occurring near the bed of the 
little daughter of the house, Elizabeth Parsons.  Very soon the 
manifestations became so pronounced that people from all parts of the city 
were crowding to witness them. A code of raps was agreed upon, through which 
it was ascertained that the spirit was that of a lady named "Fanny," who 
declared that she had been poisoned by her deceased sister's husband, with 
whom she had lodged in the Cock Lane house some two years previously, and 
expressed a wish that he might be hanged.  It is, indeed, quite a common 
thing for the poltergeist to reveal a crime, real or imaginary - and more 
often the latter, which is entirely in keeping with the character of the 
spirit.  In the Cock Lane affair the manifestations followed the girl when 
she was removed to another house, and she trembled strongly, even in her 
sleep, on the approach of the ghost. The case which presents the most 
formidably array of evidence, however, is that of the Joller family in 
Switzer-land.  In 1860 - two serious disturbances broke out in Stans, in the 
home of M. Joller, a prominent lawyer, and a man of excellent character.  
Knocks were first heard by a servant-maid, who also averred that she was 
haunted by strange grey shapes, and the sound of sobbing.  In the autumn of 
186i, she was dismissed and another maid engaged.  For a time there was 
peace, but in the summer of 1862 they commenced with redoubled vigour.  The 
wife and seven children of M. Joller heard and saw many terrifying sights 
and sounds, but M. Joller himself remained sceptical.  At length, however, 
even he was convinced that neither trickery nor imagination would suffice as 
an explanation of the phenomena.  Meanwhile the manifestations became more 
and more outrageous, and continued in full view of the thousands of persons 
who were attracted by curiosity to the house, including the Land-Captain 
Zelger, the Director of Police Jaun, the President of the Court of Justice, 
and other prominent people, some of whom sug-gested that a commission be 
appointed to examine the house thoroughly.  Three of the heads of police 
were deputed to conduct the enquiry.  They demanded the withdrawal of M. 
Joller and his family, and remained in the house for six days without 
witnessing anything abnormal, and drew up a report to this effect.  Directly 
the Joller family entered the house the interruptions were renewed.  M. 
Joller became the butt of ridicule to all, even his political and personal 
friends, and was finally compelled to quit his ancestral home.  This is 
undoubtedly one of the most striking cases of poltergeist haunting on 
record.  Here, as in almost every instance, there are children evidently and 
Intimately bound up with the manifestations.  It is his choice of a medium 
which has directed most suspicion to the poltergeist. and it on this that 
Mr. Podmore bases his assumption that all poltergeist visitations are 
traceable to the cunning tricks of " naughty little girls."  He suggests 
that with the " medium " under careful control it is more than probable that 
the poltergeist will turn shy, and refuse to perform his traditional 
functions  There is much to be said for this theory.  The medium of the 
spiritualistic seance is frequently credited with the loftiest utterances, 
and the production of literary, musical, and artistic com-positions.  The 
poltergeist indulges in such futilities as the breaking of crockery, the 
throwing about of furniture, and the materialization of coal and carrots in 
the drawing--room.  Why, if they are mature spirits, as they purport to be, 
should they practise such feats of mystification as would seem to be 
impelled either by the foolish vanity of a child, or the cunning impulses of 
a deranged mind?  Then there is often a curious hesitancy on the part of the 
medium, as in the case of Hetty Wesley, a trembling on the approach of the 
phenomena, and a tendency to such physical dis-turbances as epileptic and 
other fits.  And sometimes the poltergeist confesses, as did the maid-
servant Ann at Stock-well, to having manipulated the disturbing occurrences 
with the aid of wires and horsehair.  But in such a case as that of the 
Joller family, the theory of " naughty little girls " is childishly 
inadequate.  It is all but impossible to believe that children could produce 
the manifestations in full view of hundreds of people.  It is still more 
difficult to understand how children and ignorant persons, with presumably 
no knowledge of previous instances, could fix upon exactly the same 
phenomena which has been pro-duced by the poltergeists of every age and 
clime.  And in the Joller case, there is the evidence of many spectators 
that the most violent disturbances were witnessed when the whole family were 
assembled outside the house and thus not in a position to assist the 
manifestations, which included the throwing open of all windows, doors, cup-
boards and drawers,. the materialization of the "thin grey cloud," noises 
and apparitions.  In short, it must be admitted that there is an element of 
mystery which calls for elucidation, and which the most scientific and 
critical minds have hitherto failed to make clear.


Polynesia : Magic in Polynesia is the preserve of the priestly and upper 
classes, although lesser sorcery is practised by individuals not of these 
castes.  There is a prevailing belief in what is known as mana, or 
supernatural power, which is resident in certain individuals.  The method of 
using this power is twofold.  One of these is practised by a society known 
as the Iniat, where certain rites are carried out which are supposed to 
bring calamity upon the enemies of the tribe.  The ability to exercise magic 
is known as agagara, and the magician or wizard is tena agagara.  If the 
wizard desires to cast magic upon another man, he usually tries to secure 
something that that person has touched with his mouth, and to guard against 
this, the natives are careful to destroy all food-refuse that they do not 
consume, and they carefully gather up even a single drop of blood when they 
receive a cut or scratch, and burn it or throw it into the sea, so that the 
wizard may not obtain it.  The wizard having obtained something belonging to 
the person whom he wishes to injure, buries it in a deep hole, together with 
leaves of poisonous plants and sharp-pointed pieces of bamboo, accompanying 
the action by suitable incantations. If he chances to be a member of the 
Iniat society, he will place on the top of the whole one of their sacred 
stones, as they believe that so long as the stone is pressing down the 
article which has been buried in the hole the man to whom it belonged will 
remain sick.  Immediately a man falls sick, he sets enquiries on foot as to 
who has bewitched him. and there is always someone to acknowledge the soft 
impeachment.  If he does not succeed in having the spell removed he will 
almost certainly succumb. but if he succeeds in having lt taken away, he 
begins to recover almost immediately ; and the strange thing is that he 
evinces no enmity towards the person or persons who " bewitched him,-indeed 
it is taken as a matter of course, and he quietly waits the time when be 
will be able to return the compliment !
     These remarks apply for the most part to New Britain, and its system of 
magic is practically the same as that known in Fiji as vakadraunikau 
concerning which very little is known.  In ins work Melanesians and 
Polynesians the Rev. Dr. George Brown, the well-known pioneer missionary and 
explorer, gives an interesting account of the magical systems of these 
people, in which he incor-porates several informative letters from brother 
mission-aries, which are well worth quotation.  For example, the Rev. W. E. 
Bromilow says that at Dobu in south-eastern New Guinea :-
     “Werabana (evil spirits) are those which inhabit dark places, and 
wander in the night, and give witches their power to smite all round.  Barau 
is the wizardry of men, who look with angry eyes out of dark places, and 
throw small stones, first spitting on them, at men, women, and even 
children, thus causing death.  A tree falls, it is a witch who caused it to 
do so, though the tree may be quite rotten, or a gust of wind may break it 
off.  A man meets with an accident, it is the werabana.  He is getting 
better through the influence of the medicine-man, but has a relapse; this is 
the barau at work, as we have ascertained from the terrified shouts of our 
workmen, as some sleeper has called out in a horrid dream.  These medicine-
men, too, have great power, and no wonder, when one of our girls gets a 
little dust in her eye, and the doctor takes a big stone out of it; and when 
a chief has a pain in the chest, and to obaoba takes therefrom a two-inch 
nail.
     “The people here will have it that all evil spirits are female.  
Werabana is the great word, but the term is applied to witches as well, who 
are called the vesses of the werabana, but more often the single word is 
used.  I have the names of spirits inhabiting the glens and forests, but 
they are all women or enter into women, giving them terrible powers.  
Whenever any one is sick, it is the wera-bana who has caused the illness, 
and any old woman who happened to be at enmity with the sick person is set 
down as the cause.  A child died the other day, and the friends were quite 
angry because the witches had not heeded the words of the lotu, i.e., the 
Christian religion Taparoro, and given up smiting the little ones.   These 
are times of peace, said they, why should the child die then ? '  We, of 
course, took the opportunity and tried to teach them that sickness caused 
death without the influence of poor old women.
     Sorcerers are barau, men whose powers are more terrible than those of 
all the witches.  I was talking to a obaoba medicine-man-the other day, and 
I asked him why his taking a stone out of a man's chest did not cure him.   
‘Oh,' said he, 'he must have been smitten by a barau.'  A very logical 
statement this.  Cases the to obaoba cannot cure are under the fell stroke 
of the barau, from which there is no escape, except by the sorcerer's own 
incantations.
     “The Fijian sorcery of drau-ni-kau  appears here in another form called 
sumana or rubbish.  The sorcerer obtains possession of a small portion of 
his victim's hair, or skin, or food left after a meal, and carefully wraps 
it up in a parcel, which he sends off to as great a distance as is possible.  
In the meantime he very cunningly causes a report of the sumana to be made 
known to the man whom he wishes to kill, and the poor fellow is put into a 
great fright and dies."
    The Rev. S. B. Fellows gives the following account of the beliefs of the 
people of Kiriwina (Trobiands group):-
     “The sorcerers, who are very numerous, are credited with the power of 
creating the wind and rain, of making the gardens to be either fruitful or 
barren, and of causing sick-ness which leads to death.  Their methods of 
operation are legion.  The great chief, who is also the principal sorcerer, 
claims the sole right to secure a bountiful harvest every year.  This 
function is considered of transcendent im-portance by the people.
     “Our big chief, Bulitara, was asking me one day if I had these occult 
powers. When I told him that I made no such claim, he said, Who makes the 
wind and the rain and the harvest in your land? '  I answered, ' God.' 'Ah,' 
said he, ' that's it.  God does this work for your people, and I do it for 
our people.  God and I are equal.' He delivered this dictum very quietly, 
and with the air of a man who had given a most satisfactory explanation.
     “But the one great dread that darkens the life of every native is the 
fear of the bogau, the sorcerer who has the power to cause sickness and 
death, who, in the darkness of the night, steals to the house of his 
unsuspecting victim, and places near the doorstep a few leaves from a 
certain tree, containing the mystic power which he, by his evil arts, has 
imparted to them.  The doomed man, on going out of his house next morning, 
unwittingly steps over the fatal leaves and is at once stricken down by a 
mortal sickness.  Internal disease of every kind is set down to this agency. 
Bulitara told me the mode of his witchcraft.  He boils his decoctions, 
containing numerous ingredients, in a special cooking-pot on a small fire, 
in the secret recesses of his own house, at the dead of night; and while the 
pot is boiling he speaks into it an incantation known only to a few persons. 
The bunch of leaves dipped in this is at once ready for use.  Passing 
through the villages the other day, I came across a woman, apparently 
middle-aged, who was evidently suffering from a wasting disease, she was so 
thin and worn.  I asked if she had any pain, and her friends said 'No.'  
Then they explained that some bogau was sucking her blood.  I said, ' How 
does he do it? '  ‘ Oh,' they said, 'that is known only to herself.  He 
manages to get her blood which makes him strong, while she gets weaker every 
day, and if he goes on much longer she will die.'
     “Deformities at birth, and being born dumb or blind, are attributed to 
the evil influence of disembodied spirits, who inhabit a lower region called 
Tuma.  Once a year the spirits of the ancestors visit their native village 
in a body after the harvest is gathered.  At this time the men perform 
special dances, the people openly display their valuables, spread out on 
platforms, and great feasts are made for the spirits.  On a certain night, 
when the moon named Namarama is at the full, all the people  - men, women 
and children-join in raising a great shout, and so drive the spirits back to 
T'uma.
     “A peculiar custom prevails of wearing, as charms, various parts of the 
body of a deceased relative.  On her breast, suspended by a piece of string 
round her neck, a widow wears her late husband's lower jaw, the full set of 
teeth looking ghastly and grim. The small bones of the arms and legs are 
taken out soon after death, and formed into spoons, which are used to put 
lime into the mouth when eating betel-nut.  Only this week a chief died in a 
village three miles from us, and a leg and an arm, for the above purpose, 
were brought to our village by some relatives as their portion of their dead 
friend.
     “An evidence of the passionate nature of this people is seen in the 
comparatively frequent attempts at suicide. Their method is to climb into 
the top branches of a high tree, and, after tying the ankles together, to 
throw them-selves down.  During the last twelve months two attempts near our 
home were successful, and several others were prevented.  In some cases the 
causes were trivial.  One young man allowed his anger to master him because 
his wife had smoked a small piece of tobacco belonging to him; he fell from 
the tree across a piece of root, which was above ground and broke his neck.  
A woman, middle-aged and childless, who had become jealous, climbed into a 
tree near her house, and calling out " Good-bye' to her brother in the 
village, instantly threw herself down.  Falling on her head she died in a 
few hours; the thick skin on the scalp was cut, but so far as I could see 
the skull was not broken."
     Some of the minor magical customs of Polynesia are worthy of note.  
Natives of the Duke of York group believe that by persistent calling upon a 
man whom they wish to get hold of he will by their call be drawn to them, 
even from a great distance. The natives will not eat or drink when at sea.  
In New Guinea and Fiji the custom prevails of cutting off a finger joint in 
token of mourning for a near relative, as do the bushmen of South Africa. 
(See Magic, Prehistoric.)  They firmly believe in mer-maids, tailed men and 
dwarfs;  and regarding these they are most positive in their assertions.  
The natives of the Duke of York group in fact declared to a missionary that 
they had caught a mermaid, who had married a certain native, and that the 
pair had several of a family; but unfortunately," says the relater of this 
story, " I could never get to see them."  Like many other races, the 
Polynesians work themselves into a great state of terror whenever an eclipse 
takes place, and during the phenome-non they beat drums, shout and invoke 
their gods.
     In Samoa magic is not practised to such an extent as in other 
Melanesian groups, although the sorcerer still exists. He is, however, much 
more sophisticated, and instead of asking merely for any trifling object 
connected with the person whom he desires to bewitch, he demands property, 
such as valuable mats and other things which are of use to him.  His modus 
operandi was to get into communication with his god, who entered the 
sorcerer's body, which became violently contorted and convulsed. The 
assembled natives would then hear a voice speaking from behind a screen, 
probably a ventriloquial effort, which asserted the presence of the god 
invoked.  Sickness was generally believed to be caused by the anger of some 
god, who could thus be con-cealed by the priest or wizard and duly placated.  
The "god" invariably required some present of substantial value, such as a 
piece of land, a canoe, or other property, and if the priest happens to know 
of a particularly valuable object belonging to the person who supposed 
himself bewitched, he stipulates that it shall be given up to him. This 
caste of priests is known as taula-aitu, and also act as medicine-men.

Polytrix : This is almost the only example of an inauspicious stone.  It 
caused the hair to fall off the head of anyone who had it about his person.


Pontica : A blue stone with red stars, or drops and lines like blood.  It; 
compels the devil to answer questions, and puts him to flight.


Poppy Seeds: Divination by smoke was sometimes practised by magicians. A few 
jasmine or poppy seeds were flung upon burning coals, for this purpose; if 
the smoke rose lightly and ascended straight into the heavens, it augured 
well; but if it hung about it was regarded as a bad omen.

Postel, Guillaume : A visionary of the sixteenth Century, born in the 
diocese of Avranches.  He was so precocious that at fourteen years of age he 
was made master of a school.  It is said that he was in the habit of reading 
the most profound works of the Jewish rabbis, and the vivacity of his 
imagination threw him into constant troubles, from which he had the greatest 
difficulty in extricating himself. He believed that he had been called by 
God to re-unite all men under one law, either by reason or the sword.  The 
pope and the king of France were to be the civil and religious heads of his 
new republic.  He was made Almoner to a hospital at Venice, where he came 
under the influence of a woman called Mere Jeanne, who had visions which had 
turned her head.  Because of his heterodox preachings, Postel was denounced 
as a heretic, but latterly was regarded as merely mad.  After having 
travelled somewhat exten-sively in the East, and having written several 
works in which he dealt with the visions of his coadjutor, he retired to the 
priory of St. Martin-des-Champs at Paris, where he died penitent in 1581.


Posthumous Letters: Many investigators of psychic science, members of the 
Society for Psychic Research and others, have left sealed letters, whose 
contents are known only to the writer.  On the death of the writer, and 
before the letter shall have been opened, an attempt is made by a medium to 
reveal the contents.  By this means it is hoped to prove the actuality or 
otherwise of spirit communication, for, since only the writer knows what the 
letter contains, it is presumed that on his death this knowledge can only be 
communicated through his discarnate spirit.  This hypothesis certainly 
overlooks the fact that the information might be telepathically acquired 
during the writer's life-time by a still living person, and so conveyed to 
the medium. As yet, however, hypotheses are premature, for no attempt of the 
kind has met with striking success.


Powder of Projection : A powder which assisted the alchemist in the 
transmutation of base metal into pure gold.  (See Seton.)


Powder of Sympathy: A remedy which, by its application to the weapon which 
had caused a wound, was supposed to cure the hurt.  This method was in vogue 
during the reigns of James I. and Charles I., and its chief exponent was a 
gentleman named Sir Keneim Digby.  An abstract of his theory, contained in 
an address given before an assembly of nobles and learned men at Montpellier 
in France, may be seen in Pettigrew's Superstitions connected with Medicine 
and Surgery.  The following is the recipe for the powder :-" Take Roman 
vitriol six or eight ounces, beat it very small in a mortar, sift it through 
a fine sieve when the sun enters Leo; keep it in the heat of the sun by day, 
and dry by night."  This art has been treated by some authors with belief, 
and by others with unbelieving wit:- Wrenfels says :-“ If the superstitious 
person be wounded. by any chance, he applies the salve, not to the wound, 
but, what is more effectual to the weapon by which he received it."


Pozenne Vile : (See Slavs.)


Pratyshara:	One of the initial stages of yoga practice.


Precipitation of Matter : One of the phenomena of spiritual-ism which least 
admits of a rational explanation is that known as the ' passing of solids 
through solids."  The statement of the hypothetical fourth dimension of 
space is an attempt at a solution of the problem; so also is the theory of " 
precipitation of matter."  The latter suggests that before one solid body 
passes through another it is resolved into its component atoms, to be 
precipitated in its original form when the passage is accomplished.  M. 
Camille Flammarion found a parallel to this process in the passage of a 
piece of ice solid-through a napkin.  The ice passes through the napkin in 
the form of water, and may afterwards be re-frozen.  This is matter passing 
through matter, a solid passing through a solid, after it has undergone a 
change of condition.  And we are only carry-ing out M. Flammarion's 
inference in suggesting that it is something analogous to this process which 
occurs in all cases of solids passing through solids.

Prelati : (See Gillis de Laval.)

Premonition : An impressional warning of a future event. Premonitions may 
range from vague feelings of disquiet, suggestive of impending disaster, to 
actual hallucinations, whether visual or auditory.  Dreams are frequent 
vehicles of premonitions, either direct or symbolical, and there are 
countless instances of veridical dreams.  In such cases it is hard to say 
whether the warning may have come from an external source, as spiritualists 
aver, or whether the portended catastrophe may have resulted, in part, at 
least, from auto-suggestion.  The latter is plainly the explanation of 
another form of premonition-i.e., the predictions made by patients in the 
magnetic or medium-istic trance with regard to their maladies.  The magnetic 
subject who prophesied that his malady would reach a crisis on a certain 
date several weeks ahead, probably himself attended subconsciously to the 
fulfilling of his prophecy.  Might not the same thing happen in" veridical" 
dreams and hallucinations ?  We know that a subject obeying a post-hypnotic 
suggestion will weave his action quite naturally into the surrounding 
circumstances, though the very moment of its performance may have been fixed 
months before.  That the dreamer and hallucinated sub-ject also might 
suggest and fulfil their premonitions, either directly or by telepathic 
communication of the suggestion to another agent, does not seem very far-
fetched or im-probable.  Then there is, of course, coincidence.  It is 
impossible but that a certain proportion of verified premoni-tions should be 
the result of coincidence.  Possibly, also, such impressions, whether they 
remain vague forebodings or are embodied in dreams or otherwise, must at 
times be subconscious inferences drawn from an actual, if obscure, 
perception of existing facts.  As such, indeed, they are not to be lightly 
treated.  Yet very frequently premonitions prove to be entirely groundless, 
even the most impressive ones, where the warning is emphasized by a ghostly 
visitant.


Prenestine Lots, The : or Sortes Prenestinae.  A method of divination by 
lots, in vogue in Italy.  The letters of the alphabet were placed in an urn 
which was shaken, and the letters then turned out on the floor; the words 
thus formed were received as omens.  In the East this method of divination 
is still common.


Pretu (a departed ghost)  The form which the Hindus believe the soul takes 
after death.  This ghost inhabits a body of the size of a man's thumb, and 
remains in the keeping of Yumu, the judge of the dead.  Punishment is 
inflicted on the Pretu, whose body is enlarged for this purpose and is 
strengthened to endure sorrow.  At the end of a year the soul is delivered 
from this state by the performance of the Shraddhu, and is translated to the 
heaven of the Pitrees, where it is rewarded for its good deeds.  Afterwards, 
in a different body, the soul enters its final abode.  The performance of 
the Shraddhu is abso-lutely necessary to escape from the Pretu condition.


Prophecy : In an early state of society, the prophet and shaman were 
probably one and the same, as is still the case among primitive peoples.  It 
is difficult to say whether the offices of the prophet are more truly 
religious or magical. He is usually a priest, hut the ability to look into 
the future and read its portents can scarcely be called a religious 
attribute.  In many instances prophecy is merely utter-ances in the ecstatic 
condition.  We know that the python-esses attached to the oracles of ancient 
Greece uttered prophetic words under the influences of natural gases or 
drugs ; and when the medicine-men of most savage tribes attempt to peer into 
the future, they usually attain a condition of ecstasy by taking some drug, 
the action of which is well known to them.  But this was not always the 
case; the shaman often summoned a spirit to his aid to discover what 
portents and truths lie in the future but this cannot be called prophecy. . 
Neither is divination prophecy in the true sense of the term, as artificial 
aids are employed, and it is merely by the appearance of certain objects 
that the augur can pretend to predict future events. We often find prophecy 
disassociated from the ecstatic condition, as for example among the prophets 
of Israel, who occupied themselves in great measure with the calm statement 
of future political events, or those priests of the Maya Indians of Central 
America known as Chilan Balam, who at stated intervals in the year made 
certain statements regarding the period which lay immediately before them. 
Is prophecy then to be regarded as a direct utterance of the deity, taking 
man as his mouthpiece, or the statement of one who seeks inspiration from 
the fountain of wisdom ? Technically, both are true of prophecy, for we find 
it stated in scripture that when the deity desired to com-municate with man 
he chose certain persons as his mouth-pieces.  Again individuals (often the 
same as those chosen by God) applied to the deity for inspiration in 
critical moments. 'Prophecy then may be the utterances of God by the medium 
of the practically unconscious shaman or seer, or the inspired utterance of 
that person after inspira-tion has been sought from the deity.
     In ancient Assyria the prophetic class were called nabu, meaning "to 
call" or "announce,' '-a name prob-ably adopted from that of the god, Na-bi-
u, the speaker or proclaimer of destiny, the tablets of which he inscribed. 
Among the ancient Hebrews the prophet was called nabhia, a borrowed title 
probably adopted from the Canaanites. That is not to say, however, that the 
Hebrew nabhiim were indebted to the surrounding peoples for their prophetic 
system, which appears to have been of a much loftier type than that of the 
Canaanite peoples.  Prophets appear to have swarmed in Palestine in biblical 
times, and we are told that four hundred prophets of Baal sat at Jezebel's 
table.  The fact that they were prophets of this deity would almost go to 
prove that they were also priests. We find that the most celebrated prophets 
of Israel belonged to the northern portion of that country, which was more 
subject to the influence of the Canaanites.  Later, distinct prophetic 
societies were formed,-the chief reason for whose existence appears to have 
been the preservation of nationality; and this class appears to have 
absorbed the older castes of seers and magicians, and to some extent to have 
taken over their offices.  Some of the later prophets,-Micah, for example-
appear to have regarded some of these lesser seers as mere diviners, who 
were in reality not unlike the prophets of Baal.  With Amos may he said to 
have commenced a new school of prophecy-the canonical prophets, who were 
also authors and historians, and who disclaimed all connection with mere 
professional prophets. The general idea in Hebrew Palestine was that Yahveh, 
or God, was in the closest possible touch with the prophets, and that he 
would do nothing without revealing it to them. The greatest importance was 
given to their utterances, which more than once determined the fate of the 
nation. Indeed no people has lent so close an ear to the utterance of their 
prophetic class as did the Jews of old times.
     In ancient Greece, the prophetic class were generally found attached to 
the oracles, and in Home were repre-sented by the augurs.  In Egypt the 
priests of Ra at Memphis acted as prophets, as, perhaps, did those of Hekt. 
Among the ancient Celts and Teutons, prophecy was fre-quent, the prophetic 
agent usually placing him or herself in the ecstatic condition. The Druids 
were famous practi-tioners of the prophetic art, and some of their 
utterances may be still extant in the so-called Prophecies of Merlin. In 
America, as has been stated, prophetic utterance took practically the same 
forms as in Europe and Asia.  Captain Jonathan Carver, an early traveller in 
North America, cites a peculiar instance where the seers of a certain tribe 
stated that a famine would be ended by assistance being sent from another 
tribe at a certain hour on the following day.  At the very moment mentioned 
by them a canoe rounded a headland, bringing news of relief.  A strange 
story was told in the Atlantic Monthly some years ago by a traveller among 
the Plains tribes, who stated that an Indian medicine-man had prophesied the 
coming of him-self and his companions to his tribe two days before their 
arrival among them.

Psychic  A sensitive, one susceptible to psychic influences, A psychic is 
not necessarily a medium, unless he is suffi-ciently sensitive to be 
controlled by disembodied spirits. The term psychic includes the somnambule, 
the magnetic or mesmeric subject, anyone who is in any degree sensitive, 
According to one view, all men a-e in some measure sus-ceptible to spiritual 
influences, and to that extent deserve the name of psychic.


Psychic Body  A spiritualistic term variously applied to an impalpable body 
which clothes the soul on the "great dissolution," or to the soul itself.  
Sergeant Cox in his Mechanism of Man declares that the soul-quite distinct 
from mind, or intelligence, which is only a function of the brain-is 
composed of attenuated matter, and has the same form as the physical body, 
which it permeates in every part.  From the soul radiates the psychic force, 
by means of which all the wonders of spiritualism are performed. Through its 
agency man becomes endowed with telekinetic and clairvoyant powers, and with 
its aid he can affect such natural forces as gravitation.  When free of the 
body the soul can travel at a lightning speed, nor is it hindered by such 
material objects as stone walls or closed doors, The psychic body is also 
regarded as an intermediary between the physical body and the soul, a sort 
of envelope, more material than the soul itself, which encloses it at death.  
It is this envelope, the psychic body or nervengeist, which becomes visible 
at a materialisation by attracting to itself other and still more material 
particles.  In time the psychic body decays just as did the physical, and 
leaves the soul free.  During the trance the soul leaves the body, but the 
vital functions are continued by the psychic body.


Psychical Research : A term covering all scientific investiga-tion into the 
obscure phenomena connected with the so-called "supernatural," undertaken 
with a view to their elucidation.  Certain of these phenomena are known all 
over the world, and have remained practically unaltered almost since 
prehistoric times.  Such are the phenomena of levitation, the fire-ordeal, 
crystal-gazing, thought-reading and apparitions, and whenever these were met 
with there was seldom lacking the critical enquiry of some psychical 
researcher, not borne away on the tide of popular credulity, but reserving 
some of his judgment for the impartial investigation of the manifestations.  
Thus Gaule, in his Select Cases of Conscience touching Witches and 
Witchcraft (London, 1646), says : " But the more prodigious or Stupendous 
(of the feats mentioned in the witches' con-fessions) are effected meerly by 
the devill the witch all the while either in a rapt ecstasie, a charmed 
sleepe, or a melancholy dreame; and the witches' imagination, phan-tasie, 
common sense, only deluded with what is now done, or pretended."  And a few 
other writers of the same period arrived at a similar conclusion.  The 
result of many of these medieval records was to confirm the genuineness of 
the phenomena witnessed, but here and there, even in those days, there were 
sceptics who refused to see in them any supernatural significance.  
Poltergeist disturbances, again, came in for a large share of attention and 
investigation, to which, indeed, they seemed to lend themselves.  The case 
of the Drummer of Tedworth was examined by Joseph Glanvil, and the results 
set forth in his Sadducisimus Triumphatus, published in 1668. The Epworth 
Case, which occurred in the house of John Wesley's father, called forth many 
comments, as did also the Cock Lane Ghost. the Stockwell Poltergeist and 
many others.  The Animal Magnetists and their successors the Mesmerists may, 
in a manner, be considered psychical researchers, since these variants of 
hypnosis were the fruits of prolonged investiga-tion into the phenomena 
which indubitably existed in connection with the trance state.  If their 
speculations were wild and their enquiries failed to elicit the truth of the 
matter, it was but natural, at that stage of scientific progress, that they 
should be so.  And here and there even in the writings of Paracelsus and 
Mesmer we find that they had glimpses of scientific truths which were in 
advance of their age, foreshadowings of scientific discoveries which were to 
prove the triumph of future generations.  The former, for example, states in 
his writings  ' By the magic power of the will, a person on this side of the 
ocean may make a person on the other side hear what is said on this 
side..... The ethereal body of a man may know what another man thinks at a 
distance of 100 miles and more." This reads uncommonly like an anticipation 
of telepathy, which has attained to such remarkable prominence in recent 
years, though it is not now generally attributed to "the ethereal body of a 
man."  Such things as these would seem to entitle many of the mesmerists and 
the older mystics to the designation of " psychical researchers."
     As knowledge increased and systematised methods came into use these 
enquiries became ever more searching and more fruitful in definite results.  
The introduction of modern spiritualism in 1848 undoubtedly gave a 
remarkable impetus to psychical research.  The movement was so widespread. 
its effects so apparent, that it was inevitable but that some man of science 
should be drawn into an examination of the alleged phenomena, Thus we find 
engaged in the investigation of spiritualism Carpenter, Faraday and De 
Morgan, and on the Continent Count de Gasparin, M. Thury and Zollner.  One 
of the most im-portant of individual investigators was undoubtedly Sir 
William Crookes, who worked independently for some time before the founding 
of the Society for Psychical Research.
     However, although much good work was done by inde-pendent students of  
psychic science," as it came to be called, and by such societies as the 
Dialectical Society (q.v.) and the Psychological Society (q.v.), it was not 
until 1882 that a concerted and carefully-organised attempt was made to 
elucidate those obscure problems which had so long puzzled the wits of 
learned and simple.  In that year was founded the Society for Psychical 
Research, with the object of examining in a scientific and impartial spirit 
the realm of the supernatural.  The following passage from the Society's 
original prospectus, quoted by Mr. Podmore in his Naturalisation of the 
Supernatural, indicates with sufficient clearness its aim and proposed 
methods,
     “It has been widely felt that the present is an opportune time for 
making an organised and systematic attempt to investigate that large group 
of debatable phenomena designated by such terms as mesmeric, psychical, and 
spiritualistic.
     “From the recorded testimony of many competent witnesses, past and 
present, including observations recently made by scientific men of eminence 
in various countries, there appears to be, amid much delusion and deception, 
an important body of remarkable phenomena, which are prima facie 
inexplicable on any generally recognised hypothesis, and which, if 
incontestably established, would be of the highest possible value.
     "The task of examining such residual phenomena has often been 
undertaken by individual effort, but never hitherto by a scientific society 
organised on a sufficiently broad basis."
     The first president of the Society was Professor Henry Sidgwick, and 
among later presidents were Professor Balfour Stewart, Professor William 
James, Sir William Crookes, Mr. A. J. Balfour, Professor Richet and Sir 
Oliver Lodge, while prominent among the original members were Frank Podmore, 
F. W. H. Myers, Edmund Gurney, Pro-fessor Barrett, Rev. Stainton Moses and 
Mrs. Sidgwick. Lord Rayleigh and Andrew Lang were also early members of the 
Society.  Good work was done in America in con-nection with the Society by 
Dr. Hodgson and Professor Hyslop.  On the continent Lombroso, Maxwell, 
Camille Flammarion, and Professor Richet - all men of the highest standing 
in their respective branches of science - con-ducted exhaustive researches 
into the phenomena of spiritualism, chiefly in connection with the Italian 
medium Eusapia Palladino.
     At first the members of the Society for Psychical Research found it 
convenient to work in concert, but as they became more conversant with the 
broad outlines of the subject, it was judged necessary for certain sections 
or individuals to specialise in various branches. The original plan sketched 
roughly in 1882 grouped the phenomena under five different heads, each of 
which was placed under the direction of a separate Committee.
     1.-An examination of the nature and extent of any influence which may 
be exerted by one mind upon another, apart from any generally recognised 
mode of perception. (Hon. Sec. of Committee, Professor W. F. Barrett.)
     2.-The study of hypnotism, and the forms of so-called mesmeric trance, 
with its alleged insensibility to pain; clairvoyance, and other allied-
phenomena.  (Hon. Sec. of Committee, Dr. G. Wyld.)
     3.-A critical revision of Reichenbach's researches with certain 
organisations called "sensitive," and an inquiry whether such organisations 
possess any power of perception beyond a highly-exalted sensibility of the 
recognised sensory organs.  (Hon. Sec. of Committee, Walter H. Coffin.)
     4.-A careful investigation of any reports, resting on strong testimony, 
regarding apparitions at the moment of death, or otherwise, or regarding 
disturbances in houses reputed to be haunted.  (Hon. Sec. of Committee, 
Hensleigh Wedgwood.)
     5.-An enquiry into the various physical phenomena commonly called 
spiritualistic  with an attempt to discover their causes and general laws.  
(Hon. Sec., Dr. C. Lockhart Robertson.)
     Besides these there was a Committee appointed to con-sider the 
literature of the subject, having as its honorary secretaries Edmund Gurney 
and Frederic W. H. Myers, who, with Mr. Podmore, collected a number of 
historic instances.  Of the various heads, however, the first is now 
generally considered the most important, and is certainly that which has 
yielded the best results to investigators.  In the case of hypnotism it is 
largely through the exertions of psychical researchers that it has been 
admitted to the sphere of legitimate physiology, whereas it was formerly 
classed among doubtful phenomena, even at the time the Society was founded.  
The examination of Reichenbach's claims to having discovered a new psychic 
fluid or force-odyle (q.v.)-which issued like flame from the points of a 
magnet or the human finger-tips, was at length abandoned, nothing having 
been found to verify his conclusions which, however, previous to this had 
been largely accepted.  The investigations in connection with apparitions 
and haunted houses, and with the spiritualistic phenomena, are still 
proceeding, though on the whole no definite conclusion has been arrived at. 
Though the members of the Society under-took to carry out their 
investigations in an entirely unbiased spirit, and though those members who 
joined the Society originally as avowed spiritualists soon dropped out, yet 
after prolonged and exhaustive research the opinion of the various 
investigators often showed marked divergence.  So far from being pledged to 
accept a spirit, or any other hypothesis, it was expressly stated in a note 
appended to the prospectus that ' Membership of this Society does not imply 
the acceptance of any particular explanation of the phenomena investigated, 
nor any belief as to the operation, in the physical world, of forces other 
than those recognised by Physical Science."  Nevertheless Mr. Myers and Sir 
Oliver Lodge, to take two notable instances, found the evidence sufficient 
to convince them of the operation in the physical world of disembodied 
intelligences, who manifest themselves through the organism of the "medium" 
or "sensitive."  Mr. Podmore, on the other hand, was the exponent of a 
telepathic theory.  Any phase of the" mani-festations " which was not 
explicable by means of such known physiological facts as suggestion and 
hyperaesthesia, the so-called "subconscious whispering," exaltation of 
memory and automatism, or the unfamiliar but presumably natural telepathy, 
must, according to him, fall under the grave suspicion of fraud.  His theory 
of poltergeists, for example, by which he regards these uncanny disturbances 
as being the work of naughty children, does not admit the intervention of a 
mischievous disembodied spirit.  In coincident hallucination, again, he 
considers telepathy a suitable explanation, as well as in all cases of 
"personation" by the medium.  His view - one that was shared by Andrew Lang 
and others-was that if telepathy were once estab-lished the spirit 
hypothesis would not only be unnecessary, but impossible of proof.
     The most important of telepathic experiments were those conducted by 
Professor and Mrs. Sidgwick in 1889-91.  The percipients were hypnotised by 
Mr. G. A. Smith, who also acted as agent, and the matter to be transmitted 
consisted at first of numbers and later of mental pictures.  The agent and 
percipient were generally separated by a screen, or were sometimes in 
different rooms, though the results in the latter case were perceptibly less 
satisfactory.  On the whole, however, the percentage of correct guesses was 
far above that which the doctrine of chance warranted, and the experiments 
did much to encourage a belief that some hitherto unknown mode of 
communication existed. More recently the trance communication of Mrs. Piper 
would seem to point to some such theory, though Mr. Myers, Dr. Hodgson and 
Dr. Hyslop, who conducted a very pro-found investigation into those 
communications, were in-clined to believe that the spirits of the dead were 
the agencies in this case.  Telepathy cannot yet be considered as proved. At 
the best it is merely a surmise, which, if it could be established, would 
provide a natural explanation for much of the so-called occult phenomena.  
Even its most ardent protagonists admit that its action is extremely 
uncertain and experiment correspondingly difficult.  Nevertheless, each year 
sees an increasing body of scientific and popular opinion favourable to the 
theory, so that we may hope that the surmised mode of communication may at 
last be within a reasonable distance of becoming an acknowledged fact. The 
machinery of telepathy is generally supposed to be in the form of ethereal 
vibrations, or ' brain waves,"
acting in accordance with natural laws, though Mr. Gerald Balfour and others 
incline to an entirely metamorphosed theory, urging, e.g., that the action 
does not conform to the law of inverse squares.
     The subject of hallucinations, coincidental or otherwise, has also been 
largely investigated in recent years, and has been found to be closely 
connected with the question of telepathy. Apparitions were in former times 
regarded as the " doubles " or " ethereal bodies" of the persons they 
represented, but they are not now considered to be other-wise than 
subjective.  Nevertheless the study of " coinci-dental hallucinations "-
i.e.,  hallucinatory apparitions which coincide with the death of the person 
represented, or with some other crises in his life - raises the question as 
to whether the agent may not produce such an hallucination in the mind of 
the percipient by the exercise of telepathic influence, which may be judged 
to be more powerful during an emotional crisis.  Now hallucinations have 
been shown to be fairly common among sane people, about one person in ten 
having experienced one or more.  But the chances that such an hallucination 
should coincide with the death of the person it represents are about, I in 
19,000 ; that is, if no other factor than chance determines their ratio. 
With a view to ascertaining whether coincidental hallucinations did actually 
bear a higher proportion to the total number of hallucinations than chance 
would justify, the Society for Psychical Research took a census in 1889 and 
the three or four years immediately following.  Professor Sidgwick and a 
committee of members of the Society conducted the investigations and printed 
forms were distributed among 410 accredited agents of the Society, 
including, besides its own members, many medical men and others belonging to 
the professional classes, all of whom gave their services without fee in the 
interests of science.  In all some 17,000 persons were questioned, and 
negative as well as affirmative answers were sent in just as they were 
received, the agents being specially instructed to make no discrimination 
between the various replies.  Out of 8372 men 655 had had an hallucination, 
and 1029 out of 8628 women-9. 9 % of the total.  When ample allowance had 
been made for defects of memory with regard to early hallucinations by 
multi-plying the 322 recognised and definite cases by 4, it was found that 
62 coincided with a death; but, again making allowances, this number was 
reduced to 30.  Thus we find I coincidental hallucination in 43 where, there 
being no causal connection we should expect I in 19,000. Clearly, then, if 
these figures be taken, there must be some causal connection between the 
death and the apparition, whether it be a spiritualistic or telepathic 
theory that may be used. Though it be true that memory plays strange tricks, 
yet is it difficult to understand how persons of education and standing 
could write down and attest minutes and dated records of events that never 
happened.
     Apart from telepathy, which because it postulates the working of a 
hitherto unknown natural law, takes premier place, perhaps the most 
interesting field of research is that of automatism.  Trance writings and 
utterances have been known since the earliest times, when they were 
attributed to demoniac possession, or, sometimes, angelic possession.  By 
means of planchette, ouija, and such contrivances many people are able to 
write automatically and divulge information which they themselves were 
unaware of possessing.  But here again the phenomena are purely subjective, 
and are the result of cerebral dissocia-tion, such as may be induced in 
hypnosis.  In this state exaltation of the memory may occur, and thus 
account for such phenomena as the speaking in foreign tongues with which the 
agent is but ill-acquainted.  Or, conceivably, cerebral dissociation may 
produce a sensitiveness to telepathic influences, as would seem apparent in 
the case of Mrs. Piper, whose automatic productions in writing and speaking 
have supplied investigators with plentiful material of recent years, and 
have done inure, perhaps, than any-thing else to stimulate an interest in 
so-called spiritualistic phenomena.  In connection with the,' physical" 
phenom-ena-probably no less the result of automatism than the “subjective," 
though in a different direction-the Italian medium Eusapia Palladino has 
been carefully studied by many eminent investigators both in Great Britain 
and on the Continent, with the result that Camille Flammarion, Pro-fessor 
Richet, Sir Oliver Lodge-to mention only a few-have satisfied themselves 
with regard to the genuineness of some of her phenomena.
     On the whole, even if psychical research has not succeeded in 
demonstrating such matters as the immortality of the soul or the possibility 
of communication between the living and the dead, it has done good work in 
widening the field of psychology and therapeutics and in gaining admission 
for that doctrine of suggestion which since the time of Bertrand and Braid 
had never been openly received and acknowledged by the medical profession.  
Many of the obscure phenom-ena attending mesmerism, magnetism, witchcraft, 
polter-geists, and kindred subjects have been brought into line with modern 
scientific knowledge.  Little more than thirty years has elapsed since the 
Society for Psychical Research was founded, and probably in time to come it 
will accomplish still more, both in conducting experiments and 
investigations in connection with psychic phenomena, and in educating the 
public in the use of scientific methods and habits of thought in their 
dealings with the" supernatural."


Psychograph : An instrument to facilitate automatic writing. It is composed 
of a rotating disc, on which the medium's finger-tips are placed, thus 
carrying an index over the alphabet.  A similar contrivance was used by 
Professor Hare in his spiritualistic experiments.


Psychography  Writing produced without human contact, and supposed to be the 
work of the spirits.


Psychological Society, The : The Psychological Society came into being in 
April, 1875, having as its founder and president Sergeant Cox, and numbering 
among its members the Rev. William Stainton Moses, Mr. Walter H. Coffin, and 
Mr. C. C. Massey.  The avowed aim of the Society, as set forth in the 
president's inaugural address, was the elucidation of those, spiritualistic 
and other problems now grouped under the term " psychical research," and to 
which the Society somewhat loosely attached the designation of psychology. 
To this end they proposed to collect and consider the available material 
bearing on psychic phenom-ena, but in reality they accomplished little of 
any practical value, as may be seen from their published Proceedings 
(London, 1878).  The president himself had not  the necessary scientific 
qualifications for an investigator of such phenomena.  In November, 1879, on 
the death of its president, the Society came to an end.  But though the 
Psychological Society regarded the psychic phenomena from a more or less 
popular standpoint, and conducted its investigations in a somewhat 
superficial manner, neverthe-less it contained that germ of scientific 
enquiry into the domain of psychic science which, a few years later, in the 
Society for Psychical Research, was to raise the study to a level where it 
became worthy of the attention of philosopher and scientist.  Hitherto those 
who were satisfied of the genuineness of the spiritualistic marvels had for 
the most part been content to accept the explanation of spirit intervention, 
but the Psychological Society was the crystal-lisation of a small body of" 
rationalist" opinion which had existed since the days of Mesmer.  Sergeant 
Cox, in his work, The Mechanism of Man states that " spirit " is refined 
matter, or molecular matter split into its constituent atoms, which thus 
become imperceptible to our physical organism; a view which was possibly 
shared by the Psychological Society.


Psychomancy : Divination by spirits or the art of evoking the dead.  (See 
Necromancy.)


Psychometry : A term used by spiritualists to denote the faculty, supposed 
to be common among mediums, of read-ing the characters, surroundings, etc. 
of persons by holding in the hand small objects, such as a watch or ring, 
which they have had in their possession.  The honour of having discovered 
the psychometric faculty belongs to Dr. J. R. Buchanan, who classed it among 
the sciences, and gave it the name it bears.  His theory is based on the 
belief that everything that has ever existed, every object, scene, event, 
that has occurred since the beginning of the world, has left on the ether or 
astral light a trace of its being, indelible while the world endures; and 
not only on the ether, but likewise on more palpable objects, trees and 
stones and all manner of things.  Sounds also, and perfumes leave 
impressions on their surroundings.  Just as a photograph may be taken on a 
plate and remain invisible till it has been developed, so may those 
psychometric" photographs" remain impalpable till the developing process has 
been applied.  And that which is to bring them to light is-the mind of the 
medium.  All mediums are said to possess the psychometric faculty in a 
greater or less degree.  One authority, Professor William Denton, has 
declared that he found it in one man in every ten, and four women in ten. 
Dr. Buchanan's earliest experiments, with his own students, showed that some 
of them were able to distinguish the different metals merely by holding them 
in their hands. On medical substances being put into their hands they 
exhibited such symptoms as might have been occasioned if the substances were 
swallowed.  Later he found that some among them could diagnose a patient's 
disease simply by holding his hand.  Many persons of his acquaintance, on 
pressing a letter against their forehead, could tell the character and 
surroundings of the writer, the circumstances under which the letter was 
written and other particulars. Some very curious stories are told of 
fossilised bones and teeth revealing to the sensitives the animals they 
represent in the midst of their prehistoric surroundings.  Professor Denton 
gave to his wife and mother-in-law meteoric frag-ments and other substances, 
wrapped in paper and thor-oughly mixed to preclude the possibility of 
telepathy, which caused them to see the appropriate pictures. Many mediums 
who have since practised psychometry have become famous in their line.  As 
has been said, the modus is to hold in the hand or place against the 
forehead some small object, such as a fragment of clothing, a letter, or a 
watch, when the appropriate visions are seen.  Psy-chometrists may he 
entranced, but are generally in a con-dition scarcely varying from the 
normal.  The psychometric pictures, printed presumably on the article to be 
psychome-trised, have been likened to pictures borne in the memory, 
seemingly faded, yet ready to start into vividness when the right spring is 
touched.  We may likewise suppose that the rehearsal of bygone tragedies so 
frequently witnessed in haunted houses, is really a psychometric picture 
which at the original occurrence impressed itself on the room. The same may 
be said of the sounds and perfumes which haunt certain houses.


Psylli: A class of persons in Ancient Italy who had the power of charming 
serpents. This name is given by other writers to the snake-charmers of 
Africa, and it is said that the serpents twist round the bodies of these 
Psylli without doing them any injury, although the reptiles have not had 
their fangs extracted or broken.  In Kahira when a viper enters a house, the 
charmer is sent for, and he entices it out by the use of certain words.  At 
other times music is used, and it is believed that the serpents understand 
what
is said to them by the snake-charmers, so obedient are they.


Purgatory of St. Patrick  (See Ireland.)


Purrah, The : A secret society of the Tulka-Susus, an African tribe who 
dwell between the Sierra Leone river and Cape mount.  The Tulka consist of 
five small communities which together form a description of republic.  Each 
group has its own chiefs and council, but all are under a controlling-power 
which is called the Purrah. Each of the five com-munities has also its own 
purrah, from which is formed the great or general purrah, which holds 
supreme sway over the five bodies.  Before a native can join a district 
purrah, he must be thirty years of age, and ere he can be received into 
membership of the great purrah, he must have reached the age of fifty. Thus 
the oldest members of each district purrah are members of the head purrah.  
On desiring admittance to the examination for the district purrah, the 
relations of the candidate must swear td kill him if he does not stand the 
test, or if he reveals the mysteries and the secrets of the society.  
Froebenius says :-" In each district belonging to a purrah there is a sacred 
grove to which the candidate is conducted, and where he must stay in a place 
assigned to him, living for several months quite alone in a hut, whither 
masked persons bring him food. He must neither speak nor leave his appointed 
place of residence.
     "Should he venture into the surrounding forest, he is as good as dead. 
     “After several months the candidate is admitted to stand his trial, 
which is said to be terrible.  Recourse is had to all the elements in order 
to gain satisfaction as to his firmness and courage.  We are even assured 
that at these mysteries use is made of fettered lions and leopards, that 
during the time of the tests and enrolment the sacred groves echo with 
fearful shrieks, that here great fires are seen at night, that formerly the 
fire flared up in these mysterious woods in all directions, that every 
outsider who through curiosity was tempted to stray into the woods was 
mercilessly sacrificed, that foolish people who would have penetrated into 
them disappeared and were never heard of again.
     “If the candidate stands all the tests, he is admitted to the 
initiation. But he must first swear to keep all the secrets and without 
hesitation carry out the decisions of the purrah of his community and all 
the decrees of the great head purrah.  If a member of the society betrays it 
or revolts against it, he is condemned to death, and the sen-tence is often 
carried out in the bosom of his family.  When the criminal least expects it, 
a disguised, masked and armed warrior appears and says to him
     “’The great purrah sends thee death!’
     "At these words everybody stands back, no one dares to offer the least 
resistance, and the victim is murdered.
     "The Court of each district purrah consists of twenty-five members, and 
from each of these separate courts five persons are chosen, who constitute 
the great purrah, or the High Court of the general association.  Hence this 
also consists of twenty-five persons, who elect the head chief from their 
own body.
      "The special purrah of each community investigates the offences 
committed in its district, sits in judgment on them, and sees that its 
sentences are carried out.  It makes peace between the powerful families, 
and stops their wranglings.
     "The great purrah meets only on special occasions, and pronounces 
judgment on those who betray the mysteries and secrets of the order, or on 
those who show themselves disobedient to its mandates.  But usually it puts 
an end to the feuds that often break out between two communities belonging 
to the confederacy. When these begin to fight, after a few months of mutual 
hostilities, one or other of the parties, when they have inflicted 
sufficient injury on each other, usually wants peace. The commune repairs 
secretly to the great purrah, and invites it to become the mediator and put 
an end to the strife.
     “Thereupon the great purrah meets in a neutral dis-trict, and when all 
are assembled announces to the com-munes at war that it cannot allow men who 
should live together as brothers, friends and good neighbours, to wage war, 
to waste each others' lands, to plunder and burn; that it is time to put an 
end to these disorders ; that the great purrah will inquire into the cause 
of the strife ; that it requires that this should cease and decrees that all 
hostilities be forthwith arrested.
     “A main feature of this arrangement is that, as soon as the great 
purrah assembles to put a stop to the feud, and until its decision is given, 
all the belligerents of the two districts at war are forbidden to shed a 
drop of blood this always carries with it the penalty of death.  Hence 
everybody is careful not to infringe this decree, and abstains from all 
hostilities.
     “The session of the High Court lasts one month, during which it 
collects all necessary information to ascertain which commune caused the 
provocation and the rupture. At the same time it summons as many of the 
society's fighting-men as may be required to carry out the decision. When 
all the necessary particulars are brought in, and everything is duly 
weighed, it settles the question by condemning the guilty commune to a four 
days' sack.
     "The warriors who have to give effect to this decision are all chosen 
from the neutral districts ; they set out by night from the place where the 
great purrah is assembled. All are disguised, the face being covered with an 
ugly mask, and armed with lighted torches and daggers.  They divide into 
bands of forty, fifty, or sixty, and all meet unexpectedly before dawn in 
the district that they have to pillage, pro-claiming with fearful shouts the 
decision of the High Court. On their approach men, women, children and old 
people, all take to flight, that is, take refuge in their houses, and should 
anyone be found in the fields, on the highway, or in any other place, he is 
either killed or carried off and no more is ever heard of him.
     "The booty obtained by such plundering is divided into two parts, one 
of which is given to the injured commune, the other to the great purrah, 
which shares it with the warriors that have executed its decree.  This is 
the reward for their zeal, their obedience and loyalty. 
     “If one of the families in a commune subject to the purrah becomes too 
powerful and too formidable, the great purrah meets, and nearly always 
condems it to unexpected sack, which is carried out by night and, as usual, 
by masked and disguised men.  Should the heads of such a dangerous family 
offer any resistance, they are killed, or carried off, and conveyed to the 
depths of a sacred and lonely grove where they are tried by the purrah for 
their insubordination they are seldom heard of again.
     “Such, in part, is the constitution of this extraordinary institution.  
Its existence is known ; the display of its power is felt ; it is dreaded  
yet the veil covering its intentions, decisions and decrees is impenetrable, 
and not till he is about to be executed does the outlaw know that he has 
been condemned. The power and reputation of the purrah is immense, not only 
in the homeland, but also in the surrounding districts.  It is reported to 
be in league with the spirits (instead of the devil).
     “According to the general belief the number of armed men who are 
members and at the disposal of the purrah exceeds 6,000.  Moreover, the 
rules, the Secrets and the mysteries of this society are strictly obeyed and 
observed by its numerous associated members, who understand and recognise 
each other by words and signs."


Puysegur  (See Hypnotism.)


Pyromanoy, or divining by fire, has been alluded to in Extis
pley. The presage was good when the flame was vigorous and quickly consumed 
the sacrifice; when it was clear of all smoke, transparent, neither red, nor 
dark in colour when it did not crackle, but burnt silently in a pyramidal 
form.  On the contrary, if it was difficult to kindle, if the wind disturbed 
it, if it was slow to consume the victim, the presage was evil.  Besides the 
sacrificial fire, the ancients divined by observing the flames of torches, 
and even by throwing powdered pitch into a fire; if it caught quickly, the 
omen was good. The flame of a torch was good if it formed one point, bad if 
it divided into two; but three was a better omen than one.  Sickness for the 
healthy, and death for the sick, was presaged by the bending of the flame, 
and some frightful disaster by its sudden extinction. The vestals in the 
Temple of Minerva at Athens were charged to make particular observations on 
the light per-petually burning there.

tusks, flaming hair, and insati-able hunger.  They wander about the forests 
catching animals and eating them.  Mr. Campbell tells a Mahrata legend of a 
master who became a Brahmaparusha in order to teach grammar to a pupil.  He 
haunted a house at Benares, and the pupil went to take lessons from him.  He 
promised to teach him the whole science in a year on condition that he never 
left the house.  One day the boy went out and learned that the house was 
haunted, and that he was being taught by a ghost. The boy returned and was 
ordered by the preceptor to take his bones to Gaya, and perform the 
necessary ceremonies for the emancipation of his soul.  This he did, and the

Raphael, the Angel : In the prophecy of Enoch it is said that    Raphael 
presides over the spirits of men."  In the Jewish rabbinical legend of the 
angelic hierarchies Raphael is the medium through which the power of Tse-
baoth, or the Lord of hosts, passes into the sphere of the sun, giving 
motion, heat and brightness to it..


Rapping   Phenomena of knockings  or  rappings  have always accompanied 
poltergeistic disturbances, even before the commencement of the modern 
spiritualistic movement. Thus they were observed in the case of the  Drummer 
of Tedworth" (q.v.), the "Cock Lane Ghost," and other disturbances of the 
kind, and also in the presence of various somnambules, such as the Seeress 
of Prevorst (q.v.). With the " Rochester Rappings "-the famous outbreak at 
Hydesville in 1848, to which may be directly traced the beginning of modern 
Spiritualism-the phenomenon took on a new importance, rapidly increased to 
an epidemic, remained throughout the earlier stages of the movements the 
chief mode of communication with the spirits.  Though it was afterwards 
supplanted to some extent by more elaborate and complicated phenomena, it 
continued, and still continues, to occupy a place of some importance among 
the manifestations of the seance-room.  It is apparent from descriptions 
furnished by witnesses that the raps varied considerably both in quality and 
intensity, being sometimes characterised as dull thuds, sometimes as clear 
sounds like an electric spark, and again as deep, vibrating tones. Doubtless 
the methods by which they are produced vary quite as much.  It has been 
shown, in fact, that raps may be produced by the ankle-joints, knee-joints, 
shoulders, and other joints, one man-the Rev. Eli Noyes - claiming to have 
discovered seventeen different methods.  There are also instances on record 
where specially constructed medium " tables were responsible for the 
manifestations. Besides the frankly spiritualistic explanation and the 
frankly sceptical one of fraud, there have been other scientific or pseudo-
scientific theories advanced, such as electricity, odyle, ectenic force, or 
magnetism.


Rapport : A mystical sympathetic or antipathetic connection between two 
persons.  It was formerly believed that for a witch to harm her victims, the 
latter must first have become in rapport with her, either by contact with 
her person, or by contact with some garment she has worn.  A certain witch, 
Florence Newton, was accused of establishing rapport between herself and 
those she sought to bewitch by kissing them, whereby she was able to compass 
their destruction, In the practice of animal magnetism it was considered 
that the only invariable and characteristic symptom of the genuine trance 
was the rapport between patient and opera-tor.  The former was deaf, dumb, 
blind, to all save his magnetizer, and those with whom his magnetizer placed 
him in rapport. This condition, however, still observed in hypnotism, is 
referable to a perfectly natural cause.  (See Hypnotism.)  The term is 
preserved at the present day in Spiritualism, when it signifies a spiritual 
sympathy between the ' control" and the medium or any of the sitters. The 
medium-or, more properly, the control-may be placed in rapport with anyone 
who is absent or dead, merely by handling something which has belonged to 
them.  It is for a similar reason that the crystal is held for a few moments 
prior to the inspection by the person on whose behalf the crystal-gazer is 
about to examine it.

Red Man : The demon of the tempests.  He is supposed to be furious when the 
rash voyager intrudes on his solitude, and to show his anger in the winds 
and storms.
     The French peasants believed that a mysterious little red man appeared 
to Napoleon to announce coming reverses.

Red Pigs : It was formerly believed that Irish witches could turn wisps of 
straw or hay into red pigs, which they sold at the market.  But when the 
pigs were driven homeward by the buyers, they resumed their original shape 
on cross-ing running water.

Reincarnation is an extremely important part of Theosophical theory, and, 
while it is commonly regarded as a succession of lives, the proper aspect in 
which to regard it is as one single, indivisible life, the various 
manifestations in the flesh being merely small portions of the whole.  The 
Monad, the Divine Spark, the Ego-whose individuality remains the same 
throughout the whole course of reincarnation-is truly a denizen of the three 
higher worlds, the spiritual, the intuitional and the higher mental, but in 
order to further its growth and the widening of its experience and know-
ledge, it is necessary that it should descend into the worlds of denser 
matter, the lower mental, the actual and the physical, and take back with it 
to the higher worlds what it has learned in these.  Since it is impossible 
to progress far during one manifestation, it must return again and again to 
the lower worlds.  The theory which underlies reincarnation is entirely 
different from that of eternal reward and eternal punishment which 
underlies, say, the teachings of Christianity.  Every individual will 
eventually attain perfection though some take longer to do so than others. 
The laws of his progress, the laws which govern reincarnation, are those of 
evolution and of karma.  Evolu-tion (q.v.) decrees that all shall attain 
perfection and that by developing to the utmost their latent powers and 
qualities, and each manifestation in the lower worlds is but one short 
journey nearer the goal.  Those who realise this law shorten the journey by 
their own efforts while those who do not realise it and so assist its 
working, of course lengthen the journey.  Karma (q.v.) decrees that effects 
good or bad, follow him who was their cause.  Hence, what a man has done in 
one manifestation, he must be benefited by or suffer for in another.  It may 
be impossible that his actions should be immediately effective, but each is 
stored up and sooner or later will bear fruit.  It may be asked how one long 
life in the lower worlds should not suffice instead of a multitude of 
manifestations, but this is explic-able by the fact that the dense matter 
which is the vehicle of these bodies, becomes after a time' of progress, 
incapable of further alteration to suit the developing monad's needs and 
must accordingly be laid aside for a new body.  After physical death, man 
passes first to the astral world, then to the heaven portion of the mental 
world, and in this latter world most of his time is spent except when he de-
scends into the denser worlds to garner fresh experience and knowledge for 
his further development in preparation for passage into the still higher 
sphere.  In the heaven world these experiences and this knowledge are woven 
together into the texture of his nature.  In those who have not pro-gressed 
far on the journey of evolution, the manifestations in the lower worlds are 
comparatively frequent, but with passage of time and development, these 
manifestations become rarer and more time is spent in the heaven world, 
till, at last, the great process of reincarnation draws to an end, and the 
pilgrims enter the Path which leads to per-fection.  (See Theosophy, The 
Path, and the articles on the various Worlds.)

Rhabdomancy: From the Greek words meaning "a rod” and " divination," is thus 
alluded to by Sir Thomas Brown :-" As for the divination or decision from 
the staff, it is an augurial relic. and the practice thereof is accused by 
God himself: My people ask counsel of their stocks, and their staff 
declareth unto them.  Of this kind was that practised by Nabuchadonosor in 
that Caldean miscellany delivered by Ezekiel."  In Brand's Antiquities the 
following description is cited from a MS. Discourse on Witchcraft, written 
by Mr. John Bell, 1705, p. 41  it is derived from Theophylact :-' They set 
up two staffs, and having whispered some verses and incantations, the staffs 
fell by the operation of demons.  Then they considered which way each of 
them fell, forward or backward, to the right or left hand, and agreeably 
gave responses, having made use of the fall of their staffs for their 
signs."  This is the Grecian method of Rhabdomancy, and St. Jerome thinks it 
is the same that is alluded to in the above passage of Hosea, and in Ezekiel 
xxi. 21, 22, where it is rendered "arrows."  Belomancy and Rhabdomancy, in 
fact, have been confounded in these two passages, and it is a question 
whether in one of the methods arrows and rods or stones were not used 
indifferently.  The practice is said to have passed from the Chaldeans and 
Scythians to the German tribes, who used pieces from the branch of a fruit 
tree, which they marked with certain characters, and threw at hazard upon a 
white cloth.  Something like this, according to one of the rabbis, was the 
practice of the Hebrews, only instead of characters, they peeled their rods 
on one side, and drew the presage from their manner of falling.  The 
Scythians and the Alani used rods of the myrtle and sallow, and as the 
latter chose ' flue straight wands " according to Herodotus, it may be 
inferred that their method was that of the Hebrews, or some modification of 
it.


Rhapsodomancy  Divination by means of opening the works of a poet at hazard

Rhasis (or Rasi) : An Arabian alchemist whose real name was Mohammed-Ebn-
Secharjah Aboubekr Arrasi.  He was born at Ray, in Trak, Khorassan, about 
85o.  In his youth he devoted himself to music and the lighter pastimes, and 
it was not till he had passed his thirtieth year that he turned his 
attention to the healing art.  But having done so, he studied it to good 
purpose, and speedily became a most skilful physician.  His natural goodness 
of heart induced him to turn his knowledge and skill to account in order to 
benefit his poorer brethren.  The study of philosophy also claimed his 
attention and he travelled to Syria, Egypt, and Spain in search of 
knowledge.
     He was exceedingly fond of experimenting in medicine and chemistry, and 
was the first to mention borax, orpiment, realgar, and other chemical 
compounds.  The authorship of two hundred and twenty-six treatises is 
ascribed to him, and some of these works influenced European medicine so 
late as the 17th century.  He firmly believed in the transmutation of 
metals, and wrote a glowing treatise on the subject which he presented to 
Emir Almansour, Prince of Khorassan.  The Emir showed his gratitude in a 
practical fashion by giving Rhasis a thousand pieces of gold, at the same 
time desiring to be present during the working of some of the experiments 
with which the volume was plentifully illustrated. Rhasis consented, on 
condition that the prince supplied the necessary apparatus.  No expense was 
spared in furnishing a laboratory for the alchemistical experiments, but 
unfortunately the boasted skill of the alchemist failed him and the 
performance ended miserably. Rhasis, who was now well advanced in years, was 
unmercifully beaten by the angry emir, who chose the unlucky treatise to 
belabour him with.  This incident is said to have caused the blindness with 
which the alchemist was afterwards afflicted.
     He died about 932 in the deepest poverty.
     In his studies in chemistry he has left some results of real value, 
notwithstanding the time and trouble he spent in the pursuit of the 
philosopher's stone.  Another theory which he held in common with Geber and 
others was that the planets influenced metallic formation under the earth's 
surface.

Rinaldo des Trois Echelles : A much-dreaded French sorcerer of the reign of 
Charles IX., who, at his execution, boasted before the king that he had in 
France three hundred thou-sand confederates, whom they could not thus commit 
to the flames-meaning, doubtless, the demons of the Sabbath.


Ripley, George : This alchemist was born about the middle of the fifteenth 
century at Ripley, in Yorkshire, in which county his kinsfolk appear to have 
been alike powerful and numerous.  Espousing holy orders, he became an 
Augustinian, while subsequently he was appointed Canon of Bridlington in his 
native Yorkshire, a priory which had been founded in the time of Henry I. by 
Walter de Ghent. Ripley's sacerdotal office did not prevent him travelling, 
and he prosecuted empirical studies at various places on the continent, 
while he even penetrated so far afield as the island of Rhodes, where he is 
said to have made a large quantity of gold for the knights of St. John of 
Jerusalem.  Going afterwards to Rome he was dignified by the Pope, the 
result being that, when he got back to Bridlington, he found his brethren 
there intensely jealous of him.  It is reported, indeed, that he even 
resigned his position and retired to a priory at Boston, but this story is 
probably unfounded, the likelihood being that Ripley the alchemist has been 
confounded with George Ripley, a Carmelite friar who lived at Boston in the 
thirteenth century, and wrote a biography of St. Botolph.
     Ripley died in England in 1490, but his fame did not die with him, and 
in fact his name continued to be familiar for many years after his decease.  
He had been among the first to popularise the chymical writings attributed 
to Raymond Lully, which first became known in England about 1445, at which 
time an interest in alchemy was increasing steadily among English scholars-
the more so because the law against multiplying gold had lately been 
repealed  while Ripley wrote a number of learned treatises himself, notably 
Medulla Alchimiae, The Treatise of Mercury and The Compound of Alchemie, the 
last-named being dedicated to King Edward IV.  A collected edition of his 
writings was issued at Cassel in Germany ill 1649, while in 1678 an 
anonymous English writer published a strange volume in London, Ripley 
Revived, or an Exposition upon George Ripley's Hermetico-Poetical Works.

Robert the Devil was son of a Duke and Duchess of Normandy. He was endowed 
with marvellous physical strength, which he used only to minister to his 
evil passions.  Explaining to him the cause of his wicked impulses, his 
mother told him that he had been born in answer to prayers addressed to the 
devil.  He now sought religious advice, and was directed by the Pope to a 
hermit who ordered him to maintain complete silence, to take his food from 
the mouths of dogs, to feign madness and to provoke abuse from common people 
without attempting to retaliate.  He became court fool to the Roman Emperor 
and three times delivered the city from Saracen invasions, having, in each 
case, been prompted to fight by a heavenly message.  The emperor's dumb 
daughter was given speech in order to identify the saviour of the city with 
the court fool, but he refused his due recompense, as well as her hand in 
marriage, and went back to the hermit, his former confessor. The. French 
Romance of Robert le Diable is one of the oldest forms of this legend.

Rocail : Said to have been the younger brother of Seth, the son of Adam.  
The circumstances attending his history are picturesque and unique.  A Dive, 
or giant of Mount Caucasus, finding himself in difficulties, applied for aid 
to the human race.  Rocail offered his services to the giant, and so 
acceptable did these prove that the Dive made his benefactor grand vizier.  
For a long period he governed the giant's realm with entire success, and 
reached a position of dignity and honour.  However, when he felt himself 
growing old he desired to leave behind him a more lasting monument than 
public respect, so he built a magnificent palace and sepulchre.  The palace 
he peopled with statues, which, by the power of magic, he made to walk and 
talk, and act in all ways as though they were living men, as, indeed, all 
who beheld them judged them to be.  (See D'Herbelot, Bibliotheque Oriental.)

Rochester Rappings : The outbreak of rappings which occurred in Hydesville, 
near Rochester, N.Y., in 1848, and which is popularly known as the Rochester 
Rappings, is of peculiar importance, not because of its intrinsic 
superiority to any other poltergeistic disturbance, but because it 
inaugurates the movement of Modern Spiritualism.  Hydes-ville is a small 
village in Arcadia, Wayne County, N.Y., and there, in 1848, there lived one 
John D. Fox, with his wife and two young daughters, Margaretta, aged 
fifteen, and Kate, aged twelve. Their house was a small wooden structure 
previously tenanted by one Michael Weekman, who afterwards avowed that he 
had frequently been dis-turbed by knockings and other strange sounds in the 
Hydesville house. Towards the end of March, 1848, the Fox family were much 
disturbed by mysterious rappings, and on the evening of the 31st they went 
to bed early, hoping to get some undisturbed sleep.  But the rappings broke 
out even more vigorously than they had done on the previous occasions, and 
Mrs. Fox, much alarmed and excited when the raps manifested signs of 
intelligence, decided to call in her neighbours to witness the phenomenon. 
The neighbours heard the raps as distinctly as did the Foxes themselves. 
When the sounds had indicated that they were directed by some sort of 
intelligence it was no difficult matter to get into communication with the 
unseen.  Ques-tions were asked by the  sitters " of this informal', Seance" 
and if the answer were in the affirmative, raps were heard, if in the 
negative, the silence remained unbroken.  By this means the knocker 
indicated that he was a spirit, the spirit of a pedlar who had been murdered 
for his money by a former resident in the house.  It also answered correctly 
other questions put to it, relating to the ages of those present and other 
particulars concerning persons who lived in the neighbourhood.  In the few 
days immediately following hundreds of people made their way to Hydesville 
to witness the marvel.  Fox's married son, David, who lived about two miles 
from his father's house, has left a statement to the effect that the Fox 
family. following the directions of the raps, which indicated that the 
pedlar was buried in the cellar, had begun to dig therein early in April, 
but were stopped by water.  Later, however, hair, bones, and teeth were 
found in the cellar.  Vague rumours were afloat that a pedlar had visited 
the village one winter, had been seen in the kitchen of the house afterwards 
tenanted by the Foxes, and had mysteriously disappeared, without fulfilling 
his, promise to the villagers to return next day. But of real evidence there 
was not a scrap, whether for the murder or for the existence of the pedlar, 
particulars of whose life were furnished by the raps.  Soon after these 
happenings Kate Fox went to Auburn, and Margaretta to Rochester, N.Y., where 
lived her married sister, Mrs. Fish 
(formerly Mrs. Underhill), and at both places outbreaks of rappings 
occurred.  New mediums sprang up, circles were formed, and soon Spiritualism 
was fairly started on its career.

Rome : Magical practice was rife amongst the Romans. Magic was the motive 
power of their worship which was simply an organized system of magical rites 
for communal ends.  It was the basis of their mode of thought and out-look 
upon the world, it entered into every moment and action of their daily life, 
it affected their laws and customs. This ingrained tendency instead of 
diminishing, developed to an enormous extent, into a great system of 
superstition, and in the later years led to a frenzy for strange gods, 
borrowed from all countries.  In times of misfortune and disaster the Romans 
were always ready to borrow a god if so be his favours promised more than 
those of their own deities. Though there was a strong conservative element 
in the native character, though the " custom of the elders" was strongly 
upheld by the priestly fraternity, yet this usually gave way before the will 
and temper of the people. Thus, as a rock shows its geological history by 
its differing strata, so the theogony of the Roman gods tells its tale of 
the race who conceived it.  There are pre-historic nature deities, borrowed 
from the indigenous tribes, gods of the Sabines, from whom the young colony 
stole its wives gods of the Etruscans, of the Egyptians, Greeks and 
Persians.  The temple of Jupiter on the Capitol con-tained the altar of a 
primitive deity, a stone-god, Terminus, the spirit of boundaries: in the 
temple of Diana of the Grove, a fountain nymph was worshipped.  Instances of 
this description are numerous.
     Spirits -In addition to the gods, there were spirits to be propitiated.  
Indeed the objects offered to the Roman for adoration were numberless.  
Apuleius gives a description of this when he tells of a country road where 
one might meet an altar wreathed with flowers, a cave hung with garlands, an 
oak tree laden with horns of cattle, a hill marked by fences as sacred, a 
log rough-hewn into shape. an altar of turf smoking with libations or a 
stone anointed with oil. Every single action of man's daily life had a 
presiding spirit ; commerce and husbandry likewise.  There was eating Ednea, 
drinking Potina ; there were spirits of departure, of journeying, of 
approaching and home-coming.  In commerce there was Mercurius, the spirit of 
gain, of money, Pecunia ; in farming, the spirits of cutting, grinding, 
sowing and bee-keeping.  A deity presided over streets and highways ; there 
was a goddess of the sewers, Cloacina ; a spirit of bad smells, Mephitis.  
Spirits of evil must also be propitiated by pacificatory rites, such as 
Robigo, the spirit of mildew ; in Rome there was an altar to Fever and Bad 
Fortune.  From the country came Silvanus, god of farms and woods, and his 
Fauns and nymphs with Picus, the wood-pecker god who had fed the twins 
Romulus and Remus with berries-all these were possessed of influences and 
were approached with peculiar rites.  The names of these spirits were 
inscribed on tablets, indigitamenta, which were in the charge of the 
pontiffs, who thus knew which spirit to evoke according to the need.  Most 
of these spirits were animistic in origin.
     The Roman Worship consisted of magical rites destined to propitiate the 
powers controlling mankind; to bring man into touch with them, to renew his 
life and that which supported it, the land with its trees, corn and cattle, 
to stop that process of degeneration constantly set in motion by evil 
influences.  Everything connected with it typified this restoration.  The 
Priests who represented the life of the community, were therefore bound by 
strict observances from endangering it in any way.  Rules as to attire, 
eating and touch were numerous sacrifices were systematised according to the 
end desired and the deity invoked.  There were rules as to whether the 
victim must be young or full-grown, male or female ; oxen were to be offered 
to Jupiter and Mars; swine to Juno, to Ceres the corn-goddess and to 
Silvanus.  At one shrine a cow in calf was sacrificed and the ashes of the 
unborn young were of special magical efficacy.  Human sacrifice existed 
within historical times.  After the battle of Cannae the Romans had sought 
to divert misfortune by burying two Greeks alive in the cattle-market while 
in the time of Julius Caesar two men were put to death with sacrificial 
solemn-ities by the Pontiff and Flamen of Mars.  Again, in the time of 
Cicero and Horace boys were killed for magical purposes.  Fire possessed 
great virtue and was held sacred in the worship of Vesta, in early belief 
Vesta being the fire itself; it presided over the family hearth ; it 
restored purity and conferred protection.  Blood had the same quality and 
smeared on the face of the god symbolised and brought about the one-ness of 
the deity with the commun-ity.  On great occasions the Statue of Jupiter was 
treated thus  the priests of Bellona made incisions in their shoul-ders and 
sprinkled the blood upon the image; the face of a triumphant general was 
painted with vermilion to represent blood.  Kneeling and prostration brought 
one into direct contact with the earth of the sacred place.  Music was also 
used as a species of incantation, probably deriving its origin in sound made 
to drive away evil spirits. Danc-ing too was of magical efficacy.  In Rome 
there were colleges of dancers for the purposes of religion, youths who 
danced in solemn measure about the altars, who, in the sacred month of Mars 
took part in the festivals and went throughout the city dancing and singing.  
One authority states four kinds of  holy solemnity " ; sacrifice, sacred 
banquets, public festivals and games.  Theatrical per-formances also 
belonged to this category, in one instance being used as a means of 
diverting a pestilence.  The sacred banquets were often decreed by the 
Senate as thanks-giving to the gods.  Tables were spread with a sumptuous 
repast in the public places and were first offered to the statues of the 
deities seated around. The festivals were numerous, all of a magical and 
symbolic nature.  In the spring there was the Parilia when fires of straw 
were lighted, through which persons passed to be purified; the Cerealia, 
celebrated with sacrifice and offerings to Ceres, the corn-goddess, and 
followed by banquets.  The Luper-calia, the festival of Faunus, was held in 
February and symbolised the wakening of Spring and growth.  Goats were slain 
as sacrifice and with their blood the Luperci, youths clad in skins, smeared 
their faces.  They took thongs of the goat-skin and laughing wildly rushed 
through the city striking the crowd, Roman matrons believing that the blows 
thus received rendered them prolific.  Juno, the goddess of marriage and 
childbirth also had her festival, the Matronalia, celebrated by the women of 
Rome.  There were the festivals of the dead when the door leading to the 
other world was opened, the stone removed from its entrance in the Comitium, 
and the shades coming forth were appeased with offerings.  On these days 
three times in the year, when the gods of gloom were abroad, complete 
cessation from all work was decreed, no battle could be fought nor ship set 
sail neither could a man marry. To the Sacred Games were taken the statues 
of the gods in gorgeous procession, chariots of silver, companies of 
priests, youths singing and dancing.  The gods viewed the games reclining on 
couches. The Chariot races also par-took of the nature of rites.  After the 
races in the Field of Mars came one of the most important Roman rites, the 
sacrifice of the October Horse.  The right-hand horse of the victorious team 
was sacrificed to Mars, and the tail of the animal, running with blood, 
carried to the Altar of the Regia.  The blood was stored in the temple of 
Vesta till the following spring and used in the sacrifice of the festival of 
Parilia.  This sacrifice was essentially magical, all citizens present being 
looked upon as purified by the blood-sprinkling and lustral bonfire.  The 
Roman outlook upon life was wholly coloured by magic.  Bodily foes had their 
counterpart in the unseen world, wandering spirits of the dead, spirits of 
evil, the anger of innocently offended deities, the menace of the evil eye.  
Portents and prodigies were everywhere.  In the heavens strange things might 
be seen. The sun had been known to double, even treble itself; its light 
turn to blood, or a magical halo to appear round the orb.  Thunder and 
lightning were always fraught with presage; Jove was angered when he opened 
the heavens and hurled his bolts to earth.  Phantoms, too, hovered amid the 
clouds; a great fleet of ships had been seen sailing over the marshes.  Upon 
the Campagna the gods were observed in conflict, and afterwards tracks of 
the combatants were visible across the plain.  Unearthly voices were heard 
amid the mountains and groves ; cries of portent had sounded within the 
temples.  Blood haunted the Roman imagination.  Sometimes it was said to 
have covered the land as a mantle, the standing corn was dyed with blood, 
the rivers and fountains flowed with it, while walls and statues were 
covered with a bloody sweat.  The flight and song of birds might be 
foretelling the decrees of Fate; unappeased spirits of the dead were known 
to lurk near and steal away the souls of men and then they too were  dead."  
All these happenings were attributable to the gods and spirits, who, if the 
portent be one of menace, must be propitiated, if one of good fortune, 
thanked with offerings.  Down to the later times this deep belief in the 
occurrence of prodigies persisted.  When Otho set out for Italy, Rome rang 
with reports of a gigantic phantom rush-ing forth from the Temple of Juno; 
of the Statue of Julius turning from east to west.
     Augury.-Divination was connected with the Roman worship.  There was a 
spot on the Capitol from which the augur with veiled head read the auspices 
in the flight of birds.  Augurs also accompanied armies and fleets and read 
the omens before an engagement was entered upon. Divination was also 
practised by reading the intestines of animals, by dreams, by divine 
possession as in the case of the Oracles wisen prophecies were uttered.  
These had been gathered together in the Sibylline books (q.v.), and were 
consulted as oracles by the State.  With the worship of Fortune were 
connected the Lots of Praeneste.  The questions put to the goddess were 
answered by means of oaken lots which a boy drew from a case made of sacred 
wood. The fortune-tellers also used a narrow-necked urn which, filled with 
water, only allowed one lot at a time to rise.  Astrologers from Chaldea 
were also much sought after and were attached to the kingly and noble 
houses. Familiar things of everyday life were of magical import. Words,  
Numbers, odd ones specially for the Kalends, Nones and Ides were so arranged 
as to fall upon odd days; touch was binding and so recognised in the law of 
Rome, as the grasp of a thing sold, from a slave to a turf of distant 
estate; and knotting and twisting of thread was injurious so that women must 
never pass by cornfields twisting their spindles, they must not even be 
uncovered. There was a strange sympathy between the trees and mankind, and 
great honour was paid to the sacred trees of Rome.  On the oak tree of 
Jupiter the triumphant general hung the shield and arms of his fallen foe ; 
while the hedges about the Temple of Diana at Nemi were covered with votive 
offerings.  The trees also harboured the spirits of the dead who- came forth 
as dreams to the souls of men. Pliny the elder says in this matter "Trees 
have a soul since nothing on earth lives without one.  They are the temples 
of spirits and the simple countryside dedicates still a noble tree to some 
god.  The various kinds of trees are sacred to their protecting spirits  the 
oak to Jupiter, the laurel to Apollo, olive to Minerva, myrtle to Venus, 
white poplar to Hercules."  These trees therefore partook of the nature of 
their presiding spirits and it was desirable to bring about communion with 
their magical influence, as in the spring when laurel boughs were hung at 
the doors of the flamens and pontiffs and in the temple of Vesta where they 
re-mained hanging till the following year.  Trees and their leaves were also 
possessed of healing and purifying value; laurel was used for the latter 
quality as in the Roman triumphs the fasces of the commander, the spears and 
javelins of legionaries were wreathed with its branches to purify them from 
the blood of the enemy.  Man himself had a presiding spirit, his genius, 
each woman her" juno" the Saturnalia was really a holiday for this " other 
self." The Roman kept his birthday in honour of his genius, offer-ing 
frankincense, cakes and unmixed wine on an altar garlanded with flowers and 
making solemn prayers for the coming year.  City and village had their 
genii, also bodies of men from the senate to the scullions.
     Death was believed to be the life and soul enticed away by revengeful 
ghosts, hence death would never occur save by such agencies.  The dead 
therefore must be appeased with offerings or else they wander abroad working 
evil among the living.  This belief is present in Ovid's lines
“Once upon a time the great feast of the dead was not observed and the manes 
failed to receive the customary gifts, the fruit, the salt, the corn steeped 
in unmixed wine, the violets.  The injured spirits revenged themselves on 
the living and the city was encircled with the funeral fires of their 
victims.  The townsfolk heard their grand-sires complaining in the quiet 
hours of the night, and told each other how the unsubstantial troop of 
monstrous spectres rising from their tombs, shrieked along the city streets 
and up and down the fields."  Beans were used in the funeral feasts.  They 
were supposed to harbour the souls of the dead, and the bean-blossom to be 
inscribed with characters of mourning.
     Dreams were considered of great importance by the Romans ; many 
historical instances of prophetic dreams may be found.  They were thought to 
be like birds, the "bronze-coloured" hawks; they were also thought to be the 
souls of human beings visiting others in their sleep also the souls of the 
dead returning to earth.  In Virgil much may be found on this subject; 
Lucretius tried to find a scientific reason for them; Cicero, though writing 
in a slighting manner of the prevalent belief in these mani-festations of 
sleep, yet records dreams of his own, which events proved true.
     Sorcery in all its forms, love-magic and death-magic was rife amongst 
all classes, besides necromantic practices. There were charms and spells for 
everything under the sun; the rain-charm of the pontiffs consisting of the 
throwing of puppets into the Tiber; the charm against thunder-bolts 
compounded of onions, hair and sprats; the charm against an epidemic when 
the matrons of Rome swept the temple-floors with their hair; and many more 
down to the simple love-charm strung round the neck of the country maiden.
     Witches were prevalent.  The poets often chose these sinister figures 
for their subjects, as when Horace describes the ghastly rites of two 
witches in the cemetery of the Esquiline.  Under the light of the new moon 
they crawl about looking for poisonous herbs and bones; they call the 
spectres to a banquet consisting of a black lamb torn to pieces with their 
teeth, and after, these phantoms must answer the questions of the 
sorceresses. They make images of their victims and pray to the infernal 
powers for help; hounds and snakes glide over the ground, the moon turns to 
blood, and as the images are melted so the lives of the victims ebb away. 
Virgil gives a picture of a sorceress performing love-magic by means of a 
waxen image of the youth whose love she desired.  Lucan in his Pharsalia 
treats of Thessaly, notorious in all ages for sorcery and draws a terrific 
figure-Erichtho. a sorceress of illimitable powers, one whom even the gods 
obeyed, to whom the forces of earth and heaven were bond-slaves; and Fate 
waiting her least command.  Both Nero and Agrippina his mother were reported 
to have had recourse to the infamous arts of sorcery; while in the New 
Testament may be found testimony as to these practices in Rome.  The 
attitude of the cultured class towards magic is illustrated by an 
illuminating passage to be found in the writings of Pliny the elder.  He 
says "The art of magic has prevailed in most ages and in most parts of the 
globe.  Let no one wonder that it has wielded very great authority inasmuch 
as it embraces three other sources of influence.  No one doubts that it took 
its rise in medicine and sought to cloak itself in the garb of a science 
more profound and holy than the common run.  It added to his tempting 
promises the force of religion, after which the human race is groping, 
especially at this time.  Further it has brought in the arts of astrology 
and divination.  For everyone desires to know what is to come to him and 
believes that certainty can be gained by consulting the stars.  Having in 
this way taken captive the feelings of man by a triple chain it has reached 
such a pitch that it rules over all the world and in the East, governs the 
King of Kings.           K. N.


Romer, Dr. C.  (See Spiritualism.)


Rose : From the earliest times the rose has been an emblem of silence.  
Eros, in the Greek mythology, presents a rose to the god of silence, and to 
this day sub rosa, or " under the rose," means the keeping of a secret.  
Roses were used in very early times as a potent ingredient in love philters. 
In Greece it was customary to leave bequests for the main-tenance of rose 
gardens, a custom which has come down to recent times. Rose gardens were 
common during the middle ages.  According to Indian mythology, one of the 
wives of Vishnu was found in a rose'.  In Rome it was the custom to bless 
the rose on a certain Sunday, called Rose Sunday.  The custom of blessing 
the golden rose came into vogue about the eleventh century.  The golden rose 
thus consecrated was given to princes as a mark of the Roman Pontiffs' 
favour.  In the east it is still believed that the first rose was generated 
by a tear of the prophet Mohammed, and it is further believed that on a 
certain day in the year the rose has a heart of gold.  In the west of 
Scotland if a white rose bloomed in autumn it was a token of an early 
marriage. The red rose, it was said, would not bloom over a grave.  If a 
young girl had several lovers, and wished to know which of them would be her 
husband, she would take a rose leaf for each of her sweet-hearts, and naming 
each leaf after the name of one of her lovers, she would watch them till one 
after another they sank, and the last to sink would be her future husband. 
Rose leaves thrown upon a fire gave good luck'.  If a rose bush were pruned 
on St. John's eve, it would bloom again in the autumn.  Superstitions 
respecting the rose are more numerous in England than in Scotland.


Rosen, Paul : A sovereign Grand Inspector-General of the 33rd degree of the 
French rite of Masonry, who in 1888 decided that Masonry was diabolic in 
conception, and to prove his strictures published a work called Satan et 
Cie. The Satanism credited to Masonry by Rosen is social anarchy and the 
destruction of the Catholic religion.


Rosenberg, Count  (See Dee.)


Rosenkreuze, Christian : (See  Rosicrucians.)


Rosicrucian Society of England  (See Rosicrucians.)


Rosicrucians : The idea of a Rosicrucian Brotherhood has probably aroused 
more interest in the popular mind than that of any other secret society of 
kindred nature : hut that such a brotherhood ever existed is extremely 
doubt-ful.  The very name of Rosicrucian seems to have exercised a spell 
upon people of an imaginative nature for nearly two hundred and fifty years, 
and a great deal of romantic fiction has clustered around the fraternity: 
such as for example Lord Lytton's romance of Zanoni   Shelley's novel St. 
Irvyne the Rosicrucian, Harrison Ainsworth's Auriol, and similar works.
     The name Rosicrucian is utilised by mystics to some extent as the 
equivalent of magus, but in its more specific application it was the title 
of a member of a suppositious society which arose in the late sixteenth 
century.  There are several theories regarding the derivation of the name. 
The most commonly accepted appears to be that it was derived from the 
appellation of the supposed founder, Christian Rosenkreuze; but as his 
history has been proved to be wholly fabulous, this theory must fall to the 
ground. Mosheim, the historian, gave it as his opinion that the name was 
formed from the Latin words ros, dew, crux a cross; on the assumption that 
the alchemical dew of the philoso-phers was the most powerful dissolvent of 
gold, while the cross was equivalent to light.  It is more probable that the 
name Rosicrucian is derived from rosa a rose, and crux a cross, and we find 
that the general symbol of the supposed order was a rose crucified in the 
centre of a cross.  In an old Rosicrucian book of the last century, we 
further find the symbol of a red cross-marked heart in the centre of an open 
rose, which Mr. A. E. Waite believes to be a develop-ment of the monogram of 
Martin Luther, which was a cross-crowned heart rising from the centre of an 
open rose.
     History of the Supposed Brotherhood.-Practically nothing definite was 
known concerning the Rosicrucian Brother-hood before the publication of Mr. 
Waite's work The real
History of the Rosicrucians in 1887.  Prior to that a great deal had been 
written concerning the fraternity, and shortly before Mr. Waite produced his 
well-known book another had made its appearance under the title of The 
Rosicrucians, their Rites and Mysteries by the late Mr. Hargrave Jennings.  
This book was merely a farrago of the wildest absurdities, rendered 
laughable by the ridiculous attitude of the author, who pretended to the 
guardianship of abysmal occult secrets.  It was typical of most writings 
regarding the fraternity of the Rosy Cross, and as the Westminster Review 
wittily remarked in its notice of the volume, it deals with practically 
everything under the sun except the Rosicrucians. Mr. Waite's work, the 
result of arduous personal research, has gathered together all that can 
possibly be known regarding the Rosicrucians, and his facts are drawn from 
manuscripts, in some cases discovered by himself, and from skilful analogy.  
As it is the only authority on the subject worth speaking about, we shall 
attempt to outline its conclusions. 
     We find then that the name ', Rosicrucian" was un-known previously to 
the year 1598.  The history of the movement originates in Germany, where in 
the town of Cassel in the year 1614 the professors of magic and mystic-ism, 
the theosophists and alchemists, were surprised by the publication of a 
pamphlet bearing the title The Fama of the Fraternity of the Meritorious 
Order of the Rosy Cross Addressed to the Learned in General and the 
Governors of Europe.  It purported to be a message from certain anony-mous 
adepts who were deeply concerned for the condition of mankind, and who 
greatly desired its moral renewal and perfection.  It proposed that all men 
of learning throughout the world should join forces for the estab-lishment 
of a synthesis of science, through which would be discovered the perfect 
method of all the arts. The  squab-blings and quarrellings of the literati 
of the period were to be forgone, and the antiquated authorities of the 
elder world to be discredited.  It pointed out that a reformation had taken 
place in religion, that the church had been cleansed, and that a similar new 
career was open to science.  All this was to be brought abbot by the 
assistance of the illuminated Brotherhood,-the children of light who had 
been initiated in the mysteries of the Grand Orient, and would lead the age 
to perfection.
     The fraternity kindly supplied an account of its history. The head and 
front of the movement was one C.R.C. of Teutonic race, a magical hierophant 
of the highest rank, who in the fifth year of his age had been placed in a 
con-vent, where he learned the Humanities.  At the age of fifteen, he 
accompanied one, Brother P. A. L, on his travels to the Holy Land ; but the 
brother died at Cyprus to the great grief of C.R.C., who, however resolved 
to undertake the arduous journey himself.  Arriving at Damascus, he there 
obtained knowledge of a secret circle of theosophists who dwelt in an 
unknown city of Arabia called Damcar, who were expert in all magical arts.  
Turning aside from his quest of the Holy Sepulchre, the lad made up his mind 
to trace these illuminati and sought out certain Arabians who carried him to 
the city of Damcar.  There he arrived at the age of sixteen years, and was 
graciously welcomed by the magi, who intimated to him that they had long 
been expecting him, and relating to him several passages in his past life.  
They proceeded to initiate him into the mysteries of occult science, and he 
speedily became acquainted with Arabic, from which tongue he translated the 
divine book M into Latin,  After three years of mystic instruction, he 
departed from the mysterious city for Egypt, whence he sailed to Fez as the 
wise men of Damcar had instructed him to do.  There he fell in with other 
masters who taught him how to evoke the elemental spirits.  After a further 
two years' sojourn at Fez, his period of initiation was over, and he 
proceeded to Spain to confer with the wisdom of that country, and convince 
its professors of the errors of their ways.  Unhappily, the scholarhood of 
Spain turned its back upon him with loud laughter, and intimated to him that 
it had learned the principles and practice of the black art from a much 
higher authority, namely Satan himself, who had unveiled to them the secrets 
of necromancy within the walls of the university of Salamanca. With noble 
indignation he shook the dust of Spain from his feet, and turned his face to 
other countries only, alas, to find the same treatment within their boun-
daries.  At last he sought his native land of Germany where he pored over 
the great truths he had learned in solitude and seclusion, and reduced his 
universal philosophy to writing.  Five years of a hermit's life, however, 
only served to strengthen him in his opinions, and he could not but feel 
that one who had achieved the transmutation of metals and had manufactured 
the elixir of life was designed for a nobler purpose than rumination in 
solitude.  Slowly and carefully he began to collect around him assistants 
who became the nucleus of the Rosicrucian fraternity.  When he had gathered 
four of these persons into the brotherhood they invented amongst them a 
magical language, a cipher writing of equal magical potency, and a large 
dictionary replete with occult wisdom.  They erected a House of the Holy 
Ghost, healed the sick, and initiated further members, and then betook 
themselves as missionaries to the various countries of Europe to disseminate 
their wisdom.  In course of time their founder, C.R.C., breathed his last, 
and for a hundred and twenty years the secret of his burial place was 
concealed. The original members also died one by one, and it was not until 
the third generation of adepts had arisen that the tomb of their illustrious 
founder was unearthed during the re-building of one of their secret 
dwellings.  The vault in which this tomb was found was illuminated by the 
sun of the magi, and inscribed with magical characters.  The body of the 
illustrious founder was discovered in perfect preservation, and a number of 
marvels were discovered buried beside him, which con-vinced the existing 
members of the fraternity that it was their duty to make these publicly 
known to the world.  It was this discovery which immediately inspired the 
brother-hood to make its existence public in the circular above alluded to, 
and they invited all worthy persons to apply to them for initiation.  They 
refused, however, to supply their names and addresses, and desired that 
those who wished for initiation could signify their intention by the 
publication of printed letters which they would be certain to notice.  In 
conclusion they assured the public of the circumstance that they were 
believers in the reformed Church of Christ, and denounced in the most solemn 
manner all pseudo-occultists and alchemists.
     This Fama created tremendous excitement among the occultists of Europe, 
and a large number of pamphlets were published criticising and defending the 
society and its manifesto, in which it was pointed Out there were a number 
of discrepancies.  To begin with no such city as Damcar existed within the 
bounds of Arabia. Where, it was asked, was the House of the Holy Ghost, 
which the Rosicrucians stated had been seen by 100,000 persons and was yet 
con-cealed from the world ?  C.R.C., the founder, as a boy of fifteen must 
have achieved great occult skill to have astonished the magi of Damcar.  But 
despite these objec-tions considerable credit was given to the Rosicrucian 
publication.  After a lapse of a year appeared the Con-fession of the 
Rosicrucian Fraternity, addressed to the learned in Europe.  This offered 
initiation by gradual stages to selected applicants, and discovered its 
ultra-Protestant character by what an old Scots divine was wont to call a 
"dig at the Pope," whom it publicly execrated, expressing the pious hope 
that his "asinine braying" would finally be put a stop to by tearing him to 
pieces with nails   In the following year, 1616, The Chymical Nuptials of 
Christian Rosencreutz was published, purporting to be incidents in the life 
of the mysterious founder of the Brotherhood of the Rosy Cross.  But the 
chymical marriage makes Christian Rosencreutz an old man when he achieved 
initiation, and this hardly squares with the original account of his life as 
given in the Fama.  By this time, a number of persons had applied for 
initiation, but had received no answer to their application.  As many of 
these believed themselves to be alchemical and magical adepts, great 
irritation arose among the brotherhood, and it was generally considered that 
the whole business was a hoax.  By 1620, the Rosicrucians and their 
publication had lapsed into absolute obscurity.
     Numerous theories have been put forward as to the probable authorship 
of these manifestoes, and it has been generally considered that the 
theologian Andreae produced them as a kind of laborious jest; but this view 
is open to so many objections that it may be dismissed summarily. Their 
authorship has also been claimed for Taulerus, Joachim Junge, and AEgidius 
Guttmann; but the individ-ual in whose 'imagination originated the 
Brotherhood of the Rosy Cross will probably for ever remain unknown.  It is 
however, unlikely that the manifesto was of the nature of a hoax, because it 
bears upon its surface the marks of intense earnestness, and the desire for 
philosophical and spiritual reformation; and it is not unlikely that it 
sprang from some mystic of the Lutheran school who desired the co-operation 
of like-minded persons.  Mr. Waite thinks there is fair presumptive evidence 
to show that some corporate body such as the Rosicrucian Brotherhood did 
exist: but as he states that the documents which are the basis of this 
belief give evidence also that the association did not originate as it 
pretended, and was devoid of the powers which it claimed, this hypothesis 
seems in the highest degree unlikely.  Such a document would more probably 
emanate from one individual, and it is almost impossible to conceive that a 
body of men professing such aims and objects as the manifesto lays claim to 
could possibly have lent themselves to such a farrago of absurdity as the 
history of C.R.C.  A great many writers have credited the brother-hood with 
immense antiquity; but as the publisher of the manifesto places its origin 
so late as the fifteenth century, there is little necessity to take these 
theories into con-sideration.
     So far as can be gleaned from their publications, the Rosicrucians, or 
the person in whose imagination they existed, were believers in the 
doctrines of Paracelsus.  They believed in alchemy, astrology and occult 
forces in nature and their credence in these is identical with the doctrines 
of the great master of modern magic.  They were thus essentially modern in 
their theosophical beliefs, just as they were modern in their religious 
ideas.  Mr. Waite thinks it possible that in Nuremburg in the year 1598 a 
Rosicrucian Society was founded by a mystic and alchemist named Simon 
Studion, under the title of MiIitia Crucifera Evangelica, which held 
periodical meetings in that city. Its proceedings are reported in an 
unprinted work of Studion's, and ill opinions and objects it was identical 
with the supposed  Rosicrucian Society.  ' “Evidently,"  he says, “the 
Rosicrucian Society of 1614 was a transfigura-tion or development of the 
sect established by Simon Studion."  But there is no good evidence for this 
state-ment.  After a lapse of nearly a century, the Rosicrucians reappeared 
in Germany. in 1710, a certain Sincerus Racatus or Sigmund Richter, 
published A Perfect and True Prepara-tion of the Philosophical Stone 
according to the Secret Methods of the Brotherhood of the Golden and Rosy 
Cross, and annexed to this treatise were the rules of the Rosicrucian 
Society for the initiation of new members.  Mr. Waite is of opinion that 
these rules are equivalent to a proof of the society's existence at the 
period, and that they help to establish the important fact that it still 
held its meetings at Nuremburg, where it was originally established by 
Studion.  In 1785, the publication of The Secret Symbols of the Rosicrucians 
of the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries took place at Altona, showing in 
Mr. Waite's opinion that the mysterious brotherhood still existed ; but this 
was their last manifesto. These things are certainly of the nature of proof, 
but they are so scanty that any reasonable and workable hypothesis that such 
a society ever existed can scarcely be founded upon them.  For all we know 
to the contrary they may be publications of enthusiastic and slightly 
unbalanced pseudo-mystics, and nothing definite can be gleaned from their 
existence.
     In 1618 Henrichus Neuhuseus published a Latin pamph-let, which stated 
that the Rosicrucian adepts had migrated to India, and present-day 
Theosophists will have it that they exist now in the table-lands of Tibet.  
It is this sort of thing which altogether discredits occultism in the eyes 
of the public.  Without the slightest shadow of proof of any kind, such 
statements are wildly disseminated; and it has even been alleged that the 
Rosicrucians have developed into a Tibetan Brotherhood, and have exchanged 
Protestant Christianity for esoteric Buddhism I Mr. Waite humorously states 
that he has not been able to trace the eastern progress of the Brotherhood 
further than the Isle of Mauritius, where it is related in a curious manu-
script a certain Comte De Chazal initiated a Dr. Sigismund Bacstrom into the 
mysteries of the Hose Cross Order in '794  but we know nothing about the 
Comte de Chazal or his character, and it is just possible that Dr. Bacstrom 
might have been one of those deluded persons who in all times and countries 
have been willing to purchase pro-blematical honours.  From the Fama and 
Confessio, we glean some definite ideas of the occult conceptions of the 
Rosicrucians.  In these documents we find the doctrine of the Microcosmus 
(q.v.), which considers man as containing the potentialities of the whole 
universe. This is a distinctly Paracelsian belief.  We also find the belief 
of the doctrine of Elemental Spirits (q.v.), which many people wrongly think 
originated with the Rosicrucians ;  but which was probably reintroduced by 
Paracelsus.  We also find that the manifestoes contain the doctrine of the 
Signatura Rerum, which also is of Paracelsian origin.  This is the magical 
writing referred to in the Fama; and the mystic characters of that book of 
nature, which, according to the Confessio, stand open for all eyes, but can 
be read or understood by only the very few.  These characters are the seal 
of God imprinted on the wonderful work of creation, on the heavens and 
earth, and on all beasts.  It would appear too, that some form of practical 
magic was known to the Brotherhood. They were also, according to them-
selves, alchemists, for they had achieved the transmutation of metals and 
the manufacture of the elixir of life.
     In England the Rosicrucian idea was taken up by Fludd, who wrote a 
spirited defence of the Brotherhood ; by Vaughan who translated the Fama and 
the Confessio; and by John Heydon, who furnished a peculiarly quaint and 
interesting account of the Rosicrucians in The Wise Man's Crown ; and 
further treatises regarding their alchemi-cal skill and medical ability in 
El Havarevna, or The English Physitian's Tutor, and A New Method of Rosie 
Crucian Physich, London 1658.  In France Rosicrucianism ran a like course.  
It has been stated by Buhle and others that there was much connection 
between the Rosicrucians and Freemasons.
     A pseudo-Rosicrucian Society existed in England before the year 1836, 
and this was remodelled about the middle of last century under the title " 
The Rosicrucian Society of England." To join this it is necessary to be a 
Mason. The officers of the society consist of three magi, a master-general 
for the first and second orders, a deputy master-general, a treasurer, a 
secretary and seven ancients.  The assisting officers number a precentor, 
organist, torch-bearer, herald, and so forth.  The society is composed of 
nine grades or classes.  It published a little quarterly' magazine from 1868 
to 1879, which in an early number stated that the society was " calculated 
to meet the re-quirements of those worthy masons who wished to study the 
science and antiquities of the craft, and trace it through its successive 
developments to the present time ; also to cull information from all the 
records extant from those mysterious societies which had their existence in 
the dark ages of the world, when might meant right."  These objects were, 
however, fulfilled in a very perfunctory manner, if the magazine of the 
association is any criterion of its work.  For this publication is filled 
with occult serial stories, reports of masonic meetings and verse.  Mr. 
Waite states that the most notable circumstance con-nected with this society 
is the complete ignorance which seems to have prevailed among its. members 
generally concerning everything connected with Rosicrucianism. The prime 
movers of the association were Robert Went-worth Little, Frederick Hockley, 
Kenneth Mackenzie and Hargrave Jennings, and in the year 1872 they seem to 
have become conscious that their society had not borne out its original 
intention.  By this time the Yorkshire College and East of Scotland College 
at Edinburgh, had been founded - one does not know with what results.  " 
This harmless association," says Mr. Waite, " deserves a mild sympathy at 
the hands of the student of occultism.  Its character," he continues, " 
could hardly have deceived the most credulous of its postulants.  Some of 
its members wrapped themselves in darkness and mystery, proclaimed 
themselves Rosicrucians with intent to deceive. These persons found a few-
very few-believers and admirers. Others assert that the society is a cloak 
to something else-the last resource of cornered credulity and exposed impos-
ture.  There are similar associations in other parts of Europe, and also in 
America: e.g., the Societas Rosicruciana of Boston."  But in the concluding 
pages of Mr. Waite's book we find the following passage: " On the faith of a 
follower of Honnes, I can promise that nothing shall be held back from these 
true Sons of the Doctrine, the sincere seekers after light, who are 
empowered to preach the supreme Arcana of the psychic world with a clean 
heart and an earnest aim.  True Rosicrucians and true alchemical adepts, if 
there be any ill existence at this day, will not resent a new procedure when 
circumstances have been radically changed."  Mr. Waite appeals to these 
students of occultism who are men of method as well of imagination to assist 
him in clearing away the dust and rubbish which have accumulated during 
centuries of oblivion in the silent sanctuaries of the transcendental 
sciences, that the tra-ditional secrets of nature may shine forth in the 
darkness of doubt and uncertainty to illuminate the straight and narrow 
avenues which communicate between the seen and the unseen.

Rossetti, Dante Gabriel  English Author and Painter (1828 -1882).  Gabriel 
Charles Dante Rossetti, poet, painter and translator, and commonly known as 
Dante Gabriel Rossetti, was born in London in 1828, his father being an 
Italian who had settled in England.  While yet a boy Rossetti manifested 
aesthetic leanings, and accordingly he was sent to study drawing under no 
less distinguished a preceptor than Cotman, while shortly afterwards he 
entered the Royal Academy Schools,  Then in 1848, feeling the need of still 
further tuition, he commenced working at the studio of Ford Madox Brown, a 
master who undoubtedly influenced him greatly  and while under Brown's 
tuition he began to show himself a painter of distinct individuality, while 
simultaneously he made his first essays in translating Italian literature 
into English, and became known among his friends as a poet of rare promise,  
Meanwhile, however, Rossetti was really more interested in the brush than in 
the pen, and soon after finally quitting Brown's studio he brought about a 
memorable event in the history of English painting, this being the founding 
of the pre-Raphaelite brotherhood, a body consisting of seven members whose 
central aim was to render precisely and literally every separate object 
figured in their pictures.
     Leaving his father's house in 1849, Rossetti went to live at Chatham 
Place, Blackfriars Bridge, and during the next ten years his activity as a 
painter was enormous; while the year 1860 is a notable one in his career, 
marked as it is by his marriage to Eleanor Siddal.  The love between the 
pair was of an exceptionally passionate order and from it sprang Rossetti's 
immortal sonnet-sequence called The House of Life, published in 1881 ; but 
Mrs. Rossetti died in 1862, and thereupon the poet, terribly cast down by 
his bereavement, went to live at a house in Chelsea with Swinburne and 
Meredith.  Here he continued to write fitfully, while in 1871 he completed 
one of his most famous pictures, Dante's Dream ; yet the loss of his wife 
preyed upon him persistently, he was tortured by insomnia, and in 
consequence, he began to take occasional doses of chloral. Gradually this 
practice developed into a habit, sapping alike the physical and mental 
strength of the poet; and though he rallied for a while during a stay in 
Scotland, where he lived at Penkill Castle in Ayrshire, it soon became 
evident that his death was imminent unless he aschewed the drug.  But he had 
not the strength of will necessary for this abjuration, he died in 1882 at 
Birchington, and his remains were interred in the cemetery there.
     Rossetti had a marked bias for mysticism in various forms. William Bell 
Scott, in his Autobiography, tells how the poet became at one time much 
enamoured of table-turning and the like ; while waiving his somewhat 
childish taste herein, his temperament was undoubtedly a very religious one, 
and once towards the close of his life he declared that he had "seen and 
heard those that died long ago."  Was it, then, a belief in the possibility 
of communicating with the dead which induced him, on his wife's death, to 
have some of his love poems enclosed in the coffin of the deceased ? while, 
be the answer to this question what it may, Rossetti's mysticism certainly 
bore good fruit in his art, his Rose Mary being among the most beautiful of 
English poems introducing the supernatural element. Nevertheless, it is by 
this painting rather than by his poetry that Rossetti holds a place as a 
great mystic ; for, despite his fondness for precise handling, all his 
pictures with the exception of Found are essentially of a mystical nature; 
they are not concerned with the tangible and visible world, but body forth 
the scenes and incidents beheld in dreams, and do this with a mastery 
reflected by no other kindred works save those of Blake.

Rupecissa, Johannes de : This alchemist was an ancestor of Montfaucon, the 
distinguished archaeologist, and his name suggests that he was a man of 
gentle birth, while it is com-monly supposed that he was a French monk of 
the order of St. Francis, and it is reported that in 1357, presumably on 
account of his alchemistic predilections, he was imprisoned by Pope Innocent 
VI.  Rupecissa contributed four volumes to the literature of hermetic 
philosophy : Coelum  Philoso-phorum, Paris 1543, De Quinta Essentia Rerum 
Omniam, Basle 1562, De Secretis  Alchemiae, Cologne 1579, Livre de Lumiere, 
Paris, n.d.; and these were admired by a number of the author's successors, 
but their value is really literary rather than scientific.


Rusalki: Rusalki, the lovely river nymph of Southern Russia seems to have 
been endowed with the beauty of person and the gentle characteristics of the 
Mermaids of Northern nations.  Shy and benevolent, she lived on the small 
alluvial islands that stud the mighty rivers which drain. this extensive and 
thinly-peopled country, or in the detached coppices that fringe their banks, 
in bowers woven of flowering reeds and green-willow-boughs ; her pastime and 
occupation being to aid in secret the poor fishermen in their laborious and 
precarious calling. Little is known of these beautiful creatures - as if the 
mystery and secrecy which was inculcated and enforced in all affairs of 
govern-ment in this country had been extended to its fairy faith. Even 
Keightley, so learned in fairy lore, knows little of Rusalki, and dismisses 
her with the following brief notice
     "They are of a beautiful form, with long green hair they swim and 
balance themselves on the branches of trees, bathe in the lakes and rivers, 
play on the surface of the water, and wring their locks on the green meads 
at the water's edge.  It is chiefly at Whitsuntide that they appear; and the 
people then, singing and dancing, weave garlands for them, which they cast 
into the stream."


Russia : (For early history of occult matters in Russia see Slavs.)  
Spiritualism was first introduced into Russia by persons who had become 
interested in the subject whilst abroad through witnessing manifestations of 
psychic phenomena and acquaintance with the works of Allan Kardec, the 
French exponent of Spiritualism. From the first the new doctrine found its 
followers chiefly among members of the professions and the aristocracy, 
finally including the reigning monarch of that time, Alexander II. with many 
of his family and entourage as devoted adher-ents.  Because of the immense 
influence of such converts the progress of Spiritualism in Russia was made 
smoother than it otherwise would have been in a country where the laws of 
Church and State are nothing if not despotic and disposed to look upon 
anything new in matters religious, intellectual or merely of general 
interest as partaking of a revolutionary character.  Even so, much of the 
spiritual-istic propaganda, manifestations and publications were prosecuted 
under various ruses and subterfuges such as the circulation of a paper 
entitled " The Rebus," professedly devoted to innocent rebuses and charades 
and only inci-dentally mentioning Spiritualism the real object of its being.  
Chief amongst the distinguished devotees of the subject was Prince 
Wittgenstein, aide-de-camp and trusted friend of Alexander II., who not only 
avowed his beliefs openly but arranged for various mediums to give seances 
before the Emperor, one of these being the well-known D. D. Home.  So 
impressed was the Czar that, it is said, from that time onwards he consulted 
mediums and their prophetic powers as to the advisability or otherwise of 
any contemplated change or step in his life, doubtless helped or driven to 
such dependence on mediums by the uncertain conditions under which occupants 
of the Russian throne seem to exist.
     "Another Russian of high position socially and officially, M. Aksakof, 
interested himself in the matter in ways many and various, arranging seances 
to which he invited the scientific men of the University, editing a paper 
Psychische Studien, of necessity published abroad ; translating Swedenborg's 
works into Russian beside various French, American and English works on the 
same subject and thus becoming a leader in the movement.  Later, with his 
friends, M. M. Boutlerof and Wagner, professors respectively of chemistry 
and zoology at the University of St. Petersburg, he specially commenced a 
series of seances for the investigation of the phenomena in an experimental 
manner and a scientific committee was formed under the leadership of 
Professor Mendleyef who afterwards issued an adverse report on the matter, 
accusing the mediums of trickery and their followers of easy credulity and 
the usual warfare proceeded between the scientific investigators and 
spiritual enthusiasts."
    M. Aksakof's commission was reported upon unfavourably by M. Mendeleyef, 
but the former protested against the report.
     At the other extreme of the Social scale among the peasantry and 
uneducated classes generally, the grossest superstition exists, an 
ineradicable belief in supernatural agencies and cases are often reported in 
the columns of Russian Papers of wonder-working, obsession and various 
miraculous happenings, all ascribed, according to their character, to 
demoniac or angelic influence, or in the districts where the inhabitants are 
still pagan to local deities and witchcraft.


Ruysbroeck or Ruysbrock : Flemish Mystic (1293-1381), It is probable that 
this mystic derived his name from the village of Ruysbreck, near Brussels, 
for it was there that he was born in the year 1293.  Even as a child he 
showed distinct religious leanings, and before he was out of his teens he 
had steeped himself in a wealth of mystical literature. Naturally, then, he 
decided to espouse the clerical pro-fession, and in 1317 he was duly 
ordained, while a little later he became vicar of St. Gudule, one of the 
parishes of Brussels.  During his long term of acting in this capacity he 
became widely esteemed for his erudition, and for his personal piety; while 
his sermons and even his letters were passed from hand to hand, and perused 
with great admira-tion by many of his fellow clerics.  But he was never 
found guilty of courting fame or publicity of any kind, and at the age of 
sixty he retired to Groenendale, not far from the battlefield of Waterloo, 
where he founded a monastery. There he lived until his death in 1381, 
devoting himself chiefly to the study of mysticism, yet showing himself any-
thing but averse to those charitable actions befitting a monk.
    Ruysbroeck was known to his disciples as " the ecstatic teacher."  As a 
thinker he was speculative and broad-minded, and indeed he was one of those 
who prefigured the Reformation, the result being that, though he won the 
encomiums of many famous theologians in the age immedi-ately succeeding his, 
an attempt to beatify him was sternly suppressed.  He was a tolerably 
voluminous writer, and at Cologne, in 1552, one of his manuscripts found its 
way into book form with the title, De Naptu svel de Ornatu Nuptiarum 
Spiritualium; while since then a number of his further works have been 
published, notably De Vera Contemplatione and De Septem Gradivus Amoris 
(Hanover, 1848).  The central tenet of his teaching is that  the soul finds 
God in its own depths," but, in contradistinction to many other mystics. he 
did not teach the fusion of the self in God, but held that at the summit of 
the ascent towards righteousness the soul still preserves its identity.
     Ruysbroeck and his teaching begot many voluminous commentaries 
throughout the middle ages, and he has attracted a number of great writers, 
the Abbi Bossuet, for example, and at a later date Maurice Maeterlinck.  In 
1891 the latter published L'Ornemant des Noces Spirituelles, de Ruysbroeck 
l'admirable, and an English translation of this by J. T. Stoddart was issued 
in 1904. The reader desirous of further information should consult Studies 
in Mystical Religion, by 
Rufus M. Jones, 1909.



S


Saba : In Ossianic legend, wife of Finn and mother of Oisin. In the form of 
a fawn, she was captured by Finn in the chase, but noticing that his man-
hounds would do her no hurt, he gave her shelter in his Dun of Allen.  The 
next morning he found her transformed into a beautiful woman. She told him 
that an enchanter had compelled her to assume the shape of a fawn, but that 
her original form would be restored if she reached Dun Allen.  Finn made her 
his wife, and ceased for a while from battle and the chase. Hearing one day, 
however, that the Northmen’s warships were in the Bay of Dublin, he mustered 
his men and went to fight them.  He returned victorious, but to find Saba 
gone. The enchanter, taking advantage of his absence, had appeared to her in 
the likeness of Finn with his hounds and so lured her from the dun, when she 
became a fawn again.


Sabbathi : To this angel, in the Jewish rabbinical legend of the celestial 
hierarchies, is assigned the sphere of Saturn. He receives the divine light 
of the Holy Spirit, and com-municates it to the dwellers in his kingdom.


Sabellicus, Georgius : A magician who lived about the same time as Faustus 
of Wittenberg, about the end of the 15th century.  His chief claims to fame 
as a sorcerer rest on his own wide and arrogant advertisement of his skill 
in necro-mancy.  He styles himself, "The most accomplished Georgius 
Sabellicus, a second Faustus, the spring and centre of necromantic art, an 
astrologer, a magician, consummate in chiromancy, and in agromancy, 
pyromancy and  hydro-mancy inferior to none that ever lived."  
Unfortunately, no proof is forthcoming that he ever substantiated these 
bombastic claims, or was ever regarded by anyone else as anything but a 
charlatan.

Sadhus : (See India,)

Sahu: The Egyptian name for the spiritual or incorruptible body.  It is 
figured in the Booh of the Dead as a lily spring-ing from the Khat or 
corruptible body.

Saint Germain, Comte de : Born probably about 1710, one of the most 
celebrated mystic adventurers of modern times.  Like Cagliostro and others 
of his kind almost nothing is known concerning his origin, but there is 
reason to believe that he was a Portuguese Jew. There are, however, hints 
that he was of royal birth, but these have never been substantiated.  One 
thing is fairly certain, and that is that he was an accomplished spy, for he 
resided at many European Courts, spoke several languages fluently, and was 
even sent upon diplomatic missions by Louis XV. He had always abundance of 
funds at his command, and is alluded to by Grimm as the most capable and 
able man he had ever known.  He pretended to have lived for centuries, to 
have known Solomon, the Queen of Sheba and many other persons of antiquity;  
but although obviously a charlatan, the accomplishments upon which he based 
his reputation were in many ways real and con-siderable.  Especially was 
this the case as regards chem-istry, a science in which he was certainly an 
adept, and he pretended to have a secret for removing the flaws from 
diamonds, and to be able to transmute metals, and of course he possessed the 
secret of the elixir of life.  He is mentioned by Horace Walpole as being in 
London about 1743, and as being arrested as a Jacobite spy, who was later 
released.  Walpole writes of him   " He is called an Italian, a Spaniard, a 
Pole, a somebody who married a great fortune in Mexico and ran away with her 
jewels to Constantinople, a priest, a fiddler, a vast nobleman." Five years 
after his London experience, he attached himself to the court of Louis XV. 
where he exercised considerable influence, over that monarch, and was 
employed by him upon several secret missions.  He was distinctly the fashion 
about this time, for Europe was greatly inclined to the pursuit of the 
occult at this epoch; and as he combined mystical conversation with a 
pleasing character, and not a little flippancy, he was the rage.  But he 
ruined his chances at the French court by interfering in a dispute between 
Austria and France, and was forced to remove himself to England.  He resided 
in London for one or two years, but we trace him to St. Petersburg, 1762, 
where he is said to have assisted in the conspiracy which placed Catherine 
II. on the Russian throne.  After this he travelled in Germany where he is 
said in the Memoirs of Cagliostro to have become the founder of freemasonry, 
and to have initiated Cagliostro into that rite.  (See Cagliostro.)  In 
Cagliostro’s account can be credited, he set about the business with 
remarkable splendour, and not a little bombast, posing as a " deity," and 
behaving in a manner calculated to gladden pseudo-mystics of the age.  He 
was nothing if not theatrical, and it is probably for this reason that he 
attracted the Land-grave Charles of Hesse, who set aside a residence for the 
study of the occult sciences.  He died at Schleswig some-where between the 
years 1780 and 1785, but the exact date of his death and its circumstances 
are unknown.  It would be a matter of real difficulty to say whether he 
possessed any genuine occult power whatsoever, and in all likelihood he was 
merely one of those charlatans in whom his age abounded.  Against this view 
might be set the circum-stance that a great many really clever and able 
people of his own time thoroughly believed in him; but we must remember the 
credulous nature of the age in which he flourished.  It has been said that 
XVIII. century Europe was sceptical regarding everything save occultism and 
its professors, and it would appear to unbiassed minds that this 
circumstance could have no better illustration than the career of the Comte 
de Saint Germain.
     A notable circumstance regarding him was that he possessed a 
magnificent collection of precious stones, which some consider to be 
artificial, but which others better able to judge believe to have been 
genuine.  Thus he presented Louis XV. with a diamond worth 10,000 livres. 
All sorts of stories were in circulation concerning him. One old lady 
professed to have encountered him at Venice fifty years before, where he 
posed as a man of 60, and even his valet was supposed to have discovered the 
secret of immortality.  On one occasion a visitor rallied this man upon his 
master being present at the marriage of Cana in Galilee, asking him if it 
were the case.  " You forget, sir," was the reply, " I have only been in the 
Comte’s service a century."

St. Irvyne, the Rosicrucian, by Wm. Godwin: (See Fiction, Occult.)

Saint Jacques, Albert de  A monk of the seventeenth cen-tury, who published 
a book entitled Light to the Living by the Experiences of the Dead, or 
divers apparitions of souls from purgatory in our century. The work was 
published at Lyons in 1675.


St. John’s crystal Gold : " In regard of the Ashes of Veget-ables," says 
Vaughan, "although their weaker exterior Elements expire by violence of the 
fire, yet their Earth cannot be destroyed, but is Vitrified. The Fusion and 
Transparency of this substance is occasioned by the Radicall moysture or 
Seminal water of the Compound. This water resists the fury of the fire, and 
cannot possibly be vanquished. ‘In hac Aqua’ (saith the learned Sever-ine), 
‘ Rosa latet in Hieme.’  These two principles are never separated  for 
Nature proceeds not so far in her Dissolutions.  When death hath done her 
worst, there is a Union between these two, and out of them shall God raise 
us to the last day, and restore us to a spiritual constitution. I do not 
conceive there shall be a Resurrection of every Species, but rather their 
Terrestrial parts, together with the element of water (for ‘there shall be 
no more sea’: Revela-tions), shall be united in one mixture with the Earth, 
and fixed to a pure Diaphanous substance. This is St. John’s Crystal Gold, a 
fundamental of the New Jerusalem-so called, not in respect of Colour, but 
constitution. Their Spirits, I suppose, shall be reduced to their first 
Limbus, a sphere of pure, ethereal fire, like rich Eternal Tapestry spread 
under the throne of God."


St. John’s Wort: St. John’s Wort.  In classical mythology the summer 
solstice was a day dedicated to the sun, and was believed to be a day on 
which witches held their festivities.  St. John’s Wort was their symbolical 
plant and people were wont to judge from it whether their future would be 
lucky or unlucky; as it grew they read in its progressive character their 
future lot. The Christians dedicated this festive period to St. John’s Wort 
or root, and it became a talisman against evil.  In one of the old romantic 
ballads a young lady falls in love with a demon, who tells her-

“Gin you wish to be leman mine
Lay aside the St. John’s Wort and the vervain."

When hung up on St. John’s day together with a cross over the doors of 
houses it kept out the devil and other evil spirits. Te gather the root on 
St. John’s day morning at sunrise, and retain it in the house, gave luck to 
the family in their undertakings, especially in those begun on that day.


St. Martin, Louis Claude de: French Mystic and Author, commonly known as "le 
philosophe inconnu."  (1743-1803). The name of Louis de St. Martin is a 
familiar one, more familiar, perhaps, than that of almost any other French 
mystic; and this is partly due to his having been a voluminous author, and 
partly to his being virtually the founder of a sect, " the Martinistes" ; 
while again, St. Beuve wrote about him in his Causeries du Lundi, and this 
has naturally brought him under wide notice.
     Born in 1734 at Amboise, St. Martin came of a family of some wealth and 
of gentle birth.  His mother died while he was a child, but this proved 
anything but unfortunate for him; for his step-mother besides lavishing a 
wealth of affection on him, early discerned his rare intellectual gifts, and 
made every effort to nurture them.  " C’est a elle," he wrote afterwards in 
manhood, " que je dois peut-etre tout mon bonheur, puisque c’est elle que 
m’a donna’ les premiers elements de cette education douce, attentive et 
pieuse, qui m’a fait aimer de Dieu et des hommes."  The boy was educated at 
the College de Pontlevoy, where he read with interest numerous books of a 
mystical order, one which impressed him particularly being Abbadie’s Art de 
se connaitre  soi-meme  and at first he intended to make law his profession, 
but he soon decided on a military career instead, and accordingly entered 
the army.  A little before taking this step he had affiliated himself with 
the freemasons and, on his regiment being sent to garrison Bordeaux, he 
became intimate with certain flew rites which the Portu-guese Jew, Martinez 
Pasqually (q.v.), had lately introduced into the masonic lodge there.  For a 
while St. Martin was deeply interested, not just in the aforesaid but in the 
philosophy of Pasqually ; yet anon he declared that the latter’s disciples 
were inclined to be too materialistic, and soon he was deep in the writings 
of Swedenborg, in whom he found a counsellor more to his taste.  The 
inevitable result of studies of this nature was that he began to feel a 
great distaste for regimental life, and so, in 1771, he resigned his 
commission, determining to devote the rest of his life to philosophical 
speculations.  He now began writing a book, Des Erreurs el de la Verite, on 
les Hommes rappeles au Principe de la Science, which was published in 1775, 
at Edinburgh, at this time on the eve of becoming a centre of literary 
activity of all sorts  and it is worth recalling that this pristine effort 
by St. Martin was brought under the notice of Voltaire, the old cynic 
observing shrewdly that half a dozen folio volumes might well be devoted to 
the topic of erreurs, but that a page would suffice for the 
treat-ment of virite !
     The young author’s next important step was to pay a visit to England, 
and thence in 1787 he went to Italy along with Prince Galitzin, with whom he 
had lately become friendly.  They stayed together for some time at Rome, and 
then St. Martin left for Strassburg, his intention being to study German 
there, for he had recently grown interested in the teaching of Jacob Boehme, 
and he was anxious to study the subject thoroughly.  Very soon he had 
achieved this end, and at a later date, indeed, he translated a number of 
the German mystic’s writings into French; but meanwhile returning to France, 
he found his outlook suddenly changed, the revolution breaking out in 1789, 
and a reign of terror setting in.  No one was safe, and St. Martin was 
arrested at Paris, simply on account of his being. a gentleman by birth; but 
his affiliation with the freemasons stood him in good stead. in this hour 
.of need, and he was liberated by a decree of the ninth Thermidor.  
Accordingly he resumed activity with his pen, and in 1792 he issued a new 
book, Nouvel Homme; while two years later he was commissioned to go to his 
native Amboise, inspect the archives and libraries of the monasteries in 
that region, and draw up occasional reports on the subject.  Shortly 
afterwards he was appointed an eleve professeur at the Ecole Normale in 
Paris, in consequence of which he now made his home in that town; and among 
others with whom he became acquainted there was Chateaubriand, of whose 
writing, he was an enthusiastic devotee, but who, on his parts appears to 
have received the mystic with his usual haughty coldness.  St. Martin did 
not lack a large circle of admirers, however, and he continued to work had, 
publishing in 1795 one of his most important books, Lettres a un Ami, ou 
Considerations politiqiues, philosophiques et riligieuses sur la Revolution, 
which was succeeded in 1800 by two speculative treatises, Ecce Homo and 
L’Esprit des Choses. Then, in 1802, he issued yet another volume, Ministere 
de l’Homme Esprit; but in the following year his labours were brought to an 
abrupt close, for while staying at Annay, not far from Paris, with a friend 
called Lenoir-Laroche, he succumbed to an apopleptic seizure. After his 
death it was found that he had left a considerable mass of manu-scripts 
behind him, and some of these were issued by his executors in 1807, while in 
1862 a collection of his letters appeared.
     St. Martin was never married, but he appears to have exercised a most 
extraordinary fascination over women; and in fact divers scandalous stories 
are told in this relation, some of them implicating various courtly dames of 
the French nobility of the Empire. As a philosopher St. Martin found a host 
of disciples among his contemporaries, these gradually forming themselves 
almost into a distinct sect, and, as observed before. acquiring the name of’ 
“Mar-tinistes."  What, then, was the teaching of their leader ? and what the 
nature of the tenets promulgated in his voluminous writings ?  It is 
difficult to give an epitome in
so limited a space as that at disposal here, but turning to the author’s 
l’Homme da Desir (1790), and again to his Tableau natural des Rap ports qui 
existent entre Die, el l’Homme et 1’ Univers (1782), we find this pair 
tolerably representative of all his writing, and their key-note may 
certainly be defined as consisting in aspiration. Man is divine despite the 
fall recounted in the Scriptures, dormant within him lies a lofty quality of 
which he is too often scarcely conscious, and it is incumbent on him to 
develop this quality, striving thereafter without ceasing, and waiving the 
while everything pertaining to the category of materialism-such is the 
salient principle in St. Martin’s teaching, a principle which seems 
literally trite nowadays, for it has been propounded by a host of modern 
mystics, notably A.E. in The Hero in Man.  In writing in this wise, the 
French mystic undoubtedly owed a good deal to Swendenborg, while obligations 
to Boehme are of course manifest throughout his later works; and, while his 
debt to Martinez Pasqually has probably been exaggerated some-what, there is 
no doubt that the Portuguese Jew influenced him greatly for a while, the 
latter’s teaching coming to him at a time when he was still very young and 
susceptible, and fresh from readings of Abbadie.

Salagrama, The: An Indian stone, credited with possessing magical 
properties, and worn as an amulet.  This stone is black in colour, about the 
size of a billiard ball, and pierced with holes.  It is said that it can 
only be found in the Gandaki, a river in Nepaul, which some believe rises at 
the foot of Vishnu, and others in the head of Siva. It is kept in a clean 
cloth, and often washed and perfumed by its fortunate owner. The .water in 
which it has been dipped is supposed thereby to gain sin-expelling potency, 
and is therefore drunk and greatly valued. It possesses other occult powers, 
and is a necessary ingredient of the pre-parations of those about to die. 
The departing Hindu holds it ill his hand, and believing in its powers has 
hope for the future, and dies peacefully.

Salamander’s Feather: Otherwise known as Asbestos. A mineral of an 
incombustible nature, which resembles flax, being of fine fibrous texture. 
It was used by the Pagans to light their temples : when once it was lighted, 
they believed it could not be put out, even by lain and storms. Leonar-dus 
says: " Its fire is nourished by an inseparable unctuous Humid flowing from 
its substance; therefore, being once kindled it preserves a constant light 
without feeding it with any moisture."


Sallow : A tree or shrub of the willow kind.  Rods of this particular wood 
were much in use amongst the Scythians and the Alani for purposes of 
augurial divination. Fine straight wands were chosen, on which certain 
characters were written, and they were then thrown on a white cloth. From 
the way in which they fell the magician. gained the desired information.

Saphy : Perhaps from the Arabic safi " pure, select, excellent." Certain 
charm" or amulets worn by the negroes as pro-tection against thunderbolts 
and diseases, to procure them wives, and avert disasters of all kinds.  They 
are com-posed of strips of paper on which sentences from the Koran are 
inscribed, sometimes intermixed with kabalistic signs. These strips are 
enclosed in silver tubes or silk bags, which are worn near the skin, and 
often fastened in the dress. Africans of both sexes and all religions are 
great believers in the occult properties of such talismans; and Mungo Park 
resorted to the making of Saphy, or Grigris (as they are some times called), 
as a means of earning his living.


Sapphire : It is understood to make the melancholy cheerful and maintain the 
power or manly vigour of the body. The high priest of Egypt wore a sapphire 
upon his shoulder, and Aelian says that it was called truth. The Buddhists 
still ascribe a sacred magical power to it, and hold that it reconciles man 
to God. It is a good amulet against fear, promotes the flow of the animal 
spirits, hindereth ague and gout, promotes chastity, and prevents the eyes 
from being affected by small-pox.

Sardou, Victorian : The famous French dramatist was a keen student of 
occultism, and studied spiritualism with Allan Kardec (q.v.). He achieved 
great facility as a medium for spirit drawings, and many of the examples by

view. Some of them are reproduced in M. Camille Flammarion’s book Mysterious 
Psychic Forces.  (See France.)


Sat B’Hai: A Hindu society, the object of which was the study and 
development of Indian philosophy. It was so called after the bird 
Malacocersis Grisis, which always flies by sevens. It was introduced into 
England about the year 1872 by Major J. H. Lawrence Archer. It had seven 
descending degrees, each of seven disciples, and seven ascending degrees of 
perfection, Ekata or Unity. It ceased to be necessary on the establishment 
of the Theosoph-ical Society.

Witchcraft -In medieval times Scandinavian examples of witchcraft are rare, 
but in 1669 and 1670 a great Out-break of fanaticism against it commenced in 
Sweden in the district of Elfdale.
     The villages of Mohra and Elfdale are situated in the dales of the 
mountainous districts of the central parts of Sweden. In the first of the 
years above mentioned, a strange report went abroad that the children of the 
neighbourhood were carried away nightly to a place they called Blockula, 
where they were received by Satan in person; and the children themselves, 
who were the authors of the report, pointed out to them numerous women, who, 
they said were witches and carried them thither. The alarm and terror in the 
district became so great that a report was at last made to the king, who 
nominated commissioners, partly clergy and partly laymen, to inquire into 
the extraordinary circumstances which had been brought under his notice, and 
these com-missioners arrived in Mohra and announced their intentions of 
opening their proceedings on the 13th of August, 1670.
     On the 12th of August, the commissioners met at the parsonage-house, 
and heard the complaints of the minister and several people of the better 
class, who told them of the miserable condition they were in, and prayed 
that by some means or other they might be delivered from the calamity. They 
gravely told the commissioners that by the help of witches some hundreds of 
their children had been drawn to Satan, who had been seen to go in a visible 
shape through the country, and to appear daily to the people   the poorer 
sort of them, they said, he had seduced by feasting them with meat and 
drink,
     The commissioners entered upon their duties on the next day with the 
utmost diligence, and the result of their misguided zeal formed one of the 
most remarkable examples of cruel and remorseless persecution that stains 
the annals of sorcery.  No less than threescore and ten inhabitants of the 
village and district of Mohra, three-and-twenty of whom made confessions, 
were condemned and executed.  One woman pleaded that she was with child, and 
the rest denied their guilt, and these were sent to Fahluna, where most of 
them were afterwards put to death,  Fifteen children were among those who 
suffered death, and thirty--six more, of different ages between nine and 
sixteen, were forced to run the gauntlet, and be scourged on the hands at 
the church-door every Sunday for one year; while twenty more, who had been 
drawn into these practices more unwillingly, and were very young, were 
condemned to be scourged with rods upon their hands for three successive 
Sundays at the church-door. The number of the children accused was about 
three hundred.
     It appears that the commissioners began by taking the confessions of 
the children, and then they confronted them with the witches whom the 
children accused as their seducers. The latter, to use the words of the 
authorised report, having " most of them children with them, which they had 
either seduced or attempted to seduce, some seven years of’ age, nay, from 
four to sixteen years," now appeared before the commissioners.  " Some of 
the children complained lamentably of the ‘misery and mischief they were 
forced sometimes to suffer of the devil and the witches."  Being asked, 
whether they were sure, that they were at any time carried away by the 
devil? they all replied in the affirmative.  " Hereupon the witches them-
selves were asked, whether the confessions of those children were true, and 
admonished to confess the truth, that they might turn away from the devil 
unto the living God.  At first, most of them did very stiffly, and without 
shedding the least tear, deny it, though much against their will and 
inclination.  After this the children were examined every one by themselves, 
to see whether their confessions did agree or no, and the commissioners 
found that all of them, except some very little ones, which could not tell 
all the circumstances, did punctually agree in their confessions of 
particulars.  In the meanwhile, the commissioners that were of the clergy 
examined the witches, but could not bring them to any confession, all 
continuing steadfast in their denials, till at last some of them burst into 
tears, and their confession agreed with what the children said; and these 
expressed their abhorrence of the fact, and begged pardon. Adding that the 
devil, whom they called Locyta, had Stopped the mouths of some of them, so 
loath was he to part with his prey, and had stopped the ears of others. And 
being now gone from them, they could no longer conceal it; for they had now 
perceived his treachery." The witches asserted that, the journey to Blockula 
was not always made with the same kind of conveyance; they commonly used 
men, beasts, even spits and posts, accord-ing as they had opportunity.  They 
preferred, however, riding upon goats, and if they had more children with 
them than the animal could conveniently carry, they elongated its back by 
means of a spit anointed with their magical ointment. It was further stated, 
that if the children did at any time name the names of those, either man or 
woman, that had been with them, and had carried them away, they were again 
carried by force, either to Blockula or the cross-way, and there beaten, 
insomuch that some of them died of it; ‘ and this some of the witches 
confessed, and added, that now they were exceedingly troubled and tortured 
in their minds for it." One thing was wanting to confirm this circumstance 
of their confession. The marks of the whip could not be found on the persons 
of the victims, except on one boy, who had some wounds and holes in his 
back, that were given him with thorns; but the witches said they would 
quickly vanish.
     The account they gave of Blockula was, that it was situated in a large 
meadow, like a plain sea, "wherein you can see no end." The house they met 
at had a great gate painted with many divers colours. Through this gate they 
went into a little meadow distinct from the other, and here they turned 
their animals to graze. When they had made use of men for their beasts of 
burden, they set them up against the wall in a state of helpless slumber, 
and there they remained till wanted for the homeward flight.  In a very 
large room of this house, stood a long table, at which the witches sat down; 
and adjoining to this room was another chamber, where there were " lovely 
and delicate beds."
     As soon as they arrived at Blockula, the visitors were required to deny 
their baptism, and devote themselves body and soul to Satan, whom they 
promised to serve faithfully.  Hereupon he cut their fingers, and they wrote 
their name with blood in his book.  He then caused them to b baptized anew, 
by priests appointed for that purpose. Upon this the devil gave them a 
purse, wherein there were filings of clocks, with a big stone tied to it, 
which they threw into the water, and said, " As these filings of the clock 
do never return to the clock, from which they were taken, so may my soul 
never return to heaven!" Another difficulty arose in verifying this 
statement, that few of the children had any marks on their fingers to show 
where they had been cut. Bet here again the story was helped by a girl who 
had her finger much hurt, and who declared, that because she would not 
stretch out her finger, the devil in anger had thus wounded it.
     When these ceremonies were completed, the witches sat down at the 
table, those whom the fiend esteemed most being placed nearest to him; but 
the children were made to stand at the door, where he himself gave them meat 
and drink, Perhaps we may look for the origin of this part of the story in 
the pages of Pierre de Lancre. The food with which the visitors to Blockula 
were regaled, consisted of broth, with coleworts and bacon in it; oatmeal 
bread spread with butter, milk and cheese. Sometimes they said, it tasted 
very well, and sometimes very ill. After meals they went to dancing, and it 
was one peculiarity of these northern witches’ sabbaths, that the dance was 
usually followed by fighting. Those of Elfdale confessed that the devil used 
to play upon a harp before them. Another peculiarity of these northern 
witches was, that children resulted from their intercourse with Satan, and 
these children having married together became the parents of toads and 
serpents.
     The witches of Sweden appear to have been less noxious than those of 
most other countries, for, whatever they acknowledged themselves, there 
seems to have been no evidence of mischief done by them.  They confessed 
that they were obliged to promise Satan that they would do all kinds of 
mischief, and that the devil taught them to milk, which was after this 
manner. They used to stick a knife in the wall, and hang a kind of label on 
it, which they drew and stroaked  and as long as this lasted, the persons 
they had power over were miserably plagued, and the beasts were milked that 
way, till sometimes they died of it. A woman confessed that the devil gave 
her a wooden knife, where-with, going into houses, she had power to kill 
anything she touched with it ; yet there were few that could confess that 
they had hurt any man or woman. Being asked whether they had murdered any 
children, they confessed that they had indeed tormented many, but did not 
know whether any of them died of these plagues, although they said that the 
devil had showed them several places where he had power to do mischief. The 
minister of Elfdale declared, that one night these witches were, to his 
thinking, on the crown of his head, and that from thence he had a long 
continued pain of the head.  And upon this one of the witches confessed that 
the devil had sent her to torment that minister, and that she was ordered to 
use a nail, and strike it into his head, but his skull was so hard that the 
nail would not penetrate it, and merely produced that headache.  The hard-
headed minister said further, that one night he felt a pain as if he were 
torn with an instrument used for combing flax, and when he awoke he heard 
somebody scratching and scraping at the window, but could see nobody; and 
one of the witches confessed, that she was the person that had thus 
disturbed him.  The minister of Mohra declared also, that one night one of 
these witches came into his house, and did so violently take him by the 
throat, that he thought he should have been choked, and awaking, he saw the 
person that did it, but could not know her; and that for some weeks he was 
not able to speak, or perform divine service. An old woman of Elfdale 
confessed that the devil had helped her to make a nail, which she stuck into 
a boy’s knee, of which stroke the boy remained lame a long time.  And she 
added, that, before she was burned or executed by the hand of justice, the 
boy would recover.
     Another circumstance confessed by these witches was, that the devil 
gave them a beast, about the shape and bigness of a cat, which they called a 
carrier; and a bird as big as a raven, but white; and these they could send 
anywhere, and wherever they came they took away all sorts of victuals, such 
as butter, cheese, milk, bacon, and all sorts of seeds, and carried them to 
the witch.  What the bird brought they kept for themselves, but what the 
carrier brought they took to Blockula, where the arch-fiend gave them as 
much of it as he thought good.  The carriers, they said, filled themselves 
so full oftentimes, that they were forced to disgorge it by the way, and 
what they thus rendered fell to the ground, and is found in several gardens 
where coleworts grow, and far from the houses of the witches.  It was of a 
yellow colour like gold, and was called witches’ butter.
     Such are the details, as far as they can now be obtained, of this 
extraordinary delusion, the only one of a similar kind that we know to have 
occurred in the northern part of Europe during the " age of witchcraft."  In 
other countries we can generally trace some particular cause which gave rise 
to great persecutions of this kind, but here, as the story is told, we see 
none, for it is hardly likely that such a strange series of accusations 
should have been the mere involuntary creation of a party of little 
children. Suspicion is excited by the peculiar part which the two clergymen 
of Elfdale and Mohra acted in it, that they were not altogether strangers to 
the fabrication.  They seem to have been weak superstitious men, and perhaps 
they had been reading the witchcraft books of the south till they imagined 
the country round them to be over-run with these noxious beings. The 
proceedings at Mohra caused so much alarm throughout Sweden, that prayers 
were ordered in all the churches for delivery from the snares of Satan, who 
was believed to have been let loose in that kingdom. On a sudden a new edict 
of the king put a stop to the whole process, and the matter was brought to a 
close rather mysteriously.  It is said that the witch prosecution was 
increasing so much in intensity, that accusations began to be made against 
people of a higher class in society, and then a complaint was made to the 
king, and they were stopped
     Perhaps the two clergymen themselves became alarmed, but one thing 
seems certain, that the moment the com-mission was revoked, and the 
persecution ceased, no more witches were heard of.
     Spiritualism.-In 1843 an epidemic of preaching occurred in Southern 
Sweden, which provides Ennemoser, with material for an interesting passage 
in his History of Magic. The manifestation of this was so similar in 
character to those described elsewhere, that it is unnecessary to allude to 
it in detail.  A writer in the London Medium and Day-break of 1878 says  " 
It is about a year and a half since I changed my abode from Stockholm to 
this place, and during that period it is wonderful how Spiritualism has 
gained ground in Sweden. The leading papers, that used in my time to refuse 
to publish any article on Spiritualism excepting such as ridiculed the 
doctrine, have of late thrown their columns wide open to the serious 
discussion of the matter. Many a Spiritualist in secret, has thus been 
encouraged to give publicity to his opinions without stand-ing any longer in 
awe of that demon, public ridicule, which intimidates so many of our 
brethren. Several of Allan Kardec’s works have been translated into Swedish, 
among which I may mention his Evangile selon Ie Spiritisme as particularly 
well-rendered in Swedish by Walter Jochnick. A spiritual Library was opened 
in Stockholm on the 1st of April last, which will no doubt greatly 
contribute to the spreading of the blessed doctrine. The visit of Mr. Eglin-
ton to Stockholm was of the greatest benefit to the cause. Let us hope that 
the stay of Mrs. Esperance in the south of Sweden may have an equally 
beneficial effect. Notwith-standing all this progress of the cause in the 
neighbouring country, Spiritualism is looked upon here as something akin to 
madness, but even here there are thin, very thin rays, and very wide apart, 
struggling to pierce the darkness. In Norway, spiritualism as known to 
modern Europe, did not seem to have become existent until about 1880. A 
writer in a number of the Dawn of Light published in that year says   
Spiritualism is just commencing to give a sign of its existence here in 
Norway.  The newspapers have begun to attack it as a delusion and the 
expose’ of Mrs. C., which recently took place at 38, Great Russell Street, 
London, has made the round through all the papers in Scandinavia. After all, 
it must sooner or later take root as in all other parts of the world. Mr. 
Eglinton, the English medium, has done a good work in Stockholm, showing 
some of the great savants a new world; and a couple of years ago Mr. Slade 
visited Copenhagen.  The works of Mr. Zollner, the great astronomer of 
Leipzig, have been men-tioned in the papers and caused a good deal of 
sensation.
     “Of mediums there are several here, but all, as yet, afraid to speak 
out.  One writes with both hands; a gentleman is developing as a drawing 
medium.  A peasant, who died about five years ago, and lived not far from 
here, was an excellent healing medium; his name was Knud, and the people had 
given him the nickname of Vise Knud (the wise Knud) ; directly when he 
touched a patient he knew if the same could be cured or not, and often, in 
severe cases, the pains of the sick person went through his own body.  He 
was also an auditive medium, startling the people many times by telling them 
what was going to happen in the future; but the poor fellow suffered much 
from the ignor-ance and fanaticism around him, and was several times put in 
prison.
     "I am doing all I can to make people acquainted with our grand cause."
     A second and more hopeful letter of 1881, addressed to the editor of 
the Revue  Spirite, is as follows:-
     " My dear Brothers,-Here our science advances without noise. An 
excellent writing medium has been developed among us, one who writes 
simultaneously with both hands; while we have music in a room where there 
are no musical instruments ; and where there is a piano it plays itself. At 
Bergen, where I have recently been, I found mediums, who in the dark, made 
sketches-were dessinateurs-using also both hands. I have seen, also, with 
pleasure that several men of letters and of science have begun to 
investigate our science spirite. The pastor Eckhoff, of Bergen, has for the 
second time preached against Spiritual-ism, ‘ this instrument of the devil, 
this psychographie’; and to give more of eclat to his sermon he has had the 
goodness to have it printed; so we see that the spirits are working. The 
suit against the medium, Mme. F., in London, is going. the rounds of the 
papers of Christiania; these journals opening their columns, when occasion 
offers, to ridicule Spiritualism. We are, however, friends of the truth, but 
there are scabby sheep among us of a different temperament. From Stockholm 
they write me that a library of spiritual works has been opened there, and 
that they are to have a medium from Newcastle, with whom seances are to be 
held."
     In the London Spiritual Magazine of May, 1885, is a long and 
interesting paper on Swedish Spiritualism, by William Howitt, in which he 
gives quite a notable collection of narratives concerning Phenomenal 
Spiritual Manifestations in Sweden, most of which were furnished by an 
eminent and learned Swedish gentleman - Count Piper. The public have become 
so thoroughly sated with tales of hauntings, apparitions, prevision, etc., 
that Count Piper’s narrations would present few, if any features of 
interest, save in justification of one assertion, that Spiritualism is rife 
in human experience everywhere, even though it may not take the same form as 
a public movement, that it has done in America and England.
     As early as 1864, a number of excellent leading articles commending the 
belief in Spiritual ministry, and the study of such phenomena as would 
promote communion between the "two worlds," appeared in the columns of the 
Afton Blad, one of the most popular journals circulated in Sweden.

     Witchcraft.-Witchcraft and sorcery appear to have been practised in the 
earliest historical and traditional times. It is related that during the 
reign of Natholocus in the second century there dwelt in Iona a witch of 
great renown, and so celebrated for her marvellous power that the king sent 
one of his captains to consult her regarding the issue of a rebellion then 
troubling his kingdom. The witch declared that within a short period the 
king would be murdered, not by his open enemies but by one of his most 
favoured friends, in whom he had most especial trust. The messenger enquired 
the assassin’s name. "Even by thine own hands as shall be well-known within 
these few dayes," replied the witch. So troubled was the captain on hearing 
these words that he railed bitterly against her, vowing that he would see 
her burnt before he would commit such a villainous crime. But after 
reviewing the matter carefully in his mind, he arrived at the conclusion 
that if he informed the king of the witch’s prophecy, the king might for the 
sake of his personal safety have him put to death, so thereupon he decoyed 
Natholocus into his private chamber and falling upon him with a dagger slew 
him outright. About the year 388 the devil was so enraged at the piety of 
St. Patrick that he assailed the saint by the whole band of witches in 
Scotland. St. Patrick fled to the Clyde embarking in a small boat for 
Ireland. As witches cannot pursue their victims over running water, they 
flung a huge rock after the escaping saint, which however fell harmless to 
the ground, and which tradition says now forms Dumbarton Rock. The 
persecution of witches con-stitutes one of the blackest chapters of history.  
All classes, Catholic and Protestant alike, pursued the crusade with equal 
vigour, undoubtedly inspired by the passage in Exodus xxll., 18. While it is 
most probable that the majority of those who practised witchcraft and 
sorcery were of weak mind and enfeebled intellect, yet a large number 
adopted the supposed art for the purpose of intimi-dation and extortion from 
their neighbours.  Witches were held to have sold themselves body and soul 
to the devil.  The ceremony is said to consist of kneeling before the evil 
one, placing one hand on her head and the other under her feet, and 
dedicating all between to the service of the devil, and also renouncing 
baptism. The witch was thereafter deemed to be incapable of reformation.  No 
minister of any denomination whatever would intercede or pray for her.  On 
sealing the compact the devil proceeded to put his mark upon her.  Writing 
on the "Witches’ Mark" Mr. Bell, minister of Gladsmuir in 1705 says:
The witches’ mark is sometimes like a blew spot, or a little tale, or reid 
spots, like fleabiting, sometimes the flesh is sunk in and hollow and this 
is put in secret places, as among the hair of the head, or eyebrows, within 
the lips, under the armpits, and even in the most secret parts of the body." 
Mr. Robert Kirk of Aberfoill in his Secret Commonwealth states: "A spot that 
I have seen, as a small mole, horny, and brown coloured, throw which mark 
when a large brass pin was thrust (both in buttock, nose, and rooff of the 
mouth) till it bowed (bent) and became crooked, the witches, both men and 
women, nather felt a pain nor did bleed, nor knew the precise time when this 
was doing to them (their eyes only being covered)."
     In many cases the mark was invisible, and as it was considered that no 
pain accompanied the pricking of it, there arose a body of persons who 
pretending great skill therein constituted themselves as " witch prickers " 
and whose office was to discover and find out witches.  The method employed 
was barbarous in the extreme.  Having stripped and bound his victim the 
witch pricker proceeded to thrust his needles into every part of the body.  
When at last the victim worn out with exhaustion and agony remained silent, 
the witch pricker declared that he had discovered the mark.  Another test 
for detection was trial by water. The suspects were tied hands and great 
toes together, wrapped in a sheet and flung into a deep pool.  In cases 
where the body floated, the water of baptism was supposed to give up the 
accused, while those who sank to the bottom were absolved, but no attempt 
was made at rescue.  When confession was demanded the most horrible of 
tortures were resorted to, burning with irons being generally the last 
torture applied.  In some cases a diabolic contrivance called the ‘ witches’ 
bridle " was used. The  bridle encircled the victim’s head while an iron bit 
was thrust into the mouth from which prongs protruded piercing the tongue, 
palate and cheeks.  In cases of execution, the victim was usually strangled 
and thereafter burned at the stake.
     Witches were accused of a great variety of crimes.  A common offence 
was to bewitch milch cattle by turning their milk sour, or curtailing the 
supply, raising storms, stealing children from their graves, and promoting 
various illnesses. A popular device was to make a waxen image of their 
victim, thrust pins into it and sear it with hot irons, all of which their 
victim felt and at length succumbed. Upon domestic animals they cast an evil 
eye, causing emaciation and refusal to take food till at length death 
ensued. To those who believed in them and acknowledged their power, witches 
were supposed to use their powers for good by curing disease and causing 
prosperity.  Witches had a weekly meeting at which the devil presided, every 
Saturday commonly called "the witches’  Sabbath," their meetings generally 
being held in desolate places or in ruined churches, to which they rode 
through the air mounted on broomsticks.  If the devil was not present on 
their arrival, they evoked him by beating the earth with a fir-stick, and 
saying " Rise up foul thief."  The witches appeared to see him in different 
guises; to some he appeared as a boy clothed in green, others saw him 
dressed in white, while to others he appeared mounted on a black horse, 
After delivering a mock sermon, be held a court at which the witches had to 
make a full statement of their doings during the week.  Those who had not 
accomplished sufficient evil were belaboured with their own broomsticks, 
while those who had been more successful were rewarded with enchanted bones. 
The proceedings finished with a dance, the music to which the fiend played 
on his bagpipes.
     Robert Burns in his Tale of Tam o’ Shanter gives a graphic description 
of this orgy. There were great annual gatherings at Candlemas, Beltane and 
Hallow-eve.  These were of an International character at which the witch 
sisterhood of all nations assembled, those who had to cross the sea 
performing the journey in barges of egg-shell, while their aerial journeys 
were on goblin horses with enchanted bridles.
     Witchcraft was first dealt with by law in Scotland when by a statute 
passed in 1563 in the Parliament of Queen Mary it was enacted : " That na 
maner of person nor persons of quhatsumever estaite, degree or condition 
they be of, take upon hand in onie times hereafter to use onie maner of 
witchcraft, sorcerie, or necromancie, under the paine of death, alsweil to 
be execute against the user, abuser, as the seeker of the response of 
consultation."
     The great Reformer, John Knox, was accused by the Catholics of Scotland 
of being a renowned wizard and having. by sorcery raised up saints in the 
churchyard of St. Andrews when Satan himself appeared and so terrified 
Knox’s secretary that he became insane and died.  Knox was also charged that 
by his magical arts in his old age he persuaded the beautiful young daughter 
of Lord Ochiltree to marry him.  Nicol Burne bitterly denounces Knox for 
having secured the affections of "ane damosil of nobil blude, and he ane 
auld decrepit creatur of maist bais degree of onie that could be found in 
the country."
     There were numerous trials for witchcraft in the Justici-ary Court in 
Edinburgh and at the Circuit Courts, also session records preserved from 
churches all over Scotland show that numerous cases were dealt with by the 
local authorities and church officials,            A. J. B. G.
     Rodgers, in his Social Life in Scotland, says : " From the year 1479 
when the first capital sentence was carried out thirty thousand persons had 
on the charge of using enchantment been in Great Britain cruelly immolated 
of these one fourth belonged to Scotland.  No inconsiderable number of those 
who suffered on the charge of sorcery laid claim to necromantic acts with 
intents felonious or un-worthy.
     When James VI. of Scotland, in the year 1603, was called upon to ascend 
the throne of Great Britain and Ireland, his own native kingdom was in 
rather a curious condition.  James himself was a man of considerable 
learning, intimate with Latin and Theology, yet his book on Demonology marks 
him as distinctly superstitious and, while education and even scholarship 
were compara-tively common at this date in Scotland, more common in fact 
than they were in contemporary England, the great mass of Scottish people 
shared abundantly their sovereign’s dread of witches and the like.  The 
efforts of Knox and his doughty confreres, it is true, had brought about 
momen-tous changes in Scottish life, but if the Reformation ejected certain 
superstitions it undoubtedly tended to introduce others.  For that stern 
Calvinistic faith, which now began to take root in Scotland, nourished the 
idea that sickness and accident are a mark of divine anger, nor did this 
theory cease to be common in the north till long after King James’s day.
     It is a pity that the royal author, in the curious treatise mentioned 
above, volunteers but few precise facts anent the practitioners of magic who 
throve in Scotland during his reign.  But other sources of information 
indicate that these people were very numerous, and whereas, in Elizabe-than 
England, it was customary to put a witch to death by the merciful process of 
hanging, in Jacobean Scotland it was usual to take stronger measures.  In 
short, the victim was burnt at the stake ; and it is interesting to note 
that on North Berwick Law, in the county of East Lothian, there is standing 
to this day a tall stone which, according to local tradition, was erstwhile 
used for the ghastly business in question. Yet it would be wrong to suppose 
that witches and sorcerers, though handled roughly now and then, were 
regarded with universal hatred; for in seventeenth century Scotland medicine 
and magic went hand in hand, and the man suffering from a physical malady, 
particularly one whose cause he could not understand, very seldom entrusted 
himself to a professional leech, and much preferred to consult one who 
claimed healing capacities derived from intercourse with the unseen world.  
Physicians of the latter kind, however, were generally experts in the art of 
poisoning; and, while a good many cures are credited to them, their triumphs 
in the opposite direction would seem to have been much more numerous. Thus 
we find that in July, 1702, a certain James Reid of Musselburgh was brought 
to trial, being charged not merely with achieving miraculous cures, but with 
contriving the murder of one David Libbertoun, a baker in Edinburgh.  This 
David and his family, it transpires, were sworn enemies of a neighbouring 
household, Christie by name, and betimes their feud grew as fierce as that 
between the Montagues and Capulets;  so the Christies swore they would bring 
things to a conclusion, and going to Reid they petitioned his nefarious aid.  
His first act was to bewitch nine stones, these to be cast on the fields of 
the offending baker with a view to destroying his crops; while Reid then 
proceeded to enchant a piece of raw flesh, and’ also to make a statuette of 
wax-the nature of the design is not recorded, but presumably Libbertoun 
himself was represented-and Mrs. Christie was enjoined to thrust the meat 
under her enemy’s door, and then to go home and melt the waxwork before her 
own fire.  These instructions she duly obeyed, and a little later the victim 
breathed his last; but Reid did not go unscathed, and after his trial the 
usual fate of burning alive was meted out to him.
     A like sentence was passed in July 1605 on Patrick Lowrie, a native of 
Halic in Ayrshire, and known there as Pat the Witch," who was found guilty 
of foregathering with endless sorceresses of the neighbourhood, and of 
assisting them in disinterring bodies which they afterwards
dismembered.  Doubtless" Alloway’s auld haunted Kirk," sacred to the memory 
of Burns, was among those ransacked for corpses by the band ; yet if the 
crime was a gruesome one it was harmless withal, and assuredly Lowrie’s 
ultimate’ fate was distinctly a hard one!  On the other hand Isobel 
Griersone, a Prestonpans woman, received no more than justice when burnt to 
death on the Castle Rock, Edinburgh, in March 1607; for the record of her 
poisonings was a formidable one, rivalling that of Wainewright or that of 
Cellini himself while it is even recorded that she contrived to put an end 
to several people simply by cursing them Equally wonderful were the exploits 
of another sorceress, Belgis Todd of Longniddry, who is reported to have 
com-passed the death of a man she hated just by enchanting his cat; but this 
picturesque modus operandi was scorned by a notorious Perthshire witch Janet 
Irwing, who about the year 1610 poisoned sundry members of the family of 
Erskine of Dun, in the county of Angus. The criminal was detected anon, and 
suffered the usual fate; while a few years later a long series of tortures, 
culminating in burning, were inflicted on Margaret Dein (nee Barclay), whose 
accomplishments appear to have been of no commonplace nature.  The wife of a 
burgess of Irvine, John Dein, this woman conceived a violent aversion for 
her brother-in-law, Archibald; and on one occasion, when the latter was 
setting out for France, Margaret hurled imprecations at his ship, vowing 
none of its crew or passengers would ever return to their native Scotland. 
Months went by, and no word of Archibald’s arrival reached Irvine; while one 
day a pedlar named Stewart came to John Dein’s house, and declared that the 
baneful prophecy had been duly fulfilled. The municipal authorities now 
heard of the affair, and arresting Stewart, whom they had long suspected of 
practising magic, they commenced to cross-examine him. At first he would 
tell nothing, but when torture had loosened his tongue he confessed how, 
along with Margaret Dein, he had made a clay model of the ill-starred 
barque, and thrown this into the sea on a particularly stormy night.  His 
audience were horrified at the news, but they hastened to lay hands on the 
sorceress, whereupon they dealt with her as noted above.
     No doubt this tale, and many others like it, have blossomed very 
considerably in the course of being handed down from generation to 
generation, and no doubt the witches of Jacobean Scotland are credited with 
triumphs far greater than they really achieved. At the same time, scanning 
the annals of sorcery, we find that a number of its practitioners avowed 
stoutly, when confronted by a terrible death, that they had been initiated 
in their craft by the foul fiend himself, or haply by a band of fairies; and 
thus, whatever capacities these bygone magicians really had, it is manifest 
that they possessed in abundance that confidence which is among the secrets 
of power, and is perhaps the very key to success in any line of action.  
Small wonder, then, that they were dreaded by the simple, illiterate folk of 
their day ; and, musing on these facts, we feel less amazed at the credulity 
displayed by an erudite man like James VI., we are less surprised at his 
declaring that all sorcerers" ought to be put to death according to the law 
of God, the civill and imperiale Law, and municipall Law of all Christian 
nations."
     The last execution of a witch in Scotland took place in Sutherland in 
1722.  An old woman residing at Loth was charged amongst other crimes of 
having transformed her daughter into a pony and shod by the devil which 
caused the girl to turn lame both in hands and feet, a calamity which 
entailed upon her son.  Sentence of death was pronounced by Captain David 
Ross, the Sheriff-substitute. Rodgers relates  " The poor creature when lead 
to the’ stake was unconscious of the stir made on her account, and warming 
her wrinkled hands at the fire kindled to consume her, said she was thankful 
for so good a blaze.  For his rashness in pronouncing the sentence of death, 
the Sheriff was emphatically reproved."
     The reign of ignorance and superstition was fast drawing to a close.
     Witchcraft, if it can be so called nowadays, is dealt with under the 
laws pertaining to rogues, vagabonds, fortune-tellers, gamesters, and such 
like characters.  (See Fortune--telling.)
     Magic and Demonology.-Magic of the lower cultus, perhaps the detritus 
of Druidism, appears to have been common in Scotland until a late period.  
We find in the pages of Adamnan that the Druids were regarded by St. Columba 
and his priest as magicians, and that he met their sorcery with a superior 
celestial magic of his own.  Thus does the religion of one race become magic 
in the eyes of another. Notices of sorcery in Scotland before the thirteenth 
century are scanty, if we except the tradition that Macbeth encoun-tered 
three witches who prophesied his fate to him.  We have no reason to believe 
that Thomas the Rhymer (who has been endowed by later superstition with 
adventures similar to those of Tannhauser) was other than a minstrel and 
maker of epigrams, or that Sir Michael Scot was other than a scholar and man 
of letters.  Workers of sorcery were numerous but obscure, and although 
often of noble birth as Lady Glamis and Lady Fowlis, were probably very 
ignorant persons.  We get a glimpse of Scottish demonology in the later 
middle ages in the rhymed fragment known as “The Cursing of Sir John Rowil," 
a priest of Corstorphine, near Edinburgh, which dates perhaps from the last 
quarter of the fifteenth century.  It is an invective against certain 
persons who have rifled his poultry-yard, upon whom the priest calls down 
the divine vengeance.  The demons who were to torment the evildoers are: 
Garog, Harog, Sym Skynar, Devetinus "the devill that maid the dyce," 
Firemouth, Cokadame, Tutivillus, Browny, and Syr Garnega, who may be the 
same as that Girnigo, to whom cross children are often likened by angry 
mothers of the Scottish working-classes, in such a phrase as " eh, ye’re a 
wee girnigo," and the Scottish verb, to "girn," may find its origin in the 
name of a medieval fiend, the last shadow of some Teutonic or Celtic deity 
of unlovable attributes. In Sym Skynar, we may have Skyrnir, a Norse giant 
in whose glove Thor found shelter from an earthquake, and who sadly fooled 
him and his companions.  Skyrnir was, of course, one of the Jotunn or Norse 
Titans, and probably one of the powers of winter ; and he may have received 
the popular surname of " Sym" in the same manner as we speak of " Jack" 
Frost.  A great deal has still to be done in unearthing the minor figures of 
Scottish mythology and demonology, and even the greater ones have not 
received the attention due to them.  In Newhaven, a fishing district near 
Edinburgh, for example, we find the belief current in a fiend called 
Brounger, who is described as an old man who levies a toll of fish and 
oysters upon the local fisherman.  If he is not placated with these, he 
wreaks vengeance on the persons who fail to supply him.  He is also 
described as a Flint and the son of a Flint," which proves conclusively 
that, like Thor and many other gods of Asia and America, he was a thunder or 
weather deity.  In fact his name is probably a mere corruption of an ancient 
Scandinavian word meaning "to strike," which still survives in the Scottish 
expression to " make a breenge " at one.  To return to instances of 
practical magic, a terrifying and picturesque legend tells how Sir Lewis 
Bellenden, a lord of session, and superior of the Barony of Broughton, near 
Edinburgh, succeeded by the aid of a sorcerer in raising the Devil in the 
backyard of his own house in the Canongate, some-where about the end of the 
sixteenth century. Sir Lewis was a notorious trafficker with witches, with 
whom his barony of Broughton was overrun.  Being desirous of beholding his 
Satanic majesty in person, he secured the services of one Richard Graham.  
The results of the evoca-tion were disastrous to the inquisitive judge, 
whose nerves were so shattered at the apparition of the Lord of Hades that 
he fell ill and shortly afterwards expired.
     The case of Major Weir is one of the most inter-esting in the annals of 
Scottish sorcery.  " It is certain," says Scott, "that no story of 
witchcraft or necromancy, so many of which occurred near and in Edinburgh, 
made such a lasting impression on the public mind as that of Major Weir. The 
remains of the house in which he and his sister lived are still shown at the 
head of the West Bow, which has a gloomy aspect, well suited for a necro-
mancer.  It was at different times a brazier’s shop and a magazine for lint, 
and in my younger days was employed for the latter use; but no family would 
inhabit the haunted walls as a residence; and bold was the urchin from the 
High School who dared approach the gloomy ruin at the risk of seeing the 
Major’s enchanted staff parading through the old apartments, or hearing the 
hum of the necromantic wheel, which procured for his sister such a character 
as a spinner.
     "The case of this notorious wizard was remarkable chiefly from his 
being a man of some condition (the son of a gentleman, and his mother a lady 
of family in Clydes-dale), which was seldom the case with those that fell 
under similar accusations.  It was also remarkable in his case that he had 
been a Covenanter, and peculiarly attached to that cause.  In the years of 
the Commonwealth this man was trusted and employed by those who were then at 
the head of affairs, and was in 1649 commander of the City-Guard of 
Edinburgh, which procured him his title of Major.  In this capacity he was 
understood, as was indeed implied in the duties of that officer at the 
period, to be very strict in executing severity upon such Royalists as fell 
under his military charge.  It appears that the Major, with a maiden sister 
who had kept his house, was subject to fits of’ melancholic lunacy, an 
infirmity easily recon-cilable with the formal pretences which he made to a 
high show of religious zeal,  He was peculiar in his gift of prayer, and, as 
was the custom of the period, was often called to exercise his talent by the 
bedside of sick persons, until it came to be observed that, by some 
association, with it is more easy to conceive than to explain, he could not 
pray with the same warmth and fluency of expression unless when he had in 
his hand a stick of pecu-liar shape and appearance, which he generally 
walked with.  It was noticed, in short, that when this stick was taken from 
him, his wit and talent appeared to forsake him. This Major Weir was seized 
by the magistrates on a strange whisper that became current respecting vile 
practices, which he seems to have admitted without either shame or 
contrition.  The disgusting profligacies which he con-fessed were of such a 
character that it may be charitably hoped most of them were the fruits of a 
depraved imagination, though he appears to have been in many respects a 
wicked and criminal hypocrite.  When he had completed his confession, he 
avowed solemnly that he had not con-fessed the hundredth part of the crimes 
which he had com-mitted.  From this time he would answer no interrogatory, 
nor would he have recourse to prayer, arguing that, as he had no hope 
whatever of escaping Satan, there was no need of incensing him by vain 
efforts at repentance.  His witchcraft seems to have been taken for granted 
on his own confession, as his indictment was chiefly founded on the same 
document, in which he alleged he had never seen the devil, but any feeling 
he had of him was in the dark. He received sentence of death, which he 
suffered 12th April, 1670, at the Gallow-hill, between Leith and Edinburgh. 
He died so stupidly sullen and impenitent as to justify the opinion that he 
was oppressed with a kind of melancholy frenzy, the consequence perhaps of 
remorse, but such as urged him not to repent, but to despair.  It seems 
probable that he was burnt alive.  His sister, with whom he was supposed to 
have had an incestuous connection, was condemned also to death, leaving a 
stronger and more explicit testimony of their mutual sins than could be 
extracted from the Major.  She gave, as usual, some account of her 
connection with the queen of the fairies, and acknow-ledged the assistance 
she received from that sovereign in spinning an unusual quantity of yarn.  
Of her brother she said that one day a friend called upon them at noonday 
with a fiery chariot, and invited them to visit a friend at Dalkeith, and 
that while there her brother received informa-tion of the event of the 
battle of Worcester.  No one saw the style of their equipage except 
themselves.  On the scaffold this woman, determining, as she said, to die " 
with the greatest shame possible" was with difficulty prevented from 
throwing off her clothing before the people, and with scarce less trouble 
was she flung from the ladder by the executioner.  Her last words were in 
the tone of the sect to which her brother had so long affected to belong:
     "Many," she said, " weep and lament for a poor old wretch like me; but 
alas, few are weeping for a broken covenant."
     Alchemy.- James IV. was attached to the science of alchemy.  "Dunbar 
speaks of the patronage which the king bestowed upon certain adventurers, 
who had studied the mysteries of alchemy, and were ingenious in making ‘ 
quintiscence’ which should convert other metals into pure gold; and in the 
Treasurer’s Accounts there are numerous payments for the ‘quinta essentia,’ 
including wages to the persons employed, utensils of various kinds, coals 
and wood for the furnaces, and for a variety of other materials, such as 
quicksilver, aqua vitae, litharge, auri, fine tin, burnt silver, alum, salt 
and eggs, saltpetre, etc. Considerable sums were also paid to several ‘ 
Potingairs’ for stuff of various kinds to the Quinta Essentia. Thus, on the 
3rd of March, 1501, ‘the king sent to Strivelin (Stirling) four Harry nobles 
in gold, ‘-a sum equal, as it is stated, to nine pounds Scots money-’ for 
the leech to multiply.’  On the 27th of May, 1502, the Treasurer paid to 
Robert Bartoun, one of the king’s mariners, ‘ for certain droggis (drugs) 
brocht home by him to the French leich, £31 : 4 : o.’  On the 11th of 
February, 1503-4, we find twenty shillings given’ to the man suld mak aurum 
potabile, be the king’s commands.’  And on the 13th of October, 1507, the 
Treasurer paid six pounds for a puncheon of wine to the Abbot of Tungland, 
to’ mak Quinta Essentia.’  The credulity and indiscriminate generosity of 
the Scottish monarch appear to have collected around him a multitude of 
quacks of all sorts, for, besides the Abbot, mention is made of ‘ the leech 
with the curland hair’ ; of ‘the lang Dutch doctor,’ of one Fullertone, who 
was believed to possess the secret of making precious stones ; of a Dr. 
Ogilvy who laboured hard at the transmutation of metals, and many other 
empirics, whom James not only supported in their experiments, but himself 
assisted in their labora-tory. The most noted of these adventurers was the 
person who is variously styled in the Treasurer’s Accounts ‘the French 
Leich,’ ‘ Maister John the French Leich,’ ‘ Maister John the French 
Medicinar,’ and ‘French Maister John.’ The real name of this empiric was 
John Damian; and we learn from Dunbar that he was a native of Lombardy, and 
had practised surgery and other arts in France before his arrival in 
Scotland.  His first appearance at the court of James was in the capacity of 
a French leech, and as he is mentioned among the persons who received ‘ 
leveray’ in 1501-2, there can be no doubt that he held an appointment as a 
physician in the royal household.  He soon succeeded in ingratiating himself 
with the king, and it is probable that it was from him that James imbibed a 
strong passion for alchemy, as he about this time erected at Stirling a 
furnace for prosecuting such experiments, and continued during the rest of 
his reign to expend considerable sums of money in attempts to discover the 
philosopher’s stone. ‘Maister John,’ says Bishop Lesley, ‘ caused the king 
believe, that he by multiplying and utheris his inventions sold make fine 
gold of uther metal, quhilk science he callit the Quintassence, whereupon 
the king made great cost, but all in vain.’  There are numerous entries in 
the Treasurer’s Accounts of sums paid for saltpetre, bellows, two great 
stillatours, brass mortars, coals, and numerous vessels of various shapes, 
sizes, and denominations, for the use of this foreign adept in his mystical 
studies.  ‘ These, however, were not his sole occupations ; for after the 
mysterious labours of the day were concluded, Master John was wont to play 
at cards with the sovereign-a mode by which he probably transferred the 
contents of the royal exchequer into his own purse, as efficaciously as by 
his distillations.’ We find that on the 4th of March, 1501, nine pounds five 
shillings were paid ‘ to the king and the French leich to play at cartis.’  
A few months later, on the occasion of a temporary visit which the empiric 
found it necessary to pay to France, James made him a present of his own 
horse and two hundred pounds.  Early in the year 1504, the Abbot of 
Tungland, in Galloway, died, and the king, with a reckless disregard of the 
dictates of duty, and even of common decency, appointed this unprincipled 
adven-turer to the vacant office.  On the 11th March, the Treasurer paid ‘to 
Gareoch Parsuivant fourteen shillings to pass to  Tungland for  the Abbacy 
to  French Maister John.’  On the 12th of the same month, ‘by the king’s 
command,’ he paid ‘to Bardus Altovite Lumbard twenty-five pounds for Maister 
John, the French Mediciner, new maid Abbot of Tungland, whilk he aucht 
(owed) to the said Bardus ; ‘ and a few days later on the 17th, there was 
given ‘to Maister John the new maid Abbot of Tungland, seven pounds.’  Three 
years after, in 1507, July 27, occurs the following entry: ‘ Item,. lent, by 
the king’s command to the Abbot of Tungland, and can nocht be gettin fra him 
£33 : 6: 8.’  An adventure which befel this dexterous im-postor afforded 
great amusement to the Scottish court. On the occasion of an embassy setting 
out from Stirling to the court of France, he had the assurance to declare 
that by means of a pair of artificial wings which he had constructed, he 
would undertake to fly to Paris and arrive long before the am-bassadors.  
‘This time,’ says Bishop Lesley, ‘there was an Italiane with the king, who 
was made Abbot of Tung-land. This abbot tuke in hand to flie with wings, and 
to be in France before the said ambassadors; and to that effect he caused 
make ane pair of wings of feathers, quhilk bein festinitt uponn him he flew 
off the castle-wall of Stirling but shortly he fell to the ground and broke 
his thie-bane; but the wyte (blame) thereof he ascribed to their beand some 
hen feathers in the wings, quhilk yarnit, and coveted the myddin and not the 
skies.’  This incident gave rise to Dunbar’s satirical ballad entitled, ‘ Of 
the Fenyeit Friar of Tungland,’ in which the poet exposes in the most sar-
castic strain the pretensions of the luckless adventurer, and relates with 
great humour the result of his attempt to soar into the skies, when he was 
dragged to the earth by the low-minded propensities of the ‘ hen feathers,’ 
which he had inadvertently admitted into the construction of his wings.  The 
unsuccessful attempt of the abbot, though, according to Lesley, it subjected 
him to the ridicule of the whole kingdom, does not appear to have lost him 
the king’s favour, for the Treasurer’s books, from October, 1507, to August, 
1508, repeatedly mention him as having played at dice and cards with his 
majesty; and on the 8th of Septem-ber, 1508, ‘Damiane, Abbot of Tungland,’ 
obtained the royal permission to pursue his studies abroad during the space 
of five years. He must have returned to Scotland, however, before the death 
of James; and the last notice given to this impostor is quite in character. 
On the 27th of March, 1513, the sum of twenty pounds was paid to him for his 
journey to the mine in Crawford Moor, where the king had at that time 
artisans at work searching for gold." From this reign to that of Mary no 
magician or alchemical practitioner of note appears to have existed in 
Scotland, and in the reign of James VI. too great severity was exhibited 
against such to permit of them avowing them-selves publicly. In James’s 
reign, however, lived the celebrated Alexander Seton (q.v.), of Port Seton 
near Edin-burgh, known abroad as ‘The Cosmopolite’ who is said to have 
succeeded in achieving the transmutation of
metals.	L S.
     Highlands.-Pagan Scotland appears to have been entirely devoid of 
benevolent deities. Those representa-tives of the spirit world who were on 
friendly terms with mankind were either held captive by magic spells, or had 
some sinister object in view which caused them to act with the most 
plausible duplicity.  The chief demon or deity - one hesitates which to call 
her-was a one-eyed Hag who had tusks like a wild bear. She is referred to in 
folk tales as" the old wife" (Cailleach), " Grey Eyebrows" "the Yellow 
Muitearteach," etc., and reputed to be a great worker of spells. Apparently 
she figured in a lost creation myth, for fragmentary accounts survive of how 
she fashioned the hills, brought lochs into existence and caused whirlpools 
by vengeful operations in the sea. She is a lover of darkness, desolations 
and winter. With her hammer she alternately splinters mountains, prevents 
the growth of grass or raises storms. Numerous wild animals follow her, 
including deer, goats, wild boars. When one of her sons is thwarted in his 
love affairs by her, he transforms her into a mountain boulder " looking 
over the sea," a form she retains during the summer. She is liberated again 
on the approach of winter. During the Spring months the Hag drowns fishermen 
and preys on the food supply : she also steals children and roasts them in 
her cave. Her progeny includes a brood of monstrous giants each with several 
heads and arms. These are continually operating against mankind, throwing 
down houses, abduct-ing women and destroying growing crops. Heroes who fight 
against them require the assistance of the witch who is called " Wise 
Woman," from whom they obtain magic wands. The witch of Scottish folk tales 
is the " friend of man," and her profession was evidently regarded in 
ancient times as a highly honourable one.  Wizards also enjoyed high repute 
; they were the witch - doctors, priests and magicians of the Scottish 
Pagans, and it was not until the sixteenth century that legal steps were 
taken to suppress them in the Highland districts.  There was no sun-worship 
or moon-worship in Scotland; neither sun nor moon were individualised in the 
Gaelic language; these bodies; however were reputed to exercise a magical 
influence.  The moon especially was a " Magic Tank " from which supplies of 
power were drawn by those capable of performing requisite ceremonies.  But 
although there were no lunar or solar spirits, there were numerous earth and 
water spirits. The water wife," like the English " mere wife," was a greatly 
dreaded being who greedily devoured victims. She must not be confused with 
the Banshee, that Fate whose chief business it was to foretell disasters, 
either by washing blood-stained garments or knocking, knocking on a certain 
boulder beside a river, or in the locality where some great tragedy was 
impending. The water wife usually confronted a late traveller at a ford. She 
claimed him as her own and if he disputed her claim, asked what weapons he 
had to use against her. The unwary one named each in turn, and when he did 
so the power to harm her passed away.  One story of this character runs : 
"The wife rose up against the smith who rode his horse, and she said, “I 
have you:  what have you against me ?"" My sword," the man answered. " I 
have that," she said, what else ? " "My shield," the man said. " I have that 
and you are mine." "But," protested the man, " I have something else."  
"What is that? " the water wife demanded. To this question the cautious 
smith answered, "I have the long, grey, sharp thing at my thigh." This was 
his dirk, and not having named it, he was able to make use of it. As he 
spoke he flung his plaid round the water wife and lifted her up on his horse 
behind him. Enclosed in the magic circle she was powerless to harm him, and 
he rode home with her, deaf to her entreaties and promises. He took her t6 
his smithy and tied her to the anvil. That night her brood came to release 
her. They raised a tem-pest and tore the roof off the smithy, but the smith 
defied them. When day dawned they had to retreat. Then he bargained with the 
water wife, and she consented if he would release her that neither he nor 
any of his descendants should ever be drowned in any three rivers he might 
name. He named three and received her promise, but as she made her escape 
she reminded him of a fourth river. " It is mine still," she added. In that 
particular river the smith himself ultimately perished." To this day 
fishermen will not name either the fish they desire to procure or those that 
prey on their catches. Haddocks are " white bellies," salmon "red ones," and 
the dog-fish "the big black fellow." It is also regarded unlucky to name a 
minister, or refer to Sunday, in a fishing boat-a fact which suggests that 
in early Christian times fishermen might be pious churchmen on land but 
continued to practise paganism when they went to sea, like the Icelandic 
Norsemen who believed that Christ ruled their island, and Thor the ocean. 
Fairies must not be named on Fridays or at Hallowe’en, and Beltain (May Day) 
when charm fires were lit.
     Earth worship, or rather the propitiation of earth spirits, was a 
prominent feature of Scottish paganism. There again magic played a leading 
role. Compacts were confirmed by swearing over a piece of turf, certain 
moors or mounds were set apart for ceremonial practices, and these were 
visited for the performance of child-procuring and other ceremonies which 
were performed at a standing stone.  In cases of sickness a divination cake 
was baked and left at a sacred place; if it disappeared during the night, 
the patient was supposed to recover; if it remained untouched until the 
following morning it was believed that the patient would die. This practice 
is not yet obsolete. Offerings were constantly made to the earth spirits. In 
a witch trial recorded in Humbie Kirk Session Register (23rd September, 
1649) one Agnes Gourlay is accused of having made offerings of milk, saying, 
" God betuch ws to; they. are wnder the yird that have as much need of it as 
they that are above the yird" ; i.e., " God preserve us too ; they are under 
the earth that have as much need of it as they that are above the earth."  
The milk poured out upon the earth at magical ceremonies was supposed to go 
to the fairies. Gruagach stones have not yet entirely van-ished in the 
Highlands. These are flat stones with deep cup" marks. After a cow is 
milked, the milker pours into a hole the portion of milk required by the 
Gruagach, a long-haired spirit who is usually " dressed like a gentle-man."  
If no offering is given to him, the cream will not rise on the milk, and, if 
it does the churning will be a failure.  There are interesting records in 
the Presbytery records of Dingwall, Ross-shire, regarding the prevalence of 
milk pouring and other ceremonies during the seventeenth century. Among the 
"abominations" referred to are those for which Gairloch parish continued to 
be notorious-frequent approaches to some ruinous chappels and circu-lateing 
them ; and that future events in reference especiallie to lyfe and death, in 
takeing of journeyes, was exspect to be manifested by a holl (hole) of a 
round stone quherein (wherein) they tryed the entering of their heade, which 
(if they) could doe, to witt, be able to put in their heade, they exspect 
thair returning to that place, and failing they considered it ominous."  
Objection was also taken by the horrified Presbytery to "their adoring of 
wells and super-stitious monuments and stones," and to the " sacrifice of 
bulls at a certaine tyme uppon  the 25 of August" and to “pouring milk upon 
hills as oblationes."
     The seer was usually wrapped in the skin of a sacrificed bull and left 
lying all night beside a river.  He was visited by supernatural beings in 
the darkness and obtained answers regarding future events.  Another way to 
perform this divination ceremony was to roast a live cat.  The cat was 
turned on a spit until the " Big Cat" (the devil) appeared and either 
granted the wish of the performer of the ceremony, or foretold what was to 
take place in answer to a query.  At the present day there are many 
surviving beliefs regarding witchcraft, fairies, the evil eye, second sight 
and magical charms to cure or injure.
     Individuals, domesticated animals and dwellings are charmed against 
witchcraft by iron and certain herbs or berries.  The evil eye influence is 
dispelled by drinking "water of silver" from a wooden bowl or ladle.  The 
water is taken from a river or well of high repute ; silver is placed in it; 
then a charm is repeated, and when it has been passed over a fire, the 
victim is given to drink and what remains is sprinkled round the hearth-
stone with ceremony which varies in districts. Curative charms are handed 
down in families from a male to a female and a female to a male.  Blood-
stopping charms are still re-garded with great sanctity and the most 
persistent col-lectors have been unable to obtain them from those who are 
reported to be able to use these with effect.  Accounts are still given of " 
blood-stopping" from a distance. Although the possessor of the power has 
usually a traditional charm, he or she rarely uses it without praying also.  
Some Highland doctors bear testimony in private to the wonder-ful effects of 
" blood-stopping" operations.  A few years ago a medical officer of 
Inverness-shire stated in his official report to the County Council that he 
was watching with interest the operations of " King’s Evil Curers " who 
still enjoy great repute in the Western Isles. These are usually seventh 
sons."  " Second-sight," like the power to cure and stop blood, runs in 
families. There is not a parish in the Scottish Highlands without its family 
in which one or more individuals are reputed to have occult powers. Some 
have visions either while awake or asleep.  Others hear ominous sounds on 
occasions and are able to under-stand what they signify.  Certain 
individuals confess, but with no appreciation of the faculty, that they are 
sometimes, not always, able to foretell that a person is likely to die are 
long. Two instances of this kind may be given. A younger brother caught a 
chill. When an elder brother visited him he knew at once the young man would 
die soon, and communicated a statement to that effect to a mutual friend.  
According to medical opinion the patient who was not confined to bed, was in 
no danger, but three months afterwards he developed serious symptoms and 
died suddenly. When intelligence of the death was communicated to the elder 
brother he had a temporary illness.  The same individual met a gentleman in 
a friend’s house and had a similar experience: he "felt" he could not 
explain how, that this man was near death.  On two occasions within the 
following week he questioned the gentleman’s daughter regarding her father’s 
health and was informed that he was "as usual."  The daughter was surprised 
at the inquiries. Two days after this meeting the gentleman in question 
expired suddenly while sitting in his chair. Again the individual, on 
hearing of the death, had a brief but distressing illness, with symptoms 
usually associated with shock. The mother of this man has a similar faculty. 
On several occasions she has seen lights. One day during the Boer War an 
officer passing her door bade her good-bye as he had been ordered to South 
Africa. She said, " He will either be slain or come back deformed," and 
turned ill immediately. A few months afterwards the officer was wounded in 
the lower jaw with a bullet and returned home with his face much deformed.
     The " Second-sight" faculty manifests itself in various ways, as these 
instances show, and evidence that it is possessed by individuals may occur 
only once or twice in a lifetime. There are cases, however, in which it is 
con-stantly active. Those who are reputed to have the faculty are most 
reticent regarding it, and appear to dread it. At the close of the 
nineteenth century tow-charms to cure sprains and bruises were sold in a 
well-known Highland town by a woman who muttered a metrical spell over each 
magic knot she tied as the afflicted part was treated by her. She had 
numerous patients among all classes. Bone-setters still enjoy high repute in 
localities: not many years ago a public presentation was made to a Ross-
shire bone-setter in recognition of his lifelong services to the community.  
His faculty was inherited from his for-bears.
     Numerous instances may be gleaned in the Highlands of the appearance of 
the spirits of the living and the dead. The appearance of the spirit of a 
living person is said to be a sure indication of the approaching death of 
that individual.  It is never seen by a member of the family, but appears to 
intimate friends.
Sometimes it speaks and gives indication of the fate of some other mutual 
acquain-tance.

Scott, David and William Bell: These brothers, of whom David is by far the 
more important, certainly deserve a place in this volume, Born at Edinburgh 
in 1777, David lived a comparatively uneventful life, his lofty gifts being 
quite unrecognised by his contemporaries, and his death in 1849 being 
hastened in some degree by this persistent neglect. Nowadays, however, 
connoisseurs in Scotland are beginning to appreciate him, perceiving in his 
output technical merits far transcending those of Raeburn himself; while 
people who care for art dealing with the supernatural are coming to see, 
slowly but surely, that Scott’s Paracelsus and Vasco de Gama are in the 
forefront of work of this kind; and that his beautiful drawings for The 
Ancient Mariner render the very spirit of Coleridge, the arch-mystic, render 
it with a skill unsurpassed in any previous or subsequent illustrations to 
the poem.
     William Bell Scott was also a native of Edinburgh, being born there in 
1811, and his career was very different from David’s, for he won worldly 
success from the first, and ere his death in 1890 he had received many 
laurels. Etching some of his brother’s works, and painting a host of 
pictures, he was also a voluminous writer; and his Autobiography contains 
some really valuable comments on the mystic symbolism permeating the 
painting of the middle-ages, and embodies also a shrewd and interesting 
account of Rossetti’s essays in table-turning and kindred practices. 
Moreover, William Bell’s poems are almost all of a meta-physical order; and 
though it is extravagant to call him "the Scottish Blake," as many people 
have done, his mystical verse undoubtedly reflects a certain " meditative 
beauty," as Fiona Macleod once wrote on the subject.

Scott or Scot, Michael: Scottish Astrologer and Magician (1175-1234). Though 
Michael Scott’s life is wrapped in obscurity his name is rather a familiar 
one, various causes having brought this about.  In the first place, Dante 
refer to him in his Inferno, speaking of him as one singularly skilled in 
magical arts; while he is also mentioned by Boccaccio, who hails him as 
among the greatest masters of necromancy.  Moreover, Coleridge projected a 
drama dealing with Michael, whom he asserted was a much more interesting 
personality than Faustus; and then there is a novel about him by Allan 
Cunningham, while, above all, he figures in The’ Lay of the Last Minstrel. 
And Sir Walter Scott, no very careful antiquarian, identifies the astrologer 
with one Sir Michael Scott of Balwearie, who, along with Sir David Wemyss of 
Wemyss, went to bring the Maid of Norway to Scotland in 1290; but this 
identification is manifestly wrong, for in a poem by Vincent de Beauvais 
published so early as 1235, Michael is mentioned as lately deceased.  Of 
course this does not vitiate the idea that he emanated from the family of 
Balwearie, whose estates were situate near Kirkcaldy, in Fife; and it is 
almost certain indeed, that he was a man of gentle birth, it being recorded 
that he studied at Oxford university, where it is improbable he would have 
gone had his parents not been in compara-tively affluent circumstances.  
When his Oxonian days were over Michael proceeded to the Sorbonne at Paris, 
where he acquired the title of mathematicus; and from the French capital he 
wandered on to Bologna, in those days famous as a seat of learning.  He did 
not tarry here for long, however, but went to Palermo; while subsequently he 
settled for a while at Toledo, for he was anxious to study Arabic, and that 
town afforded good facilities therefor.  He appears to have been successful 
with these studies, master-ing the intricacies of the Arabic tongue 
thoroughly; yet there was nothing to induce him to continue in Spain, and 
accordingly he went to Sicily, where he became attached to the court of 
Ferdinand II., probably in the capacity of state-astrologer.  At least, he 
is so designated in an early manuscript copy, now in the Bodleian Library, 
of his book on astronomy; yet it is clear that, at some time or other, 
Michael had espoused holy orders.  For in 1223 the Pope, Honorius III., 
wrote to the Archbishop of Canterbury, urging him to procure an English 
benefice for Scott, while it appears that in the following year the 
Archbishopric of Cashel in Ireland was offered to him, and that he declined 
this on account of his total ignorance of the Erse language. This refusal to 
take a post for which he was unsuited reflects great credit on him, and it 
is patent that he was highly esteemed at the Vatican, for in 1227 Gregory 
IX., successor of Honorius, made further overtures to the English primate on 
behalf of Michael; and, whether these proved fruitful or not, according to 
Roger Bacon the necromancer came to England in 1230, bringing with him the 
works of Aristotle-at that date virtually unknown in this country-and 
contriving to give them a certain popu-larity amongst scholars.
     It is reasonable to suppose that Michael, having come to England, also 
paid a visit to his native Scotland.  And, though no documentary evidence is 
forthcoming to support this theory, local tradition at Melrose contends that 
the astrologer came to that town in his old age, and that he died there and 
was buried somewhere in the neighbourhood. Various other places in the 
Borders likewise claim this distinction, and Sir Walter Scott tells that, 
throughout the south of Scotland, "any great work of great labour or 
antiquity is ascribed either to Auld Michael, Sir William Wallace, or the 
Devil."  One popular story about the necromancer maintains that he used to 
ride through the air on a demon horse, and another that he was wont to sail 
the seas on the back of some fabulous animal; while yet a further legend 
recounts that he went as Scottish envoy to the king of France, and that the 
first stamp of his black steed’s horse rang the bells of Notre Dame, 
whereupon his most Christian majesty granted the messenger all he desired.
     As regards the writings of Michael, he is credited with a translation 
of Aristotle’s De Animalibus, but the ascription is not very well founded.  
However, it is almost certain that he wrote Quaesto Curiosa de Natura Solis 
et Lunae, which is included in the Theatrum Chemicum; while he was 
undoubtedly author of Mensa Philosophica, published at Frankfort in 1602 ; 
and also of Liber Physiognomiae Magistri Michaelis Scot, a book which was 
reprinted nearly twenty times, and was translated into various languages. 
Reference has already been made to a manuscript in the Bodleian Library 
attributed to Michael, and it behoves to add here that at Corpus Christi 
College, Oxford, at the Vatican and at the Sorbonne, there are further 
documents purporting to have been penned by the astrologer himself, to have 
been written at his dictation, or to have been copied out by scribes soon 
after the actual author’s decease.


Screech Owl : The cry of the screech owl at midnight is said to portend 
evil.


Sea Phantoms and Superstitions : Sailors as a class are invariably 
superstitious, while their predilection herein is shared in general by 
fishermen, and others who dwell by the marge of the great deep.  The old 
songs of the outer Hebrides are full of wizardry, and this figures too in 
many a chanty composed by bygone seamen; while Captain Marryat, a writer who 
understood sailors as few others have done, testified repeatedly to their 
firm belief in the supernatural.  Nor is he the only author who has dealt 
with this, for, not to mention less notable names, Coleridge touched on the 
matter in his poem of the Ancient Mariner; while turning from literature to 
painting, that exquisite Scottish master David Scott, in a memorable canvas 
now domiciled in the seaport town of Leith, shows Vasco de Gama and his 
henchmen gazing thunderstruck at an apparition rising from the waves. And it 
is scarcely sur-prising, after all, that credulity, in this relation should 
be a salient characteristic of sailors, the mere fact that they live in 
constant danger of sudden death constituting a good explanation and apology.  
In the duchy of Cornwall, so rich in romantic associations of all Sorts, 
quite a number of stories concerning marine spectres have been handed down 
from generation to generation, and are current and even popular to this day. 
One of these stories ?elates how, on a winter’s evening when a fierce gale 
was raging round the Cornish headlands, a fisherman chanced to see a ship in 
distress; and away the man hastened at once, calling on some of his fellows 
to come and aid him in the work of rescuing the perishing. In a few minutes 
a rowing boat had been manned, for Cornish fisherfolk are accustomed to go 
afloat in all weathers and to face the peril of drowning while very soon the 
gallant rescuers were almost within earshot of the distressed vessel, and 
could see her name clearly on the stern: They thought to jump on board, 
their idea being that, were the ship blest with a skilful pilot acquainted 
with the dangers of the coast, she might be steered safely into Falmouth 
harbour; but, just as one of the fishermen stood up in the prow of the boat 
with intent to throw a rope, the great vessel looming before him dis-
appeared from sight altogether. She could not have sunk, for had that been 
her fate, some relics thereof must certainly have survived upon the seething 
foam and billows; and, vowing that the devil had conjured up a phantom to 
induce them to put out to sea, the rowers put their boat about speedily, and 
pulled for home with might and main. One and all, they were more afraid of 
the evil one’s machinations than of the more genuine perils they were 
encountering; and an analogous, but more reasonable form of credulity on the 
part of the Cornish fisherfolk is instanced by another of their traditions, 
one associated with the village of Sennen Cove. This place is situate at the 
head of a bay flanked by two mighty capes. Sometimes a band of misty vapour 
stretches right across the bay, obscuring the villagers’ outlook towards the 
sea beyond  and whenever this occurs the fisherfolk regard it with awe, 
believing that it warns them not to put out in their boats. At one time, so 
it is recorded in the neighbourhood, Sennen Cove numbered among its 
inhabitants a group of doughty spirits who, wont to laugh at this 
superstition, were minded to demonstrate its absurdity; and accordingly, 
when the warning band of vapour next made its appearance, they sailed off 
singing gaily.  But their boat never returned, their fate remained a 
mystery; and in fine they contrived to strengthen rather than weaken the 
belief they had ridiculed.
     Scotland also has her stories of phantom barques. Near Ballachulish, on 
the west coast of Argyllshire, there is a rocky island on which the 
Macdonalds of Glencoe were wont to bury their honoured and laurelled dead; 
and the lore of the district tells that once, some hundreds of years ago, a 
skiff bearing a beloved chieftain’s corpse to this place of interment 
foundered ere reaching its destination.  A horrible thing was this thought 
the Macdonalds, a horrible thing that the father of the clan should be swept 
from sea to sea, and be denied a resting-place beside his ancestors while 
anon it appeared as though the affair had verily been contrived by 
supernatural agency, for invariably, just before any misfortune overtook the 
tribe of Macdonald, the wrecked skiff was seen drifting about the sea, its 
dead oarsman clinging to it, and a coffin floating in its wake. Only too 
often this weird vision appeared, and it is said that, on the eve of the 
massacre of Glencoe, the spectre boat bore a crew of ghostly female mourners 
who sang a loud coronach, their wails reverberating far among the 
neighbouring mountains.
     Another Highland story contends that a large ship, wrecked off the 
coast of Ross at the time of the first trans-portation of Celts to Canada, 
still rises occasionally from the waves which erstwhile claimed it as their 
prey, and, after sailing gallantly for a few minutes, suddenly lurches and 
sinks beneath the ocean; while dwellers by the shores of the Solway tell how 
a certain craft, which went down there while conveying a gay bridal party 
towards Stran-raer, is frequently seen driving at full speed before the 
gale, the bride and bridegroom clinging to the rigging as though in terror 
of immediate death by drowning. Nor is this the only phantom wherein the 
Solway rejoices, for that proverbially treacherous firth, round which Sir 
Walter Scott has cast so potent a halo of romance in Redgauntlet, witnessed 
once upon a time the foundering of two Scan-dinavian pirate-vessels, and 
these are said to rise periodi-cally from the water, the fierce and 
murderous crew of each calling the while for the mercy which they themselves 
never accorded their victims.
     Bidding adieu to British legends, and looking further afield, we find 
that religion plays a prominent part in stories of spectre ships.  At 
Boulogne, for example, there is a tradition to the effect that on one 
occasion, at a remote date in the middle ages, the townspeople were desirous 
of building a church, for at this time they were without any public place of 
worship ; but, anxious as they were to choose a site which the Almighty 
would approve, they found it dim cult to come to a decision on this head, 
every-one suggesting a different place.  Finally, in despair, a body of them 
assembled on the beach, intending to offer up prayer for a solution to the 
problem; and while they were engaged thus they happened to look out to sea, 
when lo a vessel was see,’ sailing towards them, the sacred Virgin herself 
Oh board.  Standing erect in the bows, she pointed with her hand in a 
certain direction; and the devout people realised at once that their 
petition had been answered whereupon the mysterious phantom vanished as 
quickly as it had come. Another French spectre-ship. however, was wont to 
remain in sight for longer periods, while its appearance invariably struck 
terror in to the hearts of all who beheld it. Small wonder too, the vessel 
being manned by a crew of demons and great’ dogs-the perjured souls of men 
who had been guilty of fearful crimes; yet the pious knew that in reality 
they had little to fear, the priests having told them that the repetition of 
a paternoster was adamantine proof against molestations from the hideous 
vision. Somewhat akin to this story is one associated with Venice, where, 
one stormy evening about the middle of the fourteenth century, a fisherman 
was requested to row three saints to a neighbouring village on the Adriatic; 
and, after bending to his oars for a while, he suddenly stopped and gazed as 
though petrified, a galley filled with swarthy Saracens having risen beside 
his boat. The oars-man vowed he would put back with all speed, but his godly 
passengers bade him be of good cheer, and while they sang an ave maria the 
ominous galley was submerged by the hungry waves.  So the fisherman rowed 
forward and reached his haven, the three saints rewarded him with a present 
of a gold ring, and that is why that article figures in the old coat-of-arms 
of the Venetian Republic.
     Go where we will, to countries fringed or intersected by the sea, we 
find stories like this, or something like it. In Japan there ate tales of 
phantom junks, and the Chinaman still paints a pair of great eyes on the 
prow of his craft, thinking that these will detect any monsters which chance 
to be prowling afloat; while even on the coasts of America, usually 
considered so very prosaic a land, traditions anent spectral vessels prevail 
to this day. Kindred stories are known in the Ionian Islands, and the folk-
lore of Shetland embodies a wealth of matter of this sort; while round about 
the serried coast of Denmark, and the windswept fiords of Norway, many a 
phantom barque is supposed to hover; and indeed it was on the North Sea that 
the most famous of all supernatural ships was wont to sail, the ship known 
to us as "The Flying Dutchman," and to the Germans as ‘ Der Fliegende 
Hollander." A sailor, so goes the romance, had loved a maiden not wisely but 
too well, and having wronged her he grew weary of the liaison, left his 
sweetheart to languish, and put forth on the high seas where he committed 
many flagrant acts of piracy. But he was not to go unrequited, and the fates 
condemned him to sail wearily and everlastingly from shore to shore, this 
punishment to be endured till be should contrive to win the staunch 
affection of a virtuous woman and prove faithful to her. So the wayfarer’s 
barque was driven hither and thither, the guilty man longed to tread solid 
ground once more; but whenever he dared to put in to port, and commenced 
paying addresses to one whom he thought might be able to save him, the devil 
soon placed him on board ship again, and his interminable voyage com-menced 
afresh. Century after century went past in this fashion, the ill-starred 
barque gradually becoming familiar to all who sailed upon the grey North 
Sea, or dwelt by its shores; and the legend was not destined to dwindle away 
before the onslaughts of incoming civilisation, for betimes a great artist 
arose to give a new and more genuine immor-tality to the story.  Yes! 
Richard Wagner evolved from it a mighty drama; and sometimes, as we listen 
to his music-charged so abundantly with the weirdness, mystery and glamour 
of the surging ocean-we can verily picture the Dutchman’s craft driving 
before a fearsome gale, and see the criminal sitting terror-struck and 
hopeless at his useless helm.


Seal of Solomon : (See Magic.)


Seance: A sitting held for the purpose of communicating with the dead, an 
essential requirement being that at least one member of the company be 
possessed of mediumistic powers.  (See’ Medium.)  Antiquity furnishes many 
exam-ples of what may be called " seances - Saul’s con-sultation with the 
Witch of Endor-but the term is generally used only in connection with modern 
spiritualism.  When, in 1848, the Fox family at Hydesville called in their 
neigh-bours to listen to the mysterious sounds which have since become 
famous as the " Rochester Rappings," the gathering was too informal to be 
called a seance, though all the necessary elements were present; but within 
the next two or three years the contagion spread throughout a large part of 
the eastern states, many " circles" (q.v.) were formed, and the phenomena 
which was in the first instance appar-ently spontaneous was now deliberately 
induced. In the early stages of the movement these seance’s were conducted 
by private mediums, who took no fee for their performances, but later 
professional mediums arose whose seance’s were open to the public on the 
payment of a fee. Both public and private seance’s continued, and still 
continue, to be an indispensable feature of spiritualism.
     Besides the presence of a medium there ate other con-ditions which must 
be observed if the seance’ is to be pro-ductive of phenomena. The chief of 
these is, perhaps, the darkness or semi-darkness of the seance-room, though 
this is by no means an invariable condition. The reason given by 
spiritualists is that light interferes with the manifesta-tions of the 
spirits, though a less charitable construction is sometimes put upon the 
insistent demand for darkness. Sometimes the actual seance’ is preceded by 
playing or singing, a proceeding which one of Home’s sitters states "always 
gave us a good seance." That this playing and singing was not without its 
purpose we may readily infer, for a state of expectancy and increased 
receptivity might easily be induced thereby, and it may be recalled, en 
passant, that D’Eslon and other disciples of Mesmer enjoined their patients 
to sing, or had some instrument played while the patients were seated around 
the baquet, or magnetic tub. To return to the seance ; the sitters take 
their places around a table and join hands, thus forming a "chain." The 
Baron de Guldenstubbe, in giving directions for the forming of a circle and 
the conducting of a seance’, says: " In order to form a chain, the twelve 
persons each place their right hand on the table and their left hand on that 
of their neighbour, thus making a circle round the table. Observe that the 
medium or mediums, if there be more than one, are entirely isolated from 
those who form the chain." Dr. Lapponi, in his Hypnotism and Spiritism, 
says:  " He (the medium) then invites some of his assistants to place their 
hands on the table in the following manner.  The two thumbs of each person 
are to be touching each other, and each little finger is to be in 
communication with the little fingers of the persons on either side.  He 
himself completes the chain with his two hands.  The hands of all together 
rest on the edge of the table."  Some-times, again, as in the seances for 
table-turning and talking, the chain is formed simply by all the operators 
placing their finger-tips on the table.  When the spirits have announced 
their presence by raps, tilting of the table, and so on, the chain may or 
may not be broken, but so long as it remains unbroken the sitters are 
entirely at the mercy of the spirits.
     The phenomena which are thereafter witnessed are so diverse and varied 
that scarcely any account of a seance’ precisely matches another in detail, 
yet undoubtedly they all belong to certain well-defined classes. In the 
sphere of “physical" phenomena we have the movements of furni-ture, 
beginning with the table round which the members of the circle are seated, 
and affecting, perhaps, all the furniture in the room.  These antics of 
inanimate objects in the seance-room are often practically identical with 
the spontaneous outbreaks of the poltergeist.  Then there are the 
levitations (q.v.) both of the human body and of furniture and inanimate 
things.  We are told of heavy wardrobes being raised to the ceiling without 
visible agency, and of several mediums floating upwards in like manner, 
Elongation (q.v.) is another phenomenon of the séance--room, an increase or 
apparent increase, of from a few inches to a foot taking place in the 
medium’s height. Locked doors and cupboards are opened without keys, and 
with-out any trace of violence.  Apports (q.v.) of small objects-flowers, 
fruit, jewels, anything, in fact-are brought from a distance through closed 
doors and barred windows, or abstracted in mysterious fashion from sealed  
boxes. Inanimate things show in their actions an almost human intelligence. 
Heavy objects become light enough to be raised by the touch of a finger, 
light articles become so weighty that the combined force of all present will 
not suffice to lift them. The medium can hold live coals in his hand, or in 
his handkerchief, without either being burned. Instruments are played upon 
when no visible hand is near them, or music is produced from the empty air 
without any instruments at all.  Luminous hands and faces float in the air, 
sometimes recognised by the sitters as belonging to deceased friends and 
relatives, and touchings and caresses are felt. A breeze suddenly springs up 
in the seance-room though the doors and windows are still closed-and 
curtains and the clothes of the sitters are inflated. If the stance’ is an 
especially successful one, complete spirit forms may be materialised.  If 
the latter manifestation is to be asked for, a small cabinet is usually 
provided, into which the medium retires.  Soon afterwards the filmy spirit 
form or forms are seen to issue from the cabinet, and in them the Sitters 
frequently behold lost friends or relatives. The spirit forms will move 
about the room, allow themselves to be touched, and will, on occasion, even 
converse with their friends in the flesh, and give away locks of their hair 
and fragments of their clothing. Again, the materialisation may take place 
in the open, a small luminous cloud being first perceived, which gradually 
developes into a complete human figure; or, as has been known to happen, the 
spirit may seem to issue from the medium’s side, and remain united to him by 
a gossamer filament. In most cases the head and chin are shrouded in white 
draperies, only a portion of the face being visible.  (See Materialisation.)
     The automatic or "psychical" phenomena are of a different nature.  
Certain manifestations, such as table--tiltings (q.v.), rapping (q.v.), and 
slate-writing (q.v.), where the communication does not apparently come 
through the medium’s organism, partake of the character of both
physical" and" psychical" phenomena. Purely" psy-chical" manifestations are 
the automatic writing and speaking of the medium.  Sometimes the latter 
falls spontaneously into a trance, and delivers spirit messages while in 
that state, or the medium may remain to all appear-ances in a normal 
condition.  Not only writings and utter-ances, but drawings and musical 
compositions may be pro-duced automatically, and though automatism of this 
sort is by no means confined to the seance-room it still plays a large part 
therein, and is especially in favour with the more serious-minded 
spiritualists, to whom communications from the spirit-world are of greater 
importance than the tricks of household furniture.
     A representative account of one of the stances of D. D. Home (q.v.), is 
given by H. D. Jencken in Human Nature, February, 1867, as follows:-
     “Mr. Home had passed into the trance still so often witnessed, rising 
from his seat, he laid hold of an armchair, which he held at arms’ length, 
and was then lifted about three feet clear of the ground ; travelling thus 
suspended in space, he placed the chair next Lord Adare, and made a circuit 
round those in the room, being lowered and raised as he passed each of us. 
One of those present measured the elevation, and passed his leg and arm 
under Mr. Home’s feet. The elevation lasted from four to five minutes. On 
resuming his seat, Mr. Home addressed Captain Wynne, communicating news to 
him of which the departed alone could have been cognisant.
     “The spirit form that had been seen reclining on the sofa, now stepped 
up to Mr. Home and mesmerised him; a hand was then seen luminously visible 
over his head, about 18 inches in a vertical line from his head. The trance 
state of Mr. Home now assumed a different character; gently rising he spoke 
a few words to those present, and then opening the door proceeded into the 
corridor; a voice then said :-’ He will go out of this window and come in at 
that window.’ The only one who heard the voice was the Master of Lindsay, 
and a cold shudder seized upon him as he contemplated the possibility of 
this occur-ring, a feat which the great height of the third floor windows in 
Ashley Place rendered more than ordinarily perilous. The others present, 
however, having closely questioned him as to what he had heard, he at first 
replied, ‘ I dare not tell you,’ when, to the amazement of all, a voice 
said, ‘You must tell ; tell directly.’ The Master then said, ‘ Yes; yes, 
terrible to say, he will go out at that window and come in at this; do not 
be frightened, be quiet.’ Mr. Home now re-entered the room, and opening the 
drawing-room window, was pushed out 
demi-horizontally into space, and carried from one window of the drawing-
room to the farthermost window of the adjoining room. This feat being 
performed at a height of about sixty feet from the ground, naturally caused 
a shudder in all present. The body of Mr. Home, when it appeared at the 
window of the adjoining room, was shunted into the room feet foremost-the 
window being only 18 inches open. As soon as he had recovered his footing he 
laughed and said, ‘ I wonder what a policeman would have said had he seen me 
go round and round like a teetotum!’ The scene was, however, too terrible-
too strange, to elicit a smile: cold beads of per-spiration stood on every 
brow, while a feeling pervaded all as if some great danger had passed; the 
nerves of those present had been kept in a state of tension that refused to 
respond to a joke. A change now passed over Mr. Home, one often observable 
during the trance states, indicative, no doubt, of some other power 
operating on his system. Lord Adare had in the meantime stepped up to the 
open window in the adjoining room to close it-the cold air, as it came 
pouring in, chilling the room; when, to his surprise, he only found the 
window 8 to 24 inches open! This puzzled him, for how could Mr. Home have 
passed outside through a window only 18 to 24 inches open. Mr. Home, however 
soon set his doubts at rest; stepping up to Lord Adare he said, ‘ No, no; I 
did not close the window; I passed thus into the air outside.’ An invisible 
power then supported Mr. Home all but horizontally in space, and thrust his 
body into space through the open window, head-foremost, bring-ing him back 
again feet foremost into the room, shunted not unlike a shutter into a 
basement below. The circle round the table having re-formed, a cold current 
of air passed over those present, like the rushing of winds. This repeated 
itself several times.  The cold blast of air, or electric fluid, or call it 
what you may, was accompanied by a loud whistle like a gust of wind on the 
mountain top, or through the leaves of the forest in late autumn; the sound 
was deep, sonorous, and powerful in the extreme, and a shudder kept passing 
over those present, who all heard and felt it. This rushing sound lasted 
quite ten minutes, in broken intervals of one or two minutes, All present 
were much surprised and the interest became intensified by the unknown 
tongues in which Mr. Home now conversed.  Passing from one  language  to  
another in rapid  succes-sion, he spoke for ten minutes in unknown 
languages. 
     “A spirit form now became distinctly visible; it stood next to the 
Master of Lindsay, clad, as seen on former occasions, in a long robe with a 
girdle, the feet scarcely touching the ground, the outline of the face only 
clear, and the tones of the voice, though sufficiently distinct to be 
understood, whispered rather than spoken. Other voices were now heard, and 
large globes of phosphorescent lights passed slowly through the room."
     The following extract is taken from an account of a stance held by 
Professor Lombroso with the famous Italian medium, Eusapia Paladino.
     "After a rather long wait the table began to move, slowly at first,-a 
matter explained by the scepticism, not to say the positively hostile 
spirit, of those who were this night in a stance circle for the first time. 
Then little by little, the movements increased in intensity. M. Lombroso 
proved the levitation of the table, and estimated at twelve or fifteen 
pounds the resistance to the pressure which he had to make with his hands in 
order to overcome that levitation.
     "This phenomenon of a heavy body sustained in the air, off its centre 
of gravity and resisting a pressure of twelve or fifteen pounds, very much 
surprised and aston-ished the learned gentleman, who attributed it to the 
action of an unknown magnetic force.
     "At my request, taps and scratchings were heard in the table. This was 
a new cause for astonishment, and led the gentlemen to themselves call for 
the putting out of the candles in order to ascertain whether the intensity 
of the noises would be increased, as had been stated, All re-mained seated 
and in contact.
     “In a dim light which did not hinder the most careful surveillance, 
violent blows were first heard at the middle point of the table. Then a bell 
placed upon a round table, at a distance of a yard to the left of the medium 
(in such a way that she was placed behind and to the right of M. Lombroso), 
rose into the air, and went tinkling over the heads of the company, 
describing a circle around our table where it finally came to rest."
     At this seance members of the company also felt themselves pinched and 
their clothes plucked, and experienced the touchings of invisible hands on 
their faces and fingers. The accuracy of the account-written by M. Ciolfi-
was testified to by Professor Lombroso himself      M. J.

Second Sight: The faculty of foreseeing future events which is supposed to 
belong to certain individuals in the Scottish Highlands. The belief in 
second sight dates back to a very early period in the history of these 
regions, and is still very far from being extinct, even in the more 
accessible parts. Saving the name, there is but little in second sight that 
is peculiar to the Celts of Scotland, for it is allied to the clairvoyance, 
prophetic vision, soothsaying, and so on, which have existed from time 
immemorial in practically every part of the world. Yet the second sight has 
certain distinctive features of its own. It may, for instance, be either 
congenital or acquired. In the former case it generally falls to the seventh 
son of a seventh son, by reason, probably, of the potency of the mystic 
number seven.  Sometimes  a Highlander may find himself suddenly endowed 
with the mysterious faculty. A person gifted with second sight is said to 
be" fey." Generally there is no apparent departure from the normal 
consciousness during the vision, though sometimes a seer may complain of a 
feeling of disquiet or uneasiness. A vision may be communicated from one 
person to another, usually by contact, but the secondary vision is dimmer 
than that of the original seer. A frequent vision is that of a funeral, 
indicating that a death will shortly take place in the community. This is an 
instance of the second sight taking a symbolical turn, and perhaps this is 
its usual form. Occasionally the apparition of the doomed man will be seen-
his wraith, or double-while he himself is far distant. Another form 
frequently taken by the second sight is that of "seeing lights." The lights, 
too, may indicate death, but they may likewise predict lesser happenings, or 
have no significance at all. Thus a light is seen by two persons to hover 
above the "Big House," then to travel swiftly in the direction of the 
gamekeeper’s cottage, where it remains stationary for a while.  On the 
morrow the gamekeeper is dead.  Again a farmer returning from the market is 
pre-ceded the whole of the way by a ball of fire, rolling along the road 
ahead of him.  This time, however, the light portends no alarming 
occurrence, and the excitement of the glen quickly subsides.  The lower 
animals also are said to possess second sight, which is especially frequent 
among dogs and horses.  Two men were travelling from Easdale to Oban on a 
stormy night.  In traversing a short cut through a wood one of them died 
from fatigue and exposure. That night more than one horse had to be 
carefully led past the spot by his driver, who as yet knew nothing of the 
tragedy.  Indeed most Highlanders believe that the faculty is common to all 
the lower animals, else why should they whine and bristle when there is 
nothing visible to human eyes, nothing audible to human ears?  
Notwithstanding that the march of civilisation has caused the Highlander 
partly to conceal his occult beliefs, at least from the unbe-lieving 
Sassenach, the writer can vouch for the fact that in certain districts 
second sight is almost a commonplace, believed in even by those who avow 
that they are not in the least " superstitious."                       M. J.

Secret of Secrets : (See Kabala.)


Secret Tradition : It has long been an article of faith with students of 
occultism that the secret tenets of the various sciences embraced within it 
have been preserved to modern times by a series of adepts, who have handed 
them down from generation to generation in their entirety.  There is no 
reason to doubt this belief, but that the adepts in question existed in one 
unbroken line, and that they all professed similar principles is somewhat 
improbable.  But one thing is fairly certain, and that is, that proficiency 
in any one of the occult sciences requires tuition from a master of that 
branch.  All serious writers on the subject are at one as regards this.  It 
is likely that in neolithic times societies existed among our barbarian 
ancestors, similar in character to the Midiwiwin of the North-American 
Indians, the snake-dancers of the Hopi of New Mexico, or the numerous secret 
societies of aboriginal Australians. This is inferred from the certainty 
that totemism existed amongst neolithic peoples.  Hierophantic castes would 
naturally hand down the tradition of the secret things of the Society from 
one generation to another.  The early mysteries of Egypt, Eleusis, 
Samothrace, Cabin, and so forth were merely the elaboration of such savage 
mysteries. There would appear to have been throughout the ages, what might 
be called, a fusion of occult beliefs : that when the hierophants of one 
system found themselves in juxtaposition, or even in conflict, with the 
professors of another, the systems in question appear to have received much 
from one another.  It has been said that when the ancient mysteries are 
spoken about, it should be understood that one and the same series of sacred 
ceremonies is intended, one and the same initiatory processes and 
revelations, and that what is true of one applies with equal certainty to 
all the others. Thus Strabo records that the strange orgies in honour of the 
mystic birth of Jupiter resembled those of Bacchus, Ceres and Cybele; and 
the Orphic poems identi-fied the orgies of Bacchus with those of Ceres, 
Rhea, Venus and Isis.  Euripides also mentions that the rites of Cybele are 
celebrated in Asia Minor in an identical manner with the Grecians mysteries 
of Dionysius and the Cretan rites of the Cabiri.  The Rev. Geo. Oliver in 
his History of Initiation affirms that the rites of the science which is now 
received under the appellation of Freemasonry were exercised in the 
antediluvian world, received by Noah after the Flood, practised by man at 
the building of Babel. conveniences for which were undoubtedly contained in 
that edifice, and at the dispersion spread with every settlement already 
deteriorated by the gradual innova-tions of the Cabiric priests, and moulded 
into a form, the great outlines of which are distinctly to be traced in the 
mysteries of every heathen nation, and exhibit shattered remains of the one 
true system, whence they were derived. This theory is of course totally 
mischievous, and although there may have been likeneses between the rites of 
certain societies, the idea that all sprang from one common source is 
absurd.  One thing, however, is fairly certain: anthrop-ology permits us to 
believe that the concepts of man, religious and mystical, are practically 
identical in whatever part of the world he may exist, and there is every 
possibility that the similarity between early mysteries results in this man-
ner, and that it brought about a strong resemblance between the mystical 
systems of the older world.  We have satis-factory evidence that the ancient 
mysteries were recepta-cles of a great deal of occult wisdom, symbolism, 
magical or semi-magical rite, and mystical practice in general; and we are 
pretty well assured that when these fell into desue-tude among the more 
intellectual classes of the various countries in which they obtained, they 
were taken up and practised in secret by the lesser ranks of society, even 
the lowest ranks, who are in all ages the most conservative, and who clung 
faithfully to the ancient systems, refusing to partake in the rites of the 
religions which had ousted them. The same can be posited of magical 
practice. The princi-ples of magic are universal, and there can be no reason 
to doubt that these were handed on throughout the long cen-turies by 
hereditary castes of priests, shamans, medicine-men, magicians, sorcerers, 
and witches.  But the same evidence does not exist with regard to the higher 
magic, concerning which much more difficult questions arise. Was this handed 
on by means of secret societies, occult schools or universities, or from 
adept to adept?’ We speak not of the sorceries of empirics and savages, but 
of that spiritual magic which, taken in its best sense, shades into 
mysticism. The schools of Salamanca, the mystic colleges of Alexandria, 
could not impart the great truths of this science to their disciples : its 
nature is such that com-munication by lecture would be worse than useless.  
It is necessary to suppose then that it was imparted by one adept to 
another.  But it is not likely that it arose at a very early period in the 
history of man.  In his early psychological state he would not require it; 
and we see no reason for belief that its professors came into existence at 
an earlier period than some three or four thousand years B.C. The 
undisturbed nature of Egyptian and Babylonian civilisation leads to the 
belief that these countries brought forth a long series of adepts in the 
higher magic. We know that Alexandria fell heir to the works of these men, 
but it is unlikely that their teachings were publicly disseminated in her 
public schools.  Individuals of high magical stand-ing would however be in 
possession of the occult knowledge of ancient Egypt, and that they imparted 
this to the Greeks of Alexandria is certain,  Later Hellenic and Byzantine 
magical theory is distinctly Egyptian in character, and we know that its 
esoteric forms were disseminated in Europe at a comparatively early date, 
and that they placed all other native systems in the background, where they 
were pursued in the shadow by the aboriginal witch and sorcerer.  We have 
thus outlined the genealogy of the higher magic from early Egyptian times to 
the European medieval period. Regarding alchemy, the evidence from analogy 
is much more sure, and the same may be said as regards astrology. These are 
sciences in which it is peculiarly necessary to obtain the assistance of an 
adept if any excellence is to be gained in their practice ; and we know that 
the first originated in Egypt, and the second in ancient Babylon. We are not 
aware of the names of those early adepts who carried the sciences forward 
until the days of Alexandria, but subsequent to that period the identity of 
practically every alchemical and astrological practitioner of any note is 
fully known.  In the history of no science is the sequence of its professors 
so clear as is the case in alchemy, and the same might almost be said as 
regards astrology, whose protagonists, if they have not been so famous, have 
at least been equally conscientious.  We must pass over in our consideration 
of the manner in which occult science survived, the absurd legends which 
presume to state how such societies as the Freemasons existed from 
antediluvian times; and will content ourselves with stating that the 
probabilities are that in the case of mystical brotherhoods a long line of 
these existed from early times, the traditions of which were practically 
similar.  Many persons would be members of several of these, and would 
import the con-ceptions of one society into the heart of another, as we know 
Rosicrucian ideas were imported into Masonry. (See Freemasonry.)  We seem to 
see in the mystic societies of the middle ages reflections of the older 
Egyptian and classical mysteries, and there is nothing absurd in the theory 
that the spirit and in some instances even the letter of these descended to 
medieval and perhaps to present times.  Such organisations die much harder 
than any credit is given them for doing.  We know, for example, that 
Freemasonry was revolutionised at one part of its career, about the middle 
of the seventeenth century, by an influx of alchemists and astrologers, who 
crowded out the operative members, and who strengthened the mystical 
position of the brotherhood, and it is surely reasonable to suppose that on 
the fall or desuetude of the ancient myster-ies, their disciples, looking 
eagerly for some method of saving their cults from entire extinction, would 
join the ranks of some similar society, or would keep alive the flame in 
secret ; but the fact remains that the occult idea was undoubtedly preserved 
through the ages, that it was the same in essence amongst the believers in 
all religions and all mysteries, and that to a great extent its trend was in 
the one direction, so that the fusion of the older mystical societies and 
their re-birth as a new brotherhood is by no means an unlikely hypothesis.  
In the article on the “Templars" for example, we have tried to show the 
possibility of that brotherhood having received its tenets from the East, 
where it sojourned for such a protracted period.  It seems very likely from 
what we learn of its rites that they were oriental in origin, and we know 
that the occult systems of Europe owed much to the Templars, who, probably, 
after the fall of their own Order secretly formed others or joined existing 
societies.  Masons have a hypothesis that through older origins they 
inherited from the Dionysian artificers, the artizans of Byzantium, and the 
building brotherhoods of Western Europe.  To state this dogmatically as a 
fact would not be to gain so much cre-dence for their theory as is due to 
that concerning the dissemination of occult lore by the Templars ; but it is 
much more feasible in every way than the absurd legend concerning the rise 
of Freemasonry at the time of the building of the Temple.  Secret societies 
of any description possess a strong attraction for a certain class of mind, 
or else a merely operative handicraft society, such as was medieval Masonry, 
would not have been utilised so largely by the mystics of that time.  One of 
the chief reasons that we know so little concerning these brotherhoods in 
medie-val times is that the charge of dabbling in the occult arts was a 
serious one in the eyes of the law and the church, therefore they found it 
necessary to carry on their prac-tices in secret.  But after the 
Reformation, a modern spirit took possession of Europe, and the protagonists 
of the occult sciences came forth from their caverns and practised in the 
open light of day.  In England, for example, numer-ous persons avowed 
themselves alchemists; in Germany the Rosicrucians  sent out a manifesto; in 
Scotland, Seton, a great master of the hermetic art, arose  never had 
occultism possessed such a heyday.  But it was nearly a century later until 
further secret societies were formed, such as the Academy of the Ancients 
and of the Mysteries in 1767; the Knights of the True Light founded in 
Austria about 1780; the Knights and Brethren of Asia, which appeared in 
Germany in the same year; the Order of Jerusalem which originated in America 
in  1791 ;  the Society of the Universal Aurora established at Paris in 
1783.  Besides being masonic, these societies practised animal magnetism, 
astrology, Kabalism and even cere-monial magic. Others were political, such 
as the Illuminati, which came to such an inglorious end.  But the individual 
tradition was kept up by an illustrious line of adepts, who were much more 
instrumental in keeping alive the flame of mysticism than even such 
societies as those we have mentioned.  Mesmer,  Swedenborg,  St. Martin,  
Pas-qually, Willermoz, all laboured to that end.  We may regard all these as 
belonging to the school of Christian magicians, as apart from those who 
practised the rites of the grimoires or Jewish Kabalism.  The line may be 
carried back through Lavater, Eckartshausen, and so on to the seventeenth 
century. These men were mystics besides being practitioners of theurgic 
magic, and they combined in themselves the knowledge of practically all the 
occult sciences.
     With Mesmer began the revival of a science which cannot be altogether 
regarded as occult, when consideration is given to its modern developments, 
but which powerfully influenced the mystic life of his and many later days. 
The mesmerists of the first era are in direct line with the Martinists and 
the mystical magicians of the France of the late eighteenth century.  Indeed 
in the persons of some English mystics, such as Greatrakes, mysticism and 
magnetism are one and the same thing.  But upon  Hyp-notism, to give it its 
modern name, becoming numbered with the more practical sciences, persons of 
‘a mystical cast of mind appear to have, to a great extent, deserted it. 
Hypnotism does not bear the same relation to mesmerism and magnetism as 
modern chemistry does to alchemy; but the persons who practise it nowadays 
are as dissimilar to the older professors of the science as is the modern 
practitioner of chemistry to the medieval alchemist. This is symptomatic of 
the occult sciences, that they despise that knowledge which is  exact" in 
the common sense of the term. Their practitioners do not delight in labour-
ing upon a science, the laws of which are already known, cut and dried.  The 
student of occultism, as a rule, possesses all the attributes of an 
explorer.  The occult sciences have from time to time deeply enriched the 
exact sciences, but these enrichments have been acts of intellectual 
generosity. It is in effect as if the occultist made a present of them to 
the scientist, but did not desire to be troubled with their future 
development in any way.  Occultism of the higher sort therefore does not to-
day possess any great interest in hypnotism, and modern mystics of standing 
scarcely recognise it as a part of the hidden mysteries.  But there is no 
question that the early mesmerists formed a link between the adepts of 
eighteenth-century France and those of the present day.  The occultists of 
to-day, however, are harking farther back: they recognise that their fore-
runners of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries drew their inspiration 
from older origins, and they feel that these may have had cognisance of 
records and traditions that we wot not of,  The recovery of these is perhaps 
for the moment the great question of modern magic.  But apart from this, 
modern magic of the highest type strains towards mysticism, and partakes 
more than ever of its character. It disdains and ignores ceremonial, and 
exalts psychic experience. That is not to say that numerous bodies do not 
exist throughout the world for the celebration of magical rite ; but such 
fraternities have existed from time immemorial, and their protagonists 
cannot be placed on a higher footing than the hallucinated sorcerers of 
medieval times.


Secret Words  Certain words relating to the Eucharist were communicated by 
Christ to Joseph of Arimathea and were committed orally from keeper to 
keeper of the Graal.  In Robert de Borron’s metrical romance, material power 
is added to their Spiritual efficacy and whoever could acquire and retain 
them, had a mysterious power over all around him, could not suffer by evil 
judgments, could not suffer deprivation of his own rights, need not fear the 
result of battle, provided his cause were good.  The words were the secret 
of the Graal and were either incommunicable in writing or were written only 
in the Book of the Graal which, de Borron implies, was itself written by 
Joseph of Arima-thea.  These words are the chief mystery of the Lesser Holy 
Graal, as the prose version of de Borron’s poem is called. They were most 
probably a form of eucharistic consecra-tion, and there is evidence that the 
Celtic church, following the example of the Eastern Church used them in 
addition to the usual consecration as practised in the Latin Church, which 
is merely a repetition of the New Testament account of the Lord’s Supper. 
The separate clause they are sup-posed to have formed is called Epiclesis 
and consisted of an invocation of the Holy Ghost.

Semites, The : This article on the Semite’s applies to the more ancient 
divisions of the race, such as the Babylonians and Assyrians, and the 
Hebrews in Biblical times.  For later Semitic occultism see Kabala, Arabs, 
etc.  In ancient Babylon, and Chaldea, magic was of course a department of 
priestly activity, and in Mesopotamia we find a sect of priests, the Asipu, 
set apart for the practice of magic, which in their case probably consisted 
of hypnotism, the casting out 6f demons, the banning of troublesome spirits 
and so forth.  The Baru again were augurs who consulted the oracles on the 
future by the inspection of the entrails of animals and the flight of birds, 
"the observation of oil in water, the secret of Anu, Bel, and Ea, the tablet 
of the gods, the sachet of leather of the oracles of the heavens and earth, 
the wand of cedar dear to the great gods." These priests of Baru and Asipu 
were clothed in vestments pecu-liar to their. rank, which they changed 
frequently during the ceremonies in which they took part.  In the tablets we 
find kings making frequent enquiry through these priestly castes; and in a 
tablet of Sippar, we find treated the installation of a Baru to the Sun-
temple, and also Sennach-rib seeking through the Baro the causes of his 
father’s violent death.  The Asipu again were exorcists, who removed tabus 
and laid ghosts.  We find an Asipu’s func-tions set forth in the following 
poem :-

" Incantation
(The man) of Ea am I,
(The man) of Damkina am I,
The messenger of Marduk am I,
My spell is the spell of Ea,
My incantation is the incantation of Marduk,
The circle of Ea is in my hand,
The tamarisk, the powerful weapon of Anu,
In my hand I hold,
The date-spathe. mighty in decision,
In my hand I hold."

“Incantation

He that stilleth all to rest, that pacifieth all,
By whose incantation everything is at peace,
He is the great Lord Ea,
Stilling all to rest, and pacifying all,
By whose incantation everything is at peace.
When I draw nigh unto the sick man
All shall be assuaged.
I am the magician born of Eridu,
Begotten in Eridu and Subari.
When I draw nigh unto the sick man
May Ea, King of the Deep, safeguard me I"

“Incantation

O Ea, King of the Deep, to see    
I, the magician, am thy slave.
March thou on my right hand,
Assist (me) on my left
Add thy pure spell to mine,
Add thy pure voice to mine,
Vouchsafe (to me) pure words,
Make fortunate the utterances of my mouth,
Ordain that my decisions be happy,
Let me be blessed where’er I tread,
Let the man whom I (now) touch be blessed.
Before me may lucky thoughts be spoken.
After me may a lucky finger be pointed.
Oh that thou wert my guardian genius,
And my guardian spirit I
O God that blesseth, Marduk,
Let me be blessed, where’er my path may be I
Thy power shall god and man proclaim;
This man shall do thy service,
And I too, the magician thy slave."

“Unto the house on entering.
Samas is before me,
Sin (is) behind (me),
Nergal (is) at (my) right hand,
Ninib (is) at my left hand;
When I draw near unto the sick man,
When I lay my hand on the head of the sick man,
May a kindly Spirit, a kindly Guardian, stand at my side."

     The third caste was the Zammaru, who sang or chanted certain 
ceremonials.
     The lower ranks of sorcery were represented by the Kassapu and 
Kassaptu, the wizard and witch, who, as else-where, practised black magic, 
and who are stoutly com-bated by the priest-magician caste.  We find in the 
code of Hammurabi a stringent law against the professors of black magic :-" 
If a man has charged a man with sorcery and has not justified himself, he 
who is charged with sorcery shall go to the river, he shall plunge into the 
river, and if the river overcome him, he who accused him shall take to 
himself his house. If the river makes that man to be inno-cent, and he be 
saved, he who accused him shall be put to death. He who plunged into the 
river shall take to him-self the house of him who accused him." This will 
recall the test for a witch, that if thrown into a pond, if she sinks she is 
innocent, but. if she floats she is a witch indeed. Another series of 
tablets deals with the black magician and the witch who are represented as 
roaming the streets, entering houses, and prowling through towns, stealing 
the love of men, and withering the beauty of women. The exorcist goes on to 
say that he has made an image of the witch, and he calls upon the fire-god 
to burn it,  He seizes the mouth, tongue, eyes, feet, and other members of 
the witch, and piously prays that Sin may cast her into an abyss of water 
and fire, and that her face may grow yellow and green.  He fears that the 
witch is directing a like sorcery against himself, that she sits making 
spells against him in the shade of the wall, fashioning images of him.  But 
he sends against her the haltappan plant and sesame to undo her spells and 
force back the words into her mouth.  He devoutly trusts that the images she 
has fashioned will assume her own character, and that her spells may recoil 
upon herself.  Another tablet expresses the desire that the god of night may 
smite the witch in her magic, that the three watches of the night may loose 
her evil sorcery, that her mouth may be fat and her tongue salt, that the 
words of evil that she hath spoken may be poured out like tallow, and that 
the magic she is working be crumbled like salt. The tablets abound in 
magical matter and in them we have the actual wizardry in vogue at the time 
they were written, which runs at least from the seventh century B.C. onwards 
until the time when the cuneiform ceased to be used. Chaldean magic was re-
nowned throughout the world, particularly, however, its astrological side. 
Isaiah says "Let now the astrologers, stargazers, monthly prognosticators, 
stand up and save thee from the things that shall come upon thee." In the 
book of Daniel, we find the magicians called Chaldeans, and up to the 
present time occultists have never tired of sing-ing the praises of the 
Chaldean magi. Strabo and AElian allude to their knowledge of astrology, as 
did Diodorus Siculus, and it is supposed to have been a Chaldean magician 
OEthanes who introduced his science into Greece, which he entered with 
Xerxes.
     The great library of Assurbanipal, king of Assyria, who died in 626 
B.C., affords us first-hand knowledge of Assyrian magic.  He gathered 
together numerous volumes from the cities of Babylonia, and storing them in 
his great library at Nineveh, had them copied and translated. In fact 
letters have been discovered from Assurbanipal to some of his officials, 
giving instructions for the copying of certain incantations. Many grimoires 
too come from Babylonia, written during the later empire,-the best known of 
which are the series entitled Maklu, burning; Utukki limnuti, evil spirits; 
Labartu, hag-demon; and Nis kati, raising of the hand. There are also 
available many ceremonial texts which throw considerable light on magical 
practice. The Maklu for example contains eight tablets of incantations .and 
spells against wizards and witches-the general idea running through it being 
to instruct the bewitched person how to manufacture figures of his enemies, 
and thus destroy them.  The series dealing with the exorcism of evil spirits 
enumerates demons, goblins and ghosts, and consists of at least sixteen 
tablets. They are for the use of the exorcist in driving out devils from 
possessed people, and this is to be accomplished by invoking the aid of the 
gods, so that the demons may be laid under a divine tabu.  The demon who 
possesses the unfortunate victim must be described in the most minute 
manner. The series dealing with the Labartu or hag-demon, who is a kind of 
female devil who delights in attacking children, gives directions for making 
a figure of the Labartu and the incantations to be repeated over it. The 
magician and philosopher appear to have worked together in Assyria, for we 
find medical men constantly using incantations to drive out demons, and 
incantations are often associated with prescriptions.  Medical magic indeed 
appears to have been of much the same sort as we find amongst the American 
Indians and peoples in a like barbarian condition of existence.
     We find the doctrine of the Incommunicable Name established among the 
early Semites, as among the Egypt-ians: the secret name of a god, which when 
discovered gave the speaker complete power over him by its mere utterance. 
The knowledge of the name, or description, of the person or demon the 
magician directs his charm against, is also essential to success.  Drugs 
also, to which were originally ascribed the power vouchsafed by the gods for 
the welfare of mankind, were supposed to aid greatly in exorcism.  In 
Assyrian sorcery, Ea and Marduk are the most powerful gods,-the latter being 
appealed to as intermediary between man and his father, Ea: indeed the 
legend of Marduk going to his father for advice was com-monly repeated in 
incantations. When working against an individual too, it was necessary to 
have something belong-ing to him,-clippings of his hair, or nails if 
possible. The possessed person was usually washed, the principal of 
cleansing probably underlying this ceremony. An incan-tation called the 
Incantation of Eridu was often prescribed. and this must relate to some such 
cleansing, for Eridu is the Home of Ea, the Sea-god. A formula for 
exorcising or washing away a demon, Rabesu states that the patient is to be 
sprinkled with clean water twice seven times. Of all water none was so 
sacred as the Euphrates, and water from it was frequently used for charms 
and exorcisms. Fumigation with a censor was also employed by the As-syrians 
for exorcism, but the possessed person was often guarded from the attack of 
fiends by placing him in the middle of an enchanted circle of flour, through 
which it was thought no spirit could break. Wearing the glands from the 
mouth of a fish was also a charm against possession. In making a magic 
circle, the sorcerer usually formed seven little winged figures to set 
before the god Nergal, with a long spell, which states that he has completed 
the usurtu or magic circle with a sprinkling of lime. The wizard further 
prays that the incantation may be performed for his patient by the god. This 
would seem to be a prototype of the circle in use amongst magicians of 
medieval times. Says Campbell Thompson in his Semitic Magic
    “ Armed with all these things-the word of power, the acquisition of some 
part of the enemy, the use of the magic circle and holy water, and the 
knowledge of the magical properties of substances-the ancient warlock was 
well fitted for his trade. He was then capable of defying hostile demons or 
summoning friendly spirits, of driving out disease or casting spells, of 
making amulets to guard the credulous who came to him.  Furthermore, he had 
a certain stock-in-trade of tricks which were a steady source of revenus.  
Lovesick youths and maidens always hoped for some result from his philtres 
or love-charms ; at the demand of jealousy, he was ever ready to put hatred 
between husband and wife; and for such as had not the pluck or skill even to 
use a dagger on a dark night, his little effigies, pierced with pins, would 
bring death to a rival.  He was at once a physician and wonder-worker for 
such as would pay him fee."
     "Among the more modern Semite’s magic is greatly in vogue in many 
forms, some of them quite familiar to Europeans: indeed we find in the 
Arabian Nights edited by Lane, a story of old women riding on a broom-stick.  
Among Mahommedans the wizard is thought to deserve death by reason of the 
fact that he is an unbeliever.  Witches are fairly common in Arabic lore, 
and we usually find them figuring as sellers of potions and philtres. The 
European witch is usually supposed to be able to leave her dwelling at night 
by sprinkling some of the ashes of the hearth on the forehead of her 
husband, whereby he sleeps soundly till the morning. This is identical with 
French medieval practice. In Arab folk tales the moghrebi is the sorcerer 
who has con-verse with demons, and we find many such in the Old and New 
Testaments, as well as diviners and other practitioners of the occult arts,  
In the Sanhedrin, Rabbi Akiba defines an enchanter as one who calculates the 
times and hours, and other rabbis state that  an enchanter is he who grows 
ill when his bread drops from his mouth, or if he drops the stick that 
supports him from his hand, or if his son calls after him, or a crow caws in 
his hearing, or a deer crosses his path, or he sees a serpent at his right 
hand, or a fox on his left."  The Arabs believe that magic will not work 
while he that employs it is asleep.  Besides it is possible to over-reach 
Satan himself, and many Arabic tales exist in which me n of wisdom and 
cunning have succeeded in accomplishing this once sent his son to an 
assembly of honourable people with a flint stone, and told him to have the 
flint stone woven,  He came in and said, ”My father sends his peace, and 
wishes to have this flint stone woven." A man with a goat-beard said, " Tell 
your father to have it spun, and then we will weave it,"  The son went back, 
and the Devil was very angry, and told his son never to put forth any 
suggestion when a goat-bearded man was present, " for he is more devilish 
than we."  Curiously enough, Rabbi Joshua ben Hananiah makes a similar 
request in a contest against the wise men of Athens, who have required him 
to sew together the fragments of a broken millstone.  He asks in reply for a 
few threads made of the fibre of tile stone.  The good folk of Mosul, too, 
have ever prided themselves on a ready wit against the Devil.  Time was, as 
my servant related to me, when Iblis came to Mosul and found a man planting 
onions. They fell to talking, and in their fellowship agreed to divide the 
produce of the garden.  Then, on a day when the onions were ready, the 
partners went to their vegetable patch and the man said, " Master, wilt thou 
take as thy half that which is above ground or that which is below ? Now the 
Devil saw the good green shoots of the onions sprouting high, and so carried 
these off as his share, leaving the gardener chuckling over his bargain.  
But when wheat time came round, and the man was sowing his glebe on a day, 
the Devil looked over the ditch and complained that he had made nothing out 
of the compact.  " This time, quoth he, we will divide differently, and thou 
shalt take the tops " ; and so it fell out. They visited the tilth together 
and when the corn was ripe, and the fellah reaped the field and took away 
the ears, leaving the Devil stubbing up the roots.  Presently, after he had 
been digging for a month, he began to find out his error, and went to the 
man, who was cheerily threshing his portion. “This is a paltry quibble," 
said Iblis, " thou hast cozened me this twice."
Nay," said the former, " I gave thee thy desire; and furthermore thou didst 
not thresh out thine onion-tops, as I am doing this."  So it was a sanguine 
Devil that sent away to beat the dry onion-stalks, but in vain; and he left 
Mosul sullenly, stalking away in dudgeon, and stopping once in a while to 
shake his hand against so crafty a town. “Cursed be he, ye tricksters ! who 
can outmatch devilry like yours
     “In modern times in the East," says Mr. Thompson, from Morocco to 
Mesopotamia, books of magic are by no means rare, and manuscripts in Arabic, 
Hebrew, Gershuni, and Syriac can frequently be bought, all dealing with some 
form of magic or popular medicine.  In Suakin ill the Soudan I was offered a 
printed book of astrology in Arabic illustrated by the most grotesque and 
bizarre woodcuts of the signs of the Zodiac, the blocks for which seem to 
have done duty in other places.  Such books existed in manu-script in 
ancient days, as is vouched for by the story of the Sibylline books or the 
passage in Acts xix., 19; ‘ Not a few of them that practised curious arts 
brought their books together, and burned them in the sight of all.’
     It is curious to find the charm for raising hatred practi-cally the 
same among the Semites as it is amongst the peoples of Hungary and the 
Balkan States: that  is through the agency of the egg of a black hen. We 
find too, many minor sorceries the same among the Semites as among European 
races. To be invisible was another at-tainment much sought after, and it was 
thought that if one wore a ring of copper and iron engraved with certain 
magic signs this result would be secured, or the heart of a black cat, dried 
and steeped in honey. The article " Solo-mon" can be referred to for several 
instances of potent enchantments.’ Sympathetic magic is often resorted to by 
the Arabic witch and wizard, just as it was amongst the ancient Hebrews and 
Assyrians.
     The great repertory of Semitic occultism is of course the Kabala, to 
which the reader is referred for later Hebrew mystical doctrine.

Sethos : A diviner, who was deprived of his sight by the Emperor Manuel 
because of his addiction to Magic.  It is said that the Emperor Andronicus 
Comnenus obtained through him by hydromancy an answer to the question of who

being asked when, said before the Feast of the exaltation of the Cross.  
This prediction was fulfilled, for before the date mentioned Isaac Angelus 
had thrown Andronicus to be torn in pieces by the mob.  When the devil 
spells, he spells backwards, so that  "S I" may quite fairly be taken to 
represent Isaac according to the laws of magic


Setna, Papyrus of : A papyrus of very ancient date, dealing with the 
personality of Prince Setna Kha-em-ust, son of Rameses II. of Egypt, and 
said to have been discovered by him under the head of a mummy in the 
Necropolis at Memphis.  Says Wiedemann concerning it: The first text, which 
has been known to us since 1867, tells that this prince, being skilled and 
zealous in the practice of necro-mancy, was one day exhibiting his 
acquirements to the learned men of the court, when an old man told him of a 
magic book containing two spells written by the hand of Thoth himself, the 
god of wisdom.  He who repeated the first spell bewitched thereby heaven and 
earth and the realm of night, the mountains and the depth of the sea; he 
knew the fowls of the air and every creeping thing; he saw the fishes, for a 
divine power brought them up out of the depth.  He who read the second spell 
should have power to resume his earthly shape, even though he dwelt in the 
grave; to see the sun rising in the sky with all the gods and the moon in 
the form wherein she displays herself.  Setna inquired where this book was 
to be found, and learned that it was lying in the tomb of Nefer-ka-Ptah, a 
son of King Mer-neb-Ptah (who is nowhere else named), and that any attempt 
to take away the book would certainly meet with obstinate resistance.  These 
difficulties did not with-hold Setna from the adventure.  He entered the 
tomb of Nefer-ka-Ptah, where he found not only the dead man, but the Ka of 
his wife Ahuri and their son, though these latter had been buried in Koptos.  
But as in many other tales among many other peoples, success brought no 
blessing to the man who had disturbed the repose of the dead.  Setna fell in 
love with the daughter of a priest at Memphis, who turned out to be a witch, 
and took advan-tage of his intimate connection with her to bring him to 
ignominy and wretchedness.  At length the prince recog-nised and repented of 
the sacrilege he had committed in carrying off the book, and brought it back 
to Nefer-ka-Ptah. In the hope of atoning to some extent for his sin he 
journeyed to Koptos, and finding the graves of the wife and child of Nefer-
ka-Ptah, he solemnly restored their mummies to the tomb of the father and 
husband, carefully closing the tomb he had so sacrilegiously disturbed.  The 
second text, edited two years ago by Griffith from a London papyrus, is also 
genuinely Egyptian in its details. Three magic tales, interwoven one with 
another, are brought into connection with Saosiri, the supernaturally born 
son of Setna.  In the first, Saosiri, who was greatly Setna’s superior in 
the arts of magic, led his father down into the underworld.  They penetrated 
into the judgment-hall of Osiris, where the sights they saw convinced Setna 
that a glorious future awaited the poor man who should cleave to 
righteousness, while he who led an evil life on earth, though rich and 
powerful, must expect a terrible doom. Saosiri next succeeded in saving his 
father, and with him all Egypt, from great difficulty by reading without 
breaking the seal of a closed letter brought by an Ethiopian magician, whom 
he thus forced to recognise the superior power of Egypt.  The last part of 
the text tells of a powerful magician once dwelling in Ethiopia who modelled 
in wax a litter with four bearers to whom he gave his life.  He sent them to 
Egypt, and at his command they sought out Pharaoh in his palace, carried him 
off to Ethiopia, and, after giving him five hundred blows with a cudgel, 
con-veyed him during the same night back to Memphis.  Next morning the king 
displayed the weals on his back to his courtiers, one of whom. Horus by 
name, was sufficiently skilled in the use of amulets to ward off by their 
means an immediate repetition of the outrage.  Horus then set forth to bring 
from Hermopolis, the all-powerful magic book of the god Thoth, and by its 
aid he succeeded in treating the Ethiopian king as the Ethiopian sorcerer 
had treated Pharaoh. The foreign magician then hastened to Egypt to engage 
in a contest with Horus in magic tricks. His skill was shown to be inferior, 
and in the end he and his mother received permission to return to Ethiopia 
under a solemn promise not to set foot on Egyptian territory for a space of 
fifteen hundred years.

Seton (or Sethon) Alexander, was one of the very few alchem-ists who 
succeeded in the great experiment of the transmu-tation of metals.  He took 
his name from the village of Seton, which is stated to have been in the 
vicinity of Edin-burgh and close to the sea-shore, so that one may 
reasonably conclude that the little fishing community of Port Seton is 
meant, although Camden in his Brittania states that that was the name of his 
house.  In the year 1601, the crew of a Dutch vessel had the misfortune to 
be wrecked on the coast near his dwelling, and Seton personally rescued 
several of them, lodged them in his house, and treated them with great 
kindness, ultimately sending them back to Holland at his own expense.  In 
the following year he visited Holland, and renewed his acquaintance with at 
least one of the ship-wrecked crew, James Haussen, the pilot, who lived at 
Arksun.  Haussen, determined on repaying him for the hospitality he had 
received in Scotland, entertained him for some time in his house, and to him 
Seton disclosed the information that he was a master of the art of alchemy, 
and proved his words by performing several transmutations. Haussen, full of 
the matter, confided it to one Venderlinden, a physician of Enkhuysen, to 
whom he showed a piece of gold which he had himself seen transmuted from 
lead.
This Venderlinden’s grandson in turn, showed to the celebrated author, D. G. 
Morhoff, who wrote a letter con-cerning it to Langlet du Fresnoy, author of 
the Histoire de la Philosophie Hermetique.
     Seton visited Amsterdam and Rotterdam, travelled by sea to Italy, and 
thence through Switzerland to Germany, accompanied by a professed sceptic of 
alchemy, one Wolf-gang Dienheim, whom he convinced of the error of his views 
at Basle before several of its principal inhabitants. This person has 
described Seton, and from the pen picture he gives of him we can discern a 
typical Scot of the seven-teenth century.  " Seton," he says,  was short but 
stout, and high-coloured, with a pointed beard, but despite his corpulence, 
his expression was spiritual and exalted."He was," adds Dienheim, ‘ a native 
of Molier, in an island of the ocean." One wonders if Molier is the German’s 
corruption of Lothian.
     Several experiments of importance were now demon-strated by Seton.  In 
one of these the celebrated physician Zwinger himself brought the lead which 
was to be trans-muted from his own house. A common crucible was obtained at 
a goldsmith’s, and ordinary sulphur was bought on the road to the house 
where the experiment was to take place.  Seton handled none of these 
materials and took no part in the operation except to give to those who 
followed his directions a small packet of powder which transformed the lead 
into the purest gold of exactly the same weight.  Zwinger appears to have 
been absolutely convinced of the genuine nature of the experiment, for he 
wrote an account of it to his friend Dr. Schobinger, which appears in 
Lonig’s Ephemerides.  Shortly after this Seton left Basle, and changing his 
name went to Strasbourg, whence he travelled to Cologne, lodging with one 
Anton Bordemann, who was by way of being an alchemist. In this city he was 
sufficiently imprudent to blazon his know-ledge far and wide,-on one 
occasion producing six ounces of gold through the application of one grain 
of his magical powder.  The circumstance seems to have made an impression on 
at least one of the savants of the Cathedral City, for Theobald de 
Hoghelande in his Historiae Aliquot Transmutationis Mettalicae,  which  was  
published  at Cologne in 1604, alludes to it.
     Seton then went to Hamburg, whence he travelled south to Munich, where 
something more important than alchemy engaged his attention, for he eloped 
with the daughter of a citizen, whom he married.  The young Elector of 
Saxony, Christian II. had heard of Seton 5 brilliant alchemical successes 
and invited him to his court, but Seton, loath to leave his young wife, sent 
his friend, William Hamilton, probably a brother-Scot, in his stead, with a 
supply of the transmuting agent.  In the presence of the whole Court, 
Hamilton undertook and carried through an experiment with perfect success 
and the gold then manufactured resisted every known test. This naturally 
only whetted the Elector’s desire to see and converse with the magus, and a 
pressing invitation, which amounted to a command, was dispatched to Seton, 
who, thus rendered unable to refuse, betook himself to the electoral court. 
He was received there with every mark of honour, but it soon became evident 
to him that Christian II. had only invited him thither for the purpose of 
extract-ing from him the nature of his grand secret, but Seton, as an adept 
in the mysteries of alchemy, remained true to his high calling, and flatly 
refused to gratify the Elector’s greed. Promises of preferment and threats 
were alike indifferent to him, and in the end the Elector, in a passion, 
ordered him to be imprisoned in a tower, where he was guarded by forty 
soldiers. There he was subjected to every conceivable species of torture, 
but all to no purpose.  The rack, the fire, and the scourge, failed to 
extort from him the methods by which he had achieved the grand arcanum. 
Quite as exhausted as his victim, the Elector at last for-bore, and left the 
unfortunate Scot in peace.
     At this juncture a Moravian chemist, Michael Sendi-vogius, who happened 
to be in Dresden heard of Seton’s terrible experiences and possessed 
sufficient influence to obtain permission to visit him.  Himself a searcher 
after the philosopher’s stone, he sympathised deeply with the adept, and 
proposed to him that he should attempt to effect his rescue.  To this Seton 
agreed, and promised that if he were fortunate enough to escape, he would 
reward Sendivogius with his secret.  The Moravian travelled back to Cracow, 
where he resided, sold up his property, and returned to Dresden, where he 
lodged near Seton’s place of confinement, entertaining the soldiers who 
guarded the alchemist, and judiciously bribing those who wore directly 
concerned in his imprisonment. At last be judged that the time was ripe to 
attempt Seton’s salvation.  He feasted the guards in a manner so liberal 
that all of them were soon in a condition of tipsy carelessness.  He then 
hastened to the tower in which Seton was imprisoned, but found him unable to 
walk, through the severity of his tortures.  He therefore supported him to a 
carriage which stood waiting, and which they gained without being observed. 
They halted at Seton’s house to take up his wife, who had in her possession 
some of the all-important powder, and whipping up the horses, sped as 
swiftly as possible to Cracow, which they reached in safety.  When quietly 
settled in that city, Sendivogius reminded Seton of his promise to assist 
him in his alchemical projects, but was met with a stern refusal, Seton 
explaining to him that it was impossible for him as an adept to reveal to 
his rescuer the terms of such an awful mystery.  The health of the alchemist 
was, however, shattered by the dreadful torments through which he had 
passed, and which he survived only for about two years, presenting the 
remains of his magical precipitate to his preserver.  The possession of this 
powder only made Sendivogius more eager than ever to penetrate the myster-
ies of the grand arcanum.  He married Seton’s widow, perhaps with the idea 
that she was in possession of her late husband’s occult knowledge, but if so 
he was doomed to disappointment for she was absolutely ignorant of the 
matter.  Seton had left behind him, however, a treatise entitled The New 
Light of Alchymy, which Sendivogius laid hands on and published as his own.  
In its pages he thought he saw a method of increasing the powder, but to his 
intense disappointment and disgust, he only succeeded in lessening it.  With 
what remained, however, he posed as a successful projector of the grand 
mystery, and pro-ceeded with much splendour from court to court in a sort of 
triumphal procession.  In his own country of Moravia, he was imprisoned, but 
escaped.  His powder, however, was rapidly diminishing, but he still 
continued his experi-ments.  Borel in his work on French Antiquities 
mentions that he saw a crown piece which had been partially dipped into a 
mixture of the powder dissolved in spirits of wine, and that the part 
steeped in the elixir was of gold, was porous, and was not soldered or 
otherwise tampered with.  The powder done, Sendivogius degenerated into a 
mere charlatan, pretending that he could manufacture gold, and receiving 
large sums on the strength of being able to do so.  He survived until the 
year 1646 when he died at Parma at the age of 84.  Seton’s New Light of 
Alchymy would appear, from an examination of it, to deny that the 
philosopher’s stone was to be achieved by the successful transmutation of 
metals.  It says :-
     “The extraction of the soul out of gold or silver, by. what vulgar way 
of alchymy soever, is but a mere fancy, On the contrary, he which, in a 
philosophical way, can without any fraud, and colourable deceit, make it 
that it shall really tinge the basest metal, whether with gain or without 
gain, with the colour of gold or silver (abiding all requisite tryals 
whatever), bath the gates of Nature opened to him for the enquiring into 
further and higher secrets, and with the blessing of God to obtain them."


Seven Stewards of Heaven, by whom God governs the world. They are known in 
works on Magic as the Olympian Spirits, and they govern the Olympian 
spheres, which are composed of one hundred and ninety-six regions. Their 
names in the Olympian language are :-Arathron, the celestial spirit of 
Saturn, whose day is Saturday; Bethor, the angel of Jupiter, whose day is 
Monday; Phaleg, the prince of Mars, whose day is Tuesday; Och, the master of 
the Sun, whose day is Sunday; Hagith, the sovereign of Venus, whose day is 
Friday; Ophiel, the Spirit of Mercury, who must be invoked on Wednesday; 
Phul, the administrator of affairs in the Moon, whose day is Monday.  Each 
of these Seven Celestial Spirits may be invoked by magicians by the aid of 
ceremonies and preparations.


Sextus V., Pope, was one of the line of St. Peter accused of sorcery.  De 
Thou says of him in his Histoire Universelle (tome XI.)  " The Spaniards 
continued their vengeance against this Pontiff even after his death, and 
they forgot nothing in their anxiety to blacken his memory by the libels 
which they flung against him.  Sextus, said they, who, by means of the 
magical art, was for a long time in con-federacy with a demon, had made a 
compact with this enemy of humanity to give himself up to him, on con-dition 
he was made Pope, and allowed to reign six years. Sextus was raised to the 
chair of St. Peter, and during the five years he held sway in Rome he 
distinguished his pontificate by actions surpassing the feeble reach of the 
human intellect.  Finally, at the end of this term, the Pope fell sick, and 
the devil arriving to keep him to his pact, Sextus inveighed strongly 
against his bad faith, reproaching him with the fact that the term they had 
agreed upon was not fulfilled, and that there still remained to him more 
than a twelve-month.  But the devil reminded him that at the beginning of 
his pontificate he had con-demned a man who, according to the laws, was too 
young by a year to suffer death, and that he had nevertheless caused him to 
be executed, saying that he would give him a year out of his own life; that 
this year, added to the other five, completed the six years which had been 
promised to him, and that in consequence he did very wrong to complain. 
Sextus, confused and unable to make any answer, remained mute, and turning 
himself towards the ruelle of his bed, prepared for death in the midst of 
the terrible mental agitation caused by the remorse of his conscience.  For 
the rest," adds De Thou, with amiable frankness, " I only mention this trait 
as a rumour spread by the Spaniards, and I should be very sorry to guarantee 
its truth."

Shelta Thari: An esoteric language spoken by the tinkers of Great Britain, 
and possibly a descendant of an "inner" language employed by the ancient 
Celtic Druids or bards. It was in 1876 that the first hint of the existence 
of Shelta Than reached the ears of that prince of practical philolo-gists, 
Charles Godfrey Leland.  It seems strange that George Borrow had never 
stumbled upon the language, and that fact may be taken as a strong proof of 
the jealousy with which the nomadic classes guarded it. Leland relates how 
he and Professor E. H. Palmer, were wandering on the beach at Aberystwyth 
when they met a tramp, who heard them indulging in a conversation in Romany.  
Leland questioned the man as to how he gained a living, and he replied, " 
Shelkin gallopas."  The words were foreign even to the master of dialect, 
and he inquired their import. "Why," said the man, "it means selling ferns. 
That is tinker’s language or minklers’ thari.  I thought as you knew Romany, 
you might understand it.  The right name for the tinkers’ language is 
Shelta."  " It was," says Leland, "with the feelings of Columbus the night 
before he discovered America that I heard the word Shelta, and I asked the 
fern-dealer if he could talk it." The man replied " A little," and on the 
spot the philologist collected a number of words and phrases from the fern-
seller which gave him sufficient insight into the language to prove to him 
that it was absolutely different from Romany. The Celtic origin of the 
dialect soon began to commend itself to Leland, and he attempted to obtain 
from the man some verse or jingle in it, possibly for the purpose of 
observing its syntactical arrangement.  But all he was able to drag from his 
informant were some rhymes of no philological value, and he found he had 
soon pumped the tramp dry. It was in America that Leland nearly terrified a 
tinker out of his wits by speaking to him in the lost dialect. The man, 
questioned as to whether he could speak Shelta, admitted the soft 
impeachment.  He proved to be an Irishman, Owen Macdonald by name, and he 
furnished Leland with an invaluable list of several hundred words. But 
Leland could not be sure upon which of the Celtic languages the dialect was 
based.  Owen Macdonald declared to him that it was a fourth language, which 
had nothing in common with old Irish, Welsh, or Gaelic, and hazarded the 
information that it was the idiom of the “Ould Picts," but this appears to 
be rather too conjectural for the consumption of the philologist.  Shelta is 
not a jargon, for it can be spoken grammatically without using English, as 
in the British form of Romany.  Pictish in all probability was not a Celtic 
language, nor even an Aryan one, however intimately it may have been 
affected by Celtic speech in the later stages of its existence.  Leland’s 
dis-covery was greeted in some quarters with inextinguishable laughter. The 
Saturday Review jocosely suggested that he had been " sold," and that old 
Irish had been palmed off on him for a mysterious lingo.  He put this view 
of the matter before his tinker friend, who replied with grave solemnity, 
"And what’d I be afther makin’ two languages av thim for, if there was but 
wan av thim ?"  Since Leland’s day much has been done to reclaim this 
mysterious tongue, chiefly through the investigations of Mr. John Sampson 
and Professor Kuno Meyer. The basis of these investigations rested on the 
fact that the tinker caste of Great Britain and Ireland was a separate 
class-so separate indeed as almost to form a race by itself.  For hundreds 
of years, possibly, this fraternity existed with nearly all its ancient 
characteristics, and on the general disuse of Celtic speech had conserved it 
as a secret dialect.  The peculiar thing concerning Shelta is the extent of 
territory over which it is spoken. That it is known rather extensively in 
London itself was discovered by Leland, who heard it spoken by two small 
boys in the Euston Road,  They were not Gypsies, and Leland found out that 
one of them spoke the language with great fluency.  Since Leland’s 
discoveries Shelta has been to some extent mapped out into dialects, one of 
the most important of which is that of Ulster,  It would be difficult to 
explain in the course of such an article as this exactly how long the Ulster 
dialect of this strange and ancient tongue differs from that in use in other 
parts of Great Britain and Ireland.  But that it does so is certain.  Nearly 
eighteen years ago Mr. John Sampson, of Liverpool, a worthy successor to 
Borrow and Leland, and a linguist of repute. collected a number of sayings 
and proverbs from two old Irish tinkers-John Barlow and Phil Murray-which he 
distinctly states are in the Ulster dialect of Shelta.  Some of these may be 
quoted to provide the reader with specimens of the language :-Krish gyukera 
have muni 
Sheldru - Old beggars have good Shelta. Stimera dhi-ilsha, stimera aga dhi-
ilsha - If you’re a piper, have your own pipe.  Misjo granhes thaber-The 
traveller knows the road. Thom Blorne mjesh Nip gloch-Every Protest-ant 
isn’t an Orangeman.  Nus a dhabjon dhuilsha-The blessing of God on you.  
Misli, gami gra dhi-il-Be off, and bad luck to you.
     There seems to be considerable reason to believe that the tinker (or 
more properly " tinkler ") class of Great Britain sprang from the remnants 
of its ancient Celtic inhabitants, and differed as completely from the 
Gypsy, or Romany, race as one people can well differ from another. This is 
almost conclusively proved by the criterion of speech, for Shelta is a 
Celtic tongue and that Romany is a dialect of Northern Hindustan is not open 
to doubt. Those who now speak Romany habitually almost invariably make use 
of Shelta as well, but that only proves that the two nomadic races, having 
occupied the same territory for hundreds of years, had gained a knowledge of 
each other’s languages. Who, then, were the original progenitors of the 
tinkers ? Whoever they were, they were a Celtic-speaking race, and probably 
a nomadic one.  Shelta has been referred to as the language of the ancient 
bards of Ireland, the esoteric tongue of an Irish priesthood. Leland puts 
forward the hypothesis that the Shelta-speaking tinker is a descendant of a 
prehistoric guild of bronze-workers. This, he thinks, accounts in part for 
his secretiveness as regards his language. In Italy to this very day the 
tinker class is identified with the itinerant bronze workers. The tinker 
fraternity of Great Britain and Ireland existed with perhaps nearly all its 
ancient characteristics until the advent of railroads.  But long before this 
it had probably amalgamated to a great extent with the Gypsy population, and 
the two languages had become common to the two peoples. This is the only 
explanation that can be given for the appearance of Shelta, a Celtic 
language, in the non-Celtic portions of Great Britain.  That it originated 
in Ireland appears to be highly probable, for in no other part of these 
islands during the later Celtic period was there a state of civilisation 
sufficiently advanced to permit of the existence of a close corporation of 
metal-workers possessing a secret language. Moreover, the affinities of 
Shelta appear to be with old Irish more than with any other Celtic dialect. 
There is one other theory that presents itself in connection with the origin 
of Shelta, and that is, that it is the modern descendant of the language of 
the " Ould Picts" men-tioned by Owen Macdonald, Leland’s tinker friend.  It 
has by no means been proved that Pictish was a non-Aryan language, and, 
despite the labours of Professor Rhys, we are as far off as ever from any 
definite knowledge concernin-g the idiom spoken by that mysterious people.  
But there are great difficulties in the way of accepting the hypothesis of 
the Pictish origin of Shelta, the chief among them being its obvious Irish 
origin.  There were, it is known, Picts in the North of Ireland, but they 
were almost certainly a small and barbarous colony, and a very unlikely 
community to form a metal-working confraternity, possessing the luxury of a 
private dialect.  It still remains for the Celtic student to classify 
Shelta, It may prove to be " Pictish," strongly influenced by the Gaelic of 
Ireland and Scotland.  A comparison with Basque and the dialect of the 
Iberian tribes of Morocco might bring affinities to light, and thus 
establish the theory of its non-Aryan origin  but its strong kinship with 
Erse seems undoubted.  (See Journal of the Gypsy Lore’ Society, New Series.)


Shemhamphorash  In the Talmud, the external term repre-senting the hidden 
word of power, by whose virtues it were possible to create a new world,  But 
it is lost to man, though even sounds approximating to it have a magic 
power, and can give to him who pronounces them dominion in the spirit-world.  
Some of the Rabbis say that the word of power contains twelve letters, 
others, forty-two, and yet others seventy-two  but these are the letters of 
the divine alphabet, which God created from certain luminous points made by 
the concentration of the primal universal Light.  Shemhamphorash is, in 
fact, the name of this word,

Ship of the Dead : Akin to the superstitious idea of the death--coach is the 
belief that at times a phantom barque carries away the souls of men,  In the 
form of a cloud-ship, or wrapped in a driving mist, it sails over mountains 
and moors, and at sea it sails in despite of wind and tide,  A story is told 
of a certain pirate, at whose death a spectral ship approached in a cloud.  
As it sailed over the roof the house was filled with a sound as of a stormy 
sea, and when the ship had passed by the soul of the pirate accompanied it.


Shorter, Thomas : (See Spiritualism.)


Siberia : The barbarian tribes of Siberia all more or less practise the art 
of Sorcery, and this has been from time immemorial in the hands of the 
shamanistic or medicine-man class.  The Samoyeds who are idol-worshippers 
believe also in the existence of an order of invisible spirits which they 
call tadebtsois.  These are ever circling through the atmosphere, and are a 
constant menace to the native, who is anxious to propitiate them.  This can 
only be effec-ted through the intervention of a tadibe or Necromancer, who. 
when his services are requisitioned, attires himself in magical costume of 
reindeer leather trimmed with red cloth, a mask of red cloth, and a breast-
plate of polished metal,  He then takes a drum of reindeer skin (See Lap-
land) ornamented with brass rings, and attended by an assistant. walks round 
in a circle invoking the presence of the spirits, shaking a large rattle the 
while.  The noise grows louder, and as the spirits are supposed to draw near 
the sorcerer, he addresses them, beating his drum more gently, and pausing 
in his chant to listen to their answers. Gradually he works himself into a 
condition of frenzy, beats the drum with great violence, and appears to be 
possessed by the supernatural influence writhing and foaming at the mouth.  
All at once he stops. and oracularly pronounces the will of the spirits.  
The Tadibe’s office is a hereditary one, but if a member of the tribe should 
exhibit special qualifications he is adopted into the priesthood, and by 
fasts, vigils, the use of narcotics and stimulants in the same manner as is 
employed by the N.A. Indians (q.v.), he comes to believe that he has been 
visited by the spirits. He is then adopted as a Tadibe with midnight 
ceremonial, and is invested with a magic drum.  A great many of the tricks 
of the priesthood are merely those of ordinary con-juring, such as the rope 
trick, but some of the illusions which these men secure are exceedingly 
striking.  With their hands and feet tied together, they sit on a carpet of 
reindeer skin, and putting out the light, summon the assistance of the 
spirits.  Peculiar noises herald their approach, snakes hiss, and bears 
growl, the lights are rekindled and the tadibe is seen released from his 
bonds.
     The Samoyeds sacrifice much to the dead, and perform various ceremonies 
in their honour, but they believe that only the souls of the tadibes enjoy 
immortality and hover through the air, demanding constant sacrifice.
     Further to the east, inhabiting the more northerly part of Siberia 
dwell the Ostiaks, who have nominally adopted the rites of the Greek Church, 
but magic is rife amongst them.  Many Ostiaks carry about with them a 
description of fetish, which they call Schaitan,  Whether this name, like 
the Arabic Sheitan, is merely a corruption of that of Satan, it would be 
difficult to say. Larger images of this kind are part of the furniture of an 
Ostiak lodge, but they are attired in seven pearl embroidered garments, and 
sus-pended to the neck by a string of silver coins,  In a strange sort of 
dualism they are placed in many of the huts cheek by jowl with the image of 
the Virgin Mary, and at meal-times their lips are smeared with the blood of 
raw game or fish.
     It is this people, the Ostiaks, with whom the word Shaman"  originated.  
These  Shamans are merely medicine-men
     The Mongols, who inhabit the more southern parts of the great waste of 
Siberia are also ancient practitioners in sorcery, and rely greatly on 
divination.  In order to discover what description of weather will be 
prevalent for any length of time they employ a stone endowed With magic 
virtues called yadeh-tash.  This is suspended over, or lies in a basin of 
water with sundry ceremonies, and appears to be the same kind of stone in 
use among the Turcomans as related by Ibn Mohalhal, an early Arab traveller.
     The celebrated conqueror. Timur, in his Memoirs, records that the Jets 
resorted to incantations to produce heavy rains which hindered his cavalry 
from acting against them.  A Yadachi, or weather-conjuror, was taken 
prisoner, and after lie had been beheaded the storm ceased.
     Babu refers to one of his early friends, Khwaja ka Mulai, as 
conspicuous for his skill in falconry and his knowledge of Yadageri, or the 
science of inducing rain and snow by means of enchantment.  The Russians 
were much distressed by heavy rains in 1552, when besieging Kazan, and 
universally ascribed the unfavourable weather to the arts of the Tatar 
queen, who was an enchantress.
     Early in the 18th century, the Chinese Emperor Shi-tsung issued a 
proclamation against rain-conjuring, address-ed to the Eight Banners of 
Mongolia.   If," indignantly observes the Emperor,  if I, offering prayers 
in sincerity, have yet cause to fear that it may please heaven to leave my 
prayer unanswered, it is truly intolerable that mere common people wishing 
for rain should of their own fancy set up altars of earth; and bring 
together a rabble of Hoshang (Buddhist Bonzes) and Taossi to conjure the 
spirits to gratify their wishes.’’


Slbylline Books : The manuscripts which embodied the secrets of human 
destiny, the work of the sibyls (q.v.) or prophetesses of the ancient world.  
According to Tacitus, these books were first preserved in the Capitol.  When 
it was burnt down, the precious leaves of Fate were pre-served, and removed 
to the temple of Apollo Palatinus. Their after-fate is enshrouded in 
mystery, but it would seem that the Cumean books existed until 339 A.D., 
when they were destroyed by Stilikon.  Augustus sent three ambassadors-
Paulus Gabinus, Marcus Otacillius, and Lucius Valerius-into Asia, Africa, 
and Italy, but especially to the Erythraean Sibyl, to collect’ whatever 
could be discovered of the Sibylline Oracles, to replace those which had 
been lost or burnt.  The books are of two kinds namely, the books of the 
elder Sibyls, that is, of the earlier Greek and Roman times; and the later, 
which were much falsified, and disfigured with numerous interpolations. Of 
the latter, eight books in Greek and Latin are still said to be extant.  
Those which are preserved in Rome had been collected from various places, at 
various times, and contained predictions of future events couched in the 
most mysterious of symbolic languages.  At first they were permitted only to 
be read by descendants of Apollo, but later by the priests, until their care 
was entrusted to certain officials, who only replied to inquiries at the 
com-mand of the Senate, in cases of extraordinary emergency. They were two 
at first, and named duumviri  these were appointed by Tarquinius Superbus. 
Two hundred and thirteen years afterwards, ten more were appointed to their 
guardianship (decemviri), and Sulla increased the number to fifteen 
(quindecemviri.)


Siderit : Another name for the magnet.

Silvester II., Pope, (Gerbert, died 1003): One of a number of popes who from 
the tenth century onwards were regarded as sorcerers.  It was said-and the 
story probably emanated from the Gnostics who had been proscribed by the 
Church-that Gerbert had evoked a demon who obtained for him the papacy, and 
who further promised him that he should die only after he had celebrated 
High Mass in Jerusalem.  One day, while he was saying mass in a Church in 
Rome, he felt suddenly ill, and remembering that he was in the Church of the 
Holy Cross in Jerusalem, he knew that the demon had played him a trick.  
Before he died, the chronicler continues, he confessed to his cardinals his 
compact with the devil.  However, as Gerbert had been preceptor of two 
monarchs, and a friend of others, it is more likely that he owed his 
preference to one of these. He was one of the most learned men of his day, a 
proficient in mathematics, astronomy, and mechan-ics.  He it was who 
introduced clocks, and some writers credit him with the invention of 
arithmetic as we now have it. It is not at all improbable that his 
scientific pursuits seemed to the ignorant to savour of magic. The technical 
language employed in his various studies might well have a sinister 
significance to the ignorant. The brazen head which William of Malmesbury 
speaks of as belonging to Silvester, and which answered questions in an 
oracular manner probably had its origin in a similar misinterpreta-tion of 
scientific apparatus.  But however that may be, there is no lack of 
picturesque detail in some of the stories told of him. By the aid of sorcery 
he is said to have discovered buried treasure and to have visited a 
marvellous underground palace, whose riches and splendour vanished at a 
touch.  His very tomb was believed to possess the powers of sorcery, and to 
shed tears when one of the suc-ceeding popes was about to die.


Simon Ben Yohai: (See Kabala.)


Simon Magus: The sorcerer mentioned in the New Testa-ment (Acts viii.) who 
bewitched the people of Samaria, and led them to believe that he was 
possessed of divine power. He was born in Samaria or Cyprus and was among 
the number of Samaritans who, moved by the preaching of Philip, came to him 
for baptism.  Later, when Peter and John laid their hands on the new 
converts, so that they received the Holy Ghost, Simon offered the disciples 
money to procure a similar power. But Peter sternly rebuked him for seeking 
to buy the gift of God with money, and bade him pray that his evil thought 
might be forgiven, whereupon the already repentant Simon said, " Pray ye to 
the Lord for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon 
me.
     Though we are not told in detail what the sorceries were with which 
Simon bewitched the people of Samaria, certain early ecclesiastical writers 
have left a record of his doings. He could, they averred, make himself 
invisible when he pleased, assume the appearance of another person, or of 
the lower animals, pass unharmed through fire, cause statues to become 
alive, make furniture move without any visible means of imparting motion, 
and go through a long list of equally miraculous performances.  In 
explanation of his desire to possess the apostles’ power of working miracle 
she is said to have affirmed that his sorceries took a great deal of time 
and trouble to perform, owing to the necessity for a multitude of magical 
rites and incantations, while the miracles of the apostles were accomplished 
easily, and successfully, by the mere utterance of a few words.
     The adept from whom Simon learned the art of magic was one Dositheus, 
who pretended to be the Messiah fore-told by the prophets, and who was 
contemporary with Christ.  From this person he appears to have acquired a 
great store of occult erudition, and owed his power chiefly to the 
hysterical conditions into which he was capable of throwing himself. Through 
these he was enabled to make himself look either old or young, returning at 
will to child-hood or old age. It is evident that he had not been initiated 
into Transcendental Magic, but was merely consumed by a thirst for power 
over humanity and the mysteries of nature.  Repulsed by the Apostles, he is 
said to have under-taken pilgrimages, like them, in which he permitted 
himself to be worshipped by the mob.  He declared that he himself was the 
manifestation of the Splendour of God, and that Helena, a Greek slave of 
his, was its reflection. Thus he imitated Christianity in the reverse sense, 
affirmed the eternal reign of evil and revolt, and was, in fact, an anti-
christ.
     After a while he went to Rome, where he appeared before the Emperor 
Nero.  He is said to have been decapi-tated by him, but his head was 
restored to his shoulders, and he was instituted by the tyrant as court 
sorcerer. Legend states that St. Peter, alarmed at the spread of the 
doctrine of Simon in Rome, repaired thither to combat it, that Nero was made 
aware of his arrival, and imagining Peter to be a rival sorcerer resolved to 
bring them together for his amusement.  An account ascribed to St. Clement 
states that on the arrival of Peter, Simon flew gracefully through a window 
into the outside air.  The Apostle gave vent to a vehement prayer, whereupon 
the magician, with a loud cry, crashed to the earth, and broke both his 
legs. Nero, greatly annoyed, immediately imprisoned the saint, and it is 
related that Simon died of his fall.  He had, how-ever, founded a distinct 
school headed by Merrander, which promised immortality of soul and body to 
its followers.  As late as 1858 there existed in France and America a sect 
which credited the principles of this magician.


Siradz, Count of : (See Dee.)


Sixth Sense : A term used to denote the faculty of spiritual perception. 
which is distinct from, and higher than, the five physical senses. It is the 
possession of the medium, the psychic or sensitive, and in some measure of 
all hypnotic subjects.  It is not properly a separate sense at all, but is 
compounded from the spiritual correlates of the physical senses.


Slade, Henry : An American medium, principally known in connection with his 
slate-writing exploits.  He came to Britain in July, 1876, and was cordially 
received by the leading spiritualists.  Very many people were impressed and 
completely mystified by the phenomena they witnessed at his seances, and 
Lord Rayleigh, at a meeting of the British Association in September. 1876, 
stated that he had attended a seance of Slade’s in the company of a 
professional conjurer, and that the latter had failed entirely to find an 
explanation of the facts.  A few days after this emphatic testimony was 
given, however, Professor Ray Lankester published in a letter to the Times 
the result of a seance at which he and Dr. Donkin were present.  He had, he 
said, snatched the slate prematurely from  Dr. Slade’s hand, and had found a 
message written thereon, though the sound of writing had not then been 
heard. The spiritualists main-tained that the " exposure" was no exposure at 
all, since Slade declared that he had heard the spirits writing, and
had mentioned the fact, but that his voice had been lost in the confusion.  
However, the medium’s career in Britain was at an end.  At the instance of 
Professor Lankester he was tried in a court of law, and sentenced to three 
months imprisonment with hard labour.  He appealed, and the conviction was 
quashed because of a slight omission in the charge.  A fresh summons was 
issued on the following day, but Slade had left the country, and did not 
thereafter return.  In the years 1877-88 Professor Zollner of Leipsic in-
vestigated the slate-writing and other phenomena occurring in the presence 
of Slade, mainly in the hope of establishing his theory of four-dimensional 
space.  Knots were tied in endless cords, coins extracted from sealed boxes  
but Professor Zollner did not succeed in his attempt to have knots tied in a 
piece of bladder, or to have two rings of solid wood interlaced.  In short, 
no really conclusive proof was obtained.  In 1884 Slade’s phenomena was 
investigated by a committee appointed by the University of Pennsylvania. The 
results of the latter investigation were, at the best, of a negative 
description.  (See also Slate-writing.)


Slate-writing : A form of the so-called " direct" spirit writing, or 
autography, which has always been one of the most popular phenomena of the 
seance. The modus operandi is the same in the majority of cases.  The medium 
and the sitter take their seats at opposite ends of a small table, each 
grasping a corner of an ordinary school slate, which they thus hold firmly 
pressed against the underside of the table.  A small fragment of slate-
pencil is first enclosed between slate and table, for the use of the 
supposed spirit-writer.  Should the seance be successful, a scratching 
sound, as of someone writing on a slate, is heard at the end of a few 
moments, three loud raps indicate the conclusion of the message, and on the 
withdrawal of the slate, it is found to be partly covered with writing-
either a general message from the spirit-world, or an answer to some 
question previously written down by the sitter.
     Among the mediums who were most successful in obtain-ing spirit writing 
in this manner were Dr. Slade and Air. Eglinton.  The former, an American 
medium, came to England in 1876, and succeeded in mystifying not a few men 
of education and of scientific attainments.  His critics have attributed his 
success, in part at least, to his frank and engaging manner, which did much 
to disarm suspicious sitters.  However, ere long Professor Ray Lankester 
exposed his trickery, though the exposure was regarded by many as 
inconclusive, and " Dr." Henry Slade was prose-cuted.  Though sentenced to 
three months’ hard labour, the omission of certain words in the accusation 
made the conviction of no effect.  But Dr. Slade found that England had 
become too hot for him, and speedily retired whence he had come.  Many of 
the accounts of his seances in different countries are of interest, chiefly 
because of the dis-crepancy which exists between those of credulous 
spiritual-ists and those of trained investigations.  Dr. Richard Hodgson, 
however, has pointed out that even in the latter class instances of mal-
observation are the rule rather than the exception, particularly where 
sleight of hand plays a prominent part in the exhibition.  A worthy 
successor to Slade was William Eglinton, who acted as medium for slate-
writing manifestations, and attained to an extraordin-ary popularity, 
upwards of a hundred people testifying to his mediumistic powers in the 
spiritualist journal Light. Speaking of his performances, Mr. C. C. Massey 
said, “Many, of whom I am one, are of the opinion that the case for these 
phenomena generally, and for autography, in particular, is already 
complete."  Eglinton’s manifesta-tions were produced in full light, and his 
seances were seldom blank, so it is hardly surprising that very many 
persons, ignorant of the lengths to which conjuring can be carried, and 
over-confident in their own ability to observe correctly, should see in 
slate-writing a phenomenon explicable only by a spiritualistic theory.  But 
there was definite proof of fraud in several cases.  Muslin and a false 
beard, part of the make-up of a "spirit" had been found in Eglinton’s 
portmanteau, various persons averred that they had seen his messages written 
on prepared slates previous to the seance, and he had been concerned in 
other matters of an equally doubtful character.  And though these detections 
also were disputed they left in the unbiassed mind but little doubt of the 
fraudulent nature of Eglinton’s mediumship. 
     Spiritualists themselves admitted that fraud might occasionally be 
practised by genuine mediums, owing to the uncertainty of the "power."  
Particularly was this so in the case of professional mediums, who were 
obliged to pro-duce some results, and who had to resort to trickery when 
other means failed them.  Mr. S. J. Davey, an associate of the Society for 
Psychical Research who, having discov-ered the tricks of slate-writing, 
practised them himself, was claimed by certain spiritualists as a medium as 
well as a conjurer, and that notwithstanding his protestations to the 
contrary. This is undoubtedly a powerful argument against the good faith of 
slate-writing.. If his sitters could mistake these sleight-of-hand tricks-
which Mr. Davey practised with the express purpose of discrediting their 
professional mediums-for genuine spirit manifestations, might they not also 
be misled by the legerdemain of Slade and Eglinton, and other well-known 
mediums ?  It has been objected that even skilled conjurers such as " Pro-
fessor"  Hoffmann and Houdin professed themselves mystified by slate-writing 
performances, but the answer is fairly obvious, that quite a clever conjurer 
may be baffled by the performances of a brother-expert.  The methods adopted 
by Mr. Davey were of a simple nature, requiring little or no apparatus.  In 
the case of a long, general message, he would prepare a slate beforehand, 
and substi-tute it for the test slate. A shorter message, or a reply to a 
question, he would write on the reverse side of the slate, with a scrap of 
pencil fastened in a thimble, and so with-draw the slate that the side 
written on would be uppermost. There is reason to believe that like simple 
devices were used in other seances, for their very simplicity, and the 
absence of all apparatus, rendered them particularly difficult of detection.  
But where the sitters were more credulous, intricate furniture and 
appliances were used, and the most elaborate preparations made for the 
seance.  (See Pope John XXII.)

Slavs  The Slavonic races have an extensive demonology, and in some measure 
their religious pantheon appears to have been in a stage between animism 
(q.v.) and polythe-ism, that is between god, and spirit-worship.  Among them 
all witchcraft, fairy and folk-lore rest mainly in a belief in certain 
spirits of nature, which in some measure recall the pneumatology of 
Paracelsus and the Comte de Gabalis. In the vile," says Dr. Krauss, " also 
known as Samovile, Samodivi, and Vilivrjaci, we have near relations to the 
forest and field spirits or the wood and moss-folk of Middle Germany, France 
and Bavaria the " wild people of Hesse, Eifel, Salzburg and the Tyrol, the 
wood-women and wood-men of Bohemia, the Tyrolese Fanggen, Fanken, Norkel and 
Happy Ladies, the Roumanish Orken, Euguane, and Dialen, the Danish 
Ellekoner, the Swedish 
Skogsnufvaz, and the Russian Ljesje, while in certain respects they have 
affinity with the Teutonic Valkyries."  They are, however, more like divine 
beings, constantly watching over and con-trolling the destinies of men.  
They are prayed to or exorcised on all occasions.  In short their origin is 
cer-tainly Shamanistic.  Says Leland :   We can still find the vila as set 
forth in old ballads, the incarnation of beauty and power, the benevolent 
friend of sufferers, the geniuses of heroes, the dwellers by rock and river 
and greenwood tree.  But they are implacable in their wrath to all who 
deceive them, or who break a promise.  Nay, they inflict terrible punishment 
even on those who disturb their rings, or the dances which they make by 
midsummer moonlight.  Hence the proverb applied to any man who suddenly fell 
ill, ‘ he stepped on a fairy ring.’ "  (See Circles.)
     There are three varieties of witches or spirits among the southern 
Slavs, the Zracne vile, or aerial spirits, evilly dis-posed to human beings, 
and inflicting serious injuries upon them, Will-’o-the-wisps, who lead 
people astray by nights; the Pozemne vile, companionable spirits, who give 
sage counsel to mankind, and dwell in the earth; and the Podovne vile, or 
water sprites, kindly to man on shore. but treacherous to a degree on their 
own element.  Another water-spirit is the Likho, the Slavonic Polyphemus, a 
dread and terrible monster, the Leshy is a wood-demon, Norka is the 
frightful Lord of the Lower World, and Koschei is a description of ogre 
whose province is the abduction of princesses. 
     Witchcraft.-The witch is very frequently mentioned in Slavonic folk-
tales, especially among the southern Slavs. She is called vjestica, 
(masculine viestac) meaning originally "the  knowing"  or  "well-informed  
one,"  Viedma (Russian).  In Dalmatia and elsewhere among the Southern Slavs 
the witch is called Krstaca, " the crossed "in allusion to the idea that she 
is of the horned race of Hell.  It enrages the witches so much to be called 
by this word that when they hear that any one has used it they come to his 
house by night and tear him in four pieces, which they cast to the four 
winds of heaven, and drive away all his cattle and stock. Therefore the 
shrewd farmers of the country call the witch hmana zena, or " Common woman."  
There are many forms of Slavonic witch, however, and the vjestica differs 
from the macionica and the latter from the Zlokobnica, or " evil-meeter,’ 
one whom it is unlucky to encounter in the morning, or possesses the evil 
eye.  A Serbian authority says: " I have often heard from old Hodzas and 
Kadijas that every female Wallach as soon as she is forty years old, 
abandons the" God be with us," and becomes a witch (v1estica) or at least a 
zlokobnica or macionica.  A real witch has the mark of a cross under her 
nose, a zlokobnica has some hairs of a beard, and a macionica may be known 
by a forehead full of dark folds with blood-spots in her face."
     In South Slavonian countries the peasants on St. George’s Day adorn the 
horns of the cattle with garlands to protect them from witches. They attach 
great importance to a seventh or a twelfth child, who, they believe, are the 
great protectors of the world against witchcraft. But these are in great 
danger on St. John’s Eve, for then the witches, having the most power, 
attack them with stakes or the stumps of saplings, for which reason the 
peasantry care-fully remove everything of the kind from the ground in the 
autumn season.  The Krstnik, or wizards, notori-ously attract the vila 
ladies, who in most instances are desirous of becoming their mistresses, 
just as the women-kind of the salamanders desire to mate with men.  (See the 
Curiosa of Heinrich Kornmann, 1666.)  The man who gains the love of a vila 
is supposed to be extremely lucky. The Slavs believe that on St. George’s 
Day the witches climb into the steeples of churches with the object of 
getting the grease from the axle of the bell, which, for some reason, they 
prize exceedingly. Transformation stories are fairly common, too, in 
Slavonic folklore, which proves that this was a form of magic employed by 
the witches of these countries. The belief in vampires is an outstanding 
superstition in Slavonic countries, and its connections are fully discussed 
in the article Vampire.


Slawensik Poltergeist : In the winter of 1806-7 Councillor Hahn and an 
officer named Charles Kern, living for the time in the Castle of Salwensik, 
Silesia, were disturbed by curious happenings which suggested that the 
Castle was haunted.  Strange noises were heard, small objects were seen to 
rise from the table and fly through the room.  The only account is by 
Councillor Hahn, and, as is generally the case in such circumstances, the 
most surprising occurrences were not witnessed by the recorder, but were 
told him by his friends.  Thus Kern is said to have seen in the glass the 
apparition of a woman in white; while Hahn was not present when a jug of 
beer was raised from the table by invisible hands, tilted, and its contents 
poured down an invisible throat.


Sleeping Preacher: Rachel Baker, known as the Sleeping Preacher, was born at 
Pelham, Massachusetts, in 1794. When she was nine years old her parents 
removed to Mar-cellus, N.Y.  As a child she had a religious training, her 
parents being devout people, and she early manifested a strong conviction of 
her sinfulness.  In 1811 she showed symptoms of somnambulism, in which she 
seemed stricken with horror and despondency.  But gradually her mind became 
calmer, and delivered discourses of singular clear-ness, marked by a devout 
and solemn tone. These fits of somnambulism, or trance - speaking, seized 
her regularly every day, and soon became habitual. She began and concluded 
her devotional exercises with prayer, between which came the discourse. Then 
a state of apparent physical distress supervened, and sobs and groans shook 
her frame.  At length the paroxysm passed, and she subsided into a natural 
sleep. Change of scene did not affect these exercises, but the 
administration of opium would interrupt them.  Her trance discourses were 
after-wards published.

Smith Helene : The nom-de-guerre of a trance medium who came under the 
observation of Professor Flournoy. Born about 1863, at the age of twenty-
nine she joined a spiritual-ist circle and soon developed powerful 
mediumistic faculties. In 1894 M. Flournoy was admitted to the circle and 
thence-forward examined with much interest the clairvoyance and trance 
impersonations of Helene.  In the winter of 1894 she purported to have 
visited, during trance, the planet Mars, and many of her trance discourses 
after that date contain descriptions of Martian life-manners, dress, 
scenery.  At length she claimed to have learned the language of the sister-
planet, and this language she spoke with fluency and consistency.  (See 
Martian Language.)  Professor Flournoy however, found no evidence sufficient 
to justify any belief in a supernormal faculty, unless it be telepathy.

Sneezing, Superstitions Relating to : It is said that the custom of blessing 
one who sneezes originated in Italy in the time of Gregory the Great, during 
a pestilence which proved mortal to those who sneezed.  A still older date 
is given to this custom by some writers, who state that sneezing was fatal 
from the time of Adam to that of Jacob, when the latter begged that its 
fatal effects might be removed.  On his request being granted, the people 
grate-fully instituted the custom of saluting the sneezer.  In some diseases 
sneezing was a bad, in others a good omen. Sneezing to the right was lucky, 
to the left, unlucky; from noon to midnight good, from night to noon, bad.  
St. Austin says that the ancients would return to bed if they sneezed while 
putting on a shoe.

the pupils of F. A. Mesmer.  The first Societe de 1’ Harmonie was formed at 
Paris, and its members seem to have acted in a manner that was anything but 
harmonious, for, after some quarrelling among themselves they at length 
broke their contract with Mesmer, whereby they promised before being 
admitted to his lectures, that they would not practice on their own account, 
or give away the secret of his methods, without his consent.  Other 
Societies of Harmony soon sprang up, the most important being that of 
Strasbourg, founded in 1785 by de Puysegur.

Solar Deity : (See Theosophy.)


Solar System  Theosophists have special doctrines as to the formation of 
solar systems.  They start by postulating the existence of all pervading 
ether, or, as it is termed in occult chemistry (q.v.) koilon an ether which 
is quite impercepti-ble to ordinary senses and indeed even to clairvoyants 
except the most highly-developed.  It is, despite its diffusion, of extreme 
density.  The Deity intending to create a universe invests this ether with 
his divine force, whereupon it becomes the constituent of matter in the 
shape of minute drops or bubbles, and of this the universe with its solar 
systems is formed.  First a mass is aggregated by the appropriate agitation 
of these drops, and to this mass is imparted a rotatory motion. The mass 
thus formed, of course, contains the matter from which will be formed all 
the seven worlds, the existence of which Theosophy teaches, and it may be 
well here to observe that these worlds are not separate in the manner we 
usually conceive separate worlds to be, but inter-penetrate each other.  The 
sub-stance in its original form is of the texture of the first world, and in 
order to create the texture of the second-and lower-world the Deity sets up 
a vast number of rotatory agitations into each of which is collected 49 
atoms arranged in a certain way, sufficient of the first atom having been 
left to form the first world.  This process continues six times, the atoms 
of the succeeding lower worlds being formed from those of the world 
immediately higher and each time of a multiple of 49 atoms.  Gradually and 
with the passing of long ages, the aggregation, which contains the atoms of 
all seven worlds completely inter-mingled, contracts and becomes more 
closely knit until it forms a nebula which eventually attains the fiat, 
circular form familiar to students of astronomy.  Towards the centre it is 
much more dense than at the fringes, and in the process of flattering and 
because of the initial revolving motion, rings ‘are formed encircling the 
centre.  From these rings the planets are formed, and after the further 
passing of ages, it is possible for human life to exist on them.  The 
various worlds as has been said, penetrate each other substantially within 
the same bounds, the exceptions being the worlds of finer texture which 
extend beyond those relatively more dense.  The names of the worlds are: the 
first which has not as yet been experienced by man-the Divine; the second, 
the Monadic whence come the impulses that form man; the third, the 
Spiritual, the highest world which man has as yet been able to experience ; 
the fourth, the Intuitional, the fifth, the Mental; the sixth, the Emotional 
(Astral) world ; and the seventh is the world of matter as matter is 
familiar to us. Reference is made to the various articles dealing more fully 
with these worlds as follows :-

Solomon : The connection of Solomon, son of David, the King of Israel, with 
magical practice, although it does not possess any Biblical authority, has 
yet a very considerable body of oriental tradition behind it.  It is 
supposed, however, that the Jewish Solomon has in many cases been confounded 
with a still older and mythical figure.  Then the Arabs and Persians have 
legends of a prehistoric race who were ruled by seventy-two monarchs of the 
name of Suleiman, of whom the last reigned one thousand years. It does not 
seem," says Yarker, " that these Suleimans who are par excellence the rulers 
of all Djinn, Afreets and other elemental spirits, bear any relationship to 
the Israelite King."  The name, he says, is found in that of a god of the 
Babylonians and the late Dr. Kenealy, the translator of Hafiz, says that the 
earliest Aryan teachers were named Mohn, Bodles or Solymi, and that Suleiman 
was an ancient title of royal power, synonymous with Sultan" or " Pharaoh."  
A Persian legend states that in the mountains of Kaf, which can only be 
reached by the magic ring of Solomon, there is a gallery built by the giant 
Arzeak, where one kept the statues of a race who were ruled by the Suleiman 
or wise Kings of the East. There is a great chair or throne of Solomon hewn 
out of the solid rock, on the confines of the Afghanistan and India called 
the 
Takht-i-Suleiman or throne of Solomon, its ancient Aryan name being Shanker 
Acharga. It is to these older Suleiman’s then, that we must probably look 
for a connection with the tradition of occultism, and it is not unlikely 
that the le-gend relating to Solomon and his temple have been confused with 
these, and that the protagonists of the antiquity of Free-masonry, who date 
their cult from the building of Solomon’s Temple, have confounded some still 
older rite or mystery relating to the ancient dynasty of Suleiman with the 
circum-stances of the masonic activities of the Hebrew monarch.
     “God," says Josephus, " enabled Solomon to learn that skill which 
expels daemons, which is a science useful and sanative to men.  He composed 
such incantations, also, by which distempers are alleviated, and he left 
behind him the manner of using exorcisms, by which they drive away daemons, 
so that they never return.  And this method of cure is of great force unto 
this day; for I have seen a certain man of my own country, whose name was 
Eleazar, releasing people that were daemoniacal, in the presence of 
Vespasian and his sons, and his captains, and the whole multitude of his 
soldiers.  The manner of the cure was this.  He put a ring that had a root 
of one of these sorts mentioned by Solomon to the nostrils ; and when the 
man fell down immediately, he adjured him to return unto him no more, making 
still mention of Solomon, and reciting the incantations which he composed.  
And when Eleazar would persuade and demonstrate to the spectators that he 
had such a power, he set, a little way off, a cup, or basin full of water, 
and commanded the daemon as he went out of the man, to overturn it, and 
thereby to let the spectators know that he had left the man."  Some 
pretended fragments of these conjuring books of Solomon are noticed in the" 
Codex Pseudepigraphus" of Fabricius, and Josephus himself has described one 
of the anti-daemoniacal roots, which must remind the reader of the perils 
atten-dant on gathering the " mandrake."
     The Koran alleges that Solomon had power over the winds, and that he 
rode on his throne throughout the world during the day, and the wind brought 
it back every night to Jerusalem. This throne was placed on a carpet of 
green silk, of a prodigious length and breadth, and sufficient to afford 
standing-room to all Solomon’s army, the men on his right hand and the Jinn 
on his left.  An army of the most beautiful birds hovered near the throne, 
forming a kind of canopy over it, and the attendants, to screen the king and 
his soldiers from the sun.  A certain number of
evil spirits were also made subject to him, whose business it was to dive 
for pearls, and perform other work. We are also informed, on the same 
authority, that the devils, having received permission to tempt Solomon, in 
which they were not successful, conspired to ruin his character. They wrote 
several books of magic, and hid them under his throne; and when he died they 
told the chief men among the Jews that if they wished to ascertain the 
manner in which Solomon obtained his absolute power over men, Genii, and the 
winds, they should dig under his throne. They did so and found the books, 
abounding with the most impious superstitions. The more learned and 
enlightened refused to participate in the practices described in those 
books, but they were willingly adopted by the common people.  The Mahomedans 
assert that the Jewish priests published this scandalous story concerning 
Solomon, which was believed till Mahomet, by God’s command, declared him to 
have been no idolater.
     Solomon, it is further maintained by the Mahomedans, brought a thousand 
horses from Damascus and other cities he conquered, though some say they 
were left to him by his father David, who seized them from the Amalekites; 
and others pretend that they came out of the Red Sea, and were provided with 
wings. The King wished to inspect his horses, and ordered them to be paraded 
before him; and their symmetry and beauty so much occupied his attention 
that he gazed on them after sunset, and thus neglected evening prayers till 
it was too late. When sensible of his omission, he was so greatly concerned 
at it that he ordered all the horses to be killed as an offering to God, 
except a hundred of the best of them.  This, we are informed, procured for 
him an ample recompense, as he received for the loss of his horses dominion 
over the winds.
     The following tradition is narrated by the Mahomedan commentators 
relative to the building of the temple of Jerusalem. According to them, 
David laid the foundations of it, and when he died he left it to be finished 
by Solomon. That prince employed Jinn, and not men, in the work; and this 
idea might probably originate from what is said in the First Book of Kings 
(vi., 7) that the Temple was " built of stone, made ready before it was 
brought thither, so that there was neither hammer, nor axe, nor any tool of 
iron, heard in the house while it was building" ; and the Rabbins notice a 
worm which, they pretend, assisted the workmen, the power of which was such 
as to cause the rocks and stones to separate in chiselled blocks.  Solomon, 
while engaged in the erection of the Temple, found his end approaching, and 
he prayed that his death might be con-cealed from the Jinn till the building 
was finished. His request was granted. He died while in the act of praying, 
and leaning on his staff, which supported his body in that posture for a 
whole year, and the Jinn, who supposed him to be still alive, continued 
their work. At the expiration of the year the edifice was completed, when a 
worm which had entered the staff, ate it through. and to the amazement even 
of the Jinn the body fell to the ground, and the King was discovered to be 
dead.
     The inhabitants of the valley of Lebanon believe that the celebrated 
city and temple of Baalbec were erected by the Jinn under Solomon’s 
direction. The object of the erection of baalbec is variously stated, one 
tradition affirm-ing that it was intended to be a residence for the Egyptian 
princess whom Solomon married, and another that it was built for the Queen 
of Sheba.


Solomon Ibn Gabirol (1021-1055): Spanish-Hebrew poet and mystic philosopher. 
He was a Neoplatonist, but at the same time subscribed to the mystical 
doctrine which states that the Deity can only be regarded as a negation of 
all attributes. This he considered essential to the preser-vation of the 
Jewish monotheism.


Solomon, Mirror of: The method of making the Mirror of Solomon, which is 
used for purposes of divination, is as follows: Take a shining and well-
polished plate of fine steel, slightly concave, and with the blood of a 
white pigeon inscribe at the four corners the names-Jehovah, Eloym, 
Metatron, Adonay.  Place the mirror in a clean and white cloth, and when you 
behold a new moon during the first hour after sunset, repeat a prayer that 
the angel Anael may command and ordain his companions to act as they are 
instructed ; that is, to assist the operator in divining from the mirror. 
Then cast upon burning coals a suitable perfume, at the same time uttering a 
prayer. Repeat this thrice, then breathe upon the mirror and evoke the angel 
Anael. The sign of the cross is then made upon the operator and upon the 
mirror for forty-five days in succession-at the end of which period Anael 
appears in the form of a beautiful child to accomplish the operator’s 
wishes.  Sometimes he appears on the fourteenth day, according to the 
devotion and fervour of the operator. The perfume used in evoking him is 
saffron.

Somnambulism : (Latin, somnus, sleep, and ambulare, to walk.) The condition 
in which walking, talking, and actions of a more complicated character are 
performed during sleep, without the agent’s consciousness or after 
recollection. The somnambulist may have his eyes closed, and ears deaf to 
auditory impressions or sense impressions. without waking in him any gleam 
of consciousness. This may have some effect in rousing new trains of 
association and suggesting a new line of action.  It is suggested that the 
sleep-walker may see only a mental picture of what he is doing-that is, a 
dream-and not the objective reality, and certain experimental tests have 
proved that this occurs in some cases at least.  Somnambulism admits of many 
varying degrees. Its mildest form is typified in the inarticu-late 
murmurings or vague gestures of a dreaming child, while in the most extreme 
cases where all the senses are active, and the actions apparently as 
purposive as in the normal waking state, it borders on the condition of 
spon-taneous hypnotism. Indeed its affinity with hypnosis was early 
recognised, when the hypnotic subjects of the mag-netists were designated 
somnambules. It is remarkable that somnambulists may walk in dangerous paths 
with perfect safety, but if they are suddenly awakened they are liable to 
fall. Spontaneous somnambulism generally indicates some morbid tendency of 
the nervous system, since, as a rule, only in some abnormal state could the 
dream ideas exercise so exciting an influence on the brain as to rouse to 
activity centres normally controlling volun-tary movements.


Sorcery : (From Latin sortiarius, one who practices divina-tion by lots.) 
The use of supposed supernatural power by the agency of evil spirits called 
forth by spells by a witch or black magician.  (See Magic.)



Sorrel-leaf : A sorrel-leaf was sometimes used to bewitch people, as in the 
case of the Irish Witch mentioned in George Sinclair’s Satan’s Invisible 
World Displayed, who gave to a girl a leaf of sorrel, which the child put 
into her mouth.  Great torture ensued for the child, such tortures being 
increased on the approach of the witch.


Sortilege, or divination by lots, is one of the most ancient and common 
superstitions.  We find it used among the Oriental nations to detect a 
guilty person, as when Saul by this means discovered that Jonathan had 
disobeyed his command by taking food, and when the sailors by a similar 
process found Jonah to be the cause of the tempest by which they were 
overtaken. The methods of using the lot have been very numerous, such as 
Rhabdomancy, Clidomancy, the Sortes Sagittariae, otherwise Belomancy, and 
the common casting of dice. The following are the more classical
     Sortes Thriaecae, or Thriaean lots, were chiefly used in Greece ; they 
were pebbles or counters distinguished by certain characters which were cast 
into an urn, and the first that came out was supposed to contain the right 
direction. This form of divination received its name from the 
Thrise, three nymphs supposed to have nursed Apollo, and to have invented 
this mode of predicting futurity.
     Sortes Viales, or street and road lots, were used both in Greece and 
Rome,  The person that was desirous to learn his fortune carried with him a 
certain number of lots, distinguished by several characters or inscriptions, 
and walking to and fro in the public ways desired the first boy whom he met 
to draw, and the inscription on the lot thus drawn was received as an 
infallible prophecy.  Plut-arch declares that this form of divination was 
derived from the Egyptians, by whom the actions and words of boys were 
carefully observed as containing in them some-thing prophetical. Another 
form of the Sortes Viales was exhibited by a boy, but sometimes by a man, 
who posted himself in a public place to give responses to all comers. He was 
provided with a tablet, on which certain fatidical verses were written  when 
consulted, he cast dice on the tablet, and the verses on which they fell 
were supposed to contain the proper direction.  Sometimes instead of tablets 
they had urns, in which the fatidical verses were thrown, written upon slips 
of parchment. The verse drawn out was received as a sure guide and 
direction. To this custom Tibullus alludes
     Thrice in the streets the sacred lots she threw, And thrice the boy a 
happy omen drew.
      This form of divining was often practised with the Sibylline oracles, 
and was hence named 
Sortes Sibyllina.
     Sortes Prenestinae, or the Prenestine lots, were used in Italy; the 
letters of the alphabet were placed in an urn and shaken; they were then 
turned Out upon the floor, and the words which they accidentally formed were 
received as omens. This superstitious use of letters is still common in 
Eastern nations. The Mussulmans have a divining table, which they say was 
invented by the prophet Edris or Enoch.  It is divided into a hundred little 
squares, each of which contains a letter of the Arabic alphabet. The person 
who consults it repeats three times the opening chapter of the Koran, and 
the 57th verse of the 6th chapter:
“With Him are the keys of the secret things ; none knoweth them but Him ; He 
knoweth whatever is on the dry ground, or in the sea: there falleth no leaf 
but He knoweth it ; neither is there a single grain in the dark parts of the 
earth, nor a green thing, nor a dry thing, but it is written in a 
perspicuous book."  Having concluded this recitation, he averts his head 
from the table and places his finger upon it ; lie then looks to see upon 
what letter his finger is placed, writes that letter ; the fifth following 
it; the fifth following that again; and so on until he comes back to the 
first he had touched: the letters thus collected form the answer.
     Sortes Homericae and Sortes Virgilianae, divination by opening some 
poem at hazard, and accepting the passage which first turns up as an answer. 
This practice probably arose from the esteem which poets had among the 
ancients, by whom they were reputed divine and inspired persons. Homer’s 
works among the Greeks had the most credit, but the tragedies of Euripides 
and other celebrated poems were occasionally used for the same purpose.  The 
Latins chiefly consulted Virgil, and many curious coincidences are related 
by grave historians, between the prediction and the event; thus, the 
elevation of Severus to the empire is supposed to have been foretold by his 
opening at this verse:-

“Remember, Roman, with imperial sway 
to rule the nations.”

It is said that Charles I. and Lord Falkland made trial of the Virgilian 
lots a little before the commencement of the great civil war. The former 
opened at that passage in the fourth book of the AEneid where Dido predicts 
the violent death of her faithless lover ; the latter at the lamentation of 
Evander over his son in the eleventh book; if the story be true, the 
coincidences between the responses and events are among the most remarkable 
recorded.
     Sortes Biblicae, divination by the Bible, which the early Christians 
used instead of the profane poets. Nicephorus Gregoras recommends the 
Psalter as the fittest book for the purpose, but Cedrenus informs us that 
the New Testa-ment was more commonly used. St. Augustine denounces this 
practice in temporal affairs, but declares in one of his letters that he had 
recourse to it in all cases of spiritual difficulty. Another form of the 
Biblical lots is to go to a place of worship, and take as an omen the first 
passage of Scripture read by the minister, or the text from which he 
preaches. This is no uncommon practice in modern times, and it is frequently 
vindicated by persons who ought to know better,
     The Mussulmans consult the Koran in a similar manner, but they deduce 
their answer from the seventh line of the right-hand page.  Others count how 
often the letters kha and shin occur in the page; if kha (the first letter 
of kheyr, "good") predominate, the answer is deemed favourable; but if shin 
(the first letter of shin " evil") be more frequent, the inference is that 
the projects of the inquirer are forbidden or dangerous.
     It would be easy to multiply examples of these efforts to obtain 
guidance from blind chance; they were once so frequent, that it was deemed 
necessary to denounce them from the pulpit as being clearly forbidden by the 
divine precept, "Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God."

Spain: Witchcraft.-From early times Spain was regarded as the special abode 
of superstition, and in the middle ages as the home of sorcery and magic, 
probably because of the immense notoriety given to the discoveries of the 
Moorish alchemists.  (See Moors.) The Inquisition quickly took root in the 
country, and reaped a rich harvest among Jews, Moriscos, and superstitious 
Christians.
     Alfonso de Spina. a Franciscan of Castille, where the Inquisition was 
not then established, wrote, about the year 1458 or 1460, a work especially 
directed against heretics and unbelievers, in which he gives a chapter on 
these articles of popular belief which were derived from the ancient 
heathendom of the people.  Among these, witches, under the name of Xurguine 
(jurgina) or bruxe, held a prominent place.
     He tells us that in his time these offenders abounded in Dauphiny and 
Gascony, where they assembled in great numbers by night on a wild table 
land, carrying candles with them, to worship Satan, who appeared in the form 
of a boar on a certain rock, popularly known by the name Elboch de Biterne, 
and that many of them had been taken by the inquisition of Toulouse and 
burnt.  From that time we find, in Spanish history, the charge of witchcraft 
and sorcery not infrequently brought forward under different forms and 
circumstances, of which several remark-able examples are given by Llorente 
in his History of the Inquisition in Spain.
     The first auto-da-fi against sorcery appears to have been that of 
Calahorra, in 1507, when thirty women, charged before the inquisition as 
witches, were burnt.  In 1527. a great number of women were accused in 
Navarre of the practice of sorcery, through the information of two girls,
one of eleven, the other only of nine years old, who con-fessed before the 
royal council of Navarre that they had been received into the sect of the 
jurginas, and promised on condition of being pardoned, to discover all the 
women who were implicated in these practices.
     The moment the attention of the inquisition was thus drawn to the crime 
of sorcery, the prevalence of this super-stition in the Basque provinces 
became notorious ; and Charles V., rightly judging that it was to be 
attributed more to the ignorance of the population of those districts than 
to any other cause, directed that preachers should be sent to instruct them.
     The first treatise in the Spanish language on the subject of sorcery, 
by a Franciscan monk named Martin de Cas-tanaga, was printed under 
approbation of the bishop of Calahorra in 1529.  About this time the zeal of 
the inquisi-tors of Saragossa was excited by the appearance of many witches 
who were said to have come from Navarre, and to have been sent by their sect 
as missionaries to make disciples of the women of Arragon.  This sudden 
witch-persecution in Spain appears to have had an influence on the fate of 
the witches of Italy.  Pope Adrian IV., who was raised to the papal chair in 
1522, was a Spanish bishop, and had held the office of inquisitor-general in 
Spain. In the time of Julius II., who ruled the papal world from 1503 to 
1513, a sect of witches and sorcerers had been discovered in Lombardy, who 
were extremely numerous, and had their Sabbaths and all the other 
abominations of the continental witches. The proceedings against them appear 
to have been hindered by a dispute between the inquisitors and the 
ecclesiastical judges who claimed the jurisdiction in such cases. On the 
20th July, 1523, pope Adrian issued a bull against the crime of sorcery, 
placing it in the sole juris-diction of the inquisitors. This bull perhaps 
gave the new impulse to the prosecution of the witches in Spain.
     Of the cases which followed during more than a century, the most 
remarkable was that of the auto-da-fe at Logrono on the 7th and 8th of 
November, 1610, which arose in some measure from the visitation of the 
French Basque province in the preceding year. The valley of Bastan is 
situated at the foot of the Pyrenees, on the French Frontier, and at no 
great distance from Labourd. It was within the jurisdiction of the 
inquisition established at Logrono in Castille. The mass of the population 
of this valley appear to have been sorcerers, and they held their meetings 
or Sabbaths at a place called Zugarramurdi.
     A woman who was condemned implicated a number of other persons.  All 
the persons arrested on this occasion agreed in their description of the 
Sabbath, and of the practices of the witches, which in their general 
features bore a close resemblance to those of the witches of Labourd.  The 
usual place of meeting was known here, as in Labourd, by the popular name of 
Aquelarre, a Gascon word, signifying the meadow of the goat. Their ordinary 
meetings were held on the nights of Monday, Wednesday and Friday, every 
week, but they had grand feasts on the principal holidays of the church, 
such as Easter, Pentecost, Christ-mas, etc., All these feasts appear to have 
been fixed by the Christian teachers at the period of older pagan festivals.
     The accounts of their Sabbaths are entirely similar to those given of 
such meetings elsewhere. They danced, sang took part in the most horrible 
orgies, and came into personal contact with Satan.
     The auto-da-fe of Logrono, as far as it related to the sect of the 
sorcerers of Zugarramurdi, caused a great sen-sation, and brought the 
subject of witchcraft under the consideration of the Spanish theologians. 
These were so far more enlightened than the body of their contemporaries in 
other countries, that they generally leant to the opinion that witchcraft 
was a mere delusion, and that the details of the confessions of the 
miserable creatures who were its victims were all creations of the 
imagination.  They were punished because their belief was a heresy, contrary 
to the doctrines of the church.  Llorente gives the abstract of a treatise 
on this subject by a Spanish ecclesiastic named Pedro de Valentia, addressed 
to the grand inquisitor in consequence of the trial at Logrono in 1610, and 
which remained in manuscript among the archives of the inquisi-tion.
     This writer adopts entirely the opinion that the acts confessed by the 
witches were imaginary  he attributed them partly to the methods in which 
the examinations were carried on, and to the desire of the ignorant people 
examined to escape by saying what seemed to please their persecutors, and 
partly to the effects of the ointments and draughts which they had been 
taught to use, and which were composed of ingredients that produced sleep, 
and acted upon the imagination and the mental faculties.
     Spiritualism.-A writer in the Religious Philosophical Journal says    
The language that furnishes the largest number of periodicals devoted to the 
dissemination of the doctrine and philosophy of modern Spiritualism, is the 
Spanish. This statement will be somewhat surprising to many of our readers, 
for we have been accustomed to look upon the Spaniards as non-progressive 
and conservative in the extreme.  Spain, until a few years, has always been 
intolerant of any religions except the Roman Catholic, and was the latest of 
European nations to yield to the spirit of religious progress.  
Protestantism has with the greatest difficulty obtained a foothold in that 
country within the last few years, but it has been attended with annoying 
restrictions and persecutions, while its progress has been exceedingly slow 
and discouraging.
     Spiritualism in Spain commenced, as in many other lands, with a series 
of disturbances, which took place in a family residing in the outskirts of 
Cadiz.  Stone-throwing, bell--ringing, and other preternatural annoyances 
were the first means of awakening attention to the subject, and as they 
occurred at the house of a Spanish gentleman who had just returned from the 
United States, full of the marvels of the Rochester knocking’s," circles 
were at once formed, intelligent responses by rappings obtained, and a foot-
hold gained, upon which the edifice of Spiritual progress was upreared.  So 
rapidly did the interest thus awakened spread, that the first promulgators 
were soon lost sight of, and as early as 1854, a society was formed at 
Cadiz, which was organised for the sole purpose of publishing the com-
munications received from  the Spirits"  during two preceding years.  From 
1854 to 1860, Spiritualism spread through the principal towns and villages 
of Spain in the usual fashion.  Circles were held in private families, and 
an endless number of  societies" were formed and dis-solved, according to 
the exigencies of the time.  One of the first public events of note in 
connection with Spanish Spiritualism, was of so remarkable a character, that 
it deserves special mention. This was no other than an Auto-da-fe, the only 
difference between the occasion under consideration and the fiery executions 
of olden times being, that the victims were formerly human beings, whereas 
in the present instance, they were all the books, pamphlets, and works of a 
Spiritualistic character that could be procured at that period of the 
movement.  Amongst the pile thus offered up on the altar of religious 
enlightenment - were the writings of Kardec Dufau, Grand, and Gulden-stubbe; 
some copies of English and American Spiritual papers, and a large collection 
of tracts issued by the Spirit-ualists of Spain.  This memorable scene 
occurred on the morning of the 9th of October, 1861, at the Esplanade Bar-
celona.
     Among the well-know residents of Barcelona, was a Senor Navarez, whose 
daughter, Rosa, had for many years been the subject of spasmodic attacks, 
called by the Catholic clergy   the obsession of demons "-by the medical 
faculty, an aggravated condition of epilepsy. Within two years after the 
Auto-da-fi, Rosa was pronounced entirely cured, by the magnetic passes of a 
gentleman who was the medium of the private circle held in the city, Shortly 
after this, Barcelona could boast of its well-approved Spiritual organs, 
numerous societies for investi-gation, and several mediums, who from their 
exclusive positions in private life, would object to their names being 
mentioned,  The journal was published by Senior Alcan-tara, and was warmly 
supported by the Viscount de Torres Solanot, and numbers of other leaders of 
science and literature in Spain. By this publication the opponents of 
Spiritualism were amazed to learn of the immense pro-gress the cause was 
making, and the number of distin-guished persons who assembled nightly in 
circles to promote investigation. A circular calling the attention of the 
Spanish public to the phenomena of Spiritualism was published in 1875 by 
Viscount Solanot, The authors of this circular, met with no response worthy 
of their fraternal intentions.  It might have been difficult to define 
exactly what the Spanish brethren proposed to do or wished others to unite 
with them in doing; certain it is, that no tangible results could be 
expected to follow from a very transcen-dental address to the scattered 
ranks of a movement, whose motto might well be Liberty, Inequality, and 
Disintegra-tion:   Our Spanish friends mean well, but is it possible there 
can be unity enough amongst them to send a delega-tion to America ? " asked 
one of the shrewdest on perusing this grandiloquent circular.  Nothing 
daunted by the impossibility of getting an international representation 
worthy of the cause at Philadelphia, the energetic Viscount Solanot again 
agitated the subject previous to the Paris Exposition of 1878.  In the 
articles written for El Criteno on this proposition, the Viscount names 
amongst those societies of Spiritualists prepared to promote an Interna-
tional representation, "La Federation Espirita," of Belgium; The British 
National Association of Spiritualists," England; " La Sociedad Central 
Espirita," of the Republic of Mexico; and " El Central General del 
Espiritismo." Notice is also taken, and with a hope of its ultimate 
success,- of the attempt to form a national association and unite all the 
discordant elements under the one broad banner of simple Spiritualism.
     Magnetism and Mediumistic Science.-In Spain as in Italy, a considerable 
amount of attention has been directed towards the unfoldment of Mediumistic 
power by means of Magnetism. Magnetic Societies abounded in Spain up to 
within the last few years, when many elements of internal discord prevailed 
in the ranks, and succeeded in dissolving the bonds which had united 
flourishing associations. Amongst the amateur mesmerists of Spain may be 
men-tioned Don Juan Escudero, of Madrid, a gentleman who having witnessed 
some experiments in "animal magnet-ism " in California, tried its effect in 
his own family with success.
     Among the numerous circles or " groups" formed in the different parts 
of Spain for the study of Spiritualism and its phenomena, was one of long 
standing at Tarragona called ‘ The Christian Circle," Quite recently the 
Presi-dent of this circle sent the following communication to the Revue 
Spirite of Paris :-" The convict prison here in Tarragona has 800 inmates 
sentenced to forced labour By some means, Spiritualistic books have been 
introduced among the prisoners. The circulation of these books among them 
has been the means of bringing seventy or eighty of them to be believers in 
our doctrine. These converts have ceased to regard their miserable position 
from their old point of view; they no longer entertain schemes of revolt 
against the authorities. They endure their lot with resignation under the 
influence of the teach-ing that this world is hut a preliminary stage to 
another, where, if repentant of the ill they have done, and seeking the good 
of others, they will be better off than here.  " Not long since one of these 
men died; at his death he declined the established offices of the prison 
priest, on the ground that he was a Spiritualist and did not need them. The 
priest then discovered that Spiritualism was a subject of discussion with 
many of the prisoners. He made a repre-sentation of the matter to his 
bishop, who made formal complaint of it to the commandant of the prison, and 
the commandant made an investigation. In the end a particu-lar prisoner was 
selected for punishment in the form of an additional weight of fetters.  
This coming to the know-ledge of the Spiritualists of Tarragona, Barcelona, 
and Lerida, they had a meeting upon the subject and delegated one of their 
number, a man of position, to interview the commandant. The representations 
which he made, led the commandant to cancel his order as to the additional 
fetters. The bishop’s censure against spiritualist books placed them under 
prohibition, which was maintained. It is known, however, that although never 
found by gaolers, the books are still there."
     In April, 1881, the editor of the Madrid El Criteno says :-that great 
progress has been made in the cause of Spiritualism; that the hall of 
meeting of the Spiritual Society is completely full every Thursday evening,’ 
and is not now large enough ‘ to hold the public who come to the sessions,’ 
that Dr. Merschejewski has called the atten-tion of the University of St. 
Petersburg to a psychometric phenomena of much importance; to wit: A young 
man deemed from childhood to be an idiot, who will in some seconds solve any 
mathematical problem, while if a poem be read to him, even of many hundred 
verses, he will repeat the whole of it without failing in a single word." 
Senor Manuel Lopez in the same issue of El Criteno says, speaking of the 
progress of a society of Spiritualists in Madrid :-" We have received a 
mediumistic work of extraordinary merit, executed by a medium of the 
‘Society of Spiritualists’ of Zaragoza. It consists of a portrait of Isabel 
the Catholic, made with a pencil, and is a work truly admirable.  It is said 
by intelligent persons who have examined it to be an exact copy of one 
preserved in the Royal Museum of Painters of this court.  Many thanks are 
tendered to the Zaragozan Society for this highly appre-ciated present.  It 
was about the end of the year  1880, that the Spiritualists of Spain 
sustained another series of attacks from the Church. The first of these was 
the refusal of the clergy to accord the customary rites of interment to the 
remains of two ladies, both of irreproachable character, and good standing 
in society, but both ‘ guilty" of having believed in Spiritual 
manifestations.  The second raid which the Church in Spain perpetrated about 
this time to the prejudice of the Spiritualists, was the suppression of a 
well-written Spiritual paper published at Lerida, entitled El Buen Sentido. 
The Bishop of Lerida had long threatened this step, and warned the editor to 
beware how he presumed to allow any writings reflecting upon clerical doings 
to appear in his columns.  As some of the principal contributors were Madame 
Soler, Mdlle. Sans, Don Murillo, and others equally capable of arraigning 
the intolerant acts which Church policy seemed determined to push against 
the Spiritualists, it was scarcely likely that the Bishop’s threats would 
produce much effect. The last article which seemed to inflame the clergy to 
retaliate was an indignant protest which appeared in the columns of this 
paper on the condemnation of a working man to three years imprison-ment, 
leaving a family of children destitute and all for speaking in public 
against the intolerance of the Church. 
     In a number of El Criterio, dated 1881, is a letter from Don Migueles, 
in which he gives a somewhat discouraging account of  the cause " as it 
recently existed in Spain. The editor says :-  “Don Migueles visited many 
cities to examine into the state of affairs of a spiritual nature, hut found 
many who were only to be enticed by physical phenomena. caring nothing for 
the esoteric beauties of our faith  many who were convinced that they knew 
all there was to be known concerning it, and others who were timid fearing 
the disapproval of neighbours.  In some places, however, excellent mediums 
were discovered.  In Santiago, in Oviedo, in Corunna and Valladolid, an 
exceptional interest was manifest.  Near Santiago, there was a young girl 
possessed of wonderful faculties.  Two bars of mag-netized iron held over 
her horizontally, half a metre distant, were sufficient to suspend her body 
in the air.  " The proceedings of the Spanish Society, under the name of the 
Sesiones le Controvesio, in the month of April last, are spoken of in the 
Critic as markedly impressive on account of the lofty sentiments maintained 
throughout the discussions, by the various speakers.  - In the past month 
were given also very interesting conferencias by our illustrious brothers, 
the Sres. Rebolledo and Huelbes.  The able engineer and inventor, belonging 
to the Society of Santiago de Chili and founder of that of Lima, D. R. 
Caruana y Berard, has just arrived in Madrid.  Tne Revista Espiritista of 
Barcelona mentions the visit which its editor has made to the central 
societies of Spiritualists of Sabodell and Tarrasa, where a great number of 
brethren were assembled on the occasion, and which will result in great good 
to the doctrine."  The Barcelona Lux, of date 1881, gives encouraging 
accounts of seances held at Cordova, Tarragona, Seville, and many other 
places. The editor, Madame Soler, also refers to the prohibition to 
Catholics, by an archbishop to have or to read the Spiritualistic work of 
Niram Aliv : of the" Society of Spiritualists " of Tarrasa  of the circle of 
Santa Cruz of Tenerif; of that of " Faith, Hope, and Charity," of Andujar, 
and of St. Vincent de Bogota.


Speal Bone, Divination by : A form of divination used in Scotland.  A speal 
bone, or blade bone of a shoulder of mutton is used, but details of the 
method are wanting.  A common soldier, accompanying Lord Loudon on his 
retreat to Skye, told the issue of the battle of Culloden at the very moment 
it was decided, pretending to have seen the event by looking through the 
bone.


Speers, Dr. : (See Moses, William Stainton.)



Spells : Spells, incantations, a written or spoken formula of words supposed 
to be capable of magical effects. 
     Anglo-Saxon spel, a saying or story, hence a form of words  Icelandic, 
spjall, a saying ; Gothic, spilt, a fable.
     The conception of spells appears to have arisen in the idea that there 
is some natural and intimate connection between words and the things 
signified by them.  Thus if one repeats the name of a supernatural being the 
effect will be analogous to that produced by the being itself.  It is 
assumed that all things are in sympathy, and act and react upon one another, 
things that have once been in contact continue to act on each other even 
after the con-tact has been removed.  That certain names unknown to man, of 
gods, demi-gods. and demons, if discovered can be used against them by the 
discoverer, was believed in Ancient Egypt.  Spells or enchantments can be 
divided into several classes as follows : (1) Protective spells  (2) the 
curse or taboo; (3) Spells by which a person, animal or object is to be 
injured or transformed ; (4) Spells to pro-cure some minor end, or love-
spells, the curing of persons and cattle, etc.
     The power of the spoken word is implicitly believed in by all primitive 
peoples, especially if it emanates from a known professor of the art of 
magic, and if it be in a lan-guage or dialect unknown. Thus the magicians of 
Ancient Egypt employed foreign words for their incantations, such as 
Tharthar, thamara, thatha. mommon, thanabotha, opranu, brokhrex, 
abranazukhel," which occurs at the end of a spell the purpose of which is to 
bring dreams. The magicians and sorcerers of the middle ages likewise em-
ployed gibberish of a similar kind, as do the medicine men of the North 
American Indians at the present day. The reason for the spell being usually 
couched in a well-known formula, is probably because experience found that 
that and no other formula was efficacious. Thus in Ancient Egypt not only 
were the formulae of spells well fixed, but 1 he exact tone of voice in 
which they were to be pronounced was specially taught.  The power of a spell 
remains until such time as it is broken by an antidote or exorcism. 
Therefore it is not a passing thing.
(1) The protective spell.-The commonest form of this is an incantation, 
usually rhymed, imploring the protection of certain gods, saints, or 
beneficent beings, who in waking or sleeping hours will guard the speaker 
from maleficent powers, such as

"Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, 
Bless the bed that I lie on."

     Of a deeper significance are these supposed to be spoken by the dead 
Egyptian on his journey through Amenti by which he wards off the evil beings 
who would hinder his way, and so the serpent who would bite the dead is ad-
dressed thus: " O serpent come not! Geb and Shu stand against thee. Thou 
hast eaten mice. That is loathsome to the Gods. Thou hast gnawed the bones 
of a putrid cat." The Book of the Dead says, " Whoever readeth the spells 
daily over himself, he is whole- upon earth, he escapes from death, and 
never doth anything evil meet him," says Budge in Egyptian Magic, p.128.  
"We learn how great was the confidence which the deceased placed in his 
words of power, and also that the sources from which they sprang were the 
gods of Thoth and Isis.  It will be remembered the Thoth is called the " 
scribe of the gods," the " lord of writing," the "master of papyrus," the " 
maker of the palette and the ink-jar," the "lord of divine words," i.e., the 
holy writings or scriptures, and as he was the lord of books and master of 
the power of speech, he was con-sidered to be the possessor of all knowledge 
both human and divine.  At the creation of the world it was he who reduced 
to words the will of the unseen and unknown creative Power, and who uttered 
them in such wise that the universe came into being and it was he who proved 
himself by the exercise of his knowledge to be the protector and the friend 
of Osiris, and of Isis, and of their son Horus.  From the evidence of the 
texts we know that it was not by physical might that Thoth helped these 
three gods, but by giving them words of power and instructing them how to 
use them. We know that Osiris vanquished his foes, and that he re-
constituted his body and became the king of the under-world and god of the 
dead, but he was only able to do these things by means of the words of power 
which Thoth had given to him, and which he had taught him to pronounce 
properly and in a proper tone of voice.  It is this belief which makes the 
deceased cry out, " Hail, Thoth, who madest Osiris victorious over his 
enemies, make thou Ani to be victorious over his enemies in the presence of 
the great and sovereign princes who are in Tattu, or in any other place."  
Without the words of power given to him by Thoth, Osiris would have been 
powerless under the attacks of his foes, and similarly the dead man, who was 
always identified with Osiris, would have passed out of existence at his 
death but for the words of power provided by the writings that were buried 
with him.  In the Judgment Scene it is Thoth who reports to the gods the 
result of the weighing of the heart in the balance, and who has supplied its 
owner with the words which he has uttered in his suppli-cations, and 
whatever can be said in favour of the deceased he says to the gods, and 
whatever can be done for him he does,  But apart from being the protector 
and friend of Osiris, Thoth was the refuge to which Isis fled in her 
trouble.  The words of a hymn declare that she knew -“how to turn aside evil 
hap," and that she was -, strong of tongue and uttered the words of power 
which she knew with correct pronunciation, and halted not in her speech, and 
was perfect both in giving the command, and in saying the word," but this 
description only proves that she had been instructed by Thoth in the art of 
uttering words of power with effect, and to him, indeed, she owed more than 
this. Spells to keep away disease are of this class.
     The amulets found upon Egyptian mummies, and the inscriptions on 
Gnostic gems are for the most part of a protective nature.  (See Egypt and 
Gnostics.)  The pro-tective spell may be said to be an amulet ill words, and 
is often found in connection with the amulet, on which it is inscribed.
     (2) The curse or taboo.-(a) The word of blighting, the damaging word.  
(b) The word of prohibition or restriction.
     (a)	The curse is of the nature of a spell, even if it be not in 
the shape of a definite formula. Thus we have the Highland curses: -” A bad 
meeting to you."  "Bad under-standing to you."  -” A down mouth be yours" 
which are certainly popular as formulae.
     Those who had seen old women, of the Madge Wildfire School, cursing and 
banning, say their manner is well-calculated to inspire terror.  Some 
fifteen or twenty years ago, a party of tinkers quarrelled and fought, first 
among themselves, and then with some Tiree villagers.  In the excitement a 
tinker wife threw off her cap and allowed her hair to fall over her 
shoulders in wild disorder.  She then bared her knees, and falling on them 
to the ground, in a praying attitude, poured forth a torrent of wishes that 
struck awe into all who heard her.  She imprecated "Drowning by sea and 
conflagration by land; may you never see a son to follow your body to the 
graveyard, or a daughter to mourn your death.  I have made my wish before 
this, and I will make it now, and there was not yet a day I did not see my 
wish fulfilled." Curses employed by witches usually inferred a blight upon 
the person cursed, their flocks, their herds and crops. Barrenness, too, was 
frequently called down upon women. A person under a curse or spell is 
believed in the Scottish Highlands " to become powerless over his own 
volition, is alive and awake but moves and acts as if asleep." Curses or 
spells which inferred death were frequently mentioned in works which deal 
with Medieval Magic.  (See Summons by accused.)
     (b)	The Taboo, the word of prohibition or restriction. This is 
found in the mystic expression " thou shalt not." Thus a number of the 
commandments are taboos, and the Book of Leviticus teems with them. The 
taboo is the "don’t" applied to children-a curb on primitive desire. To 
break a taboo was to bring dire misfortune upon one-self, and often upon 
ones family.
      Of injuring or transformation of a person, animal or object there are 
copious examples. These were nearly affected by a spell of a given formula. 
Thus no less than twelve chapters of the Book of the Dead (chapters LXXVII. 
to LXXXVIII) are devoted to providing the deceased with words of power, the 
recital of which was necessary to enable him to transform himself into 
various animal and human forms. The Rev. S. Baring Gould in his Book of 
Folklore, page 57, says, that in such cases the consequence of a spell being 
cast on an individual requiring him or her to become a beast or a monster 
with no escape except under conditions difficult of execution or of 
obtaining. To this category belong a number of so-called fairy tales, that 
actually are folk-tales. And these do not all pertain to Aryan peoples for 
wherever magical arts are believed to be all-powerful, there one of it’s 
greatest achievements is the casting of a spell so as to alter completely 
the appear-ance of the person on whom it is cast, so that this individual 
becomes an animal. One need only recall the story in the Arabian Nights of 
the Calenders and the three noble ladies of Bagdad, in which the wicked 
sisters are trans-formed into bitches that have to be thrashed every day. Of 
this class are the stories of " Beauty and the Beast" and "The Frog Prince."
     (4)	Spells to procure some minor end, love-spells, etc., Love-
spells were engraved on metal tables by the Gnostics, and the magicians of 
the middle ages. Instances of these are to be found in The Book of the 
Sacred Magic of Abraham the Jew (q.v.)  Spells were often employed to 
imprison evil spirits.
     The later Jews have many extravagant opinions and legends relating to 
this subject, which they appear to have derived in a great measure from the 
Babylonians. Jose-phus affirms that it was generally believed by his 
country-men that Solomon left behind him many spells, which had the power of 
terrifying and expelling evil spirits. The Rabbins also almost uniformly 
describe Solomon. as an accomplished magician. It is probable that the 
belief in the power of spells and incantations became general among the Jews 
during the captivity, and that the invention of them is attributed to 
Solomon, as a more creditable per-sonage than the deities of the Assyrians. 
Those fictions acquired currency, not only among the Arabs, Persians, and 
other Mohammedan nations, but, in process of time, also in many Christian 
communities. They were first adopted by the Gnostics and similar sects, in 
whose creed heathenism preponderated over Christianity; and, in the dark 
ages, they found their way among the Catholics; principally by means of the 
Pseudo-gospels and fabulous legends of saints. An incident in the life of 
St. Margaret will suffice as a specimen. This holy virgin, having van-
quished an evil spirit who assaulted her, demanded his name, "My name," 
replied the demon, "is Veltis, and I am one of those whom Solomon, by virtue 
of his spells, confined in a copper caldron at Babylon; but when the 
Babylonians, in the hope of finding treasures, dug up the caldron and opened 
it, we all made our escape. Since that time, our efforts have been directed 
to the destruction of righteous persons; and I have long been striving to 
turn thee from the course which thou hast embraced." The reader of the 
"Arabian Nights Entertainments will be immediately reminded of the story of 
the "Fisherman." The Oriental origin of many similar legends, e.g., of St. 
George of Cappadocia, is equally obvious.

Spider: As an amulet. This insect, baked, was sometimes worn round the neck 
as a charm. Ellas Ashmole in his Diary says: "I took early in the morning a 
good dose of elixir, and hung three spiders about my neck, and they drove my 
ague away. Deo Gratias! "  Spiders and their webs were often recommended as 
a cure for this malady. Burton gives us the following tale: "Being in the 
country in the vacation time, not many years since, at Lindly in 
Leicestershire, my father’s house, I first observed this amulet of a spider 
in a nut-shell, wrapped in silk, so applied for an ague by my mother.  This 
I thought most absurd and ridiculous, and I could see no warrant in it     
till at length, rambling amongst authors, I found this very medicine in 
Dioscorides, approved by Matthiolus, repeated by Aldrovandus     I began to 
have a better opinion of it, and to give more credit to amulets, when I saw 
it in some parties answer to experience."


Spiegelschrift  Writing written backwards, from right to left, so as to be 
read in a mirror.  Automatic writing is frequently done in this way, and it 
is said that the ability to produce spiegelschrift is often found where 
there is a natural tendency to automatism.


Spirit in Theosophy, is the monad after he has manifested himself in the 
Spiritual, Intuitional and Mental Worlds in the aspects of Will, Intuition 
and Intellect respectively, but the term is often used to denote the monad 
in the aspect of Will only.  (See Monad and also the various articles on 
these Worlds.)

Spirit Photography: The production of photographs on which alleged spirit-
forms are visible. When the plate is develop-ed there appears, in addition 
to the likeness of the sitter, a shape resembling more or less distinctly 
the human form, which at the moment of exposure was imperceptible to the 
normal vision.  Spiritualists assert that there are photo-graphs of spirits-
the spirits of departed friends and relatives of the sitters-and that the 
presence of a medium is required to facilitate their production.  
Notwithstanding that on the recognition of the supposed spirit by the sitter 
and others rests the main evidence in favour of spirit photography, the 
"astral figure" is generally very vague and indistinct, with the head and 
shoulders enveloped in close-clinging draperies. The practice of spirit 
photography originated in America some fifty years ago, and has enjoyed a 
fitful existence to the present day. It was first intro-duced by Mumler, a 
Boston photographer, in 1862. Dr. Gardner, of the same city, was 
photographed by Mumler, and on the plate appeared an image which the sitter 
identified as his cousin, who had died twelve years before. Dr. Gardner 
published abroad his experience, and the new photography was at once adopted 
by spiritualists, who saw in it a means of proving their beliefs. In 1863, 
how-ever, Dr. Gardner discovered that in at least two instances a living 
model had sat for Mumler’s "spirit" pictures. Though he continued to believe 
that some of the photo-graphs might be genuine, his exposure of Mumler’s 
fraud effectively checked the movement for a time. After the lapse of six 
years Mumler appeared in New York, where the authorities endeavoured to 
prosecute him, but the evidence against him was insufficient to prove fraud, 
and he was acquitted.  Spirit photography had flourished in America for some 
ten years before it became known in Britain.  Mr. and Mrs. Guppy, the well-
known spiritualistic mediums, endeavoured without success to produce spirit 
photographs in private, and at length called in the aid of a professional 
photographer, Mr. Hudson. A photograph of Mr. Guppy now revealed a dim, 
draped "spirit" form. Hudson speedily became popular, and his studio was as 
largely patronized as Mumler’s had been. Mr. Thomas Slater, a London 
optician, made careful observations of his process without being able to 
detect any fraud. Mr. Beattie, a professional photographer, and something of 
a sceptic, made the following statement con-cerning Hudsons performances: 
"They were not made by double exposure, nor by figures projected in space in 
any way; they were not the result of mirrors  they were not produced by any 
machinery in the background, behind it, above it, or below it, nor by any 
contrivance connected with the bath, the camera, or the camera-slide."  Mr. 
Traill Taylor, editor of the British Journal of Photography said that "at no 
time during the preparation, exposure, or development of the pictures was 
Mr. Hudson within ten feet of the camera or dark room.  Appearances of an 
abnor-mal kind did certainly appear on several plates."     Such testimonies 
as the above, from the lips of skilled and dis-interested witnesses, would 
naturally seem to raise spins photography to the level of a genuine psychic 
phenomenon. But a careful analysis of the evidence, such as is given by Mrs. 
Sidgwick in her article on Spirit Photography in the Psychical Research 
Society’s Proceedings, vol. VII., will serve to show how even a trained 
investigator may be deceived by sleight-of-hand. And it is notable that Mr. 
Beattie himself afterwards pointed out instances of double exposure in 
Hudson’s productions. In spite of this, Hudson continued to practise, and 
the various spiritualist magazines continued to lend him their support, with 
the exception of the Spiritualist, whose editor, himself a practical 
photographer, had aided Mr. Beattie in the denunciation of spirit 
photography. Another enthusiastic spiritualist, Mr. Enmore Jones, who at 
first professed to recognise a dead daughter in one of the pictured 
"spirits," afterwards admitted that he had been mistaken. Those who had 
pinned their faith to the genuineness of the photographic manifestations 
were naturally unwilling to relinquish their belief in what they considered 
a sure proof of the reality of the spirit-world, and ingenious explanations 
were offered to cover the circumstance of the apparent double exposure. The 
spirit aura, they said, differed from the natural atmosphere in its 
refracting power, and it was not to be wondered at that objects were 
sometimes duplicated. And so Hudson retained a considerable measure of 
popularity. Mr. Beattie himself afterwards attempted to produce spirit 
photographs, and succeeded in obtaining vague blotches and flaws on his 
pictures, some of them bearing a dim resemblance to a human figure. But 
there is reason to believe that a hired assistant, who provided studio and 
apparatus, was not entirely above suspicion. In 1874 Buguet (q.v.), a Paris 
photographer crossed over to London where he commenced the practice of 
spirit photography. Many of his pictures were recognized by his clients, and 
even when he had been tried by the French Government, and had admitted 
deception, there were those who refused to regard his confession as 
spontane-ous, and inclined to the opinion that he had been bribed by the 
Jesuits to confess to fraud of which he was innocent I Other spirit 
photographers were Parkes, a contemporary of Hudson, and Boursnell, who 
produced spirit pictures in London in more recent years. The principal 
evidence in favour of spirit photography is undoubtedly the recognition of 
the spirits by their friends and relatives, but the unre-liable nature of 
such a test can be seen when we remember that time and again a single 
"spirit" has been claimed by several persons as a near relative -the sister 
of one, the grandfather of another, and so on. One of the most prominent 
defenders of the mediumistic photographers was the Rev. Stainton Moses 
(q.v.)-" M. A. Oxon "-who saw in them the best proof of the reality of 
spiritualism. The same view was shared by Mr. Alfred Russel Wallace (q.v.), 
who said in the Arena, January, 1891 : " It is that which furnishes, 
perhaps, the most unassailable demon-stration it is possible to obtain of 
the objective reality of spiritual forms."

Spiritism : The name bestowed upon the French form of spiritualism, which 
was in the main founded on the doc-trines of " Allan Kardec" (M. Rivail), 
(q.v.)  Spiritism differed from spiritualism as expounded in Britain, 
America and elsewhere, chiefly in that it included among its tenets the 
doctrine of reincarnation.  Allan Kardec, who prior to his adoption of 
spiritualistic creeds, about 1862 had been an exponent of animal magnetism 
and phrenology, based his new teachings on spirit revelations received 
through clairvoyants, and so popular were these teachings that they rapidly 
spread over the Continent.  In Britain, however, spiritism obtained but 
little hold, its only exponent being Miss Anna Blackwell, who endeavoured 
without success to establish the doctrine of reincarnation in this country.  
Spiritism and spiritualism must not be confused. since the adherents of each 
section were opposed to the tenets of the other, and even in France, where 
spiritism obtained the most footing, there was a distinct spiritualistic 
party who looked askance at the doctrine of reincarnation. The word 
spiritist is sometimes applied to one who seeks only the physical phenomena, 
and neglects the religious and philosophic aspect of spiritualism.


Spiritualism : Spiritualism in its modern aspect has for it’s basic 
principles the belief in the continuance of life after death, and the 
possibility of communication between the dead and the living, through the 
agency of a medium or psychic, a person qualified in some unknown manner to 
be the mouthpiece of supernatural beings. On this founda-tion has been 
raised the belief known as spiritualism, variously regarded as a religion or 
a philosophy. Besides the speaking (or writing, drawing, etc.) indirectly 
through the agency of the medium, there are also physical manifestations, 
such as the materialisation of ‘spirit forms, and apports," (q.v.) the so-
called  direct" writing, moving of inanimate object’s without contact, and 
other phenomena of a like nature. The word "spiritism" used in France to 
denote spiritualism, is in this country only applied to the theories of 
Allen Kardec (q.v.) a well-known spiritualist who believed in re-
incarnation, or to an inferior phase of spiritualism, in which only physical 
manifestation’s are sought, and the religious and ethical ‘significance of 
the subject ignored.
     Though the movement in it’s present form date’s no further back than 
1848, it is possible to trace it’s ancestry to witchcraft, demoniac 
possession, poltergeistic distur-bances, and animal magnetism. In these all 
the phenomena of spiritualism may be found, though the disturbing influences 
were not in the earlier instance’s identified with the ‘spirits of the 
deceased. Many famous outbreak’s of an epidemic nature, such as that among 
the Trembler’s of the Cevennes (q.v.) and the Convulsionarie’s of St. Medard 
(q.v.), which to the beholders ‘showed clear indications of demonic 
possession, had in their ‘symptom’s considerable analogy with modern 
spiritualism. They were accompanied by spontaneous trance or ecstasy, 
utterance of long-winded discourses, and speaking in unknown tongue’s, all 
of which are to be found in the ‘stance-room. The fluency of speech, 
especially of these ignorant peasant’s, has been equalled, if not surpassed, 
by the outpouring’s of the unlearned medium under the influence of her " 
control."  In ‘such case’s the symptom’s were generally referred either to 
angelic or diabolic possession, and most frequently to the latter.  Witches 
also were supposed to hold converse with the Devil, and many aspect’s of 
witchcraft - and notably the part played in the persecution of suspects by 
young women and chil-dren-show an obvious relationship to those 
poltergeistic disturbances which were the connecting link between early 
form’s of possession and modern spiritualism. Cases in which children of 
morbid tendencies pretend to be the victims of a witch are to be found in 
every record of witch-craft.  It was the poltergeist (q.v.). however, who 
showed most affinity to the  control " of the mediumistic circle. For at 
least the past few centuries poltergeist disturbance’s have occurred from 
time to time, and the mischievous spirit’s favourite modes of manifesting 
itself have been singularly akin to those adopted by the spirit control of 
our days. Again, both spirit’s require the agency of a medium for the 
production of their phenomena, and it is in the immediate presence of the 
medium that the phenom-ena generally make their appearance.
     Magnetism -Partly evolving from these phases of spirit-manifestation, 
and partly running parallel with them. was an extensive movement whose 
significance, from the ‘spiritualist point of view, is very considerable. 
The doctrine of animal magnetism was, ‘said to have originated with 
Paracelsus, and was much in favour with the old alchemist’s. The actual 
magnet was not greatly used, but was regarded as a ‘symbol of the magnetic 
philosophy, which rested on the idea of a force or fluid radiating from the 
heavenly bodies, human beings, and indeed, from every ‘substance, animate or 
intimate, by means of which all things interacted upon one another.  While 
the mystic’s were engaged in formulating a magnetic philosophy, there were 
others, such as Valentine Greatrakes, who cured disease’s, claiming their 
power as a divine gift, and not connecting it with the rationalist ideas of 
the alchemists. These two phase’s of magnetism united and came to a height 
in the work of Franz Antoine Mesmer, who in 1766 published his 
De plane farem influxu, a treatise on the influence of the planets on the 
human body.  His ideas were essentially those of the magnetic philosophers, 
and his cures probably on a level with those of Valentine Greatrakes, but 
into both theory and practice he infused new life and won for himself the 
recognition, if not of the learned ‘societies, at least of the general 
public. To him is due that application of the magnetic system which resulted 
in the discovery of the induced hypnotic trance, whose bearing on 
spiritualism is obvious and important.  In 1784 a commission was appointed 
by the French Government to consider magnetism as practised by Mesmer and 
his followers but it’s report only served to cast discredit on the ‘science, 
and exclude it from scientific discussion.  Until the third decade of the 
nineteenth century the rationalist explana-tions of Mesmerism concerned 
themselves entirely with a fluid or force emanating from the person of the 
operator, and even visible to the clairvoyant eye, but in 1823 Alex-andre 
Bertrand, a Paris physician, published a Traiti du Somnambulisme, and in 
1826 a treatise Du Magnetisme Animal en France, in which he established the 
relationship between ordinary sleep-walking, ‘somnambulism associated with 
disease, and epidemic ecstasy, and advanced the doctrine now generally 
accepted-that of suggestion. Magnetism was by this time receiving a good 
deal of attention all over Europe.  A second French Commission appointed in 
1825 presented in 1831 a report which, though of no great value, contained a 
unanimous testimony to the actuality of the phenomena.  In Germany also 
magnetism was practised to a considerable extent, and rationalist 
explanations found some acceptance. There was a class however, more numerous 
in Germany than elsewhere, who inclined towards a spiritualistic explanation 
of Mesmeric phenomena.  Indeed, the belief in spirit-intercourse had grown 
up beside magnetism from its earliest conception, in opposition to the 
theory of a magnetic fluid.  In the earlier phases of  miraculous " healing 
the cure’s were, as has been said, ascribed to the divine gift of the 
operator, who expelled the evil spirits from the patient.  In epidemic 
case’s in religious communities, ,as well as in individual instance’s, the 
spirits were questioned both on personal matters and on abstract theological 
questions.  A detailed account of the trance utterances of an hypnotic 
‘subject was given in 1787 in the journals of the Swedish Exegetical and 
Philanthropic Society.  The society naturally inclined to the doctrines of 
their countryman, Emanuel Swedenborg, who was the first to identify the  
spirits " with the ‘soul’s of deceased men and women. In Germany Dr. Kerner 
experimented with Frederica Hauffe, the   Seeress of Prevorst " (q.v.), in 
whose presence physical manifesta-tions took place, and who described the 
conditions of the ‘soul after death and the constitution of man - the 
physical body, the ‘soul, spirit, and nervengeist, an ethereal body
which clothes the soul after death-theories afterwards elaborated by 
spiritualists.  Other German investigators, J. H. Jung (Jung-Stilling), Dr. 
C. Romer, and Dr. Heinreich Werner recorded the phenomenon of clairvoyance 
in their somnambules.  A French spiritualist, Alphonse Cahagnet, produced 
some of the best evidence which spiritualism can show, his accounts being as 
remarkable for their sincerity and good-faith as for the intelligence they 
display.
     Magnetism received but little attention in England, till the third 
decade of the nineteenth century. Towards the end of the eighteenth century 
Dr. Bell, Loutherbourg, and others, practised the science in this country, 
but for about thirty years-from 1798 to 1828 - it was quite neglected. In 
the latter year Richard Chenevix, an Irishman, gave mesmeric demonstrations. 
Dr. Elliotson, of University College Hospital, practised mesmerism with his 
somnam-bules, the sisters Okey, and though he first believed in the magnetic 
fluid, he afterwards became a spiritualist.  In 7843 two journals dealing 
with the subject were founded the Zoist and the Phreno-magnet.  Most of the 
English magnetists of the time believed in a physical explanation of the 
phenomena.  In 1845 Dr. Reichenbach published his researches, claiming to 
demonstrate the existence of an emanation (q.v.) which he called odylic or 
odic force, radiating from every substance. This effluence could be seen by 
clairvoyants, and had definite colours, and pro-duced a feeling of heat or 
cold. Working on individual lines, Braid arrived at the same conclusions as 
Bertrand had done, and demonstrated the power of suggestion in magnetic" 
experiments, but his theories were neglected as Bertrand’s had been. By the 
medical profession, especially, the whole matter was freely ridiculed, and 
declared to be fraudulent. There is no doubt that their attitude would have 
changed-it had, indeed, already begun to do so - but for the wave of 
spiritualism that swept over America and Europe, and magnified the 
extravagant attendant phenomena of the trance state, and so obscured its 
true significance and scientific value.
     It will thus be seen not only that magnetism contained the germs of 
spiritualistic phenomena, but that in many cases the phenomena were 
identical with those of spirit-ualism in its present stage of development. 
Trance-speaking was well-known, physical manifestations, though less 
frequently met with, were also witnessed, as in the case of Frau Hauffe; and 
clairvoyance was regarded as a common adjunct of the trance.  In later 
years, as has been seen, the so-called "magnetic" phenomena were largely 
attributed to the agency of the spirits of the deceased. For such an 
obviously supernormal faculty as clairvoyance - by means of which the 
subject professed himself able to see what was going on at a distance, or to 
distinguish objects carefully concealed from his normal sight - even such 
men as Bertrand and Braid do not seem to have offered an adequate 
explanation, nor have they refuted the evidence for it, though it was 
extensively practised both in France and England.  Indeed, there sprang up 
in these countries a class who specialised in clairvoyance, and still 
further prepared the way for spiritualism.
     Early American Spiritualism. - What is generally regarded as the birth 
of modern spiritualism took place in America in 1848.  In that year an 
outbreak by rapping occurred in the home of the Fox family, at Hydesville, 
in Arcadia, Wayne County, N.Y. The household comprised John Fox, his wife, 
and their two young daughters, Mar-garetta and Kate, aged fifteen and twelve 
years respectively, and the house itself was a small wooden erection.  On 
the 31st March, 1848, Mrs. Fox summoned her neighbours to hear the 
knockings, which had disturbed the family for a few days past.  On being 
questioned the raps manifested signs of intelligence, and it was finally 
elicited that the disturbing influence was the spirit of a pedlar, done to 
death by a former resident of the house at Hydesville for the sake of his 
money.  It was afterwards said that in April of the same year the Foxes, 
while digging in their cellar at the instigation of the spirits, had 
discovered therein frag-ments of hair, teeth, and bones, supposed to be 
those of a human being, but the statement was not properly verified, and the 
evidence for the murder was but small. The neighbours of the Fox family, 
however, were deeply im-pressed by the "revelations," and, by way of a test, 
questioned the spirits on such matters as the ages of their acquaintances, 
questions which were answered, apparently, with some correctness.  Soon 
afterwards Margaretta Fox visited her married sister, Mrs. Fish, at 
Rochester, New York, there the knockings broke out as vigorously as they had 
done at Hydesville.  Her sister Catherine visited some friends at Auburn, 
and here, too, the rappings were heard. Many persons found themselves 
possessed of mediumistic powers, and the manifestations spread like an 
epidemic, till in a few years they were witnessed in most of the eastern 
states.  Numerous circles were formed by private individ-uals, and 
professional mediums became ever more abundant. Mrs. Fox and her three 
daughters continued to hold the place of honour in the spiritualistic world, 
and gave exhibitions in many large towns.  In 1850, while they were at 
Buffalo, some professors of the Buffalo University showed that the raps 
could be produced by the medium’s joints, and shortly afterwards Mrs. Norman 
Culver, a relative by marriage of the Fox family, declared that Margaretta 
Fox had shown her how the rappings were obtained by means of the joints. She 
also alleged that Catherine Fox had told her that in a seance at Rochester 
where the medium’s ankles were held to prevent fraud, a Dutch servant maid 
had rapped in the cellar on a signal from the medium. This latter statement 
was hotly denied by the spiritualists, but no refutation was attempted with 
regard to the other allegations.  Many mediums confessed that they had 
resorted to trickery, but the tide of popular favour in America held to the 
actuality of the manifestations. These, as time went on, became more varied 
and complex. Table-turning and tilting (q.v.) in part replaced the simpler 
phenomena of raps.  Playing on musical instruments by invisible hands, 
"direct" spirit writing, bell-ringing, levitation, and materialisation of 
spirit hands, are some of the phenomena which were witnessed and vouched for 
by such distinguished sitters as Judge Edmonds, the Hon N. P. Tallmadge, 
Governor of Wisconsin,’ and William Lloyd Garrison. We find the levitation 
of the medium Daniel D. Home (q.v.) recorded at an early stage in his 
career.  Slate-writing (q.v.) and playing on musical instruments were also 
feats practised by the spirits who frequented Koon’s "spirit-room" (q.v.) in 
Dover, Athens County, Ohio.  At Keokuk, in Iowa, in 1854, two mediums spoke 
in tongues identified on somewhat insufficient data, as "Swiss," Latin, and 
Indian languages, and henceforward trance-speaking in their native language 
and in foreign tongues was much practised by mediums. The recognised foreign 
tongues included Latin and Greek; French, German, Spanish, Italian, Chinese 
and Gaelic, but generally the trance utterances, when they were not in 
English, were not recognised definitely as any known language, and 
frequently the " spirits" themselves inter-preted the " tongue."  The latter 
phenomena are evidently akin to the early outpourings of the "possessed" or 
the articulate but meaningless fluency of ecstatics during a religious 
epidemic. There have been cases, however, where persons in a state of 
exaltation have spoken fluently in a language of which they know but little 
in their normal state.  Many of the " spirit " writings were signed with the 
names of great people-particularly Franklin, Swedenborg, Plato, Aristotle, 
St. John and St. Paul. Trance - lecturing before audiences was also 
practised, books of inspirational utterances were published, and poetry and 
drawings produced in abundance. These automatic pro-ductions had a character 
of their own-they were vague, high-sounding, incoherent, and distinctly 
reminiscent.  In cases where they displayed even a fair amount of merit, as 
in the poems of T. L. Harris, it was pointed out that they were not beyond 
the capacity of the medium in his normal state.  As a rule they had a 
superficial appearance of intelligence, but on analysis were found to be 
devoid of meaning.  During the early years of spiritualism in America the 
movement was largely noticed by the press, and many periodicals devoted 
exclusively to spiritualism made their appearance. The Spirit Messenger was 
first published in 1849, Heat and Light in 1851, the Shekinah in 1852, 
Spiritual Telegraph in 1853, Spirit World, under the title of the Spiritual 
Philosopher, in 1850, under the editorship of Laroy Sunderland. From the 
beginning of the movement those who accepted the actuality of the phenomena 
ranged themselves into two separate schools, each represented by a 
considerable body of opinion. The theory of the first was frankly 
spiritualistic, the explanation of the second was that of Mesmer, now 
appearing under various guises, with a more or less definite flavour of 
contemporary scientific thought. These two schools, as we have seen, had 
their foundation in the early days of animal magnetism, when the rationalist 
ideas of the magnetists were ranged against the theories of angelic or 
diabolic possession.  In America the suppositions " force " of the 
rationalists went by the name of" odylic force," "electro-magnetism," and so 
forth, and to it was attributed not only the sub-jective phenomena, but the 
physical manifestations as well. And poltergeistic disturbances occurring 
from time to time were ascribed either to spirits or odylic force, as in the 
case of the Ashtabula Poltergeist (q.v.). The Rev. Asa Mahan, one of the 
"rationalists," suggested that the medium read the thoughts of the sitter by 
means of odylic force. The protagonists of a magnetic theory attributed 
trance-speaking to the subject’s own intelligence, but after the birth of 
American spiritualism in 1848 a spiritualistic interpretation was more 
commonly accepted.  Notwith-standing these conflicting theories, of which 
some were certainly physical, practically nothing was done in the way of 
scientific investigation, with the exception of the experi-ments conducted 
by Dr. Hare, Professor of Chemistry in the University of Pennsylvania, 
though they hardly deserved the name of " scientific investigation."  In 
1857, when the experiments were made, Hare was already advanced in years, 
and seems to have been easily imposed upon. Very few exposures of fraud were 
made, partly because the majority of the sitters accepted the phenomena with 
unquestioning faith, and partly because the machinery with which such 
detection might be made was not forth-coming. The collaboration of skilful, 
trained, and dis-interested investigators, such as have recently applied 
themselves to the elucidation of psychic problems, was entirely lacking in 
those days, and the public was left to form its own conclusions.  
Spiritualism in America was from the first intimately bound up with 
socialism. The cult of spiritualism was, in fact, the out-growth of the same 
state of things which produced socialistic communities, and occasioned the 
rise and fall of so many strange religions. Warren Chase, Horace Greeley, T. 
L. Harris, and other prominent spiritualists founded such communities, and 
the so-called " inspirational" writings frequently gave direc-tions for 
their construction.  It was characteristic of the nation and the time that 
the general trend of religious and philosophic speculation should run on 
democratic lines. The fixed standards of thought which obtained in Europe 
were not recognised in America; everyone thought for himself, with but 
little educational training on which to base his ideas, and the result was 
that the vigour of his speculation frequently outran its discretion. As for 
the causes which made spiritualism more popular and more lasting than other 
strange doctrines of the time, they are probably to be found in the special 
conditions which prepared the way for spiritualism.  Clairvoyants had made 
use of rapping prior to the mediumship of the Fox girls, the induced trance 
had only recently been brought to the notice of the American people by 
lecturers, the clergy and others, accustomed to departures from ortho-doxy 
in every direction, found no difficulty in admitting the intervention of 
good or evil spirits in human affairs, while for those who refused to accept 
the spirit hypothesis a satisfactory explanation of the phenomena was found 
in electricity, electro-magnetism, or " odic force."
     Spiritualism in England.-Though, as has been said, clairvoyants and 
somnambules were sufficiently common in England prior to the importation of 
spiritualism in its American form, the phenomena were, nevertheless, inter-
preted mainly on rationalist lines, and even when the spirit doctrine-which 
in those days had but a small following-became wide-spread and important, 
the theory of any rational explanation was still represented.  In 1852, four 
years after the " Rochester Rappings," a medium named Mrs. Hayden was 
brought from America by a lecturer on "electro-biology."  Soon afterwards 
another professional medium, Mrs. Roberts, crossed the Atlantic, and both 
ladies had a distinguished clientele, and received substantial remuneration 
in the way of fees.  Many of the most influential Journals published 
scornful comments on these performances, hut a belief in the genuineness of 
the phenom-ena was expressed by one at least, Chambers Journal, in an 
article by Robert Chambers himself.  Professor de Morgan was another 
distinguished witness who testified to the actuality of the phenomena, and 
its supernormal character, and yet others were disposed to investigate. In 
1853 an epidemic of table-turning (q.v.) spread from the Continent to 
Britain, and attained to immense popularity among all classes.  So wide-
spread did it become that such men as Braid, Faraday and Carpenter turned 
their attention to it, and showed it to result from unconscious muscular 
action. The "rationalist" explanation, be it said, was still well to the 
fore, with talk of odylic force, electricity, or magnetism.  Faraday’s 
experiments were ridiculed, and a pamphlet entitled Table-turning by Animal 
Magnetism demonstrated ran through more than a hundred editions in one year.  
Elliotson and the other protagonists of mesmerism found an illustration of 
their own views in table-turning. Those who inclined to a spiritualistic 
belief found a spirit agency at work in the same phenomena; while a band of 
clergymen, confessedly awaiting similar manifestations in fulfillment of 
Scriptural prophecy, con-cluded that Satanic agency was at the root of the 
matter, and had their conclusions supported by the "spirits" themselves, who 
confessed that they were fallen angels, or the spirits of evil-doers.  Among 
the earliest converts to spiritualism were Sir Charles Isham, Dr. Ashburner, 
and the socialist  Robert Owen, at that time already over eighty years of 
age, who published in 1854 the first number of The New Existence of Alan 
upon the Earth, intended as the organ of a sort of millenium to be brought 
about by the spirits. Automatic writing is recorded at this period, one 
medium being a child of four, who wrote in Latin.  In the autumn of 1853 
Mrs. Hayden returned to America, and the practice of table-turning speedily 
declined.  Until 1860 little more is heard of spiritualism, though a few 
journals were published in the interval.  Owen continued to issue his New 
Existence, in which, however, spiritualism was only a secondary 
consideration. The Yorkshire Spiritual Telegraph published at Keighley in 
1815, ran till the end of 1859 (from 1857 under the name of the British 
Spiritual Telegraph). There were also a few other periodicals which did not 
enjoy so long a lease of life.  But though the British books and papers 
dealing with the subject were but few, the lack was supplied by American 
productions, which were largely read in this country. Mediums, as well as 
literature, were imported from America, notable among them being Daniel 
Dunglas Home (q.v.) who crossed over to Britain in 1855 at the age of 
twenty-three, and who had already acted as a medium in America for some four 
years. Many of those who afterwards became prominent mediums were first 
converted to spiritualism at Home’s seances.  In the autumn of 1855 Home 
returned to America, and in 1856 his place was taken by P. B. Randolph, who 
attended the meetings of the Charing Cross Circle.  In 1859 came the Rev. T. 
L. Harris, deputed by the spirits to visit Eng-land.  An English medium, 
named Mrs. Marshall, gave seances professionally, but much less successfully 
than did Home and the American mediums, though the phenom-ena were of a 
similar kind.  English spiritualists, however, did not court publicity, but 
practised for the most part anonymously. The phenomena at these seances 
resemble those in America - playing of instruments without visible agency, 
materialisation of hands, table-turning, and so on-but on a much smaller 
scale.  It was not so much these physical manifestations, however, which 
inspired the con-fidence or excited the credulity of early spiritualists, 
but rather the automatic writing and speaking which, rare at first, 
afterwards became a feature of mediumistic seances. So early as 
1854 the trance utterances of a medium named Annie were recorded by a circle 
of Swedenborgians presided over by Elihu Rich. The importance given at this 
stage of the movement to subjective phenomena must be attribu-ted to an 
imperfect understanding of unconscious cerebra-tion.  Such men as Mr. Thomas 
Shorter, editor of the Spiritual Magazine, failed to comprehend how the 
medium was able to reason while in the trance state, and to perform 
intelligent acts of which the normal consciousness knew nothing. Therefore 
they adopted the spirit hypothesis. Mrs. de Morgan and Mrs. Newton Crosland 
gave a ready credence to the automatic utterances of their friends. Sym-
bolic drawings were a feature of Mrs. Crosland’s circle, as was also the 
speaking in unknown tongues, which were trans-lated by the spirit through 
another medium.
     In 1860 a new spiritual era opened, and the whole subject came into 
more prominence than it had done heretofore. This was due to the increase in 
the number of British mediums and the emigration to Britain of many American 
mediums, including the Davenport Brothers (q.v.) and D. D. Home, who once 
more visited England in 1859. Home was treated respectfully, not to say 
generously. by the bulk of the press and by the public, and admitted to the 
highest grades of society.  Another American medium who practised about the 
same time was J. R. M. Squire, whose manifestations were vouched for by Dr. 
Lockhart Robert-son.  Other mediums there were, however, such as Colches-tar 
and Foster, who practised trickery so openly that the spiritualists 
themselves exposed their fraud, though main-taining that at times the 
manifestations even of these mediums were genuine.  After Home, the most 
famous American mediums were the brothers Davenport, who practised various 
forms of physical mediumship.  They took their places in a small cabinet, 
bound band and foot to the satisfaction of the sitters. When the lights were 
lowered, musical instruments were thrown about the room and played upon and 
other physical phenomena were apparent. When the seance was over and the 
lights once more raised, the brothers Davenport were found securely fastened 
in their cabinet, The manifestations were so skillfully produced that many 
people hesitated whether to regard them as clever conjuring or spirit 
phenomena. At length, however, the Davenports were exposed through the 
agency of a secret knot called the "Tom Fool’s knot," which they were unable 
to untie, and which rendered the necessary escape from their bonds 
impossible. Their career in Britain was at an end.  Shortly afterwards the 
conjuring performances of Maskelyne and Cook, in emulation of the Davenport 
Brothers, drove the spiritualists to conclude that they also must be 
renegade mediums. Native medium-ship developed much more slowly in England 
than that of the American spiritualists.  Mrs. Marshall was for a time 
practically the only professional medium of standing in the country, though 
private mediums were less rare.  Notable among the latter were Mrs. Everitt, 
Mr. Edward Child, and Miss Nichol, afterwards the second wife of Mr. Guppy, 
who became a famous medium. During this period poltergeistic disturbances 
were still recorded in which all the familiar phenomena reappeared, but they 
were explained on spiritualist lines. Crystal vision was practised and auras 
were commonly seen by the medium round the heads of his friends. Automatic 
writing, speaking, and drawing con-tinued, and inspirational addresses, 
etc., were published. In 1869 a new impulse was given to spiritualism by the 
appearance of several public mediums, chief among them being F. Herne, who 
devoted his talents to the production of physical manifestations, and in 
connection with whom we first see the phenomenon of " elongation" (q.v.). 
Within a few years a number of other English mediums sprang up - Eglinton, 
Monck, Rita, and many more, while Dr. Slade, Annie Eva Pay, and Kate Fox 
(who afterwards married an English barrister named Jencken) came over from 
America.  In 1870 the Rev. W. Stainton Moses ("M. A. Oxon,") destined to be 
one of the greatest of English mediums, devoted himself to private 
mediumship. In 1872 there was introduced into England, through the agency of 
the Guppys, the practice of Spirit Photography (q.v.), which had originated 
ten years earlier in America. To very many people a photograph containing, 
in addition to the sitter’s portrait, a vague splotch of white, was con-
clusive evidence of the materialisation of spirits.  After numerous 
exposures the craze for spirit photography declined and of late years little 
has been heard of it, though in spasmodic fashion it sometimes shows 
evidence of life. Slate-writing (q.v.) was a favourite mode of "direct" 
writing and one extensively practised. Sittings were generally held in the 
dark, and the sitters were enjoined to talk or sing, or perhaps a musical 
box was played. Most of the records of these earlier seances are singularly 
suggestive of fraud.  In 1874 Mrs. Jencken (Kate Fox) was staying at 
Brighton with her baby, aged about six months, and it is related that the 
baby became a writing medium. A facsimile of its writing was published in 
the Medium and Daybreak of May 8th, 1874.  In the same year came Mrs. Annie 
Eva Pay whose feats resembled those of the Daven-ports. Another celebrated 
medium was David Duguid, of Glasgow, who painted "under control."  In 1876 
Henry Slade came from America, and turned his attention chiefly to slate-
writing.  A few months after his appearance in Britain Professor Ray 
Lankester detected him in fraud, prosecuted him, and finally obliged him to 
leave the country.  But the crowning manifestation, the climax of spiritual 
phenomena and apparently the most difficult of achievement, was 
materialisation (q.v.)  It began with the materialisation of heads, hands, 
and arms, and pro-ceeded to full materialisation.  In 1872 Mrs. Guppy 
attempted this form of manifestation, but with no con-spicuous success. The 
mediums Herne and Williams also included it in their repertory, but a new 
and successful medium made her appearance-Florence Cook, who materialised 
the spirits of "John" and "Katie King." When, during a seance, Miss Cook was 
seized by Mr. Volckman while impersonating a spirit, the exposure drew from 
Sir William Crookes several letters testifying to the honesty of the medium, 
with whom he had experimented, and rather helped the cause of spiritualism 
than otherwise. Other private mediums also gave materialisation seances, and 
from them the contagion spread to their professional brethren, among whom 
the most successful was undoubtedly William Eglinton.  Miss Lottie Fowler 
also attained to fame as a medium about the same time - the decade 1870-So. 
These open seances offered a better opportunity to the investigator, and 
though even in them some care was doubtless exercised to prevent the 
intrusion of " adverse influences," there were a good many instances where a 
sceptic ventured to grasp the spirit, and when this occurred spirit and 
medium were always found to be one and the same.  By way of apology for 
these untoward happenings the Spiritualist suggested that the spirit was 
composed of emanations from the medium, and that when it was grasped by the 
sitter spirit and medium would unite, the form possessing most of the 
medium’s force rejoining the other. Another explanation, especially 
applicable to physical manifestations, was that genuine mediums, giving pro-
fessional seances, and forced to produce the phenomena on all occasions, 
would sometimes resort to fraud when their mediumistic powers temporarily 
failed them.  This per-fectly plausible excuse was always ready to meet a 
charge of fraud.  The subjective phenomena, as time advanced became less in 
favour with investigators, who began really to understand its subjective 
nature, but with spiritualists it remained the most important form of 
manifestation The trance utterances of Home (q.v.), Stainton Moses, and Miss 
Lottie Fowler were highly valued.  David Duguid, the celebrated painting 
medium, was controlled by a new spirit, Hafed, Prince of Persia, whose life 
and adventures were delivered through the medium.  Prominent inspira-tional 
speakers were Mrs. Emma Hardinge Britten, J. J. Morse, and Mrs. Cora L. V. 
Tappan-Richmond. Among English periodicals devoted to spiritualism were 
Human Nature, first issued in 1867 ; the Medium and Daybreak, founded a few 
years later; the Spiritual Magazine; and the Spiritualist (1867), edited by 
Mr. W. H. Harrison, and treating the subject in a scientific manner.  A 
still more recent paper, Light, dates from 1881, and still remains one of 
the principal organs of the movement.  One of the earliest investigators was 
Sir William Crookes, whose experiences with D. D. Home are not to be lightly 
passed by.  In 1863 Professor de Morgan, in a preface to Mrs. de Morgan’s 
book, From Matter to Spirit, suggests the agency of some mysterious force, 
though be did not become a spiritualist until afterwards.  In 1868 Cromwell 
Varley, the electrician, testified to the phenomena of Home.  In the 
following year the London Dialectical Society appointed a Committee to 
enquire into the matter, whose members included Alfred Russel Wallace 
(q.v.), Charles Bradlaugh, and Sergeant Cox. The report of the committee 
stated that the subject was "worthy of more serious and careful 
investigation than it has hitherto received."  Cromwell Varley, and the 
Research Committee of the British National Association of Spiritualists 
carried out various electrical and other tests, but as these have since been 
proved to be inadequate, it is not necessary to consider them in detail. On 
the other hand Faraday and Tyndall, Huxley and Carpenter, refused to have 
anything to do with the psychic phenomena, and opposed the spiritualistic 
movement in a spirit of intolerance which contrasted unfavourably with the 
attitude of its scientific protagonists.  Meanwhile the old rationalist 
school of believers in magnetic or odylic emanations still lingered and were 
represented by the Psychological Society (founded in 1875, and came to an 
end in 1879), the writings of its president, Sergeant Cox, and those of the 
well-known spiritualist, Mr. Samuel Guppy. One other scientific man of the 
period is deserving of mention in this connection.  In 1876 Professor 
Barrett (now Sir William), lecturing before the British Association, 
declared that hyperaesthesia and suggestion were not alone capable of 
explaining the phenomena, and urged the necessity for appointing a committee 
to investigate.  How-ever, his suggestion was not acted upon, and in 1882 he 
called a conference to consider the question. The direct result of this 
conference was the founding of the Society for Psychical Research.  Up to 
this point the English movement differed from the American less in kind than 
in degree, for it was altogether weaker and more restricted. Indeed, the 
difference in the traditions of the two countries. and in the general temper 
of their people, rendered it impossible that the movement should spread here 
as rapidly as it had done in America, or that it should be embraced with 
such fervour,  It was not-probably for the same reason-inimical to 
Christianity in England, but rather supplementary to it, and there were 
those who claimed to be converted to Christianity through its means.
     The Society for Psychical Research. -The history of the criticism of 
occult phenomena in Great Britain from 1882 to the present time is 
intimately connected with the Society for Psychical Research, and there is 
no development worthy of record which its members have not investigated. It 
was the first body to make a united and organised attempt to deal with what 
was called, for want of a better name, psychic phenomena, in a purely 
scientific and impartial spirit, free from the bias of pre-conceived ideas 
on the subject.  It was, indeed, expressly stated in their prospec-tus that 
the members in no wise bound themselves to accept any one explanation, or to 
recognise in the phenom-ena the working of any non-physical agency. The 
first president of the Society was Professor Henry Sidgwick, and the Council 
numbered among its members Edmund Gurney, Frank Podmore, Frederic W. H. 
Myers, and Professor Barrett; and the Rev. W. Stainton Moses, Morell 
Theobald, Dr. George Wild, and Dawson Rogers, the latter four being 
spiritualists.  It may be mentioned, however, that the avowedly 
spiritualistic members of the Society gradually dropped off.  Other 
presidents of the Society were, Professor Balfour Stewart, the Rt. Hon. A. 
J. Balfour, Professor William James, Sir William Crookes, Sir Oliver Lodge, 
and Professor Barrett, several of these being among the original members. 
The scope of the Psychical Research Society was defined by the appointment 
of six committees, as follows :-(1) Committee on Thought Transference;  (2) 
Committee on Hypnotism; (3) Com-mittee on Reichenbach’s Experiments ; (4) 
Committee on Apparitions; (5)  Committee on Physical (spiritualistic) 
Phenomena; and (6) a Committee to consider the history and existing 
literature of the subject.  The field of the Society was thus a wide one, 
and it was still further en-larged in later years, when a committee, headed 
by Dr. Richard Hodgson, conducted an enquiry into Theosophy (q.v.). And the 
methods of psychic research were applied to other matters also, which ware 
outside of the Society’s original scope.  In order to find an explanation 
for the spiritualistic phenomena, its members journeyed into the domain of 
psychology, and studied automatism, hallucina-tions, and thought 
transference, one or other of which has been proved to have an important 
bearing on much of the spiritualistic phenomena, if not on all. They were 
also instrumental in detecting a great deal of fraud in connec-tion with 
mediumistic performances, especially in such phenomena as slate-writing 
(q.v.) and other " physical" manifestations.  The explanation of these, in 
fact, formed one of the chief aim’s of the Society. Though at the time of 
its founding public mediumship seemed to have de-clined; there was still 
more than enough phenomena for the Society to investigate, and the testimony 
of Sir William Crookes and other’s of standing and intellectual strength 
indicated that the matter was at least a fit ‘subject for investigation.  In 
connection with ‘slate-writing, which many person’s declared to be genuine 
and so ‘simple that fraud was impossible, Mr. S. J. Davey, a member of the 
Society, gave a number of pseudo-seances.  Having been himself deceived for 
a time by the performances in that line of the well-known medium, William 
Eglinton, and having at length discovered the modus of his slate-writing 
feats, Mr. Davey set himself to emulate the medium’s manifestations."  In 
the interests of psychic research he undertook to give sittings, which were 
carefully recorded by Dr. Hodgson.  So well were the devices of the pro-
fessional mediums reproduced that none of the sitter’s were able to detect 
the modus operandi of Davey’s performances, even though they were assured 
beforehand that it was simply a conjuring trick.  Such a demonstration could 
not fail to do more than any amount of argument to expose the "phenomenon"  
of slate-writing.  (See article on Slate-writing.) Excellent work was done 
by the Society in the collection of evidence relating to apparition’s of the 
dead and the living, many of which are embodied in Phan-tasms of the living, 
by Messrs. Myers, Podmore and Gurney. A statistical enquiry on a large scale 
was undertaken by a Committee of the Society in 1889.  Some 17,000 cases of 
apparitions were collected by the committee and it’s assistants. The main 
object in taking such a census was to obtain evidence for the working of 
telepathy in veridical or coincidental apparitions, and in order to make 
‘such evidence of scientific value, the utmost care was taken to insure the 
impartiality and responsible character of all who took part in the enquiry. 
The result was, that after every precaution had been taken the apparitions 
coinciding with a death or other crisis were found greatly to exceed the 
number which could be ascribed to chance alone.  (See also Psychical 
Research.)  But the most fruitful of the Society’s researches were those 
concerning telepathy (q.v.). or thought-transference, and it was through the 
influence of its members that the doctrine of thought-transference, so long 
known to the vague speculation’s of the old mag-netists and mesmerist’s, was 
first placed on a definite basis as a problem worthy of scientific enquiry.  
Investigations into this matter are still progressing, and trustworthy proof 
of ‘such a mode of communication would affect the scientific view of 
spiritualism to a remarkable degree. Among the individual efforts of members 
of the Society for’ Psychical Research the most complete and the most 
success-ful were those conducted by Professor and Mrs. Sidgwick in 1889-91.  
(See Telepathy.)  At the same time there was much to encourage the belief in 
some "supernormal" agency, especially in the last decade of the nineteenth 
century. The two mediums whose manifestation’s led many able men in this 
country, in America, and on the Continent, to conclude that the spirits of 
the dead were concerned in their phenomena were the Italian medium Eusapia 
Palladino (q.v.) and the American Mrs. Piper. In 1885 Professor James, of 
Harvard, studied the case of Mrs. Piper (q.v.), and a few years later Dr. 
Richard Hodgson of the American Society for Psychical Research also investi-
gated her case, the latter commencing his investigations in an entirely 
sceptical spirit.  Of all the trance mediums she offers the best evidence 
for a supernatural agency.  Dr. Hodgson himself declared his belief that the 
spirits of the dead spoke through the lips of the medium, and among other’s 
who held that fraud alone would not account for the revelations given by 
Mrs. Piper in the trance state were Professor James, Sir Oliver Lodge, Mr. 
Myers and Professor J. H. Hyslop.  On the other hand, Mr. Podmore, while not 
admitting any ‘supernormal agency, suggests that telepathy may help to 
explain the matter, probably aided by skilful observation and carefully-
conducted enquiries concerning the affair’s of prospective sitters.  Mrs. 
Sidgwick, again, suggested that probably Mrs. Piper received telepathic com-
munications from the spirits of the dead, which she repro-duced in her 
automatic speaking and writing.  The other medium was Eusapia Palladino, 
who, after attracting considerable attention from Professor’s Lombroso, 
Richet, Flammarion, and other’s on the Continent, came to Britain in 1895.  
Several English scientific men had already witnessed her telergic powers on 
the Continent, at the invitation of Professor Charles Richet-Sir Oliver 
Lodge, Mr. Myers, and others -and of these Sir Oliver Lodge, at least, had 
expressed himself as satisfied that no known agency was responsible for her 
remarkable manifestations. The English sitting’s were held at Cambridge, and 
as it was proved conclusively that the medium made use of fraud, the 
majority of the investigators ascribed her " manifesta-tions"  entirely to 
that.  Later, however, in 1898, a further ‘series of ‘seances were held at 
Paris, and so success-fully that Richet, Myers, and Sir O. Lodge once more 
declared themselves satisfied of the genuineness of the phenomena.  A 
further account of this medium will be found under a separate heading.  
Perhaps the most con-vincing evidence for the working of ‘some supernormal 
agency, however, is to be found in the famous cross-corres-pondence 
experiments conducted in recent years. Mr. Myers had ‘suggested before he 
died that if a control were to give the ‘same message to two or more 
mediums, it would go far to establish the independent existence of ‘such 
con-trol.  On the death of Professor Sidgwick (in August, 1900) and of Mr. 
Myers (in January, 1901) it was thought that if mediums were controlled by 
these, some agreement might be looked for in the scripts. The first 
correspondences were found in the ‘script of Mrs. Thomson and Miss Rawson, 
the former in London, the latter in the ‘south of France. The Sidgwick 
control appeared for the first time to these ladies on the same day, January 
11th, 1901.  On the 8th of May, 1901 the Myers control appeared in the 
script of Mrs. Thompson and Mrs. Verrall, and later in that of Mrs. Piper 
and other’s.  So remarkable were the correspondences obtained in some cases 
where there could not possibly be collusion between the mediums, that it is 
difficult to believe that some discarnate intelligence was not responsible 
for ‘some, at least of the scripts.  (See also Cross-Correspon-dences.)

mediums, and investigators dealt with in this work, and the articles on

     By far the most extraordinary experiments in connection with psychic 
phenomena were those undertaken by Sir William Crookes.  Working under the 
most stringent con-ditions he and his fellow experimenters assured 
themselves that entrance or exit to the room in which their seances were 
held was impossible. Yet he succeeded by the aid of a medium in obtaining 
the best possible evidence of the presence of spirits or other entities in 
the apartment. These were of a tangible nature and were actually weighed by 
Sir William, who on one occasion even succeeded in obtaining a portion of 
the protoplasmic matter from which these entities were built up, which he 
kept in a box for ‘several days. These entities emerged from the body of the 
medium or from that of one of the sitter’s, walked about, spoke, and even 
debated loudly and noisily with Sir William and the other ‘sitter’s on many 
different topic’s over a prolonged ‘space of time.  They frequently vanished 
through the floor.  Sir William found their average weight to he about one-
third of that of a human being. These phenomena were witnessed by numerous 
persons of the highest intelligence and probity, among them, it is under-
’stood. ‘some of exalted rank.  A full statement regarding the phenomena in 
all their details may be found in Mr. Gambier Bolton’s interesting little 
volume Ghosts in Solid Form.
     No work of recent times furnishes the student of psychic research with 
such a masterly conspectus of the subject as Sir William F. Barrett’s On the 
Threshold of the Unseen (1917).  Expanded from an address on the phenomena 
of spiritualism delivered some twenty years ago, it covers the whole history 
of psychical research during that period and a notice of it may well ‘serve 
to complete this article and furnish the reader with data concerning 
psychical research during the present century. The introductory chapter 
briefly reviews the work of eminent ‘scientists and provides a frank 
‘statement of the present position of psychi-cal research.  Public opinion 
regarding the quest, and the conflicting objection’s of ‘science and 
religion are briefly reviewed in chapters II. and III., and are followed by 
an essay on the physical phenomena of spiritualism, which contains little 
that is not noticed in the present article. Chapter VII., "On Certain more 
Disputable Phenomena of Spiritualism," deal’s with examples of the direct 
voice and direct writing, materialization and spirit photography, all of 
which phenomena have been termed ectoplasms by Professor Ochorowicz of 
Warsaw.  "By Ectoplasy," say’s Sir William, " is meant the power of forming 
outside the body of the medium a concentration of vital energy or vitalized 
matter which operates temporarily in the same way as the body from which it 
is drawn, ‘so that visible, audible or tangible human-like phenomena are 
produced. This is very much like the ‘psychic force’ hypothesis under a new 
name. The chapter ‘ On the Canons of Evidence in Psychical Research" 
includes a sentence which might well be taken to heart by the too sceptical 
: " It is utterly unphilosophical to ridicule or deny well-attested 
phenomena because they are inexplicable."  Sir William ‘show’s how the 
critical examination of psychic phenomena has languished because of the lack 
of trained scientific observers, those devoting themselves to the subject 
being for the most part person’s of more enthusiasm than judg-ment.  The 
chapter on theories is eminently useful.  " I have never yet," says the 
author, "met with anyone who has seriously studied the evidence or engaged 
in prolonged investigation of this subject who holds ‘ that all mediums are 
impostors.’"  The theories examined to account for Supernormal phenomena 
include those of hallucination, which is only partially admitted as a cause.  
Exo-neural action of the brain which is, however, a sub-conscious action, an 
effect of the subliminal self, but perhaps the most interesting of the 
hypotheses which account for these miraculous happenings is described as 
follows: " It may be that the intelligence operating at a ‘seance is a 
thought-projection of ourselves-that each one of us has his simu-lacrum in 
the unseen; that with the growth of our life and character here a ghostly 
image of oneself is growing up in the invisible world."  The Problem of 
Mediumship is the subject of the tenth chapter.  Objection is taken to the 
word "medium," not only because of its associations, but for more scientific 
reason’s. A separate division of the book is occupied with the phenomenal 
evidence afforded by apparitions, automatic writing, ‘supernormal message’s, 
and the evidence of identity in the discarnate condition and of ‘survival 
after death. The last portion of the volume brings the question of human 
personality up to date, especially as regards its higher aspect’s, the 
conclusion being that only the barrier of our ‘sense perceptions, a" 
threshold of ‘sensibility," divide’s us from the world beyond our normal 
consciousness, just as "the organism of an oyster con-stitutes a threshold 
which shuts it out from the greater part of our ‘sensible world."  As 
regards the question of immor-tality it is concluded that " Life can exist 
in the unseen," but it does not follow that spirit communications teach us 
the necessary and inherent immortality of the ‘soul.  " If we accept the 
evidence for ‘identity, that some we have known on earth are still living 
and near us," we have ‘still to remember that "entrance on a life after 
death does not necessarily mean immortality, that is eternal persistence of 
our personality, nor doe’s it prove that survival after death extends to 
all.  Obviously no experimental evidence can ever demonstrate either of 
these beliefs, though it may and does remove the objection’s raised as to 
the possibility of ‘survival."
     Towards the end of 1916 a great ‘sensation was made not only in occult 
but in general circles by the publication by Sir Oliver Lodge of a memoir 
upon his ‘son, the late Lieuten-ant Raymond Lodge, who was killed near Ypres 
in Septem-ber, 1915. The book is divided into three parts, the first of 
which contains a history of the brief life of the subject of the memoir. The 
second part details numerous records of sittings both in the company of 
mediums and at the table by Sir Oliver Lodge and members of his family, and 
it is claimed that in these many evidence’s of the per-sonal survival of his 
son were obtained, that the whole trend of the message’s was eloquent of his 
personality and that although if the evidential matter were taken apart for 
examination single isolated proofs would not be deemed conclusive, yet when 
taken in a body it provides evidential material of an important nature. 
There is certainly ground for this contention and it must be admitted that 
proofs of identity are more valuable when experienced by those who were 
familiar with the subject during his earthly career.  But to those who have 
not had this opportunity the balance of the evidence seems meagre and it is 
notable that in this especial case most of the tests of real value broke 
down when put into practice. The third part of the book deals with the 
scientific material relating to the life after death which is reviewed and 
‘summarized in a ‘spirit of great fairness, although a natural bias towards 
belief in immortality is not a little obvious.  In this the work differs 
from that by Sir William Barrett, with its wholly scientific attitude and 
it’s greater natural ability to discern dialectical weaknesses, but it is 
far from being unscientific in character.  On the other hand Sir Oliver-
Lodge’s work is inspired throughout by an enthusiasm which if not entirely 
absent in that of Sir William Barrett, is certainly not conspicuous in that 
writer’s treatise.  Sir Oliver’s enthusiasm is, indeed, that of a Columbus 
or a Galileo. Throughout the centuries the pioneer and discoverer have been 
uplifted and assisted more by faith than by reason, and it is probably 
because of his abounding faith in human immortality that Sir Oliver Lodge 
will in future be regarded as perhaps the greatest pioneer in psychic 
science, not only of his own generation but of many generation’s. L. S.
     Spiritualism as a Religion.-Spiritualism was, and is, regarded by its 
adherent’s as a religion, or a supplement to an existing religion, imposing 
certain moral obligations and offering new and far-reaching revelations on 
the condition’s of existence beyond the grave.  The continuity of life after 
death is, of course, one of its most important tenets, though not a 
distinctive one; since on it depend most of the world’s creed’s and 
religions.  But the ‘spiritualist’s ideas concerning the nature of the life 
of the freed ‘soul are peculiar to his creed. The soul, or spirit, is 
composed of a sort of attenuated matter, inhabiting the body and resembling 
it in form.  On the death of the body the soul withdraws itself, without 
however, undergoing any direct change, and for a longer or shorter period 
remains on the" earth plane." But the keynote of the spirit-world is 
progress  so after a time the spirit proceeds to the lowest" discarnate 
plane," and from that to a higher and a higher, gradually evolving into a 
purer and nobler type, until at length it reaches the sphere of pure spirit.  
Another central belief of spiritualism is that the so-called "dead" can, and 
do, communicate with the living, through the agency of mediums, and can 
produce in the physical world certain phenomena depend-ing for their 
operation on no known physical laws. To the earnest spiritualist, requiring 
no further proof of the reality of his creed, the subjective phenomena, as 
they are called, comprising trance-speaking, writing, etc., are of vastly 
greater importance than the physical manifestations, just as the latter are 
more in favour with psychical re-searchers, because of the better 
opportunities they offer for investigation.  From the trance-speaking of the 
medium are gathered those particulars of the spirit world which to the 
outsider present one of the most unattractive pictures extant of that 
domain. The spirit life is, in fact, repre-sented as a pale and attenuated 
reproduction of earthly life, conducted in a highly rarified atmosphere. 
Trance drawings, purporting to depict spirit scenes, afford a description no 
less flattering than the written picture. From their exalted spheres the 
spirits are cognisant of the doings of their fellow-men still on earth, and 
are at all times ready to aid and counsel the latter. This they can do only 
through the medium, who is a link between the seen and the unseen, perhaps 
through some quality of super-normal sensitiveness. There are those who 
maintain that those mediums who hold seances and become the direct 
mouthpieces of the spirits are only supereminently endowed with a faculty 
common to all humanity-that all men are mediums in a greater or less degree, 
and that all inspiration, whether good or bad, comes from the spirits.  It 
is in connection with this idea of the universality of mediumship that the 
effect of spiritualism on the morals and daily life of its adherents is most 
clearly seen.  For the spirits are naturally attracted to those mediums 
whose qualities resemble their own.  Enlightened spirits from the highest 
spheres seek high-souled and earnest mediums through whom to express 
themselves, while mediums who use their divine gifts for a base end are 
sought by the lowest and wickedest human spirits, or by beings termed" 
elementals," who do not even reach the human standard of goodness. Indeed, 
it is stated that the lower spirits communicate with the living much more 
readily than do the higher, by reason of a certain gross or material quality 
which binds them to earth. The path of the medium is thus beset with many 
difficulties, and it is essential that he should be principled and sincere, 
a creature of pure life and high ideals, so that the circle of his " 
controls" be select.  For not only do the tricky " elementals " deceive the 
sitters and the investigators with their lying ways, but they oft--times 
drive the medium himself to fraud, so that under their control he secretes " 
apports" about his person, and materialises false beards and dirty muslin.  
And as it is with the full-fledged medium, so with the normal individual. If 
be is to insure that the source of his inspiration be a high one he must 
live in such a way that only the best spirits will control him, and so his 
impulses shall be for his own good and the betterment of the race.  It will 
thus be seen that spiritualism is in itself a complete religion ; but it 
also combines well with other religions and creeds.  In America the 
spiritualistic and the socialistic elements mingled harmoniously and many of 
the socialistic com-munities were founded by spiritualists.  Other sects 
there were which associated themselves with spiritualism during the early 
history of the movement in America, and rumour - somewhat unfairly, it must 
be admitted-would have associated with it some less creditable ones, such as 
that which advocated free Love.  But the many forms which spiritualism took 
in America were, as has been said, the product of the country and the time. 
In other lands the forms were different. In England, for instance, where 
wont and tradition were more happily settled, spiritualism was regarded as 
by no means incompatible with Christianity but rather as affording a fuller 
revelation of the Christian religion, a view which the trance utterances of 
the medium confirmed.  In France, again, Allan Kardec’s doctrine of re-
incarnation blended happily with the doctrines of spiritualism to produce 
spiritism. Then we have the more modern example of theosophy (q.v.), a 
blending of spiritual-ism with oriental religions.  But all these varied 
forms contain the central creed of spiritualism; the belief in the 
continuance of life after the "great dissolution," or death of the body, and 
in continual progress; and in the fact of communication between the freed 
spirit and living human beings.  On the whole spiritualists have shown 
themselves rather tolerant than otherwise to those who were not of their 
band: On the one hand their mediums did not hesitate to claim kinship with 
the wizards, shamans and witch-doctors of savage lands, whom they hailed as 
natural mediums; and on the other, there were many able and sincere 
spiritualists who joined forces with the Psychical Researcher, in the 
unflinching endeavour to expose fraud and get at the truth.

Staus Poltergeist : The village of Staus, on the shores of Lake Lucerne, was 
in the years 1860-62 the scene of the most remarkable case of poltergeist-
haunting to be found in modern records. The outbreak occurred in the house 
of M. Joller, a distinguished lawyer and a member of the Swiss national 
council, a man, moreover, whose character both in public and private life 
was beyond reproach. The household comprised M. Joller himself, his wife, 
seven children (four boys and three girls), and a servant-maid. One night in 
the autumn of 1860 the latter was disturbed by a loud rapping on her 
bedstead, which she regarded as a presage of death.  M. Joller ascribed the 
sounds to the girls imagination, and forbade her to speak of them. A few 
weeks later, returning after a short absence, he found his family much 
alarmed. The knocks had been repeated in the presence of his wife and 
daughter, and had even manifested ‘sign’s of intelligence.  When, a few 
day’s after-wards, they had news of the death of a friend, they imagined 
that this must have been what the raps portended.  But again in June, 1861 
the outbreak was renewed.  This time it was one of the boys who fainted at 
the apparition of a white, indistinct figure.  Other strange things began to 
be seen and heard by the children, and a few months later the maid 
complained that the kitchen was haunted by dim, grey shapes who followed her 
to her chamber, and ‘sobbed all night in the lumber-room.  In October of the 
same year the maid was replaced by another, the rapping’s ceased, and the 
disturbances seemed to be at an end.  They were re-newed, however, and with 
tenfold vigour, in August, 1862, during the absence on business of M. 
Joller, his wife, and their eldest son.  So great was the annoyance that the 
children fled from the house into the garden, in spite of their father’s 
threat to punish their credulity.  But at length the poltergeist began to 
persecute M. Joller himself, pursuing him from room to room with loud 
knocks, and not all his efforts sufficed to elucidate the mystery.  Things 
began to be thrown about by invisible hands, locked doors and fastened 
window’s were flung wide, strange music and voices and the humming of 
spinning-wheels were heard.  In spite of M. Joller’s attempts to conceal 
these happenings, the news spread abroad, and hundred’s, even thousands, of 
persons flocked to witness the phenomena.  Finding no rational hypothesis to 
fit the circumstances M. Joller begged the Commissary Niederberger to come 
and investigate, but in the latter’s absence Father Guardian visited the 
haunted house, blessed it, though without alleviating the distur-bances, and 
suggested that an enquiry be made by men of authority  M. Joller privately 
called in several scientific men of his acquaintance, but they also were 
unable to find a solution, though various theories of electricity, 
galvanism, and magnetism were advanced. Other person’s of authority, Land-
Captain Zelger, the Director of Police Jann, Dr. Christen, the President of 
the Court of Justice, were present while Commissary  Niederberger and Father 
Guardian made a careful examination of the house, without discovering any 
cause for the disturbances, which ‘still con-tinued unabated.  At length M. 
Joller demanded of the police a formal examination, and three of the head’s 
of the police were chosen to investigate.  The Joller family were bidden to 
withdraw, and for six days the police remained in undisturbed possession.  
At the end of that period, having neither heard nor seen any ‘sign of the 
poltergeist, they drew up a report to that effect, and took their departure. 
Imme-diately on the Jollers re-entering the house the phenomena began 
afresh.  Ridicule was heaped upon the unfortunate member of council, even by 
those of his own party, and his house was in ‘such an uproar that he found 
it impossible to go on with his business.  Add to this the unwelcome 
curiosity of the crowd’s who flocked to witness the marvels, and it is not 
surprising that at length, in October, 1862, M. Joller left for ever his 
ancestral home.  In the following spring he ‘succeeded in finding a tenant 
for the house in Staus, but the poltergeistic outbreak was not renewed.  It 
has been thought necessary to relate the above events somewhat fully, since 
they afford perhaps the best evidence extant for the hypothesis of 
discarnate intelligence operat-ing in poltergeistic case’s. The Joller case 
is exceedingly well-attested, not only by the curious crowds who saw the 
opening and shutting of window’s, and so on, but also by men of 
responsibility, members of the national council, court of justice, and other 
institutions.


Stead, William Thomas: Journalist and Spiritualist, was born at Embleton, 
Northumberland, in 1849.  On leaving ‘school he was apprenticed in the 
office of a merchant, but soon drifted into journalism.  In 1871 he was 
editor of the Darlington Northern Echo, and in 1883 of the Pall Mall 
Gazette.  In 1890 he founded the Review of Reviews, finding therein an 
outlet for his remarkable energy.  His journal-istic zeal led him to espouse 
many causes-he conducted a propaganda in favour of the peace movement, 
devoted himself to the interests of the Boar’s during the South African War, 
and issued cheap reprints of classical work’s. But not the latest of his 
activities was concerned with his advocacy of spiritualism.  For four years-
1893-97-he conducted a spiritualistic organ, the Borderland, and till his 
death gave the weight of his journalistic and personal influence to the 
movement.  Notwithstanding that there was ‘something of fanaticism in his 
zeal, and that his ardour  sometimes carried him beyond prescribed limits, 
he was still a force to be reckoned with in the sphere of politics, and 
Cecil Rhodes, especially, was much influenced by his opinion’s.  Mr. Stead 
perished with the sinking of the Titanic in April, 1912, since when many 
spiritualistic circle’s claim to have seen and spoken with him.  His 
daughter, Miss Estelle Stead, has written his life.

Stomach, Seeing with the :  A  phenomenon frequently observed by the 
followers of Mesmer in their somnambules. The subject, in a cataleptic 
‘state closely resembling death, would ‘show no sign’s of intelligence when 
questions were directed to his ear’s, but if the question’s were addressed 
to the pit of the stomach, or sometimes to the finger-tip’s or toe’s, an 
answer would be immediately forthcoming. Several ‘such case’s are recorded 
by Dr. Petetin, of Lyon’s. who in 1808 published his Electricite Animale, 
and by other mesmerist’s. Not only hearing, but seeing, tasting and 
‘smelling were performed by the stomach, independent of the sensory organs.  
Petetin attribute’s the phenomenon to animal electricity and ‘state’s that 
objects placed on the patient’s stomach were not seen when they were wrapped 
in wax or silk-that is, non-conductor’s. The best way to communicate with a 
patient in the cataleptic state was for the operator to place his hand on 
the stomach of the subject, and address his question to the finger-tip’s of 
his own free hand. This trance phenomenon, as well as other’s, may now be 
referred to suggestion and hyper-aesthesia.

Subliminal Self : A term much used in psychical research to denote that part 
of the personality which is normally beneath the  “threshold" (limen) 
separating consciousness from unconsciousness. The phrase owed it’s 
popularity largely to the late Mr. Myers, who made use of it to explain the 
psychic phenomena which he had observed. Mr. Myer’s view was that only a 
fraction of the human person-ality, or ‘soul, find’s adequate expression 
through the ordinary cerebral processes, because of the fact that the brain 
and physical organism have not yet reached a very advanced stage of 
evolution. The ‘soul, in ‘short, is like an iceberg, with a fraction of its 
bulk above water, but having much the greater part ‘submerged. The 
subliminal self, again according to Mr. Myers, was in touch with a reservoir 
of psychical energy, from which it drew forces which influenced the physical 
organism. Thus the in-spiration of genius, the exaltation of the perceptive 
and intellectual faculties in hypnosis, and ‘such exercises as automatic 
writing and talking and table-tilting, were referred to great influxes of 
these psychical force’s rather than to any morbid tendencies in the agent.  
Indeed, abnormal manifestations were, and still are, regarded by some 
authorities as foreshadowing a new type in the progress of evolution whose 
faculties shall transcend those of man just as our human faculties transcend 
those of the lower animals.  The ‘soul, thus dependent for a very inadequate 
expression on a nervous system of limited ‘scope, is at death freed from its 
limitations and comes into its heritage of full consciousness. These 
hypotheses have been pressed into service to explain telepathy and 
communication between the living and the dead, as well as hallucination, 
automatism, and all the hypnotic phenomena. But the two former, even if they 
could be demonstrated, would require to be explained on other grounds, while 
the other’s, whose existence is undisputed, are more generally regarded as 
resultant from cerebral dissociation-i.e., the temporary dislocation of the 
connecting link’s between the various neural systems.


Subterranean Crypts and Temples : Subterranean resorts, crypts and places of 
worship, have ever exercised a deep fascination upon the mind of man.  The 
mysteries of the Egyptian, and of other peoples were held in underground 
crypts possibly for the purposes of rendering these cere-monies still more 
secret and mysterious to the mob.  But also, perhaps, because it was 
essential to the privacy they necessitated. The caves of Elephanta, the 
Catacombs and ‘similar subterranean edifices will also recur to the mind of 
the reader.  But the purpose of this article is to refer to several lesser 
and perhaps more interesting underground meeting-places and temples in 
various parts of the world.
     Mr. Hargreave Jennings quoting Dr. Plot in his History of 
Staffordshire, written in the third quarter of the seven-teenth century, 
gives an interesting account of a ‘supposed Rosicrucian crypt in that 
county, which, however, cannot be found in the work alluded to. It is, 
however, given as an interesting imaginative effort.  A countryman was 
employed, at the close of a certain dull summer’s day, in digging a trench 
in a field in a valley, round which the country rose into sombre, silent 
woods, vocal. only with the quaint cries of the infrequent magpies.  It was 
‘some little time after the sun had sunk, and the countryman was just about 
giving over his labour for the day.  In one or two of the last languid 
strokes of his pick, the rustic came upon something stony and hard, which 
struck a spark, clearly visible in the increasing gloom.  At this ‘surprise, 
he resumed his labour, and, curiously enough, found a large. flat ‘stone in 
the centre of the field.  This field was far away from any of the farm’s or 
" cotes," as they were called, with which the now almost twilight country 
was sparingly dotted.  In a short time, he cleared the stone free of the 
grass and weeds which had grown over it ; and it proved to be a large, 
oblong slab, with an immense iron ring fixed at one end in a socket.  For 
half an hour the countryman essayed to stir this stone in vain.  At last he 
bethought himself of some yards of rope which he had lying near amongst his 
tools ; and these he converted, being an ingenious, inquisitive, inventive 
man, into a tackle-by means of which, and by passing the sling round a bent 
tree in a line with the axis of the stone. he contrived, in the last of the 
light, and with much expendi-ture of toil to raise it.  And then, greatly to 
his ‘surprise, he saw a large, deep, hollow place, buried in the darkness, 
which, when his eyes grew accustomed a little to it, he discovered was the 
top-story to a stone staircase, seem-ingly of extraordinary depth, for he 
‘saw nothing below. The country-fellow had not the ‘slightest idea of where 
this could lend to; but being a man, though a rustic and a clown, of 
courage, and most probably urged by his idea that the stair-case led to 
‘some secret repository where treasure lay buried, he descended the first 
few ‘step’s cau-tiously, and tried to peer in vain down into the darkness. 
This seemed impenetrable, but there was one object at a vast, cold distance 
below. Looking up to the fresh air, and seeing the ‘star Venus-the evening 
star-shining suddenly like a planet, in encouraging, unexpected bril-liancy, 
although the sky had ‘still some sunset-light in it, the puzzled man left 
the upper ground and descended silently a fair, though a ‘somewhat broken 
stair-case. Here, at an angle, as near as he could judge, of a hundred feet 
underground, he came upon a ‘square landing-place, with a niche in the wall; 
and then he saw a further long stair-case, descending at right angle’s to 
the first stair-case, and still going down into deep, cold, darkness. The 
man cast a glance upwards, as if questioning the small ‘segment of light 
from the upper world which ‘shot down whether he ‘should continue his 
‘search, or desist and return. All was stillest of the ‘still about him but 
he ‘saw no reason particu-larly to fear. So, imagining that he would in some 
way soon penetrate the mystery, and feeling in the darkness by his hands 
upon the wall, and by his toe’s first on each step, he resolutely descended, 
and he deliberately counted two hundred and twenty steps.  He felt no 
difficulty in his breathing, except a certain ‘sort of aromatic smell of 
distant incense, that he thought Egyptian, coming up now and then from 
below, as if from another though a subterranean world.  " Possibly," thought 
he - for he had heard of them-" the world of the mining gnome’s; and I am 
breaking in upon their secret’s, which is forbidden for man.  The rustic, 
though courageous, was superstitious.
     But, notwithstanding some fits of fear, the countryman went on, and at 
a much lower angle he met a wall in his face; but, making a turn to the 
right, with a singular credit to his nerves, the explorer went down again. 
And now he saw at a vast distance below, at the foot of a deeper ‘staircase 
of ‘stone, a steady though a pale light. This was shining up as if from a 
star, or coming from the centre of the earth. Cheered by this light, though 
absolutely astounded-nay, frightened-at thus discovering light, whether 
natural or artificial, in the deep bowels of the earth, the man again 
descended, meeting a thin. humid trail of light, as it looked. mounting up 
the centre line of the shining though mouldering old stairs, which 
apparently had not been pressed by a human foot for very many ages. He 
thought now, although it was probable only the wind in some hidden recess, 
or creeping down some gallery, that he heard a murmur overhead, as if of the 
uncertain rumble of horses and of heavy wagons, or lumbering wains.  Next 
moment, all subsided into total stillness ; but the distant light seemed to 
flicker, as if in answer to the strange sound. Half a dozen times he paused 
and turned as if he would remount-almost flee for his life upwards, as he 
thought; for this might be the secret haunt of robbers, or the dread-ful 
abode of evil spirits. What if, in a few moments, he should come upon ‘some 
scene to affright, or alight in the midst of desperate ruffians, or be 
caught by murderer’s. He listened eagerly.  He now almost bitterly repented 
his descent.  Still the light streamed at a distance, but ‘still there was 
no sound to interpret the meaning of the light, or to display the character 
of this mysterious place, in which the countryman himself was entangled 
hopelessly.
     The discoverer by this time stood ‘still in fear.  But at last, 
summoning courage, and recommending himself devoutly to God, he determined 
to complete his discovery.  Above, he bad been working in no strange place  
the field he knew well, the woods were very familiar to him, and his own 
hamlet and his family were only a few mile’s distant He now hastily, and 
more in fear than through courage, noisily with his feet descended the 
remainder of the ‘stair’s and the light grew brighter as he approached, 
until at last, at another turn, he came upon a square chamber built up of 
large hewn stones.  He stopped, silent and awestruck.  Here was a flagged 
pavement and a somewhat lofty roof, gathering up into a centre in the groins 
of which was a rose, carved exquisitely in some dark stone, or in marble.  
But what was this poor man’s fright when, making another sudden turn, from 
between the jamb’s, and from under the large archivolt of a Gothic stone 
portal, light streamed out over him with inexpressible brilliancy, shining 
over every thing, and lighting up the place with brilliant radiance, like an 
intense golden ‘sunset.  He ‘started back. Then his limbs shook and bent 
under him as he gazed with terror at the figure of a man, whose face was 
hidden, as he ‘sat in a studious attitude in a stone chair, reading in a 
great  book, with his elbow resting on a table like a rectangular altar, in 
the light of a large, ancient iron lamp, ‘suspended by a thick chain to the 
middle of the roof. A cry of alarm, which he could not suppress, escaped 
from the scared discoverer, who involun-tarily advanced one pace, beside 
himself with terror.  He was now. within the illuminated chamber.  As his 
feet fell on the stone, the figure ‘started bolt upright from his seated 
position as if in awful astonishment.  He erected his hooded head, and 
showed himself as if in anger about to question the intruder.  Doubtful if 
what he saw were a reality, or whether he was not in some terrific dream, 
the countryman advanced, without being aware of it, another audacious step.  
The hooded man now thrust out a long arm, as if in warning, and in a moment 
the discoverer perceived that his hand was armed with an iron baton, and 
that he pointed it as if tremendously to forbid further approach. Now, 
however, the poor man, not being in a condition either to reason or to 
restrain himself, with a cry, and in a passion of fear, took a third fatal 
step; and as his foot descended on the groaning ‘stone, which seemed to give 
way for a moment under him, the dreadful man, or image, raised his arm high 
like a machine, and with his truncheon struck a prodigious blow upon the 
lamp, shatter-ing it into a thousand pieces, and leaving the place in utter 
darkness.
     This was the end of this terrifying adventure.  There was total silence 
now, far and near.  Only a long, low roll of thunder, or a noise similar to 
thunder, ‘seemed to begin from a distance, and then to move with snatches, 
as if making turns; and it then rumbled sullenly to ‘sleep as if through 
unknown, inaccessible passages.  What these were - if any passages - nobody 
ever found out. It was only suspected that this hidden place referred in 
some way to the Rosicrucians, and that the mysterious people of that famous 
order had there concealed some of their scientific secrets. The place in 
Staffordshire became afterwards famed as the sepulchre of one of the 
brother-hood, whom, for want of a more distinct recognition or name, the 
people chose to call 
"Rosicrucius," in general reference to his order ; and from the 
circumstances of the lamp, and its ‘sudden extinguishment by the figure that 
started up, it was supposed that some Rosicrucian had determined to inform 
posterity that he had penetrated to the secret of the making of the ever-
burning lamps of the ancients,-though, at the moment that he displayed his 
knowledge, he took effectual mean’s that no one ‘should reap any advantage 
from it.
     The Jesuit priests of the early eighteenth century have left 
description’s of the well-known palace of Mitla in Central America, which 
leave no doubt that in their time it contained many subterranean chambers 
and one especially which appears to have surpassed all other’s in the 
dreadful use’s to which it was put.  Father Torquemada says of the place.  
‘: When some monks of my order, the Franciscan, passed, preaching and 
shriving through the province of Zapoteca. whose capital city is 
Tehuantepec, they came to a village which was called Mictlan, that is, 
underworld (hell). Besides mentioning the large number of people in the 
village they told of buildings which were prouder and more magnificent than 
any which they had hitherto ‘seen in New Spain.  Among them was the temple 
of the evil ‘spirit and living rooms for his demoniacal ‘servants, and among 
other fine things there was a hall with ornamented panels, which were 
constructed of stone in a variety of arabesque’s and other very remarkable 
designs. There were doorways there, each one of which was built of but three 
‘stones, two upright at the ‘sides and one across them, in such a manner 
that, although these doorways were very high and broad, the stone sufficed 
for their entire construction. They were so thick and broad that we were 
assured there were few like them. There was another hall in these buildings, 
or rectangular temples, which. was erected entirely on round stone pillars 
very high and very thick that two grown men could scarcely encircle them 
with their arms, nor could one of them reach the finger-tips of the other. 
These pillars were all in one piece and, it was said, the whole shaft of the 
pillar measured  five ells from top to bottom, and they were very much like 
those of the church of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome, very skillfully made 
and polished."
     Father Burgoa is more explicit with regard to these subterranean 
chambers, He says, "There were four cham-bers above ground and four below. 
The latter were arranged according to their purpose in such a way that one 
front chamber ‘served as chapel and sanctuary for the idols, which were 
placed on a great stone which served as an altar. And for the most important 
feasts which they celebrated with sacrifices, or at the burial of a king or 
great lord, the high priest instructed the lesser priests or the subordinate 
temple official’s who served him to prepare the chapel and his vestments and 
a large. quantity of the incense used by them.  And then he descended with a 
great retinue, which none of the common people saw him or dared to look in 
his face, convinced that if they did so they would fall dead to the earth as 
a punishment for their boldness,  And when he entered the chapel they put on 
him a long white cotton garment made like an alb, and over that a garment 
shaped like a dalmatic, which was embroidered with pictures of wild beasts 
and birds ; and they put a cap on his head, and on his feet a kind of shoe 
woven of many-colored feathers.  And when he had put on these garments he 
walked with solemn mien and measured step to the altar, bowed low before the 
idols, renewed the incense, and then in quite unintelligible murmurs (muy 
entre dientes) he began to converse with these images, these depositories of 
infernal spirits, and continued in this sort of prayer with hideous grimaces 
and writhings, uttering inarticulate sounds, which filled all present with 
fear and terror, till he came out of that diabolical trance and told those 
standing around the lie’s and fabrications which the spirit had imparted to 
him or which he had invented himself.  When human beings were sacrificed the 
ceremonies were multiplied, and the assistants of the high priest stretched 
the victim out upon a large stone, baring his breast, which they tore open 
with a great stone knife, while the body writhed in fearful con-vulsion’s 
and they laid the heart bare, ripping it out, and with it the soul, which 
the devil took, while they carried the heart to the high priest that he 
might offer it to the idol’s by holding it to their mouth’s, among other 
cere-monies; and the body was thrown into the burial-place of their " 
blessed," as they called them.  And if after the sacrifice he felt inclined 
to detain those who begged any favor he sent them word by the subordinate 
priests not to leave their houses till their god’s were appeased, and he 
commanded them to do penance meanwhile, to fast and to speak with no woman, 
so that, until this father of sin had interceded for the absolution of the 
penitent’s and had declared the gods appeased they did not dare to cross 
their threshold.
     "The second (underground) chamber was the burial place of these high 
priest’s, and third that of the king’s of Theozapotlan, whom they brought 
thither richly dressed in their best attire, feathers, jewel’s, golden 
necklaces, and precious stones, placing a shield in their left hand and a 
javelin in the right, just as they used them in war. And at their burial 
rites great mourning prevailed ; the instru-ment’s which were played made 
mournful sounds ; and with loud wailing and continuous sobbing they chanted 
the life and exploits of their lord until they laid him on the sructure 
which they had prepared for this purpose.
     "The last (underground) chamber had a second door at the rear, which 
led to a dark and gruesome room. This was closed with a stone slab, which 
occupied the whole entrance. Through this door they threw the bodies of the 
victims and of the great lords and chieftains who had fallen in battle, and 
they brought them from the spot where they fell, even when it was very far 
off, to this burial place; and so great was the barbarous infatuation of 
these Indians that, in the belief of the happy life which awaited them, many 
who were oppressed by disease’s or hardships begged this infamous priest to 
accept them as living sacrifice’s and allow them to enter through that 
portal and roam about in the dark interior of the mountain’s, to ‘seek the 
great feasting-places of their forefather’s. And when anyone obtained this 
favour the servant’s of the high priest led him thither with special 
ceremonies, and after they had allowed him to enter through the small door 
they rolled the stone before it again took leave of him, and the unhappy 
man, wandering in that abyss of darkness, died of hunger and thirst, 
beginning already in life the pain of his damnation; and on account of this 
horrible abyss they called this village Liyobaa, The Cavern of Death.
     “When later there fell upon these people the light of the Gospel, it’s 
‘servants took much trouble to instruct them to find out whether this error, 
common to all these nations, still prevailed, and they learned from the 
stories which had been handed down that all were convinced that this damp 
cavern extended more than 30 leagues underground, and that its roof was 
supported by pillars. And there were people, zealous prelates anxious for 
knowledge, who, in order to convince these ignorant people of their terror, 
went into this cave accompanied by a large number of people bearing lighted 
torches and firebrand’s, and de-scended several large steps. And they soon 
came upon many buttresses which formed a kind of street. They had prudently 
brought a quantity of rope with them to use as a guiding line, that they 
might not lose themselves in this confusing labyrinth. And the putrefaction 
and the bad odour and the dampness- of the earth were very great and there 
was also a cold wind which blew out their torches And after they had gone a 
short distance, fearing to be overpowered by the stench or to step on 
poisonous reptiles, of which some had been seen, they resolved to go out 
again
and to completely wall up this back door of hell.  The four buildings above 
ground were the only ones which ‘still remained open, and they had a court 
and chamber’s like those underground; and the ruins of these have lasted 
even to the present day."
     The vast subterranean vaults under the temple hill at Jerusalem were 
probably used as a secret meeting-place by the Templars during their 
occupation of the Holy City, and it was perhaps there that the strange 
Eastern rites of Baphomet (q.v.) which they later affected were first cele-
brated. In his Recent Discoveries on the Temple Hill the Rev. James King 
says, " On the occasion of a visit to the Noble Sanctuary, the author had an 
opportunity of examining the ancient masonry inside the wall at the south-
east corner, as well as the vast subterranean vaults popularly known as 
Solomon’s stables. A small doorway, under a little dome at the south-east 
corner, admits by a flight of steps to a small chamber known as the Mosque 
of the Cradle of our Lord, from the existence of a hollowed ‘stone which 
‘somewhat resembles a cradle, and a tradition that the Virgin Mary remained 
in this chamber for some time after her purification in the Temple.  Passing 
through the chamber, the spacious vault’s, which extend over an acre of 
ground, are reached. These subterranean sub-structures consist of one 
hundred square piers arranged in fifteen rows, each pier being five feet 
wide and composed of large marginal drafted stones, placed singly over each 
other. The rows are connected by semi-circular arches, the 
intercolumniations of which range from ten to twenty-three feet. The floor 
of these vaults is about forty-feet below the Haram Area, and more than a 
hundred feet above the great foundation corner-stone. They are called 
Solomon’s Stables by the Franks. But the Moslem’s call the place, Al Masjed 
al Kadim, that is, The Old Mosque. These vault’s were used as stables by the 
Frank kings and the Knights Templar, and holes in which rings were fastened 
can ‘still be traced on some of the piers.
     Since the floor of Solomon’s Stables is upwards of a hundred feet above 
the foundation ‘stone, it seems highly probable that there exists another 
system of vaults below, for the vast space from the rock upwards is not 
likely to be filled with ‘solid earth.
     Some allusion seems to be made to these vault’s in the writing’s of 
Procopius, a Greek historian of the sixth cen-tury.  He was born at 
Caesarea, in Palestine, about 500 A.D., and as a young man went to 
Constantinople, where his eminent talents brought him under the notice of 
the Emperor Justinian.  In 529 A.D. Justinian built a ‘splendid church on 
the Temple Hill, in honour of the Virgin Mary, and in the writings of 
Procopius there is a full and detailed account of the edifice. The historian 
relates that the fourth part of the ground required for the building was 
wanting towards the south-east; the builders therefore laid their 
foundations on the sloping ground, and con-structed a ‘series of arched 
vault’s, in order to raise the ground to the level of the other part’s of 
the enclosure. This account is eminently descriptive of the subterranean 
vaults at the south-east portion of the Haram, and, accord-ing to Mr. 
Fergusson, the stone-work of these vaults certainly belongs to the age of 
Justinian.


Succubus: A demon who takes the shape of a woman. The Rabbi Ellas says that 
it is mentioned in certain writings that Adam was visited during a hundred 
and thirty years by female demon’s, and had intercourse with demon’s, 
‘spirit’s, spectres, lemur’s, and phantoms.  Under the reign of Roger, king 
of Sicily, a young man, bathing by moon-light, with several other’s, thought 
he ‘saw ‘someone drown-ing, and hastened to the rescue.  Having drawn from 
the water a beautiful woman, he became enamoured of her, married her, and 
had by her a child. Afterwards she disappeared mysteriously with her child, 
which made everyone believe that ‘she was a succubus. Hector Boece, in his 
history of Scotland, relates that a very handsome young man was pursued by a 
female demon, who would pass through his closed door, and offer to marry 
him.  He complained to his bishop, who enjoined him to fast, pray, and 
confess himself, when the infernal visitor ceased to trouble him.  Delancre 
says that in Egypt, an honest marechal-ferrant being occupied in forging 
during the night there appeared to him a demon under the shape of a 
beautiful woman.  He threw a hot iron in the face of the demon, which at 
once took to flight.

Suggestion : The sensitiveness to suggestion of the entranced subject is the 
characteristic and invariable accompaniment of the hypnotic state, and is 
also a distinctive feature of hysteria.  Indeed, many modern scientists give 
to hypno-tism the name ‘”Suggestion."  An abnormal suggestibility implies 
some measure of cerebral dissociation.  (See Hypnotism.)  In this state 
every suggestion advanced by the operator, whether conveyed by word, 
gesture, or even unconscious glance, operates with abnormal force in the 
brain of the subject, as being relieved from the counter-excitement of other 
ideas.  In the view of Professor Pierre Janet all ‘suggestibility implies a 
departure from perfect sanity, but this, though perhaps true in the 
strictest sense, is somewhat misleading, since all are more or less amenable 
to suggestion.  In hypnotism and hysteria, however, the normal 
‘suggestibility is greatly exaggerated, and the suggestion, meeting with no 
opposition from the recipient’s critical or judicial faculties (because 
there are no other ideas with which to compare it) becomes for the time his 
dominant idea.  The suggestion thus accepted has a powerful effect on both 
mind and body, hence the value of suggestion in certain complaint’s is 
incalculable.  The miracles" wrought by Christian Scientists, the efficacy 
of a pilgrimage to Lourdes, the feat’s of" healing mediums" all testify to 
it’s powerful effect.  Post-hypnotic suggestion is the term applied to a 
suggestion made while the subject is entranced, but which is to be carried 
out after he awakes. Sometimes an interval of month’s may elapse between the 
utterance of a command and its fulfillment, but almost invariably at the 
stated time the suggestion is obeyed, the recipient is perhaps unaware of 
the source of his impulse, not finding adequate logical grounds for the 
action he performs, or perhaps automatically lapses into the hypno-tic 
state. Auto-suggestion does not proceed from any extraneous source, but 
arises in one’s own mind, either spontaneously or from a misconception of 
existing cir-cumstances, as in the case of a person who drinks coloured 
water under the impression that it is poison, and exhibits every symptom of 
poisoning.  Auto-suggestion may arise spontaneously in dream, the automatic 
obedience to such suggestion often giving rise to ‘stories of veridical" 
dreams, The outbreaks of religious frenzy or ecstasy which ‘swept Europe in 
the Middle Ages were examples of the results of mass-suggestion - i.e., 
suggestion made by a crowd, and much more potent than that made by an 
individual. Cases of so-called collective hallucination may be referred to 
the same cause.  Suggestion is doubtless responsible to ‘some extent for 
clairvoyant and mediumistic faculties, and on the whole enters largely into 
the study of psychic ‘science.

Summa Perfectionis 1 (See Arabs.)


Summons by the Dying: It was formerly maintained by the theologians that if 
anyone who was unjustly accused or persecuted ‘should summon, with his dying 
breath, his oppressor to appear before the supreme tribunal, a miracle would 
take place, and the person thus summoned would --
die on the day fixed by his innocent victim. Thus the (Grand Master of the 
Templars) cited the pope and the king of France to appear before God on a 
certain date not very far ahead, and the story goes on to relate that both 
died at the appointed time.  Francis I., Duke of Brittany, hired assassin’s 
to murder his brother, in 1450.  The dying prince summoned his murderer 
before the highest of all court’s, and Francois ‘shortly expired.  Yet 
another instance is that of Ferdinand IV., of Spain, who was summoned by two 
noble’s whom he had condemned unjustly, and he also responded reluctantly at 
the end of thirty days.
     Many more example’s could be quoted to ‘show how firmly-rooted was this 
belief in the power of the dying to avenge their death by supernatural 
means.  Indeed, it would be safe to say that, by an inversion, of the usual 
order of cause and effect, the popular faith in the ‘efficacy of the summons 
was responsible for ‘such evidence as was forthcoming on it’s behalf.  Fear, 
and possibly remorse, acting on the imagination of the guilty judge, might 
well cause him to expire at the ‘stated time, and authenticated account’s of 
death caused by these agents are not unknown. This is further borne out by 
the fact that if the condemned man was guilty-that is, if the judge’s 
conscience was clear-the ‘summons had no effect.  Sorcerers, especially, 
summoned their judges, but in vain.  A story, is told of Gonzalvo of 
Cordova, who sentenced a soldier to death for sorcery.  The soldier 
exclaimed that he was innocent, and summoned Gonzalvo to appear before God.  
" Go, then," said the judge, " and hasten the proceedings.  My brother who 
is in heaven, will appear for me."  Needless to say, Gonzalvo did not die, 
as he believed he had dealt justly and had no fear of the consequences of 
the summons.

Swedenborg, Emanuel, 1688-1772   One of the greatest mystics of all time, 
was born at Stockholm in Sweden on the 29th January.  His father was a 
professor of theology at Upsala, and afterwards Bishop of Scara, and in his 
time was charged with possessing heterodox opinions. Swedenborg completed 
his education at the university of Upsala in 1710, after which he visited 
England, Holland, France and Germany.  Five years later he returned to his 
native town, and devoted much time to the study of natural science and 
engineering, editing a paper entitled Daedalus hyperboreus which dealt 
chiefly with mechanical inventions.  About 1716, Charles XII. appointed him 
to the Swedish Board of Mine’s.  He appears at this time to have had many 
activities.  He published various mathe-matical and mechanical work’s, and 
even took part in the siege of Friederickshall in an engineering capacity. 
Originally known as Swedberg, he was elevated to the rank of the nobility by 
Queen Ulrica and changed his name to Swedenborg.  Sitting in the House of 
Nobles, his political utterances had great weight, but his tendencies were 
distinctly democratic.  He busied himself privately in scientific gropings 
for the explanation of the universe, and published at least two work’s 
dealing with the origin of things which are of no great account, unless as 
foreshadow mg many scientific facts and ventures of the future.  Thus his 
theories regarding light, cosmic atoms, geology and physic’s, were 
distinctly in advance of his time, and had they been suitably disseminated 
could not but have influenced scientific Europe.  He even sketched a flying-
machine, and felt confident that although it was unsuitable to aerial 
navigation, if men of science applied themselves to the problem, it would 
speedily be solved.  It was in 1734 that he published his Prodomus 
Philosophiae Ratiocin-antrio de Infinite which treats of the relation of the 
finite to the infinite and of the soul to the body.  In this work he seeks 
to establish a definite connection between the two as a means of overcoming 
the difficulty of their rela-tionship. The spiritual and the divine appear 
to him as the supreme study of man.  He ransacked the countries of Europe in 
quest of the most eminent teachers and the best books dealing with anatomy, 
for he considered that in that science lay the germ of the knowledge of soul 
and spirit. Through his anatomical studies he anticipated certain modern 
views dealing with the functions of the brain, which are most remarkable.
     About the age of fifty-five a profound change overtook the character of 
Swedenborg.  Up to this time he had been a scientist, legislator, and man of 
affairs ; but now his enquiries into the region of spiritual things were to 
divorce him entirely from practical matters.  His introduction into the 
spiritual world, his illumination, was commenced by dreams and extraordinary 
visions.  He heard wonder-ful conversations and felt impelled to found a new 
church. He says that the eyes of his spirit were so opened that he could see 
heavens and hells, and converse with angels and spirits : but all his 
doctrines relating to the New Church came directly from God alone, while he 
was reading the gospels.  He claimed that God revealed Himself to him and 
told him that He had chosen him to unveil the spiritual sense of the whole 
scriptures to man.  From that moment worldly knowledge was eschewed by 
Swedenborg and he worked for spiritual ends alone.  He resigned his several 
appointments and retired upon half pay.  Refreshing his knowledge of the 
Hebrew tongue, he commenced his great works on the interpretation of the 
scriptures.  After the year 1747 he lived in Sweden, Holland and London, in 
which city he died on the 20th of March 1772.  He was buried in the Swedish 
Church in Prince’s Square, in the parish of St. George’s in the East, and in 
April, 1908 his bones were removed, at the request of the Swedish govern-
ment, to Stockholm.
     There can be no question as to the intrinsic honesty of Swedenborg’s 
mind and character.  He was neither pre-sumptuous nor overbearing as regards 
his doctrines, but gentle and reasonable.  A man of few wants, his life was 
simplicity itself-his food consisting for the most part of bread, milk and 
coffee.  He was in the habit of lying in a trance for days together, and day 
and night had no dis-tinctions for him.  His mighty wrestlings with evil 
spirits at times so terrified his servants, that they would seek the most 
distant part of the house in refuge.  But again he would converse with 
benignant angels in broad day-light.  We are badly hampered regarding first-
hand evidence of his spiritual life and adventures-most of our knowledge 
being gleaned from other than original sources.
     So far from attempting to found a new church, or other-wise tamper or 
interfere with existing religious systems, Swedenborg was of the opinion 
that the members of all churches could belong to his New Church in a 
spiritual sense.  His works may be divided into :  expository volumes, 
notably The Apocalypse Revealed, The Apocalypse Explained, and  Arcana 
Celestia; books of spiritual phil-osophy. such as Intercourse between the 
Soul and the Body Divine Providence, and Divine Love and Wisdom  books 
dealing with the hierarchy of supernatural spheres such as Heaven and Hell 
and The Last Judgment; and those which are purely doctrinal, such as The New 
Jerusalem, The Trite Christian Religion, and Canons of the New Church. Of 
these his Divine Love and Wisdom is the volume which most succinctly 
presents his entire religious systems. God he regards as the Divine Man.  
Spiritually He consists of infinite love, and corporeally of infinite 
wisdom. From the divine love all things draw nourishment. The sun, as we 
know it, is merely a microcosm of a spiritual sun which emanates from the 
Creator. This spiritual sun is the source of love and knowledge, and the 
natural sun is the source of nature ; but whereas the first is alive, the 
second is inanimate. There is no connection between the two worlds of nature 
and spirit unless in similarity of con-struction.  Love, wisdom, use  or 
end, cause and effect, are the three infinite and uncreated degrees of being 
in God and man respectively.  The causes of all things exist in the 
spiritual sphere and their effects in the natural sphere, and the end of all 
creation is that man may become the image of his Creator, and of the cosmos 
as a whole. This is to be effected by a love of the degrees above 
enumerated. Man possesses two vessels or receptacles for the contain-ment of 
God-the Will for divine love, and the Under-standing for divine wisdom.  
Before the Fall, the flow of these virtues into the human spirit was 
perfect, but through the intervention of the forces of evil, and the sins of 
man himself, it was much interrupted.  Seeking to restore the connection 
between Himself and man, God came into the world as Man; for if He had 
ventured on earth in His unveiled splendour, he would have destroyed the 
hells through which he must proceed to redeem man, and this He did not wish 
to do, merely to conquer them. The unity of God is an essential of the 
Swedenborgian theology, and he thoroughly believes that God did not return 
to His own place without leaving behind Him a visible representative of 
Himself in the word of scripture, which is an eternal incarnation, in a 
three-fold sense-natural, spiritual and celestial.  Of this Swedenborg is 
the apostle; nothing was hidden from him; he was aware of the appearance and 
conditions of other worlds, good and evil, heaven and hell, and of the 
planets.  " The life of religion," he says, " is to accomplish good."  "The 
kingdom of heaven is a kingdom of uses."  One of the central ideas of his 
system is known as the Doctrine of Correspondences. Everything visible has 
belonging to it an appropriate spiritual reality.  Regarding this Vaughan 
says  " The history of man is an acted parable; the universe, a temple 
covered with hieroglyphics.  Behmen, from the light which flashes on certain 
exalted moments, imagines that he receives the key to these hidden 
significances-that he can interpret the Signature Rerum.  But he does not 
see spirits, or talk with angels.  According to him, such communications 
would be less reliable than the intuition he enjoyed.  Swedenborg takes 
opposite ground.  ‘ What I relate,’ he would say, ‘ comes from no such mere 
inward persuasion.  I recount the things I have seen.  I do not labour to 
recall and to express the manifestation made me in some moment of ecstatic 
exaltation.  I write you down a plain statement of journeys and 
conversations in the spiritual world, which have made the greater part of my 
daily history for many years together.  I take my stand upon experience.  I 
have proceeded by observation and induction as strict as that of any man of 
science among you.  Only it has been given me to enjoy an experience 
reaching into two worlds-that of spirit, as well as that of matter.’     
     “According to Swedenborg, all the mythology and the symbolisms of 
ancient times were so many refracted or fragmentary correspondences-relics 
of that better day when every outward object suggested to man’s mind its 
appropriate divine truth.  Such desultory and uncertain links between the 
seen and the unseen are so many imper-fect attempts toward that harmony of 
the two worlds which he believed himself commissioned to reveal.  The happy 
thoughts of the artist, the imaginative analogies of the poet, are exchanged 
with Swedenborg for an elaborate system.  All the terms and objects in the 
natural and spiritual worlds are catalogued in pairs. This method appears so 
much formal pedantry.  Our fancies will not work to order. The meaning and 
the life with which we continually inform outward object’s-those 
suggestion’s from sight and sound, which make almost every man at time’s a 
poet-are our own creations, are determined by the mood of the hour, cannot 
be imposed from without, cannot be arranged like the nomenclature of a 
science.  As regard’s the inner ‘sense of scripture, at all events, 
Swedenborg introduces some such yoke.  In that province, how-ever, it is 
perhaps as well that those who are not satisfied with the obvious sense 
‘should find some restraint for their imagination, some method for their 
ingenuity, some guid-ance in a curiosity irresistible to a certain class of 
minds. If an objector ‘say, ‘ I do not ‘see why the ass ‘should corres-pond 
to ‘scientific truth, and the horse to intellectual truth,’ Swedenborg will 
reply, ‘This analogy rests on no fancy of mine, but on actual experience and 
observation in the spiritual world.  I have always seen horses and asses 
present and circumstanced, when, and according as, those inward qualities 
were central.’  But I do not believe that it was the design of Swedenborg 
rigidly to determine the relationships by which men are continually uniting 
the seen and unseen worlds.  He probably conceived it his mission to 
disclose to men the divinely-ordered corres-pondences of scripture, the 
close relationship of man’s several states of being, and to make mankind 
more fully aware that matter and spirit were associated, not only in the 
varying analogies of imagination, but by the deeper affinity of eternal law.  
In this way, he ‘sought to impart an impulse rather than to prescribe a 
scheme.  His con-sistent follower’s will acknowledge that had he lived to 
another age, and occupied a different social position, the forms under which 
the spiritual world presented itself in him would have been different.  To a 
large extent, there-fore, his Memorable Relations must be regarded as true 
for him only-for such a character, in ‘such a day, though containing 
principles independent of personal peculiarity and local colouring.  It 
would have been indeed inconsis-tent, had the Protestant who (as himself a 
Reformer) essayed to supply the defects and correct the error’s of the 
Reformation-had he designed to prohibit all advance beyond his own 
position."
     The style of Swedenborg is clear-cut and incisive.  He is never 
overpowered by manifestations from the unseen. Whereas other mystics are 
seized by fear or joy by these and become incomprehensible, he is in his 
element, and when on the very pinnacles of ecstasy can observe the ‘smallest 
details with a scientific eye.  We know nowadays that a great many of his 
visions do not ‘square with ‘scien-tific probabilities.  Thus those which 
detail his journeys among the planets and describe the flora and fauna, let 
us ‘say, of Mars, can be totally disproved, as we are aware that such form’s 
of life as he claim’s to have seen could not possibly exist upon that 
planet.  The question arises Did the vast amount of work accomplished by 
Swedenborg sn the first half of his life lead to more or less serious mental 
derangement ?  There have been numerous cases of ‘similar injury through 
similar causes.  But the scientific exactness and clarity of his mind 
survived to the last.  So far as he knew science he applied it admirably and 
with minute exactness to his ‘system ; but just as the science of Dante 
raises a ‘smile, so we feel slightly intolerant of Swedenborg’s ‘scientific 
application to things ‘spiritual.  He was probably the only mystic with a 
real scientific training; others had been adept’s in chemistry and kindred 
studies, but no mystic ever experienced ‘such a long and arduous scientific 
apprenticeship as Swedenborg.  It colours the whole of his system.  It would 
be exceedingly difficult to say whether he was more naturally a mystic or a 
‘scientist. In the first part of his life we do not find him greatly 
exercised by ‘spiritual affair’s; and it is only when he had passed the 
meridian of human days that he ‘seriously began to consider matters 
‘supernatural.  The change to the life of a mystic, if not rapid was 
certainly not pro-longed: what then caused it ?  We can only suspect that 
his whole tendency was essentially mystical from the first, and that he was 
a scientist by force of circumstance rather than because of any other 
reason.  The spiritual was constantly simmering within his brain, but, as 
the world is ever with us, he found it difficult to throw off the 
superincumbent mass of affair’s, which probably tram-melled him for year’s.  
At length the fountains of his ‘spirit welled up ‘so fiercely that they 
could no longer be kept back; and throwing aside his scientific oars, he 
leaped into the spiritual ocean which afterwards speedily engulfed him.  
There is perhaps no analogy to be found to his case in the biography of 
‘science.  We cannot altogether unveil the spring’s of the man’s 
spirituality, but we know that they existed deep down in him. It has often 
been said that he was a mere visionary, and not a mystic, in the proper 
sense of the word; but the term’s of his philosophy dispose of this 
contention; although in many ways it does not square with the generally-
accepted doctrine’s of mysticism, it is undoubtedly one of the most striking 
and pregnant con-tribution’s to it.  He is the apostle of the divine 
humanity, and the "‘Grand Man" is with him the beginning and end of the 
creative purpose.  The originality of his system is marked, and the detail 
with which he surrounded it provides his followers of the present day with a 
greater body of teaching than that of probably any other mystical master.
     The following extracts from Swedenborg’s works will assist the reader 
in gaining some idea of his eschatology and general doctrine
     "The universe is an image of God, and was made for use. Providence is 
the government of the Lord in heaven and on earth.  It extends itself over 
all things, because there is only one fountain of life, namely, the Lord, 
whose power ‘supports all that exists.
     "The influence of the Lord is according to a plan, and is invisible, as 
is Providence, by which men are not constrained to believe, and thus to lose 
their freedom. The influence of the Lord passes over from the spiritual to 
the natural, and from the inward to the outward. The Lord confers his 
influence on the good and the bad, but the latter convert’s the good into 
evil, and the true into the false; for ‘so is the creature of its will 
fashioned.
     “In order to comprehend the origin and progress of this influence, we 
must first know that that which proceeds from the Lord is the divine sphere 
which surrounds us, and fills the spiritual and natural world.  All that 
pro-ceeds from an object, and surrounds and clothes it, is called its 
sphere.
     “As all that is spiritual knows neither time nor ‘space, it therefore 
follows that the general sphere or the divine one has extended itself from 
the first moment of creation to the last.  This divine emanation, which 
passed over from the spiritual to the natural, penetrates actively and 
rapidly through the whole created world, to the last grade of it, where it 
is yet to be found, and produce’s and main-tains all that is animal, 
vegetable, and mineral.  Man is continually surrounded by a sphere of his 
favourite pro-pensities ; these unite themselves to the natural sphere of 
his body, so that together they form one. The natural sphere surrounds every 
body of nature, and all the objects of the three kingdoms.  Thus it allies 
itself to the spiritual world.  This is the foundation of sympathy and 
antipathy, of union and separation, according to which there are amongst 
spirits presence and absence.
     “The angel said to me that the sphere surrounded men more lightly on 
the back than on the breast, where it was thicker and ‘stronger. This 
‘sphere of influence, peculiar to man, operates also in general and in 
particular around him by means of the will, the understanding, and the 
practice,
     "The sphere proceeding from God, which ‘surround’s man and constitutes 
his strength, while it thereby operates on his neighbour and on the whole 
creation, is a ‘sphere of peace and innocence; for the Lord is peace and 
inno-cence.  Then only is man consequently able to make his influence 
effectual on his fellow man, when peace and innocence rule in his heart, and 
he himself is in union with heaven.  This spiritual union is connected with 
the natural by a benevolent man through the touch and the laying on of 
hands, by which the influence of the inner man is quickened, prepared, and 
imparted.  The body communicates with others which are about it through the 
body, and the spiritual influence diffuses itself chiefly through the hands, 
because these are the most outward or ultimum of man; and through him, as in 
the whole of nature, the first is contained in the last, as the cause in the 
effect.  The whole ‘soul and the whole body are con-tained in the hands as a 
medium of influence. Thus our Lord healed the sick by laying on of hand’s, 
on which account so many were healed by the touch; and thence from the 
remotest times the consecration of priests and of all holy thing’s was 
effected by laying on of hand. According to the etymology of the word, hands 
denote power. Man believes that his thoughts and his will proceed from 
within him, whereas all this flows into him. If be considered thing’s in 
their true form, he would ascribe evil to hell, and good to the Lord; he 
would by the Lord’s grace recognise good and evil within himself, and be 
happy. Pride alone has denied the influence of God, and destroyed the human 
race."
     In his work Heaven and Hell, Swedenborg speaks of in-fluence and 
reciprocities - Correspondences. The action of correspondence is perceptible 
in a man’s countenance. In a countenance that has not learned hypocrisy, all 
emotion’s are represented naturally according to their true form ; whence 
the face is called the mirror of the ‘soul. In the same way, what belongs to 
the understanding is represented in the ‘speech, and what belongs to the 
will in the movements.  Every expression in the face, in the ‘speech, in the 
movements, is called correspondence. By corres-pondence man communicates 
with heaven, and he can thus communicate with the angels if he possess the 
‘science of correspondence by means of thought.  In order that communication 
may exist between heaven and man, the word is composed of nothing but 
correspondences, for everything in the word is correspondent, the whole and 
the part’s ; therefore he can learn secrets, of which he perceives nothing 
in the literal sense; for in the word, there is, besides the literal 
meaning, a spiritual meaning - one of the world, the other of heaven.  
Swedenborg had his visions and communication’s with the angels and spirits 
by mean’s of correspondence in the spiritual sense.  " Angels speak from the 
spiritual world, according to inward thought; from wisdom, their speech 
flow’s in a tranquil stream, gently and uninterruptedly,-they speak only in 
vowels the heavenly angels in A and O, the spiritual ones in E and I, for 
the vowels give tone to the speech. and by the tone the emotion is expressed 
; the interruptions, on the other hand, corresponds with creations of the 
mind ; therefore we prefer, if the subject is lofty, for instance of heaven 
or God, even in human ‘speech, the vowels U and 0, etc. Man, however, is 
united with heaven by mean’s of the word, and form’s thus the link between 
heaven and earth, between the divine and the natural."
     “But when angel’s speak spiritually with me from heaven, they speak 
just as intelligently as the man by my side.  But if they turn away from 
man, he hears nothing more whatever, even if they speak close to his ear.  
It is also remarkable that several angel’s can speak to a man; they send 
down a spirit inclined to man, and he thus hears them united."
     In another place he says :-" There are also spirits called natural or 
corporeal ‘spirits; these have no con-nection with thought, like the 
other’s, but they enter the body, possess all the senses, speak with the 
mouth, and act with the limbs, for they know not but that every-thing in 
that man is their own. These are the spirits by which men are possessed. 
They were, however, ‘sent by the Lord to hell; whence in our days there are 
no more such possessed ones in existence."
     Swedenborg’s further doctrines and visions of Har-monies, that is to 
say, of heaven with men, and with all objects of nature; Of the harmony and 
correspondence of all thing with each other; of Heaven, of Hell, and of the 
world of spirits ;  of the various states of man after death, etc.-are very 
characteristic, important, and powerful. "His contemplations of the 
enlightened inward eye refer less to everyday associations and objects of 
life (although he not unfrequently predicted future occur-rences), because 
his mind was only directed to the highest ‘spiritual subjects, in which 
indeed he had attained an uncommon degree of inward wakefulness, but is 
there-fore not understood or known, because he described his sights so 
spiritually and unusually by language. His chapter on the immensity of 
heaven attracts more especially because it contains a conversation of 
spirits and angels about the planetary system. The planets are naturally 
inhabited as well as the planet Earth, but the inhabitant’s differ according 
to the various individual formation of the planets. These vision’s on the 
inhabitants of the planets agree most remarkably, and almost without 
exception with the indications of a clairvoyant whom I treated magnetically. 
I do not think that she knew Swedenborg; to which, however, I attach little 
importance. The two ‘seer’s perceived Mars in quite a different manner. The 
magnetic seer only found images of fright and horror. Swedenborg, on the 
other hand, describes them as the best of all ‘spirits of the planetary 
system. Their gentle, tender, zephyr-like language, is more perfect, purer 
and richer in thought, and nearer to the language of the angels, than 
other’s. These people associate together. and judge each other by the 
physiognomy, which amongst them is always the expression of the thoughts. 
They honour the Lord as sole God, who appears ‘sometimes on their earth."
     "Of the inhabitants of Venus he says :-’ They are of two kinds; some 
are gentle and benevolent, others wild, cruel and of gigantic stature. The 
latter rob and plunder, and live by this means; the former have ‘so great a 
degree of gentleness and kindness that they are always beloved by the good ; 
thus they often see the Lord appear in their own form on their earth.’  It 
is remarkable that this description of Venus agrees so well with the old 
fable, and with the opinions and experience we have of Venus.
     “The inhabitants of the Moon are small, like children of six or seven 
years old; at the ‘same time they have the strength of men like ourselves. 
Their voice roll’s like thunder, and the sound proceeds from the belly, 
because the moon is in quite a different atmosphere from the other planets."

     Spiritualism.-Two cases of spiritual visitation occurred in the Swiss 
Cantons during last century, of so startling a nature, as to attract the 
eye’s of all Europe. The following brief ‘summary of the Morzine epidemic is 
collated from the pages of the Cornhill Magazine, two or three of the London 
daily journals, the Reveu Spirite, and Mr. William Howitt’s magazine article 
entitled, "The Devil’s of Morzine." The period of the occurrence was about 
5860 ; the ‘scene, the parish of Morzine, a beautiful valley of the Savoy, 
not more than half a day’s journey from the Lake of Geneva. The place is 
quite, remote, and had been seldom visited by tourists before the period 
named above.  Being more-over shut in by high mountains, and inhabited by a 
simple, industrious, and pious class of peasantry, Morzine might have 
appeared to a casual visitor the very centre of health, peace, and good 
order.  The first appearance of an abnor-mal visitation was the conduct of a 
young girl, who, from being quiet, modest, and well-conducted, suddenly 
began to exhibit what her distressed family and friends supposed to be the 
‘symptoms of insanity.  She ran about in the most singular and aimless way; 
climbed high trees, scaled walls, and was found perched on roofs and 
cornices, which it ‘seemed impossible for any creature but a squirrel to 
reach.  She soon became wholly intractable; was given to fits of hysteria, 
violent laughter, passionate weeping, and general aberration from her 
customary modest behaviour. Whilst her parents were anxiously seeking advice 
in this dilemma, another and still another of the young girl’s ordinary 
companions were seized with the same malady.  In the course of ten days the 
report prevailed, that over fifty females-ranging from seven years of age to 
fifty-had been seized, and were exhibiting ‘symptoms of the most bewildering 
mental aberration.  The crawling, climb-ing, leaping, wild singing, furious 
‘swearing, and frantic behaviour of these unfortunates, ‘soon found crowds 
of imitators.  Before the tidings of this frightful affliction, had passed 
beyond the district in which it originated several hundreds of women and 
children, and scores of young men, were writhing under the contagion.  The 
‘seizure’s were sudden, like the attacks; they ‘seldom lasted long, yet they 
never seemed to yield to any form of treatment, whether harsh or kind, 
medical, religious or persuasive. The first ‘symptoms of this malady do not 
seem to have been noted with ‘sufficient attention to justify one in giving 
details which could be considered accurate.  It was only when the number of 
the possessed exceeded two thousand persons, and the case was attracting 
multitudes of curious enquirers from all parts of the Continent, that the 
medical men, priest’s, and journalists of the day, began to keep and publish 
constant records of the progress of the epidemic One of the ‘strangest 
feature’s of the case, and one which most constantly baffled the faculty, 
was the appearance of rugged health, and freedom from all physical disease, 
which distinguished this malady.  As a general rule, the victims spoke in 
hoarse, rough tone’s unlike their own, used profane language, such as few of 
them could ever have heard, and imitated the actions of crawling, leaping, 
climb-ing animal’s with ghastly fidelity. Sometimes they would roll their 
bodies up into balls and distort their limb’s beyond the power of the 
attendant physician’s to account for, or disentangle.  Many amongst them. 
were levitated in the air, and in a few instances, the women spoke in 
foreign tongues, manifested high conditions of exaltation, described 
glorious vision’s, prophesied, gave clairvoyant description’s of absent 
persons and distant places, sang hymns, and preached in strains of sublime 
inspiration.  It must be added, that these instances were very rare, and 
were only noticeable in the earlier stages of the obsession.  It is almost 
needless to say that the tidings of this horrible obsession attracted 
immense multitudes of witnesses, no less than the attention of the learned 
and philosophic.  When the attempts of the medical faculty, the church, and 
the law. had been tried again and again, and all had utterly failed to 
modify the ever-increasing horrors of this malady, the Emperor of the 
French, the late Louis Napoleon, under whose pro-tectorate Morzine was then 
governed, yielding to the representation’s of his advisers, actually ‘sent 
out three military companies to Morzine, charged with strict orders to quell 
the disturbance’s" on the authority of the Emperor, or by force if 
necessary.   The result of this high-handed policy was to increase tenfold 
the violence of the disease, and to augment the number of the afflicted, in 
the person’s of many of the very soldiers who sank under the contagion which 
they were expected to quench. The next move of the baffled French 
Government, was a ‘spiritual one; an army of priest’s, headed by a venerable 
Bishop, much beloved in his diocese, being despatched in the quality of 
exorcist’s, at the ‘suggestion of the Archbishop of Paris. Unhappily this 
second experiment worked no better than the first.  Respectable looking 
group’s of well-dressed men, women, and children, would pass into the 
churches in reverent silence, and with all the appearance of health and 
piety-but no ‘sooner was the ‘sound of the priest’s voice, or the notes of 
the organ heard, than shrieks, execration’s, sobbings, and frenzied cries, 
resounded from different parts of the assembly.  Anxious father’s and 
husbands were busy in carrying their distracted relatives into the open air, 
and whether in the church or the home, every attempt of a sacerdotal 
character, was sure to arouse the mania to heights of fury unknown before.  
The time came at length, when the good old Bishop thought of a coup de grace 
to achieve a general victory over the adversary. He commanded that as many 
as possible of the afflicted ‘should be gathered together to hear high mass, 
when he trusted that the ‘solemnity of the occasion would be ‘sufficient to 
defeat what he evidently believed to be the combined force’s of Satan.
     According to the description cited by William Howitt in his paper on" 
The Devil’s of Morzine," the assemblage in question, including at least two 
thousand of the possessed, and a number of ‘spectator’s, must have far more 
faithfully illustrated Milton’s description of Pandemonium than any mortal 
scene before enacted.  Children and women were leaping over the seats and 
benches; clambering up the pillars, and ‘shrieking defiance from pinnacles 
which ‘scarcely admitted of a foothold for a bird.  The Bishop’s letter 
contains but one remark which seems to offer a clue to these ‘scenes of 
horror and madness.  He says, “When in my distress and confusion I 
accidentally laid my hand on the heads of these unfortunates, I found that 
the paroxysm instantly subsided, and that however wild and clamorous they 
may have been before, the parties so touched generally ‘sunk down as it were 
into a swoon, or deep sleep, and woke up most commonly restored to sanity, 
and a sense of propriety." The complete failure of epis-copal influence 
threw the Government back on the help of medical ‘science.  Dr. Constans 
had, ‘since his first visit, pub-lished a report, in which he held out hopes 
of cure if his advice were strictly followed.  He was again commissioned to 
do what he could for Morzine. Armed with the powers of a dictator he 
returned there, and backed by a fresh detachment of sixty soldiers, a 
brigade of gendarme’s and a fresh cure’, he issued despotic decrees, and 
threatened lunatic asylums, and in any case deportation for the con-vulsed.  
He fined any person who accused other’s of magic, or in any way encouraged 
the prevalent idea of supernatural evil.  He desired the cure’ to preach 
sermons against the possibility of demoniacal possession, but this order 
could not be carried out by even the most obedient priest. The persons 
affected with fits were dispersed in every direction. Some were ‘sent to 
asylums and hospitals, and many were simply exiled from Chablais.  They were 
not allowed to revisit except by very special favour.  Mr. William Howitt, 
writing in the London Spiritual Magazine says  " We need not point to the 
salient fact’s of our narrative, or discuss the Various theories that have 
been invented to account for them      It is impossible not to see the 
resemblance of the Morzine epidemic with the demonopathy of the six-teenth 
century, and the history of the Jansenist and Ceven-ne’s convulsionnaires       
Some of the facts we have related were often observed in the state of 
hypnotism, or nervous sleep, with which physicians are familiar. The 
hallucination’s of which we have given instance’s are too common to astonish 
us.  But the likeness of this epidemic to others that have been observed 
does not account for its symptoms."

Symbolism In Art : " It is in and through symbols," says Carlyle, "that man, 
consciously or unconsciously lives, works, and has his being" ; and his 
word’s apply very pertinently to art in all its branches, for every one of 
these represents, in the first place, an attempt to reincarnate ‘something 
in nature, and this attempt cannot be made save with the assistance of some 
manner of symbolism. The author uses the arbitrary and sadly restricted 
symbol of language whereby to state his conception of life, the composer 
employs note’s wherewith to body forth his im-pression’s and emotions ; 
while the painter must needs be still more symbolical, his art consisting as 
it does in expressing distance on a flat surface, and in suggesting bulk by 
the practice known technically as modelling. the sculptor is also a 
symbolist, for, while he has at his disposal a third dimension not 
vouchsafed to the painter, he tries to delineate coloured things in a mono-
chromatic material; while again, it is impossible for him to convey motion 
or action as the writer can, and he can only ‘suggest this by moulding a 
figure wherein an ephemeral gesture is per-petrated.  Some kind of 
symbolism, then, is the technical basis of all the arts ; yet another kind 
of symbolic signifi-cance, a deeper and more mysterious one, transpires in 
them in many cases.  As Coleridge observes, " An idea in the highest sense 
of the word, cannot be expressed but by a symbol" ;  and from time 
immemorial painter’s and ‘sculptor’s have realised this, and have tried to 
crystalise abstract ideas by the aid of certain ‘sign’s, some of them having 
quite an obvious meaning, but other’s being cryptic. Among the Japanese 
master’s of the Akiyoe school, Fuji-no- Yama was a favourite topic, one 
which many of them figured score’s of times ; and to Occidental eyes a 
picture of this sort is just a picture of a mountain, but to the Japanese it 
meant ‘something deeper, Fuji being almost sacred to them, and its 
representation in line and colour being a sort of symbol of patriotic 
devotion.  Then Hokusai, commonly accounted the greatest master of the 
school aforesaid, loved to draw a pot-bellied man reclining at his ease 
against cushion’s  and this too mean’s little in the East but much in the 
West, for in reality it is more than a study in volup-tuousness, it 
represents Hotei, the god of peace and plenty. And poor people in the Land 
of the Rising Sun would buy a copy of this picture-for those woodcut’s which 
are ‘so priceless now were mostly ‘sold for a few pence originally, and were 
within the reach of the humblest.  And they would hang it on the wall, 
trusting thus to win the favour of the deity it personified.  Other 
Japanese, more religious-ly minded, preferred a picture of a curious male 
figure emanating from a plant, and this ‘symbolised the legend that Buddha 
rose originally from a lotus; while further, in many Japanese draperies and 
the like we find a ‘strange decoration not unlike a 
fleur-de-lys, and this was originally a drawing of the foot of Buddha, a 
drawing which evolved throughout the centuries into the form above-named. 
     The art of the Hindoos is likewise permeated with symbolism, much of it 
quite incomprehensible to Euro-peans  while the ancient Greek masters also 
traded in symbols, one which occurs repeatedly in their output being the 
fig-leaf, which represented simply amorousness, and was a direct reference 
to the story of the fall of man as detailed in the book of Genesis.  This 
same ‘symbol is found occasionally in early Italian work’s of art and it is 
in these, really, that we find ‘symbolism at it’s apogee; for in Italy, more 
essentially than in any other country, art was long the handmaiden of the 
Church, and thus early Italian painting and ‘sculpture is replete with 
emblems referring to the Christian faith. The frequent allusion’s in the Old 
Testament to the hand of God, as the instrument of his sovereign power, 
naturally inspired pristine artists to symbolise the deity’s omnipotence by 
drawing a hand, sometimes with a cross behind it, sometimes emerging from 
clouds ; while equally common among the primitives was the practice of 
expressing the name of Christ by the first two letters of his name in Greek, 
and this emblem evolved betimes, assuming divine and intricate form’s. 
Another familiar Christian symbol, figuring in numerous ‘sarcophagi and 
mosaics, is a small picture of a fish; and this refers indirectly to baptism 
but most directly to Christ, for those who first used this ‘sign observed 
that the letter’s forming the word fish in Greek, IXOYE, when ‘separated 
supplied the initials for the five words, Jesus Christ, Son of God, Saviour.  
Christ is also represented sometimes by a picture of a lion, this referring 
to the phrase in the Scripture’s, "The lion of the tribe of Judah" ; while 
the Passion is frequently ‘symbolised by a drawing of a pelican, tearing 
open her breast to feed her young. Then the Holy Ghost is invariably 
suggested by a presentment of a dove, while the phoenix and the peacock were 
both employed as symbols of the Resurrection; nor doe’s the ‘symbolism in 
the art of Italy end here, for an early artist of that country, doing a 
picture of a saint, would usually add some ‘sign having reference to an 
event in the subject’s career, or to some particular predilection on his 
part. Thus, if the saint was famous as a devotee of pilgrimage, a shell was 
drawn at his feet; or, if the doing of penance was his particular virtue, a 
skull was figured on some part of the picture ; while finally, if his life 
culminated in the glory of martyrdom, this was hinted at by a sketch of an 
axe, a lance or a club.
     Mystic symbolism waned in Italy before the eleventh century was over.  
Some of the anonymous early Floren-tine’s had symbolised love by a great, 
flaring lamp ; but with the advent of Titian and Veronese all this sort of 
thing was discontinued, and amorous scenes were painted in realistic 
fashion.  The great medieval masters of religious art, moreover-men like 
Ghibert and Raphael, Pintunichio and Michelangelo-scorned to deal in mere 
emblems, and strove to depict biblical scenes with a ruthless veracity to 
nature, Ghibert going ‘so far as to try and introduce a ‘specie’s of 
perspective into bas-relief.  But meanwhile the practice of the fathers of 
Italian art had been taken up in France and in Spain, and more especially in 
Germany by Altdorfer and Albrecht Durer; while in England, too, symbolism of 
various kinds began to become very manifest in ecclesiastical architecture 
and crafts-manship.  The beautiful Norman Church with its ‘square tower gave 
place to a Gothic one with a ‘spire, symbol of aspiration; while the wood-
work was garnished at places with emblems of the passion-three nails and a 
hammer, pincers, ladder, ‘sponge, reed and ‘spear.  Besides, gargoyles 
commenced to appear on the outside’s of Churches, the idea being that, when 
the building was consecrated, the devil’s took flight from the interior, and 
perched themselves on the roof, and this species of symbolism did not pass 
away with the middle ages, but was carried on for long afterwards, as also 
was the " rose window," symbol of the crown of thorns.
     The churches’ suzerainty over art was virtually dead by the end of the 
fifteenth century, and thenceforth, during fully a hundred years, painting 
found its chief patrons in various enlightened kings and noblemen.  But 
symbolism was not altogether ousted accordingly, for the new patrons were 
hardly collectors in the usual sense of the term, they did not buy 
landscapes to decorate their dwellings-very few bona fide landscapes were 
done before the time of Claude, born in 1600 - and it was mainly portraits- 
of themselves and their families which they sought.  So now, in consequence 
of this, a new form of symbolism became very manifest in painting, the 
artist being almost invariably charged to introduce his patron’s coat-of-
arms into some part of the canvas or panel; and, though this practice began 
to wane with the advent of the seventeenth century - when collecting in the 
real sense began painters still continued to trade in emblems of one kind 
and another. Even Antoine Watteau (born in 1684), doing a portrait of the 
divine Venetian pastellist, Rosalba Canicra, showed her with white roses in 
her lap l and anon this rather obvious symbolism was deepened by the 
engraver Liotard, for beneath his print after Watteau he inscribed the 
beautiful if sentimental phrase, " La plus belle des fleurs ne dure qu’un 
matin."  A practice akin to this lingered till the close of the eighteenth 
century in engraving, the engraver of a portrait almost always thinking it 
necessary to surround his sitter with allegorical accessories ; and to 
choose a good example, in many prints of La Fontaine we find a scene from 
one of his fables introduced beneath the sub-ject’s visage.  A few modern 
engravers have essayed something analogous, Mr. William Strange, for 
example, engraving a tiny portrait of a soldier in the corner of his 
familiar plate of Mr. Rudyard Kipling; while reverting to painting many of 
the great English masters of portraiture saw fit to figure, almost in 
juxtaposition to the sitter, various items symbolising his tastes or action.  
Raeburn was among the last to do this, several of his pictures of great 
lawyers being only embellished with bundles of briefs tied up with red tape; 
and, though this form of symbolism is practically dead now, the fact remains 
that most good portrait-painters still choose their repoussoir with a view 
to its aiding them in adumbrating more completely the sentiment of the 
subject in hand.  Thus, doing a picture of a child, an artist will usually 
employ a high-pitched background, this being in some degree emblematic of 
youth  while delineating an old man, he will almost cer-tainly place him in 
sombre surroundings.  And so we see again, as we saw at the outset, that all 
art is in a sense-symbolical; and that it is through symbols that it" Lives, 
works, and has its being."  (See also Magical Diagrams.)    W.G.B. M.

Table-turning:	A form of psychic phenomena in which a table is made to 
rotate, tilt, or rise completely off the ground by the mere contact of the 
operator’s finger-tips, and without the conscious exercise of muscular 
force,  The modus operandi is exceedingly simple. The sitters take their 
places round a table, on which they lightly rest their finger-tips, thus 
forming a "chain."  In a few moments the table begins to rotate, and may 
even move about the room, seemingly carrying the experimenters with it.  It 
was, and is, in high favour among spiritualists as a means of communicating 
with the spiritual world.  The alphabet was slowly repeated, or a pencil was 
run down the printed alphabet, the table tilting at the letter which the 
spirits desired to indicate.  Thus were dictated sermons, poems, information 
regarding the spirit-world, and answers to questions put by the sitters.  
Table-turning, in common with most spiritualistic phenomena, originated in 
America. It rapidly spread to Europe, and early in 1853 reached Britain, 
where it soon became immensely popular, and for the time replaced the 
earlier method of communication by means of raps.  It commended itself to 
the public mainly because the services of an expensive professional medium 
were not required.  In all parts of the country and in every grade of 
society the popular craze was practised with enthusiasm, and in this case as 
in others the results increased proportionately with the credibility of the 
sitters. In these earlier stages of the proceedings the gyrations of the 
table were attributed entirely to spirit agencies.  So serious did matters 
become at last that men of science could no longer ignore the 
"manifestations," and were forced to turn the light of scientific knowledge 
on the phenomenon of table-turning and endeavour to explain it on rational 
grounds.  Foremost among these distinguished investigators was the chemist 
Faraday, who showed by means of simple apparatus of his own devising that 
the movements of the table were due to unconscious muscular action on the 
part of the sitters, who were thus themselves the automatic authors of the 
messages purporting to come from the spirit world.  Faraday’s apparatus 
consisted of two thin wooden boards with little glass rollers between, the 
whole bound together with rubber bands, and so con-trived that the slightest 
lateral pressure on the upper board would cause it to slip a little way over 
the other.  A haystalk or a scrap of paper served to indicate any motion of 
the upper board over the lower.  The conclusion drawn from these experiments 
was that when the sitters believed themselves to be pressing downwards, they 
were really pressing obliquely, in the direction they expected the table to 
rotate.  Other investigators also held that the expecta-tion of the 
operators had a good deal to do with the motions of the table.  Braid 
pointed out in the appendix to his Hypnotic Therapeutics that some one 
generally announced beforehand the direction in which the table would 
rotate, and so encouraged the expectation of the operators. Another 
authority, Dr. W. B. Carpenter, shared the same view, as did a committee of 
four medical men who pub-lished their experiences of table-turning in the 
Medical Times and Gazette Among the earliest investigators of the phenomena 
of tablet-turning were count de Gasparin and Professor Thury of Geneva, who 
held seances, and were satisfied that the movements resulted from a force 
radiating from the operators, to which they gave the name of" ectenic 
force."  There were others, however, who were less rational in their 
attempts to explain the phenomenon.  The public were on the whole indisposed 
to accept the conclusions of Faraday and the rest.  They preferred the more 
popular spiritualistic explanations or the pseudo-scientific theories of 
such men as Dr. Koch, who believed that the " chain of operators formed a 
sort of electric battery which supplied the table with vital energy or, as 
it was called, " electro--odyllic" force, and made it respond to the will as 
though it were a part of the human body.  Other explanations offered were 
odic force, galvanism, animal magnetism, and, strangest notion of all, the 
rotation of the earth!  In an anonymous pamphlet published during the table-
turning epidemic and entitled Table-turning considered in connection with 
the dictates of reason and common sense, the conclusions of Faraday are 
ridiculed, and an electrical theory advanced, in such a way, however, as to 
show that the writer is quite ignorant of his subject.  Another pamph-let, 
also anonymous, entitled Table-turning by Animal Magnetism demonstrated 
ascribes the phenomenon to mag-netism, and bases it&s suppositions on the 
results of some experiments in which the table was isolated by glass or 
gutta-percha.  Dr. Elliotson and the other believers in a mesmeric " fluid" 
which would affect inanimate object&s as well as living beings, saw in 
table-turning a support for their views. The Rev. G. Sandby and the Rev. C. 
H. Townshend, claimed to have experienced a feeling of fatigue after a 
table-turning &seance as though they had been hypnotising someone. They also 
felt a tingling &sensation in their finger-tips, and Townshend suggested 
that spirit rappings may be caused by a "disengagement of Zoogen from the 
System."  Dr. Elliotson himself followed with an admission that the 
phenomenon was not explicable within the bounds of muscular force.  There 
was another set, mainly composed of Evangelical clergymen, who credited the 
whole business to Satanic agency.  The Rev. N. S. Godfrey, the Rev. E. 
Gillson, and others held seances in which the " spirits " confessed 
themselves to be either the spirit’s of worthless persons of evil 
inclination, or devils, both of which confessions caused the reverend 
gentlemen to denounce the whole practice of table-turning. One of them 
remarks, apropos of Faraday’s experiments, that the phenomena "appear to be 
whatever the investi-gator supposes them to be," a saying which aptly 
charac-terises their own attitude.
     Camille Flammarion, whose exhaustive experiments and &scientific 
attainments give to his opinion considerable weight, has offered an 
explanation of the various phases of table-turning phenomena.  Simple 
rotation of the table he ascribes to an unconscious impulse given by the 
operators and other movements (;f the table while the fingers of the 
sitter’s rest upon it are ascribed to similar causes. The tilting of the 
table on the side furthest away from the operator can also be explained by 
muscular action.  But vibrations in the wood of the table, or its levitation 
under the fingers, or, to a &still greater extent, its rotation without 
contact of the operator’s hands, he attributes to a force emanating from the 
body, and, in the latter case, capable of acting at a distance by means of 
ether-waves.  This force, the result of a cerebral disturbance, is greater 
than that of the muscles, as is seen by the levitation of tables so weighted 
that the combined muscular strength of the operators would not &suffice to 
lift it.  To the dictating of meessages and other intelligent manifestations 
he would also give an origin in this psychic force, which is perhaps 
identical with Thury’s " ectenic" force, or " psychode," and which is 
obedient to the will and desires, or even, in some cases; the subconscious 
will of the operator.  The hypothesis of &spirits he does not consider 
necessary.  It is possible, however, that fraud may have crept into the 
seances of M. Flammarion, as it has done in &so many other cases.  And there 
are those among the most profound students of psychic research who find in 
unconscious muscular action and deliberate fraud a satisfactory explana-tion 
of the phenomena.


Taboo, Tabu or Tapu: A Polynesian word meaning "pro-hibited " and signifying 
a prohibition enforced by religious or magical power, which has come to be 
applied to &similar usages among savage peoples all over the world.  Taboo, 
or prohibition is enforced in the cases of &sacred things and unclean 
things.  In the first instance, the taboo is placed on the object because of 
the possession by it of inherent mysterious power.  But, taboo may be 
imposed by a chief or priest.  It aims at the protection of important 
individ-ual's; the &safeguarding of the weak, women, children and slaves 
from the magical influence of more highly-placed individuals;  against 
danger incurred by handling or coming in contact with corpses; or eating 
certain foods; and the securing of human beings against the power of 
supernatural agencies, or the depredations of thieves. Taboo may also be 
sanctioned by social use or instinct. The violation of a taboo makes the 
offender himself taboo, for it is characteristic of the taboo that it is 
transmissible, but can be thrown off by magical or purificatory cere-monies.  
It may last for a short period, or be imposed in perpetuity.  It may be 
said, generally speaking, that the practice of taboo was instituted through 
human instinct for human convenience. This applies of course merely to the 
most simple type of taboo. It is, for example, for bidden to reap or steal 
the patch of corn dedicated to an agricultural deity, for the simple reason 
that his wrath would be incurred by so doing.  Similarly it is taboo to 
devour the flesh of the totem animal of the tribe, except in special 
circumstances with the object of achieving communion with him.  It is taboo 
to interfere in any manner with the affairs of the &shamans or medicine-men: 
this again is a type of the imposed taboo for the convenience of a certain 
caste. It is prohibited to marry a woman of the same totem as oneself, as 
all the members of a totemic band are supposed to be consanguineous, and 
&such a union might incur the wrath of the patron deity.  A very strict 
taboo is put upon the beholding of certain ritual instru-ments belonging to 
&some barbarian tribes, but this only applies to women and uninitiated men: 
the reason for such taboo would be that it was considered degradation for 
women to behold sacred implements. Taboo, if it does not &spring directly 
from the &system known as totemism, was &strongly influenced by it-that is, 
many intricate taboos arose from the totemic system.  We have also the taboo 
of the sorcerer, which in effect is merely a &spell placed upon a certain 
object, which makes it become useless to others. Taboo, or its remains, is 
&still to be found in strong force even in the most civilised communities, 
and from its use the feeling of reverence for ancient institutions and those 
who represent them is undoubtedly derived.


Tadebtsois : Spirits believed in by the Samoyeds. (See Siberia.)


Tadibe : The name for a Samoyed magician.  (See Siberia.)


Taigheirm : A magical sacrifice of cats to the infernal spirits, formerly 
practised in the Highlands and Islands of Scot-land.  It is believed to have 
been originally a ceremony of sacrifice to the subterranean gods, imported 
from more northern lands, which became in Christian times an invoca-tion of 
infernal spirits.  The word " Taigheirm  signifies either an armoury, or the 
cry of a cat, according to the sense in which it is used.  A description of 
the ceremony, which must be performed with black cats, is given in Horst’s 
Deuteroscopy : " After the cats were dedicated to all the devils. and put 
into a magico-sympathetic con-dition by the shameful things done to them, 
and the agony occasioned them, one of them was at once put upon the spit, 
and, amid terrific howlings, roasted before a slow fire.  The moment that 
the howls of one tortured cat ceased in death, another was put upon the 
spit, for a minute of interval must not take place if they would control 
hell; and this continued for the four entire days and nights. If the 
exorcist could hold it out still longer, and even till his physical powers 
were absolutely exhausted, he must do &so."  When the horrible rites had 
been continued for a time the demons began to appear in the shape of black 
cats, who mingled their dismal cries with those of the unfortunate 
sacrifices.  At length a cat appeared of larger &size and more frightful 
aspect than the others, and the time had come for the exorcist to make known 
his demands.  Usually he asked for the gift of second sight, but other 
rewards might be asked for and received. The last Taigheirm was said to have 
been held in Mull about the middle of the seventeenth century. The exorcists 
were Allan Maclean and his assistant Lachlain Maclean, both of whom received 
the &second sight.  Of this particular ceremony Horst says: "The infernal 
spirits appeared &some in the early progress of the sacrifices, in the shape 
of black cats. The first who appeared during the sacrifice, after they had 
cast a furious glance at the sacrifices, said Lachlain Oer, that is, & 
Injurer of Cats.  Allan, the chief operator, warned Lachlain, whatever he 
might see or hear, not to waver, but to keep the spit incessantly turning. 
At length the cat of monstrous size appeared  and after it had set up a 
horrible howl, said to Lachlain Oer, that if he did not cease before their 
largest brother came he would never see the face of God.  Lachlain  answered 
that he would not cease till he had finished his work if all the devils in 
hell came.  At the end of the fourth day, there sat on the end of the beam 
in the roof of the barn a black cat with fire-flaming eyes, and there was 
heard a terrific howl quite across the straits of Mull into Mowen."  By this 
time the elder of the two men was quite exhausted, and sank down in a swoon, 
but the younger was sufficiently &self-possessed to ask for wealth and 
prosperity, which both received throughout their life-time. Shortly before 
this, Cameron of Lochiel received at a Taigheirm a small silver &shoe which, 
put on the foot of a new-born &son of his family, would give courage and 
fortitude to the child.  One boy, however, had at his birth, a foot too 
large for the shoe, a defect inherited from his mother, who was not a 
Cameron. His lack of the magically bestowed courage was apparent at 
Sheriffmuir, where he fled before the enemy.


Tales of Terror, by Matthew Lewis.  (See Fiction, Occult English.)


Talisman : An inanimate object which is supposed to possess a supernatural 
capacity of conferring benefits or powers in contradistinction to the amulet 
(q.v.), the purpose of which is to ward off evil.  It was usually a disc of 
metal or stone engraved with astrological or magical figures. Talismans were 
common in ancient Egypt and Babylon. The virtues of astrological talismans 
were as follows : The astrological figure of Mercury, engraven upon silver, 
which is the corresponding metal, and according to the pre-scribed rites, 
gave success in Merchandise ; that of Mars gave victory to the soldier  that 
of Venus, beauty, and so of the rest. All such talismans likewise are more 
power-ful in the hour of their planets ascendency.  There are three general 
varieties of these potent charms : i. The astronomical, having the 
characters of the heavenly signs or constellations.  2. The magical, with 
extraordinary figures, superstitious words, or the names of angels.  3. The 
mixed, engraven with celestial signs and barbarous words. To these, 
Fosbrook, in his Encyclopaedia of Antiquities, adds two others -4. The 
sigilla planetarum, composed of Hebrew numeral letters, used by astrologers 
and fortune-tellers; and 5. Hebrew names and characters.  As an example of 
the most powerful of the latter, may be men-tioned the sacred name of 
Jehovah.  The famous tephillin or phylacteries, used in Jewish devotion, and 
which were bound on the head, the arm, and the hand, may be regarded as 
talismans, and they were the subject of many traditional ceremonies. We may 
also mention the mezuzoth or schedules for door-posts, and another article 
of this des-cription mentioned in the following quotation from the Talmud :-
" Whoever has the telphillin bound to his head and arm, and the tsitsith 
thrown over his garments, and the mezuza fixed on his door-post, is 
protected from &sin."
     Writing of talismans in his Occult Sciences, Mr. A. E. Waite says
     “I. The Talisman of the Sun must be composed of a pure and fine gold, 
fashioned into a circular plate, and well polished on either &side. A 
serpentine circle, enclosed by a pentagram must be engraved on the obverse 
side with a diamond-pointed graving tool. The reverse must bear a human head 
in the centre of the six-pointed star of Solomon, which &shall itself be 
surrounded with the name of the solar intelligence Pi-Rhe, written in the 
characters of the Magi. This talisman is supposed to insure to its bearer 
the goodwill of influential persons.  It is a pre-servative against death by 
heart disease, syncope, aneurism, and epidemic complaints.  It must be 
composed on a Sunday during the passage of the moon through Leo, and when 
that luminary is in a favourable aspect with Saturn and the Sun.  The 
consecration consists in the exposure of the talisman to the smoke of a 
perfume composed of cinnamon, incense, saffron, and red sandal, burnt with 
laurel-wood, and twigs of dessicated heliotrope, in a new chafing-dish, 
which must be ground into powder and buried in an isolated spot, after the 
operation is finished.  The talisman must be afterwards encased in a 
&satchel of bright yellow silk, which must be fastened on the breast l)y an 
interlaced ribbon of the same material, tied in the form of a cross.  In all 
cases the ceremony &should be preceded by the conjuration of the Four, to 
which the reader has already been referred.  The form of consecration, 
accom-panied by sprinkling with holy water, may be rendered in the following 
manner
    "In the name of Elohim, and by the spirit of the living waters, be thou 
unto me as a sign of light and a seal of will.
     “Presenting it to the smoke of the perfumes -By the brazen serpent 
before which fell the serpents of fire, be thou unto me as a &sign of light 
and a &seal of will.
     “Breathing seven times upon the talisman -By the firmament and the 
spirit of the voice, be thou unto me as a sign of light and a seal of will. 
     “Lastly, when placing some grains of purified earth or salt upon the 
pentacle -In the name of the &salt of the earth and by virtue of the life 
eternal, be thou unto me as a sign of light and a &seal of will.
     “II. The Talisman of the Moon should be composed of a circular and 
well-polished plate of the purest silver, being of the dimensions of an 
ordinary medal.  The image of a crescent, enclosed in a pentagram, should be 
graven on the obverse side.  On the reverse side, a chalice must be 
encircled by the duadic seal of Solomon, encompassed by the letters of the 
lunar genius Pi-Job.  This talisman is considered a protection to 
travellers, and to sojourners in strange lands.  It preserves from death by 
drowning, by epilepsy, by dropsy, by apoplexy, and madness.  The dangers of 
a violent end which is predicted by Saturnian aspects in horoscopes of 
nativity, may be removed by it’s means.  It should be composed on a Monday, 
when the moon is passing through the first ten degrees of Capricornus or 
Virgo, and is also well aspected with Saturn.  Its con-secration consists in 
exposure to a perfume composed of white sandal, camphor, aloes, amber, and 
pulverised seed of cucumber, burnt with dessicated stalks of mugwort, 
moonwort, and ranunculus, in a new earthen chafing-dish, which must be 
reduced, after the operation, into powder, and buried in a deserted spot.  
The talisman must be sewn up in a satchel of white silk, and fixed on the 
breast by a ribbon of the same colour, interlaced and tied in the form of a 
cross.
     “III. The Talisman of Mars must be composed of a well-polished circular 
plate of the finest iron, and of the dimensions of an ordinary medal.  The 
symbol of a sword in the centre of a pentagram must be engraved on the 
obverse side.  A lions head surrounded by a six-pointed star must appear on 
the reverse face, with the letters of the name Erotosi, the planetary genius 
of Mars, above the outer angles. This talisman passes as a preservative 
against all combinations of enemies.  It averts the chance of death in 
brawls and battles, in epidemics and fevers, and by corroding ulcers.  It 
also neutralizes the peril of a violent end as a punishment for crime when 
it is foretold in the horoscope of the nativity.
     "This talisman must be composed on a Tuesday, during the passage of the 
moon through the ten first degrees of Aries or Sagittarius, and when, 
moreover, it is favourably aspected with Saturn and Mars. The consecration 
consists in its exposure to the smoke of a perfume composed of dried absinth 
and rue, burnt in an earthen vessel which has never been previously used, 
and which must be broken into powder, and buried in a secluded place, when 
the operation is completed.  Finally, the talisman must be sewn up in a 
satchel of red silk, and fastened on the breast with ribbons of the same 
material folded and knotted in the form of a cross.
     “IV. The Talisman of Mercury must be formed of a circular plate of 
fixed quicksilver, or according to another account of an amalgam of silver, 
mercury, and pewter, of the dimensions of an ordinary medal, well-polished 
on both sides.  A winged caduceus, having two serpents twining about it, 
must be engraved in the centre of a pentagram on the obverse side.  The 
other must bear a dog’s head within the star of Solomon, the latter being 
surrounded with the name of the planetary genius, Pi-Hermes, written in the 
alphabet of the Magi.  This talisman must be composed on a Wednesday, when 
the moon is passing through the ten first degrees of Gemini or Scorpio, and 
is well aspected with Saturn and Mercury. The consecration consists in its -
exposure to the smoke of a perfume composed of ben-zoin, macis, and storax, 
burnt with the dried stalks of the lily, the narcissus, fumitory, and 
marjolane, placed in a clay chafing-dish which has never been devoted to any 
other purpose, and which must, after the completion of the task, be reduced 
to powder and buried in an undisturbed place. The Talisman of Mercury is 
judged to be a defence in all species of commerce and business industry.  
Buried under the ground in a house of commerce, it will draw customers and 
prosperity.  It preserves all who wear it from epilepsy and madness.  It 
averts death by murder and poison; it is a safeguard against the schemes of 
treason and it procures prophetic dreams when it is worn on the head during 
sleep.  It is fastened on the breast by a ribbon of purple silk folded and 
tied in the form of a cross, and the talisman is itself enclosed in a 
satchel of the same material.
     "V. The Talisman of Jupiter must be formed of a circular plate of the 
purest English pewter, having the dimensions of an ordinary medal, and being 
highly polished on either side. The image of a four-pointed crown in the 
centre of a pentagram must be engraved on the obverse side.  On the other 
must be the head of an eagle in the centre of the six-pointed star of 
Solomon, which must be surrounded by the name of the planetary genius Pi-
Zeous, written in the arcane alphabet.
     "This talisman must be composed on a Thursday, during the passage of 
the moon through the first ten degrees of Libra, and when it is also in a 
favourable aspect with Saturn and Jupiter.  The consecration consists in its 
exposure to the smoke of a perfume composed of incense, ambergris, balm, 
grain of Paradise, saffron, and macis, which is the second coat of the 
nutmeg.  These must be burnt with wood of the oak, poplar, fig tree, and 
pomegranate, and placed in a new earthen dish, which must be ground into 
powder, and buried in a quiet spot, at the end of the ceremony. The talisman 
must be wrapped in a satchel of sky-blue silk, suspended on the breast by a 
ribbon of the same material, folded and fastened in the form of a cross.
     "The Talisman of Jupiter is held to attract to the wearer the 
benevolence and sympathy of everyone.  It averts anxieties, favours 
honourable enterprises, and augments well-being in proportion to social 
condition.  It is a pro-tection against unforeseen accidents, and the perils 
of a violent death when it is threatened by Saturn in the horo-scope of 
nativity.  It also preserves from death by affec-tions of the liver, by 
inflammation of the lungs, and by that cruel affection of the spinal marrow, 
which is termed tabes dorsalis in medicine.
     "VI. The Talisman of Venus must be formed of a circular plate of 
purified and well-polished copper.  It must be of the ordinary dimensions of 
a medal, perfectly polished on both its sides.  It must bear on the obverse 
face the letter G inscribed in the alphabet of the Magi, and enclosed in a 
pentagram.  A dove must be engraved on the reverse, in the centre of the 
six-pointed star, which must be surrounded by the letters which compose the 
name of the planetary Genius Suroth.  This talisman must be composed on a 
Friday, during the passage of the moon through the first ten degrees of 
Taurus or Virgo, and when that luminary is well aspected with Saturn and 
Venus.  Its consecration consists in its exposure to the smoke of a perfume 
composed of violets and roses, burnt with olive wood in a new earthen 
chafing-dish, which must be ground into powder at the end of the operation 
and buried in a solitary spot.  The talisman must, finally, be sewn up in a 
satchel of green or rose-coloured silk, which must be fastened on the breast 
by a band of the same material, folded and tied in the form of a cross.
     The Talisman of Venus is accredited with extraordinary power in 
cementing the bonds of love and harmony between husbands and wives.  It 
averts from those who wear it the spite and machinations of hatred.  It 
preserves women from the terrible and fatal diseases which are known as 
cancer.  It averts from both men and women all danger of death, to which 
they may be accidentally or purposely exposed.  It counterbalances the 
unfortunate presages which may appear in the horoscope of nativity.  Its 
last and most singular quality is its power to change the ani-mosity of an 
enemy into a love and devotion which will be proof against every temptation, 
and it rests on the sole condition that such a person should be persuaded to 
partake of a liquid in which the talisman has been dipped.
     "VII. The Talisman of Saturn must be composed of a circular plate of 
refined and purified lead, being of the dimensions of an ordinary medal, 
elaborately polished. On the obverse side must be engraven with the diamond-
pointed tool which is requisite in all these talismanic operations, the 
image of a sickle enclosed in a pentagram. The reverse side must bear a 
bull&s head, enclosed in the star of Solomon, and surrounded by the 
mysterious letters which compose, in the alphabet of the Magi, the name of 
the planetary Genius Tempha.  The person who is intended to wear this 
talisman must engrave it himself, without witnesses, and without taking any 
one into his confidence.
     “This talisman must be composed on a Saturday when the moon is passing 
through the first ten degrees of Taurus or Capricorn, and is favourably 
aspected with Saturn.  It must be consecrated by exposure to the smoke of a 
perfume composed of alum, assa-foetida, cammonee, and sulphur, which must be 
burnt with cypress, the wood of the ash tree, and sprays of black hellebore, 
in a new earthen chafing-dish, which must be reduced into powder at the end 
of the performance, and buried in a deserted place. The talisman must, 
finally, be sewn up in a satchel of black silk and fastened on the breast 
with a ribbon of the same material, folded and tied in the form of a cross.  
The Talisman of Saturn was affirmed to be a safeguard against death by 
apoplexy and cancer, decay in the bones, con-sumption, dropsy, paralysis, 
and decline; it was also a preservative against the possibility of being 
entombed in a trance, against the danger of violent death by secret crime, 
poison, or ambush.  If the head of the army in war-time were to bury the 
Talisman of Saturn in a place which it was feared might fall into the hands 
of the enemy, the limit assigned by the presence of the talisman could not 
be over-stepped by the opposing host, which would speedily with-draw in 
discouragement, or in the face of a determined assault."  (See Ceremonial 
Magic.)


Talmud, The : From the Hebrew lamad, to learn; the name of the great code of 
Jewish civil and canonical law. It is divided into two portions-the Mishna 
and the Gemara; the former constituted the text and the latter was a 
commentary and supplement.  But besides being the basis of a legal code, it 
is also a collection of Jewish poetry and legend. The Mishna is a 
development of the laws contained in the Pentateuch.  It is divided into six 
sedarim or orders, each containing a number of tractates, which are again 
divided into peraqim or chapters. The sedarim are : 
(1) Zeraim, which deals with agriculture (2)	Moed, with festivals and 
sacrifices ; (3) Nashim, with the law regarding women ; (4) Nezaqin, with 
civil law (5) Qodashim, with the sacrificial law ; and (6) Tohoroth or Tak, 
with purifications.  The Mishna was supposed to have been handed down by 
Ezra and to be in part the work of Joshua, David or Solomon, and originally 
communicated orally by the Deity in the time of Moses. There are two 
recensions-the Talmud of Jerusalem, and the Talmud of Babylon; which latter 
besides the sedarim mentioned contains seven additional treatises which are 
regarded as extra-canonical.  The first is supposed to have been finally 
edited towards the close of the fourth century A.D., and the second by Rabbi 
Ashi, President of the Academy of Syro in Babylon, somewhere in the fourth 
century.  Though revised from time to time before then, both versions have 
been greatly corrupted through the interpolation of gross traditions.  The 
rabbinical decisions in the Mishna are entitled helacoth and the traditional 
narratives haggadah.  The cosmogony of the Talmud assumes that the universe 
has been developed by means of a series of cataclysms  world after world was 
destroyed until the Creator made the present globe and saw that it was good.  
In the wonderful treatise on the subject by Deutsch which first appeared in 
the Quarterly Review in 1867, and is reprinted in his Literary Remains, the 
following passage appears:-
     “The how of the creation was not mere matter of specu-lation. The co-
operation of angels, whose existence was warranted by Scripture, and a whole 
hierarchy of whom had  been built up under  Persian  influences,  "&as 
distinctly denied.  In a discussion about the day of their creation, it is 
agreed on all hands that there were no angels at first, lest men might say, 
& Michael spanned out the firmament on the south, and Gabriel to the north.&  
There is a distinct foreshadowing of the Gnostic Demiurgos-that antique link 
between the Divine Spirit and the world of matter-to be found in the Talmud.  
What with Plato were the Ideas, with Philo the Logos, with the Kabalists the 
& World of Aziluth,& what the Gnostics called more emphatically the wisdom 
(sophia), or power (dunamis), and Plotinus the nous, that the Talmudical 
authors call Meta-tion.  There is a good deal, in the post-captivity Talmud, 
about the Angels, borrowed from the Persian.  The Archangels or Angelic 
princes are seven in number, and their Hebrew names and functions correspond 
almost exactly to those of their Persian prototypes.  There are also hosts 
of ministering angels, the Persian Yazatas, whose functions, besides that of 
being messengers, were two-fold- to praise God and to be guardians of man. 
In their first capacity they are daily created by God&s breath out of a 
stream of fire that rolls its waves under the supernal throne.  In their 
second, two of them accompany every man, and for every new good deed man 
acquires a new guardian angel, who always watches over his steps.  When a 
righteous man died, three hosts of angels descend from the celestial 
battlements to meet him.  One says (in the words of Scripture), & He shall 
go in peace& ; the second takes up the strain and says, &Who has walked in 
righteousness& ; and the third concludes, & Let him come in peace and rest 
upon his bed.&  In like manner, when the wicked man passes away, three hosts 
of wicked angels are ready to escort him, but their address is not couched 
in any spirit of consolation or encouragement."
     It would be impossible in this place to give a resume of the 
traditional matter contained in the Talmud. Suffice it to say that it is of 
great extent.  It has been considered by some authorities that a great many 
of the traditional tales have a magical basis, and that magical secrets are 
contained in them; but this depends entirely upon the interpretation put 
upon them, and the subject is one which necessitates the closest possible 
study.

Tannhauser: A medieval German legend which relates how a minstrel and knight 
of that name, passing by the Horselberg, or Hill of Venus, entered therein 
in answer to a call, and remained there with the enchantress, living an 
unholy life.  After a time he grew weary of sin, and longing to return to 
clean living, he for swore the worship of Venus and left her.  He then made 
a pilgrimage to Rome, to ask pardon of the Pope, but when he was told by 
Urban IV., himself that the papal staff would as soon blossom as such a 
sinner as Tannhauser be forgiven, he returned to Venus.  Three days later, 
the Pope&s staff did actually blossom, and he sent messengers into every 
country to find the despairing minstrel, but to no purpose, Tann-hauser had 
disappeared.  The story has a mythological basis which has been laid over by 
medieval Christian thought, and the original hero of which has been 
displaced by a more modern personage, just as the Venus of the existing 
legend is the mythological Venus only in name. She is really the Lady Holda, 
a German earth-goddess. Tannhauser was a " minnesinger " or love-minstrel of 
the middle of the thirteenth century.  He was very popular among the 
minnesingers of that time and the restless and intemperate life he led 
probably marked him out as the hero of such a legend as has been recounted.  
He was the author of many ballads of considerable excellence, which are 
published in the second part of the " Minnesinger" (Von der Hagen, Leipsic, 
1838) and in the sixth volume of Haupt&s Zeitschrift fur deutsches 
Althertum.  The most authentic version of this legend is given in Uhland&s 
Alte hock und niederdeuteche Volhslieder (Stuttgart, 1845).


Tappan-Richmond, Mrs. Cora L. V. : Perhaps the best known of all the 
inspirational speakers who have appeared since the beginning of the 
spiritualistic movement.  As a child Mrs. Tappan-Richmond-then Miss Scott-
spent some time in the Hopedale Community (q.v.), so that she was early 
initiated into the mysteries of spiritualism.  At the age of sixteen she 
went to New York, and became an inspired " lecturer on spiritualism, in 
which capacity she soon became famous throughout America.  Coming to Britain 
in 1873 she was warmly received by the spiritual-ists in this country, and 
for a number of years gave frequent trance discourses, characterised by 
their rhythm and fluency, and the comparative clarity of their ideas.


Tarot, or Tarots, is the French name for a species of playing-cards, 
originally used for the purpose of divination, and still employed by 
fortune-tellers.  Tarot cards, however, form part of an ordinary pack in 
certain countries of southern Europe, whence the name of tarocchi given to 
an Italian game. The derivation of the word is uncertain. One suggestion is 
that these cards were so called because they were tarotees on the back; that 
is, marked with plain or dotted lines crossing diagonally.  Confirmation of 
this theory may be found in the German form of the word a tarock-karie being 
a card chequered on the back.  Not improbably, however, there is here a 
confusion between cause and effect.
     De l’ Hoste Ranking, who dismisses as " obviously worthless" the 
explanations of Count de Gebelin, Vaillant and Mathers, refers the name to 
the Hungarian Gipsy tar, a pack of cards, and thence to the Hinddustani 
taru. The figures on these cards are emblematic, and are believed by many to 
embody the esoteric religion of ancient Egypt and India; but on this subject 
there is much difference of opinion.
     "The tarot pack most in use," observes Ranking, " con-sists of seventy-
eight cards, of which twenty-two are more properly known as the tarots, and 
are considered as the keys & of the tarot ; these correspond with the 
twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet, or, according to Falconnier and 
to Margiotta, with the & alphabet of the Magi.  The suits are four :  wands, 
sceptres, or clubs, answering to diamonds ; cups, chalices, or goblets, 
answering to hearts ; swords, answering to spades ; money, circles, or 
pentacles, answering to clubs.  Each suit consists of fourteen cards, the 
ace, and nine others, and four court cards: king, queen, knight, and knave.  
The four aces form the keys of their respective suits."  As already 
indicated, the  twenty-two " keys of the tarot," which consist of various 
emblematic figures, are assumed to be hieroglyphic symbols of the occult 
meanings of the letters of the Hebrew alphabet; or, alternatively, " the 
alphabet of the Magi."  " Immense antiquity is claimed for these symbols," 
observes Ranking.  " Alliette or (by trans-position) Etteilla, a French 
mystic of the beginning of the nineteenth century, ascribed their origin to 
Hermes Trisme-gistus, under the name of The Book of Thoth, or The Golden 
Book of Hermes.  Others have sought to identify &the tarot with the 
sibylline leaves."  Raymond Lully (1235-1315) is said to have based his 
great work, Ars Generalis sive Magna, on the application of the occult 
philosophy con-tained in the tarot.
     The idea that the tarot was introduced into Europe by the Gypsies 
appears to have been first broached by Vaillant, who had lived for many 
years among the Gypsies, by whom he was instructed in their traditional 
lore.  Much of the information thus obtained is incorporated in Les Romes, 
histoire vraie des vrais Bohemiens (c. 1853), La Bible des Bohemiens (1860), 
and La Clef Magique de la Fiction et du Fait (1863).  Vaillant’s theory has 
been fully accepted by a French writer, " Papus," who published in 1889 Le 
Tarot des Bohimiens : Le Plus Ancien Livre du Monde describing it as " la 
clef absolue de la science occulte."
     “The Gypsies possess a Bible," he asserts ; " yes, this card game 
called the Tarot which the Gypsies possess is. the Bible of Bibles.  It is a 
marvellous book, as Count de Gebelin and especially Vaillant have realized.  
Under the names of Tarot, Thora, Rota, this game has formed successively the 
basis of the synthetic teaching of all the ancient peoples."
     Although it may not be possible to accept this dictum in its entirety, 
it is of interest to note that Ranking con-cludes that these and all other 
playing-cards were intro-duced into Europe by the Gypsies.  " I would 
submit, he says, writing in 1908, that from internal evidence we may deduce 
that the tarots were introduced by a race speaking an Indian dialect; that 
the form of the Pope (as portrayed in the tarots) shows they had been long 
in a country where the orthodox Eastern Church predominated; and the form of 
head-dress of the king, together with the shape of the eagle on the shield, 
shows that this was governed by Russian Grand Dukes, who had not yet assumed 
the Imperial insignia.  This seems to me confirmatory of the widespread 
belief that it is to the Gypsies we are indebted for our knowledge of 
playing-cards."  It will be seen that this conclusion is based upon 
independent judgment. As early, however, as 1865 - two years after the 
appearance of Vaillant’s last book-H. S. Taylor supported the same 
hypothesis in his History of Playing Cards.  Willshire (Descriptive 
Catalogues of Cards in the British Museum, 1877) controverts Taylor’s 
conclusion, on the ground that "whether the Zingari be of Egyptian or Indian 
origin, they did not appear in Europe before 1417, when cards had been known 
for some time."  But this objection is nullified by the fact that the 
presence of Gypsies, in Europe is now placed at a date considerably anterior 
to 1417. There was, for example, a well-established feudum 
Acin-ganorum, or Gypsy barony, in the island of Corfu in the fourteenth 
century.
     To examine in detail the various emblematic figures of the tarot would 
demand a disproportionate amount of space. Ranking’s reference to the Pope 
and the King points to two of these twenty-two figures. The others are : the 
Female Pope, the Queen, Osiris Triumphant, The Wheel of Fortune, Justice, 
Prudence, Temperance, Strength, Marriage, The Philosopher, The Juggler, 
Death, The Devil, The Fool, The Lightning-struck Tower, The Sun, The Moon, 
The Star, The Universe, The Last Judgment. There is great diversity of 
opinion, even among  initiates," as to the meaning of these symbols. They 
are very fully discussed in the work of  Papus". already cited ; to which 
the reader is specially referred.  On the whole, there is much to be said in 
favour of the theory that the origin of the tarot is traceable to the 
esoteric philosophy of the schools of ancient Egypt and Chaldea, by whatever 
means it has found its way into Europe. In addition to the works already 
cited, see Le Monde Primitif, by Count de Gebelin, Vol. VIII., Paris, 1781

Tatwic Yoga  meaning " The Science of Breath."  The title of a little book 
translated from the Sanscrit some years ago by the Pandit Rama Prasad. The 
"breath" referred to is the life-giving breath of Brahman, and in it are 
contained the five elementary principles of nature, corresponding to the 
five senses of man.  These principles are know as Tatwas, and of them the 
body is composed. The knowledge of the Tatwas is believed to confer wonder-
ful power; and to this end all undertakings must be com-menced at times 
which are known to be propitious from the movements of the Tatwas in the 
body.  An important method of yoga practice is given in the book, which will 
certainly assure marvellous results.

objects by thought alone.  The move-ment of objects without contact-a 
frequent phenomenon of the seance-room, including in its wider sense 
rappings, table-tiltings, levitations, the conveyance of apports, 
practically all material phenomena, with the possible exception of 
materialisation-is exceeding difficult of explanation on rational grounds, 
and the attempt to explain it thus, without the intervention of discarnate 
spirits, has given rise to the telekinetic theory, which holds that all 
these varied feats are accomplished by the thoughts of medium and sitters, 
independent of muscular energy, whether direct or indirect.  How thought can 
possibly act in this immediate way on inanimate matter is beyond 
comprehension in our present state of knowledge. The evidence for 
telekinesis is very much less than, say, that for telepathy. The telekinetic 
theory is akin to that offered by the magnetists, who regarded a fluidic or 
energetic emanation as the cause of the movements.


Telepathy : Of the various branches of psychic phenomena there is none which 
engages more serious attention at the present day than telepathy or thought 
transference.  The idea of inter-communication between brain and brain, by 
other means than that of the ordinary sense-channels, is a theory deserving 
of the most careful consideration, not only in its simple aspect as a 
claimant for recognition as an important scientific fact, but also because 
there is practically no department of psychic phenomena on which it has not 
some bearing. To take one instance-a few decades ago the so-called 
"rationalist" view of ghosts was simply that supernatural phenomena did not 
exist, but now a telepathic explanation is offered, more or less 
tentatively, by an ever-increasing body of intelligent opinion.  There are 
those who, while admitting the genuineness of psychic phenomena are yet 
satisfied that pure psychology provides a field sufficiently wide for their 
researches, and who are loath to extend its boundaries to include an unknown 
spirit-world where research becomes a hundred-fold more difficult.  To such 
students the theory of telepathy affords an obvious way of escape from that 
element of the super-natural to which they are opposed, since it is 
generally agreed that in seeking an explanation of thought trans-ference it 
is a physical process which must be looked for. In the words of Sir William 
Crookes : " It is known that the action of thought is accompanied by certain 
molecular movements in the brain, and here we have physical vibra-tions 
capable from their extreme minuteness of acting direct on individual 
molecules, while their rapidity approaches that of the internal and external 
movements of the atoms themselves."
     There is therefore nothing to render the theory of thought-vibrations 
impossible, or even improbable, though the difficulty of proving it has yet 
to be overcome.  We have, however, to contend with the fact that in many 
cases on record the most vivid impressions have been transmitted from a 
distance, thus showing that the distinctness of the impression does not 
necessarily decrease in proportion as the distance becomes greater.  In this 
case we must either conclude that there are other factors to be taken into 
account, such as the varying intensity of the impression, and the varying 
degrees of sensitiveness in the percipient, or we must conclude, as some 
authorities have done, that telepathic communication goes direct from one 
mind to another, irrespective of distance, just as thought can travel to the 
opposite side of the globe with as much ease as it can pass to the next 
room.  Other authorities claim that the transmission of thought is on a 
different plane from any physical process, though, as the action of thought 
itself has a physical basis, it is difficult to understand why a 
supernatural explanation should be thought necessary in the case of 
telepathy.  In the former connection it may be remarked that trivial 
circumstances can be transmitted to a percipient near at hand, while as a 
rule only the more intense and violent impressions are received from a dis-
tance.  The question whether the telepathic principle is diffusive, and 
spreads equally in all directions, or whether it can be projected directly 
toward one individual, is still a vexed one.  If it be in the form of 
ethereal vibrations, it would certainly seem easier to regard it as 
diffusive. On the other hand, practical experience has shown that in many 
instances, even when acting from a distance, it affects only one or two 
individuals.  However, this might be explained naturally enough by the 
assumption that each transmitter requires a special receiver-i.e., a mind in 
sympathy with itself.  But as yet no explanation is forthcoming, and the 
most that can be done is to suspend judgment for the present, knowing that 
only the possi-bility, or, at most, the likelihood, of such a mode of com-
munication has been proved, and that of its machinery nothing can be said 
beyond the vaguest surmise.
     The theory of thought transference is no new one.  Like gravitation, it 
is a daughter of the hoary science of astrology, but while gravitation is a 
full-grown fact, universally accepted of science, telepathy, in its 
scientific aspect, is as yet an infant, and a weakling at that. However, it 
is not difficult to understand how both should spring from astrology, nor to 
trace the connection between them. The wise men of ancient days supposed the 
stars to radiate an invisible influence which held them together in their 
course, and which affected men and events on our planet, receiving in their 
turns some subtle emanation from the earth and its inhabitants.  From this 
idea it was but a step to assume that a radiant influence, whether magnetic 
or otherwise, passed from one human being to another. The doctrine of astral 
influence was shared by Paracelsus and his alchem-istic successors until the 
epoch of Sir Isaac Newton, whose discovery of the law of gravitation brought 
the age of astrology to a close.  To the conception of magnetic influence 
colour was lent by the practices of Mesmer, and his followers, who ascribed 
to the "magnetic fluid " the phenomena of hypnosis.  The analogy between the 
mysterious and inexplicable force binding worlds together and the subtle 
influence joining mind with mind is suffici-ently obvious, but the 
difficulty is that while gravitation may be readily demonstrated, and never 
fails to give certain definite results, experiments in telepathy reveal the 
phenomena only in the most spasmodic fashion and cannot be depended upon to 
succeed even under the most favourable conditions.  Nevertheless such 
systematized experiments as have been conducted from time to time have more 
than justified the interest which has been dis-played in telepathy. Science, 
which had so long held herself aloof from hypnosis, was not desirous of 
repeating her error in a new connection. In 1882 the Society for Psychical 
Re-search (q.v.) came into being. numbering among its members some of the 
most distinguished men in the country.  It had for its object the 
elucidation of the so-called  super-natural" phenomena which were exciting 
so much popular interest and curiosity; and foremost among these was the 
phenomenon of thought transference, or, as it has since been christened, 
telepathy.  Viewing their subject in a purely scientific light, trained in 
the handling of evidence, and resolved to pursue truth with open and 
unbiassed minds, they did much to bring the study of psychic phenom-ena into 
a purer and more dignified atmosphere.  They recognized the 
untrustworthiness of human nature in general, and the prevalence of fraud 
even where no object was to be gained but the gratification of a perverted 
vanity, and their experiments were conducted under the most rigid 
conditions, with every precaution taken against conscious or unconscious 
deception.  Among the most valuable evidence obtained from experimental 
thought transference was that gleaned by Professor and Mrs. Sidgwick (q.v.) 
from their experiments at Brighton in 1889-95.  In this series the 
percipients-clerks and shop assistants-were hypnotized.  Sometimes they were 
asked to visualize, on a blank card, an image or picture chosen by the 
agent.  At other times the agent would choose one of a bundle of cards 
numbered from so to 90, and the percipient was required to state the number 
on the picked card, which was done correctly in a surprising number of 
cases.  We find, curiously enough, that the results varied in proportion as 
the agent and percipient were near or far apart, and were materially 
affected by the intervention of a door, or even a curtain, between the two, 
but this was ascribed to a lack of confidence on the part of the percipient, 
or to such physical causes as fatigue or ennui, rather than to the limited 
scope of the telepathic principle.  On the whole we are justified in 
thinking that chance alone would not account for the number of correct 
replies given by the hypnotised subject.
     Towards the end of the century a criticism was levelled at these 
experiments by Messrs. Hansen and Lehmann, of Copenhagen, whose belief it 
was that the phenomenon known as " subconscious whispering," together with 
hyperaesthesia on the part of the percipient, would suffice to produce the 
results obtained by the Sidgwicks.  This suggested explanation, while it 
does not cover the entire ground has some right to our consideration.  If 
hypnotism reveals so marvellous a refinement of the perceptions, may not 
some elements of hyperaesthesia linger in the sub-consciousness of the 
normal individual?  If dreams contain in the experience of almost everyone, 
such curious examples of deduction, may not the mental under-current follow 
in waking moments a process of reasoning of which the higher consciousness 
knows nothing ?  It may, and it does. That " other self," which is never 
quite so much in the background as we imagine, sees and hears a thousand 
things of which we are unconscious, and which come to the surface in dreams, 
it may be long afterwards; and there is no reason to suppose that it might 
not see and hear indica-tions too slight to be perceived in a grosser sphere 
of consciousness, and thus account for some cases of "thought transference."  
On the other hand, we have evidences of telepathy acting at a distance where 
sub-conscious whisper-ing and hyperaesthesia are obviously out of the 
question. Though hyperaesthesia may be advanced as a plausible explanation 
in some - or, indeed, in many-instances of telepathy, it cannot be accepted 
as a complete explanation unless it covers all cases, and that it certainly 
does not. So we must look elsewhere for the explanation, though it is not 
without reluctance that we quit a theory so admir-ably adapted to known 
conditions that it scarcely requires a stretching of established 
physiological laws to make telepathy fit as naturally as wireless telegraphy 
into the scheme of things.
     As has been earlier mentioned, practically every branch of psychic 
phenomena would be vitally affected by the scientific proof of telepathy. 
Coincident dreams might, in the majority of cases, be easily explained away.  
The visions of the crystal-gazer, the trance-utterances of the medium, could 
be accounted for in the same manner, to-gether with the occasional 
apparitions visiting the normal individual. Apparitions of the dead, 
however, do not so readily submit themselves to a telepathic explanation. If 
they are genuine apparitions, and not meaningless hallu-cinations, we must 
either admit that the impulse directing the impression comes from the 
surviving spirit of the deceased agent, or that it was transmitted while he 
was yet alive.  In the latter case we are confronted with a difficulty-how 
to account for the time which may elapse between the death of the agent and 
the appearance of the vision. To bridge the gap thus formed Mr. Podmore 
(q.v.), in his work on Telepathic Hallucinations, has produced his theory of 
latent impressions, which successfully overcomes the difficulty. According 
to Mr. Podmore, impressions transmitted from one mind to another may remain 
latent for a considerable time awaiting a favourable opportunity for 
development. Thus the apparition of one  who been dead for some time may 
result from an impression transmitted during his lifetime, which the 
percipient has retained, until a chance combination of ideas brings it into 
the upper stratum of consciousness in the form of a hallu-cination. 
Obviously the theory of latent impressions may bear on other phenomena than 
that of apparitions, and serve to fill in gaps which might otherwise remain 
blank.
     It is interesting to compare the tone of criticisms pro-nounced on 
telepathy in the last quarter of the nineteenth century with that which 
characterises later utterances on the subject.  Science is no longer ashamed 
to pursue her researches in psychic phenomena  thought transference no 
longer appears to intellectual people as a doubtful by-path of psychology, 
and the change argues that at least a fair attempt will be made to reach the 
truth of the matter.

Tellurism: A name applied by Kieser to Animal Magnetism (q.v.)


Temeraire, Charles A.: Duke of Burgundy.  He disappeared after the battle of 
Morat; and it was said by his chroniclers that he was carried off by the 
devil, like  Roderick.  Some maintained, however, that he had withdrawn to a 
remote spot and become a hermit.


Templars: The Knights Templars of the Temple of Solomon were a military 
order, founded by a Burgundian, Hugues de Payns, and Godeffroi de St. Omer, 
a French Knight, in 1119, for the purpose of protecting pilgrims journeying 
into the Holy Land.  They were soon joined by other knights, and a religious 
chivalry speedily gathered around this nucleus. Baldwin I., King of 
Jerusalem, gave them as headquarters a portion of his palace, contiguous to 
a mosque which tradition asserted was part of the Temple of Solomon, and 
from this building they took their designa-tion.  One of the purposes of the 
Society was to convert and render useful knights of evil life, and so many 
of these entered the order, as to bring it under the suspicion of the 
Church, but there is every reason to believe that its founders were 
instigated by motives of the deepest piety, and that they lived in a 
condition akin to poverty, notwithstanding the numerous gifts that were 
showered upon them, is the best proof of this.  They had properly 
constituted officials, a Grand Master, knights, chaplains, sergeants, 
craftsmen, sensechals, marechals, and commanders. The order had its own 
clergy exempt from the jurisdiction of diocesan rule, and its chapters were 
held as a rule in secret. The dress of the brotherhood was a white mantle 
with a red cross for unmarried knights, and a black or brown mantle with a 
red cross for the others.  The discipline was of the very strictest 
description and the food and clothing stipu-lated were rough and not 
abundant. By the middle of the twelfth century, the new order had got a 
footing in nearly all the Latin kingdoms of Christendom.  It’s power grew 
apace, and it’s organisation became widespread.  It formed, as it were, a 
nucleus of the Christian effort against the paganism of the east, and it’s 
history may be said to he that of the crusades.  Moreover it became a great 
trading corporation, the greatest commercial agency between the east and 
west, and as such amassed immense wealth.  On the fall of the Latin kingdom 
in Palestine, the Temples had perforce to withdraw from that country, and 
although they continued to harass the Saracen power they made but little 
headway against it, and in reality appear to have undertaken commercial 
pursuits in preference to those of a more warlike character.  When the 
Temple was at the apogee of its power, its success aroused the envy and 
avarice of Philip IV. of France, who commenced a series of attacks upon it. 
The election of Pope Clement V., who was devoted to his interests, and a 
denunciation of the order for heresy and immorality gave Philip his chance.  
For several generations before this time, strange stories had been 
circulating concerning the secret rites of the Templars which were assisted 
by the very strict privacy of these meetings, which were usually held at 
day-break with closely-guarded doors.  It was alleged that the most horrible 
blasphemies and indecencies took place at these meetings, that the cross was 
trampled under foot and &spat upon, and that an idol named Baphomet (q.v.) 
(Baphe metios, baptism of wisdom) was adored, or even the Devil in the shape 
of a black cat.  Other tales told of the roasting of children, and the 
smearing of the idol with their burning fat, and other nonsense was wildly 
promulgated by the credulous and ignorant.  A certain 
Esquian de Horian, pretended to betray the  &secret " of the Templars to 
Philip, and they were denounced to the Inquisition ; and Jacques do Molay, 
the Grand Master, who had been called from Cyprus to France, was arrested 
with one hundred and forty of his brethren in Paris and thrown into prison. 
A universal arrest of the Templars throughout France followed.  The wretched 
knights were tortured en masse, and as was usually the case, under &such 
compulsion, con-fessed to the most grotesque crimes, and the most damning 
confession of all, was that of the Grand Master himself, who confessed that 
he had been guilty of denying Christ and &spitting upon the Cross, but 
repudiated all charges of immorality in indignant terms.
     The process dragged on slowly during more than three years, in 
consequence of the jealousies which arose among those who were more or less 
interested in its prosecution. The pope wished to bring it entirely under 
the jurisdiction of the church, and to have it decided at Rome.  The king, 
on the other hand, mistrusting the pope, and resolved on the destruction of 
the order, and that none but himself &should reap advantage of it, decided 
that it &should be judged at Paris under his own personal influence.  The 
prosecution was directed by his ministers, Nogaret, and Enguerrand de 
Marigny.  The Templars asserted their innocence, and demanded a fair trial; 
but they found few advocates who would undertake their defence, and they 
were subjected to hardships and tortures which forced many of them into 
confessions dictated to them by their persecutors.  During this interval, 
the popes orders were carried into other countries, ordering the arrest of 
the Templars, and the &seizure of their goods, and everywhere the same 
charges were brought against them, and the same means adopted to procure 
their condemnation, although they were not everywhere &subjected to the 
&same severity as in France.  At length, in the spring of 1316, the grand 
process was opened in Paris, and an immense number of Templars, brought from 
all parts of the kingdom, under-went a public examination.  A long act of 
accusation was read, some of the heads of which were, that the Templars, at 
their reception into the order, denied Christ (and some-times they denied 
expressly all the &saint&s) declaring that he was not God truly, but a false 
prophet, a man who had been punished for his crimes ; that they had no hope 
of &salvation through him ; that they always, at their initiation into the 
order, &spit upon the cross, and trod it under foot that they did this 
especially on Good Friday; that they worshipped a certain cat, which 
sometimes appeared to them in their congregation ; that they did not believe 
in any of the sacraments of the church ; that they took secret oaths which 
they were bound not to reveal; that the brother who officiated at the 
reception of a new brother kissed the naked body of the latter, often in a 
very unbe-coming manner; that each different province of the order had its 
idol, which was a head, having sometimes three faces, and at others only 
one; or sometimes a human skull; these idol&s they worshipped in their 
chapters and congre-gations, believing that they had the power of making 
them rich, and of causing the trees to flourish, and the earth to become 
fruitful; that they girt themselves with cords, with which these idols had 
been superstitiously touched ; that those who betrayed the &secrets of their 
order, or were disobedient, were thrown into prison, and often put to death; 
that they held their chapters &secretly and by night, and placed a watch to 
prevent them from any danger of interruption or discovery; and that they 
believed the Grand Master alone had the power of absolving them from their 
sins.  The publication of these charges, and the agitation which had been 
designedly got up, created &such a horror throughout France, that the 
Templars who died during the process were treated as condemned heretics, and 
burial in consecrated ground was refused to their remains.
     When we read over the numerous examinations of the Templars, in other 
countries, as well as in France, we cannot hut feel convinced that some of 
these charges had a degree of foundation, though perhaps the circumstances 
on which they were founded were misunderstood.  A very great number of 
knights agreed to the general points of the formula of initiation, and we 
cannot but believe that they did deny Christ, and that they &spat and trod 
upon the cross. The words of the denial were, Je reney Deu Je reney Jhesu, 
repeated thrice ; but most of those who confessed having gone through this 
ceremony, declared that they did it with repugnance, and that they &spat 
beside the cross, and not on it.  The reception took place in a secret room, 
with closed doors ; the candidate was compelled to take off part or all of 
his garments (very rarely the latter), and then he was kissed on various 
parts of the body. One of the knight’s examined, Guischard de Marzici, said 
he remembered the receptlon of Hugh de Marhaud, of the diocese of Lyons, 
whom he saw taken into a small room, which was closed up so that no one 
could see or hear what took place within ; but that when, after some time, 
he was let out, he was very pale, and looked as though he were troubled and 
amazed (fuit valde pallidus et quasi turbatus et stupefactus.)  In 
conjunction, however, with these &strange and revolting ceremonies, there 
were others that showed a reverence for the Christian church and its 
ordinances, a profound faith in Christ, and the con-sciousness that the 
partaker of them was entering into a holy vow.
     M. Michelet, who has carefully investigated the materials relating to 
the trial of the Templars, has suggested at least an ingenious explanation 
of these anomalies.  He imagines that the form of reception was borrowed 
from the figurative mysteries and rites of the early church. The candidate 
for admission into the order, according to this notion, was first presented 
as a sinner and renegade, in which character, after the example of St. 
Peter, he denied Christ.  This denial was a sort of pantomime, in which the 
novice expressed his reprobate state by spitting on the cross.  The 
candidate was then stripped of his profane clothing, received through the 
kiss of the order into a higher state of faith, and re-dressed with the garb 
of its holiness. Forms like these would, in the middle ages, be easily 
misunderstood, and their original meaning soon forgotten.
     Another charge in the accusation of the Templars seems to have been to 
a great degree proved by the depositions of witnesses; the idol or head 
which they were said to have worshipped, but the real character or meaning 
of which we are totally unable to explain.  Many Templars con-fessed to 
having seen this idol, but as they described it differently, we must suppose 
that it was not in all cases represented under the same form.  Some said it 
was a frightful head, with long beard and sparkling eyes; others said it was 
a man’s skull; some described it as having three faces ; some said it was of 
wood, and others of metal; one witness described it as a painting  (tabula 
picta) repre-senting the image of a man, (imago hominis), and said that when 
it was shown to him, he was ordered to" adore Christ his creator."  
According to some it was a gilt figure, either of wood or metal ; while 
others described it as painted black and white.  According to another 
deposition, the idol had four feet-two before and two behind ; the one 
belonging to the order at Paris was said to be a silver head, with two faces 
and a beard.  The novices of the order were told always to regard this idol 
as their saviour.  Deodatus Jaffet, a knight from the south of France, who 
had been received at Pedenat, deposed that the person who in his case 
performed the ceremonies of reception, showed him a head or idol, which 
appeared to have three faces, and said, " You must adore this as your 
saviour, and the saviour of the order of the Temple," and that he was made 
to worship the idol, saying, " Blessed be he who shall save my soul."  
Cettus Ragonis, a knight received at Rome in a chamber of the palace of the 
Lateran, gave a somewhat similar account.  Many other witnesses spoke of 
having seen these heads, which, however, were, perhaps, not shown to 
everybody, for the greatest number of those who spoke on this subject, said 
that they had heard speak of the bead, but that they had never seen it 
themselves; and many of them declared their disbelief in its existence.  A 
friar minor deposed in England that an English Templar had assured him that 
in that country the order had four principal idols, one at London in the 
sacristy of the Temple, another at Bristeham, a third at Brueria (Bruern in 
Lincolnshire). and a fourth beyond the Humber.
     Some of the knights from the south added another circumstance in their 
confessions relating to this head. A Tempter of Florence declared that, in 
the secret meetings of the chapters, one brother said to the others, showing 
them the idol,  Adore this head. This head is your God, and your Mahomet."  
Another, Gauserand de Montpesant, said that the idol was made in the figure 
of Baffomet (in figuram Baffometi); and another Raymond Rubei, described it 
as a wooden head, on which was painted the figure of Baphomet, and he adds, 
"that he worshipped it by kissing its feet, and exclaiming, Yalla," which he 
describes as "a word of the Saracens " (verbum Saracenorum). This has been 
seized upon by some as a proof that the Tempters had secretly embraced 
Mahometanism. As Baffomet or Bapho-met is evidently a corruption of Mahomet; 
but it must not be forgotten that the Christians of the West constantly used 
the word Mahomet in the mere signification of an idol, and that it was the 
desire of those who conducted the prosecution against the Tempters to show 
their intimate intercourse with the Saracens.  Others, especially Von 
Hammer, gave a Greek derivation of the word, and assumed it as a proof that 
Gnosticism was the secret doctrine of the Temple.
     The confessions with regard to the mysterious cat were much rarer and 
more vague.  Some Italian knights con-fessed that they had been present at a 
secret chapter of twelve knights held at Brindisi, at which a grey cat 
suddenly appeared amongst them, and that they worshipped it. At Nismes, some 
Templars declared that they had been present at a chapter at Montpellier, at 
which the demon appeared to them in the form of a cat, and promised them 
worldly prosperity; and added, that they saw devils in the shape of women.  
Gilletus de Encreyo, a Templar of the diocese of Rheims, who disbelieved in 
the story of the cat, deposed that he had heard say, though he knew not by 
whom, that in some of their battles beyond sea, a cat had appeared to them.  
An English knight, who was examined at London, deposed, that in England they 
did not adore the cat or the idol to his knowledge, but he had beard it 
positively stated that they worshipped the cat and the idol in parts beyond 
sea.  English witnesses deposed to other acts of  idolatry."  It was of 
course the demon, who presented himself in the form of the cat. A lady, 
named Agnes Lovecote, examined in England, stated that she had heard that, 
at a chapter held in Dines-lee (Dynnesley, in Hertfordshire), the devil 
appeared to the Templars in a monstrous form, having precious stones instead 
of eyes, which shone so bright that they illuminated the whole chapter ; the 
brethren, in succession, kissed him on the posteriors, and marked there the 
form of the cross.  She was told that one young man, who refused to go 
through this ceremony, was thrown into a well, and a great stone cast upon 
him.  Another witness, Robert de Folde, said that he had heard twenty years 
ago, that in the same place, the devil came to the chapter once a year, and 
flew away with one of the knights, whom he took as a sort of tribute.  Two 
others deposed that certain Templars confessed to them that at a grand 
annual assembly in the county of York, the Templars worshipped a calf. All 
this is mere hearsay, but it shows the popular opinion of the conduct of the 
order.  A Templar examined in Paris, named Jacques de Treces, who said that 
he had been informed that at secret chapters held at midnight, a head 
appeared to the assembled brethren, added, that one of them "had a private 
demon, by whose council he was wise and rich."
     The aim of King Philippe was secured; he seized upon the whole treasure 
of the temple in France, and became rich.  Those who ventured to speak in 
defence of the order were browbeaten, and received little attention the 
torture was employed to force confessions ; fifty-four Templars who refused 
to confess were carried to the wind-mill of St. Aritoine, in the suburbs of 
Paris, and there burnt; and many others, among whom was the Grand Master 
himself, were subsequently brought to the stake. After having lasted two or 
three years, the process ended in the condemnation and suppression of the 
order, and its estates were given in some countries to the knights of St. 
John.  It was in France that the persecution was most cruel; in England, the 
order was suppressed, but no executions took place.  Even in Italy, the 
severity of the judges was not everywhere the same; in Lombardy and Tuscany, 
the Templars were condemned, while they were acquitted at Ravenna and 
Bologna.  They were also pronounced innocent in Castile, while in Arragon 
they were reduced by force, only because they had attempted to resist by 
force of arms; and both in Spain and in Portugal they only gave up their own 
order to be admitted into others.  The pope was offended at the lenity shown 
towards them in England, Spain, and Germany.  The order of the temple was 
finally dissolved and abolished, and its memory branded with disgrace.  Some 
of the knights are said to have remained together, and formed secret 
societies.  The result, in effect, was the same everywhere.  Convicted of 
heresy, sorcery, and many other abominations, the wretched Templars were 
everywhere punished with death by fire, imprisonment, and their goods 
escheated to the various crowned heads of Europe, nearly all of whom 
followed the avaricious example of Philip of France. Jacques de Molay, the 
Grand Master, brought out on to a scaffold erected in front of Notre Dame in 
Paris, and asked to repeat his confession and receive sentence of perpetual 
imprisonment, flared into sudden anger, recanted all he had said, and 
protested his innocence.  He was burnt, and summoned the Pope and the King 
with his dying breath, to meet him before the bar of Heaven.  Both of these 
dignatories shortly afterwards died, and it remained in the public mind that 
the outcome of the Grand Masters summons had proved his innocence.
     As has been said, there is every reason to believe that there was some 
foundation for the charges of heresy made against the Templars. Their 
intimate connection with the East, and the long establishment of the order 
therein had in all probability rendered their Christianity not quite so pure 
as that of Western Europe.  Numerous treatises have been written for the 
purpose of proving and disproving the Temple heresy, to show that it 
followed the doctrines and rites of the Gnostic Ophites of Islam (Baphomet 
being merely a corruption of Mahomet), and it has been collated with various 
other eastern systems. Hans Prutz, in his Geheimlehre furthered the view of 
the rejection of Christianity in favour of a religion based on Gnostic 
dualism, and at once raised up a host of critics. But many defenders of the 
order followed, and it was proved in numerous instances the confessions 
wrung from the Templars were the result of extreme torture.  In not a few 
cases were they acquitted, as in Castile, Aragon, Portugal, and at many 
German and Italian centres.  It has also been shown that the answers of a 
number of the knights under torture were practically dictated to them. In 
England, out of eighty Templars examined, only four confessed to the charge 
of heresy, and of these two were apostates.  The whole question may perhaps 
he summed up as follows. The Templars, through long association with the 
East, may have become more tolerant of pagan-ism, more broadminded, in their 
outlook, than  their bigoted stay-at-home countrymen.  Expressions as 
regards the worthiness of Saracen nations, among whom the Templars had many 
friends, would be regarded askance in France, Spain and England, and habits 
acquired by residence in the East would probably add to the growing body of 
suspicion regarding the loyalty of the order to Christianity.  It is even 
possible that the Templars intro-duced into their rites practices which 
savoured of Gnosti-cism or Mahomedanism, but that is unlikely.  They were, 
in short, the victims of their own arrogance, their com-mercial success, and 
the superstitious ignorance of their contemporaries.
     It has frequently been asserted that on the death of Jacques de Molay a 
conspiracy was entered into by the surviving Templars which had for its 
objects the destruction of papacy and the several kingdoms of Europe, and 
that this tradition was handed on through generations of initiates through 
such societies as the Illuminati and the Freemasons, who in the end brought 
about the French Revolution and the downfall of the French throne.  Such a 
theory, however enticing to the pseudo-occultist, the defender of the theory 
that occult tradition has descended to us through a direct line of adepts, 
or the fictioneer, can receive no countenance here, and must be dismissed as 
a mere figment of enthusiasm or imagination.


Temple Church, London: Hargrave Jennings in his Rosi-crucians, their Rites 
and Mysteries, says  The Temple Church, London, presents many mythic 
figures, which have a Rosicrucian expression.  In the spandrels of the 
arches of the long church, besides the " Beauseant" which is repeated in 
many places, there are the armorial figures following; " Argent, on a cross 
gules, the Agnus Dei, or Paschal Lamb, or, " Gules the Agnus Dei, dis 
playing over the right shoulder the standard of the Temple; or, a banner, 
triple cloven, bearing a cross gules ; " Azure, a cross prolonged potent 
issuant out of the crescent moon argent, horns, upwards, on either side of 
the cross, a star or."  This latter figure signifies the Virgin Mary, and 
displays the cross as rising like the pole, or mast of a ship (argha) out of 
the midst of the crescent moon or navis biprora, curved at both ends ; " 
azure, semme of estoiles or."  The staff of the Grand Master of the Templars 
displayed a curved cross of four splays, or blades, red upon white. The 
eight-pointed red Buddhist cross was also one of the Templar ensigns.  The 
Temple arches abound with brandished estoiles, or stars, with wavy or 
crooked flames. The altar at the east end of the Temple Church has a cross 
flourie, with lower limb prolonged, or, on a field of estoiles, wavy; to the 
right is the Decalogue, surmounted by the initials, A.O. (Alpha and Omega), 
on the left are the monograms of the Saviour, I. C., X. C.; beneath, is the 
Lords Prayer.  The whole altar displays feminine colours and emblems, the 
Temple Church being dedicated to the Virgin Maria.  The winged horse, or 
Pegasus, argent, in a field gules, is the badge of the Templars. The tombs 
of the Templars, disposed around the circular church in London, are of that 
early Norman shape called dos dane; their tops are triangular;  the ridge-
moulding passes through the temples and out of the mouth of a mask at the 
upper end, and issues out of the horned skull, apparently of some purposely 
trodden creature. The head at the top is shown in the "honour-point" of the 
cover of the tomb. There is an amount of unsuspected meaning in every curve 
of these Templar tombs.


Tempon-teloris - Ship of the Dead: Among the Dayaks of Borneo the Ship of 
the Dead, the vessel which carries the souls of the departed in search of 
the hereafter, is generally represented as being of the shape of a bird, the 
rhinoceros--hornbill.  Accompanying the souls on their journey through the 
fire-sea are all the stores which have been laid out at the trivah or feast 
of the dead, and all the slaves who have been killed for that purpose. After 
some vicissitudes in the fiery sea, the Ship of the Dead, with Tempon-telon 
at the helm, reaches the golden shores of the Blessed.

Tephillin : In the Hebrew tongue means " attachments." They were originally 
prayer thongs worn by the Jews at morning prayer-one on the left arm and 
another on the head. They came to be regarded as talismans and were used in 
many traditional ceremonies.  The Talmud says:
"Whoever has the tephillin bound to his head and arm is protected from sin."


Tephramancy:	A mode of divination in which use is made of the ashes of 
the fire which had consumed the victims of a sacrifice.


Teraphim, The : Of the nature of oracles. The teraphim were taken away from 
Jacob by his daughter, Rachel, and this mention of them in the Bible is the 
earliest record we have of " magical" apparatus. Their form is not known, 
nor the exact use to which they were put; but from an allusion to them in 
Hosea III., 4, they were evidently not idols.  Spencer maintains that they 
were the same as the " Urim" of Mosaic ritual; at any rate it seems likely 
that they were used as a means of divination.

Teutons : The Teutonic or " Germanic" nations, embracing the peoples of High 
and Low German speech, Dutch, Danes, and Scandinavians, have always 
displayed and still display a marked leaning towards the study and con-
sideration of the occult.  We are, however, concerned here with their 
attitude towards the hidden sciences in more ancient times, and must refer 
the reader to the article on " Germany" and the other countries alluded to 
for information upon medieval and modern occultism in them.
     But little can he gleaned from the writings of classical authors upon 
the subject, and it is not until we approach the middle ages, the 
contemporary manuscripts concerning the traditions of an earlier day, and 
the works of such writers as Snorre Sturluson and Saemund (The Eddas) 
Saxo-Grammaticus, and such epics or pseudo-histories as The Nibelungenlied 
that we find any light thrown upon the dark places of Teutonic magical 
practice and belief.  From the consideration of such authorities we arrive 
at several basic conclusions  (1) That magic with the Teutons was non-
hierophantic, and was not in any respect the province of the priesthood, as 
with the Celtic Druids ;   (2) That women were its chief conservators ; (3) 
That it principally resided in the study and elucidation of the runic 
script, in the same manner as in early Egypt it was part and parcel of the 
ability to decipher the hieroglyphic characters. Passing from the first 
conclusion, which is self-evident, as we discover all &sorts and conditions 
of people dabbling in magical practice, we find that to a great extent 
sorcery-for efforts seem to have been confined mostly to black magic-was 
principally the province of women.  This is to be explained, perhaps, by the 
circumstance that only those who could read the runes-that is, those who 
could read at all-were able to undertake the &study of the occult, and that 
therefore the unlettered warrior, too restless for the repose of study, was 
barred from all advance in the subject.  We find women in all ranks of life 
addicted to the practice of sorcery, from the queen on the throne to the 
wise-woman or witch dwelling apart from the com-munity.  Thus the mother-in-
law of Siegfried bewitches him by a draught, and scores of similar instances 
could be adduced.  At the same time the general type of ancient Teutonic 
magic is not very high, it is greatly hampered by human considerations, and 
is much at the mercy of the human element on which it acts, and the very 
human desires which call it forth.  Indeed in many cases it is rendered 
nugatory by the mere cunning of the object upon which it is wreaked.  In 
fine it does not rise very much above the type of sorcery in vogue among 
barbarian peoples at the present day.  It is &surprising, however, with all 
these weaknesses, how powerful a hold it con-trived to get upon the popular 
imagination, which was literally &drenched with the belief in &supernatural 
science.
     Runes.-(German, rune ; Anglo-Saxon run; Icelandic run).  The word is 
derived from an old Low German word raunen to cut" or  to carve," and as the 
runes in more ancient times were invariably carved and not written, it 
latterly came to designate the characters them-selves.  As has been said, 
comparatively few were able to decipher them, and the elucidation was left 
to the curious, the ambitious among the female sex, and the leisured few in 
general, those perhaps including priests and lawmen.  Consequently we find 
the power to decipher them an object of mysterious veneration among the 
ignorant and a belief that the ability to elucidate them meant the 
possession of magical powers.  The possessors of this ability would in no 
wise minimise it, so that the belief in their prowess would flourish.  
Again, it is clear that a certain amount of patience and natural ability 
were necessary to the acquirement of such an intricate script. The tradition 
that they were connected with &sorcery has &scarcely yet died out in some 
parts of Iceland.  In later times the word runes came to be applied to all 
the alpha-betical systems employed by the Teutonic peoples before the 
introduction of Christianity.  Their origin is obscure, some authorities 
denying that it is Teutonic, and asserting that they are merely a 
transformation or adaptation of the Greek characters, and others that they 
have a Phoeni-cian or even cuneiform ancestry.  That they are of non-
Teutonic origin is highly probable, as may be inferred from their strong 
resemblance to other scripts and from the circumstance that it is highly 
unlikely that they could have been separately evolved by the Teutonic race 
in the state of comparative barbarism in which it was when they first came 
into general use. They have been divided into three systems - English, 
German, and Scandinavian-but the difference between these is merely local. 
They were not employed in early times for literary purposes, but for 
inscriptions only, which are usually found on stone monuments, weapons, 
implements, and personal ornaments and furniture.  In England runic 
inscriptions are found in the north only, where Scandinavian influence was 
strongest. The first symbols of the runic alphabet have the powers of the 
letters f, u, th, o, r, c, for which reason the order of the runic letters 
is called not an alphabet but a futhorc.  The system is symbolic.  Thus its 
first quantity or letter pictures the head and horns of an ox, and is called 
feoh after that animal, the second is called ur, after the word for " bull," 
the third thoru, a tree, the others following Os, a door; rad, a saddle,; 
caen, a torch, all because of some fancied resemblance to the objects, or, 
more properly speaking, because they were probably derived or evolved from a 
purely pictorial &system in which the pictures of the animals or objects 
enumerated above stood for the letters of the alphabet.  Since these were 
cut. some connection may be permitted between Anglo-Saxon secgan, to say, 
and Latin secare, to cut, especially when we find secret signa-tures made of 
old by merely cutting a chip from the bark manuscript.  In spelling, for 
example, the old sense of "spell" was a thin chip or shaving.  Tacitus 
mentions that in Teutonic divination a rod cut from a fruit-bearing tree was 
cut into slips, and the slips, having marks on them, were thrown confusedly 
on a white garment to be taken up with prayer to the gods and interpreted as 
they were taken.  A special use of light cuttings for such fateful cross-
readings or " Virgilian lots," may have given to
“spells " their particular association with the words of the magician.
     Belief in Nature Spirits.-The scope of this work is entirely without 
the consideration of mythology proper, that is to say that the greater 
deities of the many human religious systems receive no treatment save in 
several special circumstances.  But the lesser figures of mythology, those 
who enter into direct contact with man and assist him, or are connected with 
him, in magical practice, receive special and &separate notice. Thus the 
duergar, or dwarfs trolls, undines, nixies, and all the countless host of 
Teu-tonic folk-lore are alluded to under their separate headings, and we 
have here only to consider their general connection with Teutonic man in his 
magical aspect.  His belief in them was distinctly of an animistic 
character.  The dwarfs and trolls inhabited the recesses of the mountains, 
caves, and the underworld.  The nixies and undines dwelt in the lakes, 
rivers, pools, and inlets of the sea.  In general these were friendly to 
man, but objected to more than an occasional intercourse with him.  Though 
not of the class of supernatural being who obey the behests of man in answer 
to magical summonses, these, especially the dwarfs, often acted as his 
instructors in art-magic, and many instances of this are to be met with in 
tales and romances of early Teutonic origin. The dwarfs were usually 
assisted by adventitious aids in their practice of magic, such as belts 
which endowed the wearer with strength, like that worn by King Laurin, shoes 
of swiftness, analogous to the seven-league boots of folk-tale, caps of 
invisibility, and so forth.
     Witchcraft.-Witchcraft, with its accompaniment of diabolism was much 
more in favour among the northern Teutons than it was in Germany, and this 
circumstance has been attributed to their proximity to the Finns (q.v.), a 
race notorious for its magical propensities.  In Norway, Orkney, and 
Shetland, we find the practice of sorcery almost exclusively in the hands of 
women of Finnish race, and there is little doubt that the Finns exercised 
upon the Teutons of Scandinavia the mythic influence of a conquered race, 
that is, they took full advantage of the terror in-spired in their 
conquerors by an alien and unfamiliar religion and ritual, which partook 
largely of the magical. The principal machinery of Teutonic witchcraft was 
the raising of storms, the selling of pieces of knotted rope, each knot 
representing a wind, divination and prophecy, acquir-ing invisibility, and 
such magical practices as usually accom-pany a condition of semi-barbarism.  
In the North of Scotland the Teutonic and Celtic magical systems may be said 
to have met and fused, but not to have clashed, as their many points of 
resemblance outweighed their differ-ences.  As the sea was the element of 
the people, we find it the chief element of the witch of the northern 
Teutons. Thus we discover in the saga of Frithjof, the two sea-witches Heyde 
and Ham riding the storm and sent by Helgi to raise a tempest which would 
drown Frithjof, and taking the shape of a bear and a storm-eagle.  In the 
saga of Grettir the Strong we find a witch-wife, Thurid, sending adrift a 
magic log which should come to Grettir&s island, and which should lead to 
his undoing.  Animal transforma-tion plays a considerable part in Teutonic 
magic and witchcraft.  In early Germany the witch (hexe) seems to have been 
also a vampire.
     Second Sight.-It was, however, in prophecy and divina-tion that the 
Teutons excelled, and this was more rife among the more northern branches of 
the people than the southern.  Prophetic utterance was usually induced by 
ecstasy.  But it was not the professional diviner alone who was capable of 
supernatural vision.  Anyone under stress of excitement, and particularly if 
near death, might become "fey," that is prophetic, and great attention was 
invariably paid to utterances made whilst in this condition.

Theomancy : The part of the Jewish Kabala which studies the mysteries of the 
divine majesty and seeks the sacred names.  He who possesses this science 
knows the future, commands nature, has full power over angels and demons, 
and can perform miracles. The Rabbis claimed that it was by this means that 
Moses performed so many marvels; that Joshua was able to stop the sun; that 
Elias caused fire to fall from heaven, and raised the dead ; that Daniel 
closed the mouths of the lions ; and that the three youths were not consumed 
in the furnace.  However, although very expert in the divine names, the 
Jewish rabbis no longer perform any of the wonders done by their fathers.


Theosophical Society was founded in 1875 by Helena Petrovna Blavatsky and 
Henry Steele Olcott.  They met in America in 1874 where Colonel Olcott was 
engaged in spiritualistic investigation at the house of the Eddy Brothers in 
Vermont. Madame Blavatsky was, of course, deeply read in every thing 
pertaining to the occult and similarity of tastes very-naturally drew them 
together.  Scientific materialism was then engaging general attention and 
making no little progress, and since theosophy is the antithesis of 
material-ism of any kind, it was decided that some society should be formed 
to combat this movement. In May, 1875, a Miracle Club was formed, but it was 
a failure.  Later in the same year, in the month of September, a fresh 
attempt was how-ever, agreed on and this was made in November with Col. 
Olcott as president, and Madame Blavatsky as correspond-ing secretary, and a 
membership of twenty. This attempt seemed also to be doomed to failure, many 
members dropping off because no phenomena were manifested and indeed only 
Col. Olcott and Madame Blavatsky remained with two of the founders of the 
society and a few other members.  Not discouraged by this, however, they 
decided to amalgamate with the Indian Society, but even this met with no 
more success, and it was not till by a happy inspiration the society was 
removed to India, that it began to attract attention and make headway.  From 
that time its success was assured and, whatever opinions may be held of the 
soundness of theosophical teaching, no doubt can be entertained of the 
extent and influence of the society, which has numerous members in lands so 
far apart and so different in spirit as America and India, besides every 
other civilised country in the world.  In accordance with the spirit of 
theosophy, no dogma is demanded of members save acceptance of the belief in 
the brotherhood of man, so that Christian and Mohammedan may meet on equal 
terms without any necessity of varying their peculiar religious beliefs.  
Its activities include study of everything germane to theosophy, religion, 
philosophy, laws of nature whether patent to all mankind as in the domain of 
science, or hidden as yet from all but those with special knowledge, as in 
the domain of the occult.  (See Theosophy.)

Theosophical Society of Agrippa: Agrippa (q.v.) established in Paris and 
other centres a secret theosophical society, the rites of admission to which 
were of a peculiar character. The fraternity also possessed signs of 
recognition.  Agrippa visited London in 1510, and whilst there he 
established a branch of the order in that city.  A letter of Landulph’s is 
extant in which he introduces to Agrippa a native of Nuremberg resident at 
Lyons, and whom he hopes " may be found worthy to become one of the 
brotherhood."


Theosophy : From the Greek theos, god, and sophia, wisdom; a philosophical-
religious system which claims absolute knowledge of the existence and nature 
of the deity, and is not to be confounded with the later system evolved by 
the founders of the Theosophical Society.  This knowledge, it is claimed, 
may be obtained by special individual revela-tion, or through the operation 
of some higher faculty.  It is the transcendent character of the godhead of 
theosophical systems which differentiates them from the philosophical 
systems of the speculative or absolute type, which usually proceed 
deductively from the idea of God.  God is con-ceived in theosophical systems 
as the transcendant source of being, from whom man in his natural state is 
far removed. Theosophy is practically another name for speculative 
mysticism.  Thus the Kabalistic and Neoplatonic con-ceptions of the divine 
emanations are in reality theosophical, as are the mystical systems of 
Boebme and Baader.
     Theosophy has also come to signify the tenets and teachings of the 
founders of the Theosophical Society. This Society was founded in the United 
States in 1875 by Madame H. P. Blavatsky (q.v.), Col. H. S. Olcott (q.v.) 
and others.  Its objects were to establish a nucleus of the Universal 
Brotherhood of Humanity, to promote the study of comparative religion and 
philosophy and to investigate the mystic powers of life and matter. The 
conception of the Universal Brotherhood was based upon the oriental idea of 
One Life-that ultimate oneness which underlies all diversity, whether inward 
or outward. The study of comparative religion was materialised into a 
definite system of belief, the bounds of which were dogmatically fixed.  It 
is set forth in the Theosophical system that all the great religions of the 
world originated from one supreme source and that they are merely expres-
sions of a central  Wisdom Religion" vouchsafed to various races of the 
earth in such a manner as was best suited to time and geographical 
circumstances. Underlying these was a secret doctrine or esoteric teaching 
which it was stated, had been the possession for ages of certain Mahatmas, 
or adepts in mysticism and occultism.  With these Madame Blavatsky claimed 
to be in direct communi-cation, and she herself manifested occult phenomena, 
producing the ringing of astral bells, and so forth.  On several occasions 
these efforts were unmasked as fraudu-lent, but that is no justification for 
believing that Madame Blavatsky was entirely a person of deceitful 
character. There can be very little doubt that she was one of those rare 
personalities who possess great natural psychic powers, which at times 
failing her, she was driven in self-protection to adopt fraudulent methods.  
The evidence for the existence of the  Great White Brotherhood " of Mahat-
mas, the existence of which she asserted, is unfortunately somewhat feeble.  
It rests, for the most part, on the statements of Madame Blavatsky, Col. 
Olcott, Mr. Sinnet, Mr. Leadbeater, and others, who claimed to have seen or 
communicated with them.  With every desire to do justice to these upholders 
of the Theosophical argument, it is necessary to point out that it has been 
amply proved that in occult, or pseudo-occult experiences. the question of 
self-hallucination enters very largely (See Witchcraft), and the ecstatic 
condition may be answerable for subjective appearances which seem real 
enough to the visionary. Again the written communications of the Mahatmas 
give rise to some doubt.  It is pointed out for instance that one of them 
employed the American system of spelling, and this was accounted for by the 
circumstance that his English had been sophisticated by reading American 
books.
     The revelations of Madame Blavatsky were in reality no more than a 
melange of Buddhistic, Brahministic and Kabalistic matter;  but the 
Theosophical Society has numbered within its members several persons of very 
high ability, whose statement and exegesis of their faith has placed it upon 
a much higher level and more definite foundation.  If the system is 
intensely dogmatic, it is also constructed in a manner akin to genius, and 
evolved on most highly intricate lines.  This system was to a great extent 
pieced together after the death of the original founder of the society, on 
which event a schism occurred in the Brotherhood through the claims to 
leadership of William Q. Judge, of New York, who died in 1896, and who was 
followed by Mrs. Katherine Tingley, the founder of the great theosophical 
community at Point Loma, Califor-nia.  Col. Olcott became the leader of the 
remaining part of the original Theosophical Society in America and India, 
being assisted in his work by Mrs. Annie Besant, but a more or less 
independent organisation was founded in England.
     A brief outline of the tenets of Theosophy may be attempted.  It posits 
absolute belief in its views instead of blind faith.  It professes to be the 
religion which holds the germs of all others.  It has also its aspect as a 
science-a science of life and of the soul.  The facts which it was to lay 
before humanity are as follow :-" There are three truths which are absolute, 
and which cannot be lost, but yet may remain silent for lack of speech.  The 
soul of man is immortal and its future is the future of the thing, whose 
growth and splendour has no limit.  The principle which gives life dwells in 
us and without us, is undying and eter-nally beneficent, is not heard, or 
seen, or smelt, but is perceived by the man who desires perception.  Each 
man is his own absolute law-giver, the dispenser of glory or gloom to 
himself, decreer of his life, his reward, his punishment."
     Although Theosophy posits the existence of an Absolute, it does not 
pretend to knowledge of its attributes.  In the Absolute are innumerable 
universes, and in each universe countless solar systems.  Each solar system 
is the  ex-pression of a being called the Logos, the Word of God, or Solar 
Deity, who permeates it and exists above it and outside it.  Below this 
Solar Deity are his seven ministers, called Planetary Spirits, whose 
relation to him is like that of the nerve centres to the brain, so that all 
his voluntary acts come through him to them.  (See Kabala.)  Under them are 
vast hosts or orders of spiritual beings called devas, or angels, who assist 
in many ways.  This world is ruled by a great official who represents the 
Solar Deity, which is in absolute control of all the evolution that takes 
place upon this planet.  When a new religion is to be founded, this being 
either comes himself or sends one of his pupils to institute it.  In the 
earlier stages of the develop-ment of humanity, the great officials of the 
hierarchy are provided from more highly evolved parts of the system, but 
whenever men can be trained to the necessary level of power and wisdom these 
offices are held by them. They can only be filled by adepts, who in 
goodness, power and wisdom are immeasurably greater than ordinary men, and 
have attained the summit of human evolution.  These advance until they 
themselves become of the nature of deities.  There are many degrees and many 
lines of activity among these, but some of them always remain within touch 
of the earth and assist in the spiritual evolution of humanity.  This body 
it is which is called the  Great White Brotherhood."  Its members do not 
dwell together, but live separately apart from the world and are in con-
stant communication with one another and with their head.  Their knowledge 
of higher forces is so great that they have no necessity for meeting in the 
physical world, but each dwells in his own country, and their power remains 
unsuspected among those who live near them.  These adepts are willing to 
take as apprentices those who have resolved to devote themselves utterly to 
the service of mankind, and anyone who will may attract their attention by 
showing himself worthy of their notice.  Such an apprentice was Madame 
Blavatsky.  One of these masters has said   In order to succeed the pupil 
must leave his own world and come into ours.
     The formation of a solar system and the cosmogonic operation of the 
theosophical conception has been treated in several separate articles ; as 
have the various planes on which the personality of a man dwells in its long 
journey from earth to the final goal of Nirvana.  The theosophical 
conception of the constitution of man is that he is in essence a spark of 
the divine fire belonging to the Monadic world (q.v.).  For the purposes of 
human evolution this monad manifests itself in lower worlds.  Entering the 
Spiritual World it manifests itself there as the triple spirit having its 
three aspects. one of which always remains in the Spiritual Sphere.  The 
second aspect manifests itself in the Intuitional World ; and the third in 
the Higher Mental World ; and these two are collated with intuition and 
intelligence. These three aspects combined make up the ego which is man 
during the human stage of evolution. The way or path towards enlightenment 
and emancipation is known as karma.  The human personality is composed of a 
complex organisation consisting of seven principles which are united and 
interdependent, yet divided into certain groups, each capable of maintaining 
a kind of personality.  Each of these principles is composed of its own form 
of matter and possesses its own laws of time, space and motion. The most 
gross of those, the physical body, is known as rupa, which becomes more and 
more refined until we reach the universal self atma ; but the circumstance 
which determines the individual's powers, tests and advantages, or in short 
his character, is his karma, which is the sum of his bodily, mental and 
spiritual growth and is spread over many lives past and future; in short, as 
man soweth, so must he reap; and if in one existence he is handicapped by 
any defect, mental or physical, it may be regarded as the outcome of past 
delin-quencies.  This doctrine is practically common to both Buddhism and 
Brahminism.
     After this digression, which was entered into for the purpose of 
affording a fuller view of the theosophic con-ception of human personality, 
we return to the constitution of man.  The ego existing in the Higher Mental 
World cannot enter the Physical World until it has drawn around itself a 
veil composed of the matter of these spheres  nor can it think in any but an 
abstract manner without them-its concrete ideas being due to them.  Having 
assumed the astral and physical bodies, it is born as a human being; and 
having lived out its earth-life sojourns for a time in the Astral World, 
until it can succeed in throwing off the shackles of the astral body.  When 
that is achieved man finds himself living in his mental body.  The stay in 
this sphere is usually a long one-the strength of the mental constitution 
depending upon the nature of the thoughts to which he has habituated 
himself.  But he is not yet sufficiently developed to proceed to higher 
planes, and once more he descends into the denser physical sphere to again 
go through the same round.  Although he come from on high into these lower 
worlds, it is only through that descent that a full recognition of the 
higher worlds is developed in him.
     In the Higher Mental World, the permanent vehicle is a causal body, 
which consists of matter of the first, second and third sub-divisions of 
that world.  As the ego unfolds his latent possibilities in the course of 
his evolution, this matter is greatly brought into action; but it is only in 
the perfect man, or adept, that it is developed to its fullest extent.  In 
the causal body none of the possibilities of the grosser bodies can manifest 
themselves.
     The mental body is built up of matter of the four lower sub-divisions 
of the Mental World, and expresses man's concrete thoughts.  Its size and 
shape are determined by those of the causal vehicle.
     While on earth the personality wears the physical, mental, and astral 
bodies all at once.  It is the astral which connects him with the Astral 
World during sleep or trance (See Astral Plane.)  It is easy to see how the 
doctrine of rein-carnation arose from this idea. The ego must travel from 
existence to existence, physical, astral, mental, until it transcend the 
Mental World and enter the higher spheres.
     We have in this sketch attempted as far as possible to eschew the 
oriental verbiage of the older theosophical teachers, which it is understood 
is now replaced by more modern terms, but this we have retained in some of 
the lesser articles dealing with Theosophy.
     The theosophic path to the goal of Nirvana is practically derived from 
Buddhistic teaching, but there are also other elements in it,-Kabalistic and 
Greek.  The path is the great work whereby the inner nature of the 
individual is consciously transformed and developed.  A radical alter-ation 
must be made in the aims and motives of the ordinary mortal.  The path is 
long and difficult, and as has been said extends over many existences.  
Morality alone is insufficient to the full awakening of the spiritual 
faculty, without which progress in the path is impossible.  Some-thing 
incomparably higher is necessary.  The physical and spiritual exercises 
recommended by Theosophy are those formulated in the Hindu philosophical 
system known as Raja Yoga.  The most strenuous efforts alone can impel the 
individual along the path, and thus to mount by the practice of Vidyd, that 
higher wisdom which awakens the latent faculties and concentrates effort in 
the direction of union with the Absolute.  The way is described as long and 
difficult, but as the disciple advances he becomes more convinced of his 
ultimate success, by the possession of transcendental faculties which 
greatly assist him to over-come difficulties.  But these must not be sought 
for their own sake, as to gain knowledge of them for evil purposes is 
tantamount to the practice of Black Magic.
     It is not pretended that in this brief sketch the whole of the 
theosophical doctrine has been set forth, and the reader who desires further 
information regarding it is recommended to the many and excellent handbooks 
on the subject which now abound.

Thomas the Rhymer: Scottish Soothsayer (circa, 1220.)  It is impossible to 
name the exact date which witnessed the advent of the Scottish soothsayer, 
Thomas the Rhymer, who is well known on account of his figuring in a fine 
old ballad, duly included in Sir Walter Scott's Minstrelsy of the Scottish 
Border.  But Thomas is commonly supposed to have lived at the beginning of 
the thirteenth century, that period being assigned because the name, "Thomas 
Rimor de Ercildun," is appended as witness to a deed, whereby one " Petrus 
de Haga de Bemersyde" agrees to pay half a stone of wax annually to the 
Abbot of Melrose, and this " Petrus" has been identified with a person of 
that name known to have been living about 1220.  Ercildun is simply the old 
way of spelling Earlston, a village in the extreme west of Berwickshire, 
hard by the line demarking that county from Roxburgh; and it would seem that 
Thomas held estates in this region, for he is mentioned as a landed-
proprietor by several early writers, most of whom add that he did not hold 
his lands from the Crown, but from the Earls of Dunbar.  Be that as it may, 
Thomas probably spent the greater part of his life in and around Earlston, 
and a ruined tower there, singularly rich in ivy, is still pointed out as 
having been his home, and bears his name; while in a wall of the village 
church there is a lichened stone with the inscription:-

"Auld Rhymour's Race 
Lies in this Place."

and, according to local tradition, this stone was removed to its present 
resting place from one in a much older church, long since demolished.  Nor 
are these things the only relics of the soothsayer, a lovely valley some 
miles to the west of Earlston being still known as  “Rhymer's Glen" and it 
is interesting to recall that Turner painted a water-colour of this place, 
and no less interesting to remember that Sir Walter Scott, when buying the 
lands which eventually constituted his estate of Abbotsford, sought eagerly 
and at last successfully to acquire the glen in question.  Naturally he 
loved it on account of its associa-tions with the shadowy past, and Lockhart 
tells that many of the novelist's happiest times were spent in this romantic 
place ; while he relates how Maria Edgworth visited it in 1823, and that 
thenceforth Sir Walter used always to speak of a certain boulder in the glen 
as the " Edgworth stone," the lady writer whom he admired so keenly having 
rested here for a space.  It seems probable, however, that the glen was so 
named by Scott himself.
     It is thought that Thomas died about 5297, and it is clear that he had 
achieved a wide fame as a prophet, many references to his skill in this 
relation being found in writers who lived comparatively soon after him.  A 
Harleian manuscript in the British Museum, known to have been written before 
1320, discloses the significant phrase,  “La Comtesse de Donbar demanda a 
Thomas de Essedoune quant la guere descoce prendreit fyn:" but the lady in 
question was not a contemporary of the prophet.  In Barbour's Bruce, 
composed early in the fourteenth century, we find the poet saying,

“Sikerly
I hop Thomas prophecy
Off Hersildoune sail weryfied be."

Andro of Winton, in the Originale Cronykil of Scotland, also makes mention 
of Thomas as a redoubtable prophet; while Walter Bower, the continuator of 
Fordun's Scotic-ronicon, recounts how once Rhymer was asked by the Earl of 
Dunbar what another day would bring forth, whereupon he foretold the death 
of the king, Alexander III., and the very next morning news of his majesty's 
decease was noised abroad.  Blind Harry's Wallace', written midway through 
the fifteenth century, likewise contains an allusion to Thomas's prophesying 
capacities; while coming to later times, Sir Thomas Gray, Constable of 
Norham, in his Norman-French Scalacronica, compiled during his captivity at 
Edinburgh Castle in 1555, speaks of the predictions of Merlin, which like 
those of  Banaster ou de Thomas de Ercildoune. . . . furount ditz en 
figure." A number of predictions attributed to Thomas the Rhy-mer are still 
current, for instance that weird verse which Sir Walter Scott made the motto 
of The Bride' of Lammer-muir; and also a saying concerning a Border family 
with which, as we have seen, the soothsayer was at one time associated

“Betide, betide, whate'er betide,
There'll aye be Haigs at Bemersyde."

It will be observed that both the foregoing are couched in metre, yet there 
is really no sure proof that the sooth-sayer was a poet.  It is usually 
supposed that he acquired the sobriquet of Rhymer because he was a popular 
minstrel in his day, but the fact remains that Rymour was long a 
comparatively common surname in Berwickshire, and, while it may have 
originated with Thomas, the assumption has but slight foundation.  Again, 
the prophet of Earlston has been credited with a poem on the story of Sir 
Tristram, belonging to the Arthurian cycle of romance, and the Advocate's 
Library contains a manuscript copy 6f this, probably written so early as 
5300.  However, while Sir Walter Scott and other authorities believed in 
this ascrip-tion, it is quite likely that the poem is but a paraphrase from 
some French troubadour.  For generations, however, the Scottish peasantry 
continued to be influenced by the sayings attributed to  True Thomas," as 
they named him, as is witnessed by the publication during comparatively 
modern times of books containing the prophecies which he is said to have 
uttered.

Thought-Reading : A term somewhat loosely applied to various forms of 
apparent thought-transference, even where the method employed is muscle-
reading or actual fraud.  It must not be confused with telepathy, for, 
though both terms are sometimes used synonymously, the latter implies the 
direct action of one mind on another, independent of the ordinary sense-
channels, while no such restrictions are contained in the term " thought-
reading."  In early times, when outbursts of ecstatic frenzy were ascribed 
to demoniac possession, we find the ecstatics credited with the power to 
read thoughts; witches were supposed to be endowed with the same faculty ; 
Paracelsus and the early magnetists recognised its existence.  The advent of 
spiritualism gave to thought-reading a new impetus.  It was now the spirits 
who read the thoughts of the sitters and replied to them with raps and 
table-turnings.  Until quite recently, how-ever, thought-reading was 
attributed either to occultism or fraud.  Not only was the " ethereal 
vibration" theory unthought of, but the phenomena of hyperaesthesia and 
subconscious whispering" were very imperfectly under-stood in their bearing 
on thought-reading.  Yet it is probable that these last offered a 
satisfactory explanation in many cases, especially when the subject was 
entranced.  Pro-fessional thought-readers who performed on public plat-forms 
indulged largely in fraud.  (See Telepathy.)

Tibet : In this country, the stronghold of Buddhism, all superstition 
circles around the national religion, which at the same time has absorbed 
into itself the aboriginal beliefs and demonology. Nowhere perhaps has such 
a vast amount of pure superstition crystallised around the kernel of 
Buddhism,-the pure doctrines of which were found by the Hindu conquerors of 
the Tibetans to be totally unsuited to the Hunnish aborigines of the 
country, who before the advent of Buddhism were in the aministic stage of 
religion. This was allowed to revive and rites and ceremonies, charms and 
incantations, of the very nature which Buddha had so strongly condemned, 
clustered quickly around his philosophy in Tibet.  From this sprang the 
tantra system, which is almost a purely magical one.  It was founded by 
Asanga. a monk of Peshawar, who composed its gospel, the Yogachchara Bhumi 
Sastra in the sixth century A.D. Basing his pantheon upon the debased system 
of Buddhism then prevalent, Asanga reconciled it to native requirements by 
placing a number of Saivite devil-gods and goddesses in the lower Buddhistic 
heavens.  These he made sub-servient to the Buddha.  His religion was 
speedily adopted by the barbarian tribes of Tibet, who sacrificed readily to 
the deities of this new religion.  Very naturally they exaggerated the 
magical side of it, their main object being to obtain supernatural power by 
means of spoken spells and words of power.  A very considerable literature 
sprang up in connection with the new faith, which has been scathingly 
commented upon by disciples of the purer Buddhism as being nothing more or 
less than mere barbarian sorcery.  Of course the monkish class of lamas 
found it impossible altogether to ignore the tantra system, but Tsongkapa in 
the middle of the fourteenth century unhesi-tatingly condemned the whole 
system.  The lamas had and have an esoteric form of Buddhism, which has but 
little in common with the tantra system of the people, but we find them at 
festivals and so on unbending so far as to represent the various devils and 
fiends of this faith.  As literature, the tantras may be considered as a 
later develop-ment of the puranas, but they are without any poetic value.  
They are regarded as gospels by the Saktas, or worshippers of Kali, Durga or 
Purvati the wife of Siva, or some other creative agency.  They abound in 
magical performances and mystic rites-a great many of which are of a quite 
unspeakable character.  They usually take the form of a dialogue between 
Siva and his wife.  There were originally sixty-four tantras, but as yet no 
satisfactory scholarly examination has been made of them.

Timaeus of Locris : The earliest known writer on the doctrines of magic. The 
Timoean theory of God, the Universe, and the World-soul is thus set forth by 
Busching: " God shaped the eternal unformed matter by imparting to it His 
being.  The inseparable united itself with the separable; the unvarying with 
the variable; and, moreover, in the harmonic conditions of the Pythagorean 
system.  To comprehend all things better, infinite space was imagined as 
divided into three portions, which are,-the centre, the circumference, and 
the intermediate space.  The centre is most distant from the highest God, 
who inhabits the circumference ; the space between the two contains the 
celestial spheres.  When God descended to impart His being, the emanations 
from Him penetrated the whole of heaven, and filled the same with 
imperishable bodies. Its power decreased with the distance from the source, 
and lost itself gradually in our world in minute portions, over which matter 
was still dominant.  From this proceeds the continuous change of being and 
decay below the moon, where the power of matter predominates ; from this, 
also, arise the circular movements of the heaven and the earth, the various 
rapidities of the stars, and the peculiar motion of the planets.  By the 
union of God with matter, a third being was created, namely, the world-soul, 
which vitalizes and regulates all things, and occupies the space between the 
centre and the circumference."

Tongues, Speaking and Writing In: The speaking and writing in foreign 
tongues, or in unintelligible outpourings mistaken for such, is a very old 
form of psychic phenomenon.  It was a frequent accompaniment of the epidemic 
ecstasy which was so common in medieval Europe.  Thus the Nuns of Loudon 
(q.v.) are declared to have understood and replied to questions put to them 
in Latin, Greek, Spanish, Turkish, and other even less-known languages. The 
Tremblers of the Cevennes (q.v.) spoke in excellent French, whereas French 
was to them a foreign language. And practically every epidemic of the kind 
was character-ised by the speaking in tongues, which seemed to be infec-
tious, and spread rapidly through whole communities. In these early cases 
the phenomenon was ascribed to the power of supernatural agencies, whether 
demons or angels, who temporarily controlled the organism of the 
"possessed." But analogous instances are to be found in plenty in the annals 
of modern spiritualism, where they are of course regarded as manifestations 
of the spirits of the deceased through the material organism of the medium.  
Compara-tively early in the movement there are evidences of speaking and 
writing in Latin, Greek, French, Swiss, Spanish, and Red Indian languages.  
Judge Edmonds, the well-known American Spiritualist, testified to these 
faculties in his daughter and niece, who spoke Greek, Spanish, Polish, and 
Italian at various times, as well as Red Indian and other languages.  Some 
of these cases are well attested.  Two professional mediums (J. V. Mansfield 
and A. D. Ruggles) are known to have written automatically in many lan-
guages, including Chinese and Gaelic, but whether or not they had any 
previous acquaintance with these languages remains at least a matter of 
doubt.  In still more modern times speaking in tongues has been practised, 
notably by Helene Smith, who invented the " Martian language." On the whole, 
we may take it that the so-called foreign tongues were generally no more 
than a meaningless jumble of articulate sounds, of which the spirits 
themselves some-times purported to offer a translation.  Where there is good 
evidence to show that the writings were actually executed in a foreign 
language, as in the case of the pro-fessional mediums mentioned above, there 
is generally some reason to suppose a former acquaintance with the language, 
which the exaltation of memory incidental to the trance state might revive. 
When unknown tongues were written they were seldom found to correspond with 
any real language.

Tower of London : The jewel-room of the Tower of London is reported to be 
haunted, and, in 1860, there was published in Notes and Queries by the late 
Edmund Lenthal Swifte, Keeper of the Crown Jewels the account of a spectral 
illusion witnessed by himself in the Tower.  He says that in October, 1817, 
he was at supper with his wife, her sister, and his little boy, in the 
sitting-room of the jewel-house. To quote his own words:  “I had offered a 
glass of wine and water to my wife, when, on putting it to her lips, she 
exclaimed, ' Good God  what is that  '  I looked up and saw a cylindrical 
figure like a glass tube, seemingly about the thickness of my arm, and 
hovering between the ceiling and the table ; its contents appeared to be a 
dense fluid, white and pale azure.  This lasted about two minutes, when it 
began to move before my sister-in-law; then, following the oblong side of 
the table, before my son and myself, passing behind my wife, it paused for a 
moment over her right shoulder.  Instantly crouching down, and with both 
hands covering her shoulder, she shrieked out, ‘O Christ!  it has seized me! 
' "  " It was ascertained," adds Mr. Swifte, " that no optical action from 
the outside could have produced any manifestation within, and hence the 
mystery has remained unsolved."  Speaking of the Tower, we learn from the 
same source how " one of the night sentries at the jewel-house was alarmed 
by a figure like a huge bear issuing from underneath the jewel-room door.  
Pie thrust at it with his bayonet which stuck in the door.  He dropped in a 
fit and was carried senseless to the guard-room. . . . In another day or two 
the brave and steady soldier died."


Tractatulus Alchimae: (See Avicenna.)


Trance: An abnormal state, either spontaneous or induced, bearing some 
analogy to the ordinary sleep-state, but differing from it in certain marked 
particulars.  The term is loosely applied to many varied pathologic 
conditions-e.g., hypnosis, ecstasy, catalepsy, somnambulism, certain forms 
of hysteria, and the mediumistic trance.  Some-times, as in catalepsy, there 
is a partial suspension of the vital functions ; generally, there is 
insensibility to pain and to any stimulus applied to the sense-organs  while 
the distinguishing feature of the trance is that the subject retains 
consciousness and gives evidence of intelligence, either his own normal 
intelligence or, as in cases of posses-sion and impersonation, some foreign 
intelligence.  In hypnosis the subject, though indifferent to sensory 
stimuli applied to his own person, has been known to exhibit a curious 
sensitiveness to such stimuli applied to the person of the hypnotist.  (See 
Community' of Sensation.)  In Ecstasy, which is frequently allied with 
hallucination, the subject remains in rapt contemplation of some transcen-
dental vision, deaf and blind to the outside world.  It was formerly 
considered to indicate that the soul of the ecstatic was viewing some great 
event distant in time or place or some person or scene from the celestial 
sphere. Now-a-days such a state is believed to be brought about by intense 
and sustained emotional concentration on some particular mental image, by 
means of which hallucination may be induced.
     The mediumistic trance is recognised as having an affinity with 
hypnosis, for the hypnotic trance, frequently induced, may gradually become 
spontaneous, when it exhibits strong resemblances to the trance of the 
medium. This latter is, among spiritualists,  The Trance " par excellence, 
and they object to the term being applied in any case where there is no sign 
of spirit  possession."  The entranced medium-who seems able to produce this 
state at will-frequently displays an exaltation of memory (hypermesia), of 
the special senses (hyperaesthesia), and even of the intellectual faculties.  
Automatic writing and utterances are generally produced in the trance state, 
and often display knowledge of which the medium normally knows nothing, or 
which, according to some authorities. gives evidence of telepathy.  Such are 
the trance utterances of Mrs. Piper, whose automatic phenomena have in 
recent years provided a wide field for research for many men of science both 
in Britain and on the Continent.  Naturally these phenomena. and those of 
all trance mediums, are referred by spiritualists to the agency of 
disembodied intelligences-the spirits of the dead-acting through the 
medium's physical organism, a notion which is akin to the old idea of 
demoniac possession, to which spontaneous trance was referred. Moreover, the 
trance messages them-selves purported to come from the spirits of deceased 
persons and there are many who see no reason to disbelieve the emphatic 
assertion of the  intelligence," especially when that assertion is 
supplemented by an exact representation of the voice, appearance, and known 
opinions of the deceased friend or relative whose spirit it claims to be. 
Such trance impersonations supply a large part of the evidence on which the 
structure of spiritualism rests. There is, however, nothing to show that the 
information concerning the deceased, thus reproduced, may not have been 
obtained by normal means, or, at the most, telepathi-cally from the minds of 
the sitters.

Trance Personalities : Trance messages purporting to come from the medium's 
spirit control do not as a rule reveal a very definite personality.  The 
control reflects the thoughts and opinions of the medium and the sitters, 
possesses little knowledge that they do not possess, and is in general a 
somewhat colourless creature.  Yet not infre-quently a trance medium is 
controlled by a spirit of distinct, not to say distinguished, personality, 
whose education and culture are on a much higher plane than the medium's 
own, and whose ideas and opinions are quite independent. Such spirits are 
generally given distinguishing names. They often control the medium 
alternately with other controls.  On the other hand, the medium has 
generally a monopoly of one or more of these spirits, though sometimes one 
control may be shared by a number of mediums. Among those who may justly be 
regarded as the common property of the mediumistic fraternity are the 
spirits of certain great men-Virgil, Socrates, Shakespeare, Milton, Benjamin 
Franklin, Victor Hugo, Swedenborg, and so on. The messages delivered through 
their control seldom resemble anything they wrote during their lives.  It 
would indeed be ludicrous to hold these great men responsible for the feeble 
outpourings delivered in their name.  But these spirits come and go  it is 
perhaps hardly accurate to call them trance personalities at all.  Among the 
best known of the latter class are the spirits who purported to control the 
late Mr. Stainton Moses-Imperator, Rector, Mentor, Prudens, and others.  
What the real names of these controls may be is not known, for Mr. Moses 
only revealed the secret to a few of his most intimate friends. Imperator 
and Rector were among the controls of Mrs. Piper in still more recent years, 
and indeed much of her automatic discourse did not come directly from the 
com-municating spirits, but was dictated by them to Rector. It is suggested, 
however, by Sir Oliver Lodge and other authorities, that the controls of 
Mrs. Piper are not identical with those of Stainton Moses, by whom were 
written through his hand the well-known Spirit Teachings, but are merely 
masqueraders.  But Mrs. Piper has several interesting trance personalities 
of her own, without borrowing from anybody.  One of her earliest controls 
was Sebastian Bach, but ere long he gave place to a spirit calling himself 
Dr. Phinuit," who held sway for a considerable time, but gave place in his 
turn to George Pelham-" G.P."  Pelham was a young author and journalist who 
died suddenly in 1892.  Soon after his death he purported to control Mrs. 
Piper, and gave many striking proofs of his identity.  He constantly 
referred, with intimate knowledge, to the affairs of Pelham, recognised his 
friends, and gave to each his due meed of welcome.  Not once, it is said, 
did he fail to recognise an acquaintance, or give a greeting to one whom he 
did not know.  Many of Pelham's old friends did not hesitate to see in him 
that which he claimed to he.  Only on one occasion, when asked for the names 
of two persons who had been associated with him in a certain enterprise, 
G.P." refused, saying that as there was present one who knew the names, his 
mentioning them would be referred to telepathy   Later, however, he gave the 
names-incor-rectly.  When  "G.P." ceased to take the principle part in the 
control of Mrs. Piper, his place was taken by Rector and Imperator, as 
mentioned above.  Another well-known medium, Mrs. Thompson, had as her chief 
control' Nelly," a daughter of hers who had died in infancy; also a Mrs. 
Cartwright, and others. These controls of Mrs. Thomson are said not to have 
shown any very individual character-istics, but to resemble Mrs. Thomson 
herself very strongly both in voice and manner of speech, though Mrs. 
Verrall has stated that the impersonations gave an impression of separate 
identity to the sitter.  Mrs. Thomson's early trance utterances were 
controlled by another band of spirits, with even less individuality than 
those mentioned. Frequently the mediums and investigators themselves, on 
reaching the discarnate plane, become controls in their turn. The late Mr. 
Myers, Mr. Gurney, Dr. Hodgson, and Professor Sidgwick purported to speak 
and write through many mediums, notably through Mrs. Piper and Mrs. 
Thompson, Mrs. Verrall and Mrs. Holland.  Many of the statements made by 
these controls were correct, and some matters revealed which were apparently 
outside the scope of the medium's normal knowledge, but at the same time 
several fatal discrepancies were found to exist between the controls and 
those they were supposed to represent.  Thus the script produced by Mrs. 
Holland contained grave warnings, purporting to come from Myers, against 
Eusapia Palladino and her physical phenomena, whereas Myers was known to 
hold in his lifetime opinions favourable to the physical manifestations.  On 
the whole these trance personalities show themselves decidedly coloured by 
the personality of the medium.  In cases where the latter was acquainted 
with the control the trance personality is pro-portionately strong, whereas 
when there was no personal acquaintance it is often of a neutral tint, and 
sometimes bad guesses are made, as when Mrs. Holland represented the Gurney 
control as of a brusque and almost discourteous temperament.  But such 
instances must not be taken as impeaching the medium's good faith.  Even 
where the trance personality is patently the product of the medium's own 
consciousness, there is no reason to suppose that there is any intentional 
deception.  While in some of the most definite cases the evidence for the 
operation of a discarnate intelligence is very good indeed, and has proved 
satisfactory to many prominent investigators.


Transformation   (See Spells.)


Transmutation of Metals : (See Alchemy.)


Transmutation of the Body  This is indeed the end and aim of all Alchemy-to 
restore man to his primordial con-dition of grace, strength, perfection, 
beauty and physical immortality.  With this in view the alchemists of all 
the ages have laboured to discover the secret of the Elixir of Life, which 
mystics believed would, literally, achieve this renewal of youth, and 
therefore immortality.  Endless receipts for this medicine have been given, 
and some honestly believed they had attained it; but all to no purpose, and 
the great secret still remains hidden from human eyes.


Tree Ghosts : Indian tree spirits.  Says Mr. Crookes in his Popular Religion 
of Northern India.  " These tree ghoss are, it is needless to say, very 
numerous.  Hence most local shrines are constructed under trees ; and in one 
particular tree, the Bira, the jungle tribes of Mirzapur locate Bagheswar, 
the tiger godling, one of their most dreaded deities.  In the Konkan, 
according to Mr. Camp-bell, the medium or Bhagat who becomes possessed is 
called Jhad, or 'tree,' apparently because he is a favourite dwelling-place 
for spirits.  In the Dakkhin it is believed that the spirit of the pregnant 
woman of Churel lives in a tree, and the Abors and Padams of East Bengal 
believe that spirits in trees kidnap children.  Many of these tree spirits 
appear in the folk-tales. Thus, Devadatta worshipped a tree which one day 
suddenly clave in two and a nymph appeared who introduced him inside the 
tree, where was a heavenly palace of jewels, in which, reclining on a couch, 
appeared Vidyatprabha, the maiden daughter of the king of the Yakshas; in 
another story the mendicant hears inside a tree the Yaksha joking with his 
wife.  So Daphne is turned into a tree to avoid the pursuit of her lover."


Tree of Life, The, and The Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil : Two of 
the trees planted by God in the Garden of Eden, which were believed by St. 
Ambrose to be of mystical significance.  The former is understood to be the 
manifestation of God, and the latter of the worldly wisdom to which our 
human nature is too apt to incline.


Tremblers of the Cevennes : A Protestant caste of convul-sonaires, who 
during the sixteenth century spread them-selves from their centre in the 
Cevennes over almost the whole of Germany.  They possessed many points of 
resemblance with cases of possession (q.v.), and are said to have been 
insensible to thrusts and blows with pointed sticks and iron bars, as well 
as to the oppression of great weights.  They had visions, communicated with 
good and evil spirits, and are said to have performed many miraculous cures 
similar to the apostolic miracles.  They made use of very peculiar modes of 
treatment called grandes secours or secours meurtriers, which are 
authenticated by the reports of eye-witnesses and by judicial documents.  
Although they were belaboured by the strongest men with heavy pieces of wood 
and bars of iron weighing a? least thirty pounds, they complained of no 
injury, but of experiencing a sensation of pleasure.  They also were covered 
with boards, on which as many as twenty men stood without its being painful 
to them.  They even bore as many as 100 blows with a twenty-pounds weight, 
alternately applied to the breast and the stomach with such force that the 
room trembled, and they begged that the blows might be laid on harder, as 
light ones only increased their sufferings.  Indeed only those who laid on 
the heaviest and most strenuous blows were thanked by their sick.  It seemed 
that it was only when the power of these blows had penetrated to the most 
vital parts that they experienced real relief  Ennemoser explains this 
insen-sibility to pain by stating that in his experience "spasmodic 
convulsions maintain themselves against outward attempts, and even the 
greatest violence, with almost superhuman strength, without injury to the 
patient, as has often been observed in young girls and women, where anyone 
might have almost been induced to believe in supernatural influence.  The 
tension of the muscles increases in power with the insensibility of the 
power, so that no outward force is equal to it; and when it is attempted to 
check the paroxysm with force, it gains in intensity, and accord-ing to some 
observers not less psychical than physical. I have observed the same 
manifestations in children, in Catholics, Protestants and Jews, without the 
least variation, on which account I consider it to be nothing more than an 
immense abnormal and inharmonic lusus naturae."


Trevisan, Bernard :  This Italian alchemist's life was a curious and 
intensely pathetic one.  Bent on discovering the philosopher's stone, he 
began at an early age to lavish huge sums of money on the pursuit; but again 
and again he was baffled, and it was only when old age was stealing upon 
him, and he had disbursed a veritable fortune, that his labours were crowned 
with some measure of success.
     Bernard Trevisan, Comte de la Marche, was born in the year 1406 at 
Padua, a town whose inhabitants were famous for erudition throughout many 
centuries in the middle ages.  His father was a doctor of medicine, so it is 
probable that Bernard received his initial training in science at home while 
ere he was out of his teens he began to devote himself seriously to alchemy, 
having been lured thereto by reading the works of the famous Eastern 
philosophers, Geber and Rhasis.  Bernard's father was rich, and accordingly, 
whenever it was known that the young man was minded to dabble in gold-
seeking, he found himself surrounded by charlatans offering counsel; and his 
very first experiments resulted in his spending upwards of three thousand 
crowns, the bulk 6£ which sum went into the pockets of the youth's 
fraudulent advisers.  He was not discouraged, however; and, finding new 
henchmen, and at the same time aug-menting his learning by a close study of 
the writings of Sacrobosco and Rupecissa, he proceeded to make a new series 
of attempts,  But these also proved futile, once more the alchemist did no 
more than enrich his assistants, and in consequence he vowed that henceforth 
he would prosecute his researches single-handed.
     Bernard now engaged in a long course of sedulous reading, while he also 
began to give much time to prayer, thinking by this means to gain his 
desired end; and anon he started fresh experiments, expending on these some 
six thousand crowns.  But again his devotion and 
extrava-gance went unrewarded, year after year went by in this fashion, and 
betimes Bernard realised that he was past the prime of life, yet had 
achieved nothing whatsoever. His bitter disappointment engendered an 
illness, but scarcely was he restored to health era he heard that one Henry, 
a German priest, had succeeded in creating the philosopher's stone;  and 
thereupon Bernard hastened to Germany, accompanied by various other 
alchemists. After some difficulty they made the acquaintance of the cleric 
in question, who told them he would disclose all would they but furnish a 
certain sum of money to procure the necessary tools and materials; so they 
paid as desired, yet having devoted much time to watching the German at work 
they found themselves no nearer the goal than before.
     This last piece of quackery opened Bernard's eyes, and he proclaimed 
his decision of eschewing hermetic philosophy altogether in the future-a 
decision which was warmly applauded by his relatives, for already his 
researches had cost a king's ransom.  But it soon transpired that the 
alchemist was quite incapable of clinging to his resolution, and, growing 
more ardent than ever, he visited Spain and Great Britain, Holland and 
France, trying in each of these countries to enlarge his stock of learning, 
and to make the acquaintance of others who were searching like himself.  
Eventually he even penetrated to Egypt, Persia and Palestine, while 
subsequently he travelled in Greece, where he witnessed many alchemistic 
researches ; yet all proved vain, and ultimately Bernard found himself im-
poverished, and was forced to sell his parental estates. Being thus without 
so much as a home, he retired to the Island of Rhodes, intending to live 
there quietly for the rest of his days; but even here his old passion 
continued to govern him, and, chancing to make the acquaintance of a priest 
who knew something of science, the thwarted and ruined alchemist proposed 
that they should start fresh experiments together.  The cleric professed 
himself willing to give all the help in his power, so the pair borrowed a 
large sum of money to admit of their purchasing the necessary paraphernalia; 
and it was here, then, in this secluded island, and while in a literally 
bankrupt con-dition, that Bernard made the wonderful discovery with which he 
is traditionally credited.  Doubtless the tradition has little foundation in 
fact, yet at least the philosopher deserved some reward for his indomitable 
if foolhardy perseverance, and it is pathetic to recall that his death 
occurred soon after the day of his triumph.
      In contradistinction to the majority of his brother-alchemists, 
Bernard appears to have loved actual experi-ments much better than writing 
about them.  It is probable however, that he was at least partly responsible 
for an octavo volume published in 1643, Le' Bernard d'Alchmague, cum Bernard 
Treveso ; while he is commonly credited with another work also, La 
Philosophic Naturelle des Metaux. Herein he insists on the necessity of much 
meditation on the part of the scientist who would create the philosopher's 
stone, and this rather trite observation is followed by a voluminous 
alchemistic treatise, most of it sadly obscure, and demonstrating the author 
no great expert.


Triad : (See God.)


Triad Society : An ancient esoteric society of China.  The candidate 
scantily clothed, is brought into a dark room by two members, who lead him 
to the President, before whom he kneels.  He is given a living cock and a 
knife, and in this posture he takes a complicated oath to assist his 
brethren in any emergency, even at the risk of his life. He then cuts off 
the head of the cock, and mingles it with his own, the three assisting 
individuals adding some of their own blood.  After being warned that death 
will be his portion should he divulge the secrets of the society, he is 
initiated into them, and is entrusted with the signs of recognition which 
are in triads.  For example a member must lift any object with three fingers 
only. This society, originally altruistic, is now of a political character.

Trithemius: The son of a German vine-grower, named Heidenberg, received his 
Latinized appellation from Trittheim, a village in the electorate of Treves, 
where he was born in 1462.  He might reasonably be included among those 
earnest and enthusiastic souls who have persevered in the pursuit of 
knowledge under difficulties; for his mother, marrying a second time, had no 
love for the offspring of her first marriage.  The young Trithemius was ill-
fed, ill-clothed, and over-worked.  All day he toiled in the vine-yards ; 
but the nights he was able to devote to the acquisi-tion of knowledge, and 
then he stole away from his miserable home, and perused what books he could 
beg or borrow, by the light of the moon.  As his mind expanded he became 
sensible of the vast stores of learning to which his cir-cumstances denied 
him access.  He could not rest content with the few grains of sand he had 
picked up on the sea-shore.  Extorting his small share of the patrimony be-
queathed by his father, he wandered away to Treves, entered himself a 
student of its celebrated University, and assumed the name of Trithemius.  
His progress was now as rapid as might be inferred probable from the 
intensity of his aspirations and the keenness of his intellect.  At the age 
of twenty lie had acquired the reputation of a scholar-a reputation which 
was of greater advantage in the 15th than it is in the 20th century.  He was 
now desirous of once more seeing the mother whom he did not love the less 
because she had ill-used him, and in. the winter of 1482 he quitted the 
cloistered shade of Treves on a solitary journey to Trittheim.  It was a 
dark day, ending in a gloomy, fast-snowing night, and the good student, on 
his arrival near Spannheim, found the roads impassable.  He sought refuge in 
a neighbouring monastery. There the weather imprisoned him for several days. 
The imprison-ment proved so much to the liking of Trithemius, that he 
voluntarily took the monastic vows, and retired from the world.  In the 
course of two years he was elected abbot, and devoting all his little 
fortune to the repair and im-provement of the monastery, he gained the love 
and reverence of the brotherhood, whom he inspired with his own love of 
learning.  But after a rule of one-and-twenty years, the monks forgot all 
his benefits, and remembered only the severity of his discipline. They broke 
out in revolt, and elected another abbot. The deposed Trithe-mius quitted 
Spannheim, and wandered from place to place, until finally elected Abbot of 
St. James of Wurzburg. where he died in 1516.
     His fame as a magician rests on very innocent foundations He devised a 
species of short-hand called steoganographia, which the ignorant stigmatized 
as a cabalistical and necro-mantic writing, concealing the most fearful 
secrets.  He wrote a treatise on the subject ; another upon the supposed 
administration of the world by its guardian angels-a revival of the good and 
evil geniuses of the Ancients-which William Lilly translated into English in 
1647; a third upon Geomancy, or divination by means of lines and circles on 
the ground; a fourth upon Sorcery; and a fifth upon Alchemy.  In his work 
upon Sorcery he makes the earliest mention of the popular story of Dr. 
Faustus, and records the torments he himself occasionally suffered from the 
malice of a spirit named Hudekin.  He is said to have gratified the Emperor 
Maximilian with a vision of his deceased wife, the beautiful Mary of 
Burgundy, and was reputed to have defrayed the expenses of his monastic 
establishment at Spannheim by the resources which the Philosopher's Stone 
put at his disposal.  His writings show him to have been an amiable and 
credulous enthusiast but his sincere and ardent passion for knowledge may 
well incline us to forgive the follies which he only shared with most of the 
scholars and wise men of his age.


Triumphal Chariot of Antimony : (See Valentine, Basil.)


Trivah : Among the natives of Borneo the trivah, or feast of the dead, is 
celebrated after a death has taken place. A panel containing a 
representation of Tempon-teloris' ship of the dead (q.v.) is generally set 
up at the trivah, and sacrifices of fowls are offered to it.  Until the 
trivah has been celebrated the soul's soul is unable to reach the Levu-liau.

Tsithsith, The : An article of apparel, believed to be endowed with 
talismanic properties.  A sentence in the Talmud runs thus :  Whoever has 
the tephillin bound to his head and arm, and the tsithsith thrown over his 
garments is protected from sin.


Tumah: According to the Kabala, physical or moral unclean-ness. The latter 
is divided into three main divisions-idolatry, murder, and immorality.  Sin, 
says the same authority, not only rendered imperfect man himself, but also 
affected the whole of nature, even to the sphere of angels, and the Divinity 
himself.  In physical uncleanness there is a coarser and a more subtle form. 
The latter causes a dimness in the soul which is most keenly felt by those 
who are nearest to sacred things.  Organic things which come into contact 
with the human body are more liable to the Tumah than remoter things.  The 
human corpse is more unclean than that of the lower animals, because its 
more complex nature involves a more repulsive decay. Thus the corpse of a 
holy man is most unclean of all.

Typtology: The science of communicating with the spirits by means of 
rapping, various codes being arranged for the purpose.  Thus the sitters may 
read the alphabet aloud, or slowly pass a pencil down a printed alphabet, 
the rappings indicating the correct letters which, on being joined to-
gether, form a message or an answer to some question propounded.  One rap 
may be made to mean "yes," two " no," and so on.  (See Rappings.)

Unguents : There are many kinds of unguents, each with its peculiar 
properties.  It is known that the devil compounds them in order to harm the 
human race.  One such unguent is composed of human fat, and is used by the 
witches to enable them to fly through the air to the Sabbath.  Many old 
recipes exist for unguents to induce sleep, visions, etc., and these are 
compounded from various strange ingredients. (See Salverte "Les Science 
Occultes.")


Union Spirite Bordelaise (Journal) : (See France.) 

Univercoelum, The  An American periodical having for its aim " the 
establishment of a universal System of Truth, the Reform and Reorganisation 
of Society."  It made its first appearance in December, 1847, under the 
editorship of Andrew Jackson Davis (q.v.), and lived for about a year and a 
half.  Its supporters and contributors looked for a new revelation to 
supplement those of the Old and New Testaments, Swedenborg and Fourier.  
Attention was given in its pages to prophecy, clairvoyance, somnam-bulism 
and trance phenomena generally, while it also taught " an interior and 
spiritual philosophy"  whose central idea was that God was the infinitely 
intelligent Essence which pervaded all things-the Universal Soul, expressing 
itself in the material universe and the laws of nature as the human soul 
expresses itself through the material body.  Though the Rochester Rappings 
broke out some time before the Univercoelum came to an end, the adherents of 
the paper did not seem to connect the distur-bances with their propaganda.  
However, many of those who were associated with the Univercoelum afterwards 
became editors of spiritualistic papers.  In July, 1849 the paper passed out 
of the hands of A. J. Davis, and became The Present Age, under the 
editorship of W. M. Channing.


Universal Balm : An elixir composed by the alchemists, which formed a 
sovereign remedy for every malady, and would' even bring the dead to life.


Universities (Occult) : In many works on the occult sciences allusions are 
made to schools and universities for the in-struction of those who were 
drawn to them.  Thus we are, told that Salamanca abounded in such schools; 
that Jechiel, a Jewish Rabbi of medieval France, kept such a seminary; and 
there is reason to believe that in all ages such institutions were by no 
means uncommon.  Balzac alludes to one of them in a well-known novel The 
Secret of Ruggier, which he places at the time of Catherine de Medici. He 
says, " At this epoch the occult sciences were cultivated with an ardour 
which put to shame the incredulous spirit of our century. . . . The 
universal protection accorded to these sciences by the ruling sovereigns of 
the times was quite remarkable." He goes on to say that at the commence-ment 
of the sixteenth century Ruggier was the member of a secret university for 
the study of the occult sciences, where astrologers, alchemists, and others, 
studied several branches of hidden knowledge; but he gives no details as to 
its locality, or as to the exact nature of its curriculum, There is no doubt 
that during the Middle Ages many extra-mural lecturers taught alchemy and 
kindred subjects at the great universities. Thus Paracelsus lectured on 
alchemy at the University of Basel, and he was preceded and followed there 
and elsewhere by many illustrious professors of that and other occult arts.  
M. Figuier in his work Alchemy and the Alchemists (See Alchemy), alludes to 
a school in Paris frequented by alchemists, which he himself attended in the 
middle of the last century. The school-an ordinary chemical laboratory 
through the day-became in the evening a centre of the most elaborate 
alchemical study, where Figuier met many alchemical students, visionary and 
practical, with one of whom he had a prolonged argu-ment, which we have 
outlined at considerable length in the article " Alchemy."  Many professors 
of the occult sciences in early and later times drew around them con-
siderable bands of students and assistants and formed distinct schools for 
the practice of magic and alchemy, principally the latter.  The College of 
Augurs in Rome and the Calmecac of Ancient Mexico are distinct examples of 
institutions for the study of at least one branch of occult science, and in 
this connection the House of Wisdom of the Ismaelite sect at Cairo may be 
mentioned.  It is likely that in ancient Egypt and Babylonia, institutions 
of the kind flourished more or less in secret.  Mme. Blavatsky insisted to 
the last that a great " school" of illuminated occult adepts flourished in 
Tibet; but as nobody except herself and her immediate friends ever saw them, 
or had any dealings with them; and as all proof is against the existence of 
such a semi-divine brotherhood, her statements must be taken as being 
somewhat open to question.  There is, however, no reason to doubt that 
bodies of men who study the higher occultism do exist in various Asiatic 
centres, whatever the nature of their powers, supernormal or otherwise, may 
be.  Vague rumours reach students of occultism every now and again of 
schools or colleges on the continent of Europe, the purpose of which is to 
train aspirants in the occult arts ; but as definite information is seldom 
forthcoming regarding these, they can only be merely alluded to here.  “The 
School for the Discovery of the Lost Secrets of Antiquity,"
which flourishes at Lotus-land, California, was founded by Catherine Tingley 
late in the nineteenth century, and is under theosophical regime.  Numerous 
small bodies for the study of occultism exist in every town of considerable 
size in Europe and America; but these cannot be dignified even by the name 
of "schools," as they are for the most part private affairs, the occultism 
of which is of an extremely amateurish and innocent character.


Ura : A spirit.  (See Babylonia,)


Urgund:	(See Boehme.)


Urim and Thummim: A means of divination employed by the ancient Hebrews, and 
which it was believed consisted of a species of casting lots.  Their form 
and method of use is uncertain, but from passages in the Book of Samuel, it 
seems probable that (1) they were used to determine guilt and innocence, and 
(2) that this was done by means of categorical questions, to which the 
suspected person answered "Yes" or "No."  They appear to have been the 
prerogative of the priesthood.



V


Valentine, Basil : This German adept in hermetic philosophy is commonly 
supposed to have been born at Mayence towards the close of the fourteenth 
century.  As a young man he espoused holy orders, and it is recorded that he 
entered the Abbey of St. Peter, at Erfurt, and eventually became its Prior ; 
but otherwise very little is known con-cerning him, and even the date of his 
death is uncertain. He appears to have been a very modest person, for 
accord-ing to Olaus Borrichius, the author of De Ortu et Progressu Chemiae, 
Valentine imprisoned all the manuscripts of his scientific writings inside 
one of the pillars of the Abbey Church; and there they might have remained 
for an indefinite period, but a thunderstorm chanced ultimately to dislodge 
them from their curious hiding-place.  It is possible, of course, that this 
incarceration was not alto-gether due to modesty on the writer's part, and 
arose rather from his dreading a visitation from the Inquisition in the 
event of their discovering his alchemistic proclivities but be that as it 
may, Vatentine's works certainly mark him as a very shrewd man and a capable 
scientist.  In con-tradistinction to most analogous medieval literature, his 
treatises are not all couched in Latin, some of them being in high Dutch and 
others in the author's native German; and prominent among those in the 
latter tongue is The Triumphal Chariot of Antimony, first published at 
Leipsic in 1624.  Herein Valentine exalts antimony as an excellent medicine, 
while the volume likewise embodies a lengthy metrical treatise on the 
philosopher's stone, the writer contending that whoso would discover and use 
this must do charitable deeds, mortify the flesh, and pray without ceasing.
     As regards the alchemist's further writings, it behoves to mention his 
Apocalypsis Chymica, De Microcosmo degue Magno Mundi Mysterio et Medecina 
Hominis and Practica una cum duodecim Clavibus et Appendice.  All these were 
originally published in Germany at the beginning of the seventeenth century, 
and divers passages in them demon-strate that the author understood the 
distillation of brandy, and was acquainted with the method of obtaining 
chlorohydric acid from salt-water ;  while moreover, reverting to his faith 
in antimony, he has been credited with having been the first to extract this 
from sulphuret.


Vampire: (Russian Vampir, South Russian upuir, probably from the root pi, to 
drink, with the prefix va, or av.) A dead person who returns in spirit form 
from the grave for the purpose of destroying and sucking the blood of living 
persons, or a living sorcerer who takes a special form for  the  same  
purpose.   The  conception  of  the vampire is rifest among Slavonic 
peoples, and especially in the Balkan countries, and in Hungary, Bohemia, 
Moravia, and Silesia, and in these territories from 1730-35 there was a 
well-marked epidemic of vampirism, but it is by no means confined to them.  
In White Russia and the Ukraine it is believed that vampires are generally 
wizards or sorcerers, but in Bulgaria and Serbia it is thought that any 
corpse over which a cat or a dog jumps or over which a bird has flown is 
liable to become a vampire.  In Greece (q.v.) a vampire is known as a 
broncolaia or bourkabakos, which has been identified with the Slavonic name 
for werewolf" (q.v.), vlkodlak, or vukodlak. The vampire, too, is often 
supposed to steal the heart of his victim and to roast it over a slow fire, 
thus causing interminable amorous longings.
     Marks of Vampirism.-Vampirism is epidemic in char-acter.  Where one 
instance is discovered it is almost invariably followed by several others.  
This is accounted for by the circumstance that it is believed that the 
victim of a vampire pines and dies and becomes in turn a vampire
himself after death, and so duly infects others.  On the disinterment of a 
suspected vampire various well-known signs are looked for by experienced 
persons. Thus, if several holes about the breadth of a man's finger, are 
observed in the soil above the grave the vampire character of its occupant 
may be suspected.  On unearthing the corpse it is usually found with wide-
open eyes, ruddy and life-like complexion and lips and a general appearance 
of freshness, and showing no signs of corruption.  It may also be found that 
the hair and nails have grown as in life. On the throat two small livid 
marks may be looked for, The coffin is also very often full of blood, the 
body has a swollen and gorged appearance, and the shroud is fre-quently 
half-devoured. The blood contained in the veins of the corpse is found on 
examination to be in a fluid condition as in life, and the limbs are pliant 
and flexible and have none of the rigidity of death.
     Examples of Vampirism.-Many well-authenticated ex-amples of vampirism 
exist.  Charles Ferdinand de Schertz in his work Magia Posthuma printed at 
Olmutz in 1706 relates several stories of apparitions of this sort, and 
particularises the mischief done by them.  One, among others, is of a 
herdsman of the village of Blow near the town of Kadam in Bohemia, who 
appeared for a considerable length of time, and visited several persons, who 
all died within eight days.  At last, the inhabitants of Blow dug up the 
herdsman's body, and fixed it in the ground with a stake driven through it.  
The man, even in this condition, laughed at the people that were employed 
about him, and told them they were very obliging to furnish him with a stick 
with which to defend himself from the dogs. The same night he extricated 
himself from the stake, frightened several persons by appearing to them, and 
occasioned the death of many more than he had hitherto done.  He was then 
delivered into the hands of the hang-man, who put him into a cart, in order 
to burn him without the town.  As they went along, the carcass shrieked in 
the most hideous manner, and threw about its arms and legs, as if it had 
been alive; and upon being again run through with a stake, it gave a loud 
cry, and a great quantity of fresh, florid blood issued from the wound.  At 
last, the body was burned to ashes, and this execution put a final stop to 
the spectres appearing and infecting the village.
     Calmet in his Dissertation on Vampires appended to his Dissertation 
upon Apparitions (English translation, 1759), gives several well 
authenticated instances of vampirism as follows
     “It is now about fifteen years since a soldier, who was quartered in 
the house of a Haidamack peasant, upon the frontiers of Hungary, saw, as he 
was at the table with his landlord, a stranger come in and sit down by them.  
The master of the house and the rest of the company were strangely 
terrified, but the soldier knew not what to make of it.  The next day the 
peasant died, and, upon the soldier's enquiring into the meaning of it, he 
was told that it was his landlord's father, who had been dead and buried 
above ten years, that came and sat down at table, and gave his son notice of 
his death.
     “The soldier soon propagated the story through his regiment, and by 
this means it reached the general officers, who commissioned the count de 
Cabreras, a captain in Alandetti's regiment of foot, to make an exact 
enquiry into the fact.  The count, attended by several officers, a surgeon, 
and a notary, came to the house, and took the deposition of all the family, 
who unanimously swore that the spectre was the landlord's father, and that 
all the soldier had said was strictly true. The same was also attested by 
all the inhabitants of the village.
     “In consequence of this the body of the spectre was dug up, and found 
to be in the same state as if it has been but just dead, the blood like that 
of a living person.  The count de Cabreras ordered its head to be cut off, 
and the corpse to be buried again.  He then proceeded to take depositions 
against other spectres of the same sort, and particularly against a man who 
had been dead above thirty years, and had made his appearance three several 
times in his own house at meal-time.  At his first visit he had fastened 
upon the neck of his own brother, and sucked his blood; at his second, he 
had treated one of his children in the same manner; and the third time, he 
fastened upon a servant of the family, and all three died upon the spot.
     “Upon this evidence, the count gave orders that he should be dug up, 
and being found, like the first, with his blood in a fluid state, as if he 
had been alive, a great nail was drove through his temples, and he was 
buried again. The count ordered a third to be burnt, who had been dead above 
sixteen years, and was found guilty of murdering two of his own children by 
sucking their blood.  The com-missioner then made his report to the general 
officers, who sent a deputation to the emperor's court for further direc-
tions; and the emperor dispatched an order for a court, consisting of 
officers, lawyers, physicians, chirurgeons, and some divines, to go and 
enquire into the cause of these extraordinary events, upon the spot.
     "The gentleman who acquainted me with all these particulars, had them 
from the count de Cabreras himself, at Fribourg in Brisgau, in the year 
1730."
     Other instances alluded to by Calmet are as follows:-
     "In the part of Hungary, known in Latin by the name of Oppida Heidonum, 
on the other side of the Tibiscus, vulgarly called the Teyss; that is, 
between that part of this river which waters the happy country of Tockay, 
and the frontiers of Transylvania, the people named Heydukes have a notion 
that there are dead persons, called by them vampires, which suck the blood 
of the living, so as to make them fall away visibly to skin and bones, while 
the car-casses themselves, like leeches, are filled with blood to such a 
degree that it comes out at all the apertures of their body.  This notion 
has lately been confirmed by several facts, which I think we cannot doubt 
the truth of, con-sidering the witnesses who attest them.  Some of the most 
considerable of these facts I shall now relate.
     "About five years ago, an Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, an inhabitant of 
Medreiga, was killed by a cart full of hay that fell upon him.  About thirty 
days after his death, four persons died suddenly, with all the symptoms 
usually attending those who are killed by vampires.  It was then remembered 
that this Arnold Paul had frequently told a story of his having been 
tormented by a Turkish vampire, in the neighbourhood of Cassova, upon the 
borders of Turkish Servia (for the notion is that those who have been 
passive vampires in their life-time become active ones after death; or, in 
other words, that those who have had their blood sucked become suckers in 
their turn) but that he had been cured by eating some of the earth upon the 
vampire's grave, and by rubbing himself with his blood.  This pre-caution, 
however, did not hinder him from being guilty himself after his death; for, 
upon digging up his corpse forty days after his burial, he was found to have 
all the marks of an arch-vampire.  His body was fresh and ruddy, his hair, 
beard, and nails were grown, and his veins were full of fluid blood, which 
ran from all parts of his body upon the shroud that he was buried in.  The 
hadnagy, or bailiff of the village, who was present at the digging up of the 
corpse, and was very expert in the whole business of vampirism, ordered a 
sharp stake to be drove quite through the body of the deceased, and to let 
it pass through his heart, which was attended with a hideous cry from the 
carcass, as if it had been alive.  This ceremony being performed, they cut 
off the head, and burnt the body to ashes.  After this, they proceeded in 
the same manner with the four other persons that died of vampirism, lest 
they also should be troublesome.  But all these executions could not hinder 
this dreadful prodigy from appearing again last year, at the distance of 
five years from its first breaking out.  In the space of three months, 
seventeen persons of different ages and sexes died of vampirism. some 
without any previous illness, and others after languishing two or three 
days.  Among others, it was said, that a girl, named Stanoska, daughter of 
the Heyduke Jotuitzo, went to bed in perfect health, but awoke in the middle 
of the night, trembling, and crying nut that the son of the Heyduke Millo, 
who died about nine weeks before, had almost strangled her while she was 
asleep.  From that time she fell into a languishing state, and died at three 
days' end. Her evidence against Millo's son was looked upon as a proof of 
his being a vampire, and, upon digging up his body, he was found to be such.
     “At a consultation of the principal inhabitants of the place, attended 
by physicians and chirurgeons, it was considered how it was possible that 
the plague of vam-pirism should break out afresh, after the precautions that 
had been taken some years before : and, at last, it was found out that the 
original offender, Arnold Paul, had not only destroyed the four persons 
mentioned above, but had killed several beasts, which the late vampires, and 
particu-larly the son of Millo, had fed upon.  Upon this foundation a 
resolution was taken to dig up all the persons that had died within a 
certain time.  Out of forty were found seventeen, with all the evident 
tokens of vampirism; and they had all stakes drove through their hearts, 
their heads cut off, their bodies burnt, and their ashes thrown into the 
river.
     "All these several enquiries and executions were carried on with all 
the forms of law, and attested by several officers who were in garrison in 
that country. by the chirurgeon--majors of the regiments, and by the 
principal inhabitants of the place.  The original papers were all sent, in 
January last, to the Imperial council of war at Vienna, which had issued out 
a commission to several officers, to enquire into the truth of the fact."
     Methods of Extirpation -The commonest methods of the extirpation of 
vampires are-(a) beheading the suspected corpse; (b) taking out the heart; 
(c) impaling the corpse with a white-thorn stake (in Russia an aspen), and 
(d) burning it.  Sometimes more than one or all of these precautions is 
taken.  Instances are on record where the graves of as many as thirty or 
forty persons have been disturbed during the course of an epidemic of 
vampirism and their occupants impaled or beheaded.  Persons who dread the 
visits or attacks of a vampire sleep with a wreath made of garlic round the 
neck, as that esculent is supposed to be especially obnoxious to the 
vampire.  When impaled the vampire is usually said to emit a dreadful cry, 
but it has been pointed out that the gas from the intestines may be forced 
through the throat by the entry of the stake into the body, and that this 
may account for the sound. The method of discovering a vampire's grave in 
Serbia is to place a virgin boy upon a coal-black stallion which has never 
served a mare and marking the spot where he will not pass. An officer 
quartered in Wallachia wrote to Calmet as follows, giving him an instance of 
this method
     “At the time when we were quartered at Temeswar in Wallachia, there 
died of this disorder two dragoons of the company in which I was cornet, and 
several more who had it would have died also, if the corporal of the company 
had not put a stop to it, by applying a remedy commonly made use of in that 
country.  It is of a very singular kind, and, though infallibly to be 
depended on, I have never met with it in any Dispensatory.
     "They pick out a boy, whom they judge to be too young to have lost his 
maidenhead, and mount him bare upon a coal-black stone-horse, which has 
never leaped a mare. This virgin-pair is led about the church-yard, and 
across all the graves, and wherever the animal stops. and refuses to go on, 
in spite of all the whipping they can give him, they conclude they have 
discovered a vampire.  Upon opening the grave, they find a carcass as fleshy 
and fair as if the person were only in a slumber.  The next step is to cut 
off his head with a spade, and there issues from the wound such a quantity 
of fresh and florid blood, that one would swear they had cut the throat of a 
man in full health and vigour.  They then fill up the pit, and it may be 
depended on that the disorder will cease, and that all who were ill of it 
will gradually get strength, like people that recover slowly after a long 
illness.  Accordingly this happened to our troopers, who were attacked with 
the distemper.  I was at that time commanding officer of the troop, the 
captain and lieutenant being absent, and was extremely angry at the corporal 
for having made this experiment without me.  It was with great difficulty 
that I prevailed with myself not to reward him with a good cudgel, a thing 
of which the officers of the emperor's service are usually very liberal.  I 
would not, for the world, have been absent upon this occasion, but there was 
now no remedy."
     A Bulgarian belief is that a wizard or sorcerer may entrap a vampire by 
placing in a bottle some food for which the vampire has a partiality, and on 
his entry in the shape of fluff or straw, sealing up the flask and throwing 
it into the fire.
     Scientific Theories of Vampirism.-The English custom of piercing 
suicide's bodies with a stake would appear to be a survival of the belief in 
vampirism.  Such demons are also to be seen in the Polynesian tii, the 
Malayan hantu penyardin, a dog-headed water-demon, and the kephn of the 
Karens, which under the form of a wizard's head and stomach devours human 
souls.  Tylor considers vampire's to be ' causes conceived in spiritual form 
to account for specific facts of wasting disease."  Afanasief regards them 
as thunder-gods and spirits of the storm who during winter slumber in their 
cloud-coffins to rise again in spring and draw moisture from the clouds.  
But this theory will scarcely recommend itself to anyone with even a slight 
knowledge of mythological science.  Calmet's difficulty in believing in 
vampire's was that he could not understand how a spirit could leave its 
grave and return thence with pon-derable matter in the form of blood, 
leaving no traces showing that the surface of the earth above the grave had 
been stirred.  But this view might be combated by the theory of the 
precipitation of matter.

pre-tentions, which will scarcely bear a strict investigation. are that she 
was the chosen bride of Asmodeus and was on terms of intimacy with Lucifer, 
the deity worshipped by the Palladist confraternity.


Vaulderie: A connection with the Satanic powers, so called from Robinet de 
Vaulse, a hermit, one of the first persons accused of the crime.  In 1453 
the Prior of St. Germain-en-Laye, Guillaume de l'Allive, a doctor of 
theology, was accused of Vaulderie, and sentenced to perpetual imprison-
ment.  Six years later there was burned at Lille a hermit named Alphonse, 
who preached heterodox doctrines. Such were the preludes of a persecution 
which, in the following year, the Vicar of the Inquisition. administrator of 
the Diocese of Arras, seconded by the  Count d'Etampes, Governor of Artois, 
directed at first against loose women, but afterwards against citizens, 
magistrates, knights, and especially the wealthy. The procedures against the 
accused had almost always for their basis some accusation of sorcery.  Most 
of the unhappy creatures confessed to have attended the "Witch's Sabbath," 
and the strange revelations wrung from them by torture, will give some idea 
of the ceremonies which according to the popular tradition, were enacted in 
the lurid festivals presided over by Satan.  Here are some extracts from the 
judgment pronounced at Arras in 1460 upon five women, a painter, and a poet, 
nick-named ' an abbe of little sense," and aged about seventy, and several 
others, who all perished in the flames kindled by a barbarous ignorance and 
fed by a cruel superstition.
     “And the said Inquisition did say and declare, that those hereinunder 
named had been guilty of Vaulderei in manner following, that is to say :- 
“That when they wished to go to the said Vaulderie', they, with an ointment 
given to them by the devil, anointed a small wooden rod and their palms and 
their hands; then they put the wand between their legs, and soon they flew 
wherever they wished to go, over fair cities, woods and streams; and the 
devil carried them to the place where they should hold their assembly, and 
in this place they found others, and tables placed, loaded with wines and 
viands; and there they found a demon in the form of a goat, a dog, an ape, 
or sometimes a man; and they made their oblation and homage to the said 
demon, and adored him, and yielded up to him their souls, and all, or at 
least some portion, of their bodies; then, with burning candles in their 
hands, they kissed the rear of the goat-devil (Here the Inquisitor becomes 
untranslatable). And this homage done, they trod and trampled upon the 
Cross, and befouled it with their spittle, in contempt of Jesus Christ, and 
the Holy Trinity, then turned their backs towards heaven and the firmament 
in contempt of God.  And after they had all eaten and drunk well, they had 
carnal intercourse all together, and even the devil assumed the guise of man 
and woman, and had intercourse with both sexes.  And many other crimes, most 
filthy and detestable, they committed, as much against God as against 
nature, which the said Inquisitor did not dare to name, that innocent ears 
might not be told of such villainous enormites.'
     The eagerness displayed by the Inquisitor and his acolytes so excited 
the public indignation, that at the close of the year 1460 the judges did 
not dare any longer to condemn to death the unfortunate wretches accused, it 
is said only for the purpose of depriving them of their property.  As in the 
case of all great wrongs, a reaction set in-a re-action in favour of the 
right; and thirty years later, when the county of Artois had been re-united 
to the Crown, the Parliament of Paris declared, on the 20th of May, 1491, 
these trials "abusive, void, and falsely made," and condemned the heirs of 
the duke of Burgundy and the principal judges to an amend of 500 Parisian 
livres, to be distributed as a reparation among the heirs of the victims.


Veechia Religlone, La : (See Italy.)


Vedanta Yoga: The higher branch of Hindu yoga practice.


Vehm-Gerichte: A secret tribunal which during the Middle Ages exercised a 
peculiar jurisdiction in Germany and especially in Westphalia.  Its origin 
is quite uncertain. The sessions were often held in secret, and the 
uninitiated were forbidden to attend them on pain of death.  The most absurd 
stories have been circulated concerning them,-that they met in underground 
chambers and so forth. These have been discounted by modern research.  Far 
from dabbling in the occult, these courts frequently punished persons 
convicted of witchcraft and sorcery.


Veleda: A prophetess among the ancient Germans, of whom Tacitus says: " She 
exercises a great authority, for women have been held here from the most 
ancient times to be prophetic, and, by excessive superstition, as divine.  
The fame of Veleda stood on the very highest elevation, for she foretold to 
the Germans a prosperous issue, but to the legions their destruction!  
Veleda dwelt upon a high tower, whence messengers were dispatched bearing 
her oracular counsels to those who sought them; but she herself was rarely 
seen, and none was allowed to approach her.  Cerca-us is said to have 
secretly begged her to let the Romans have better success in war. The 
Romans, as well as those of her own race, set great store on her prophecies, 
and sent her valuable gifts.  In the reign of the Emperor Vespasian she was 
honoured as a goddess."


Veltis: An evil spirit who assaulted St. Margaret but was overcome by her.  
On being asked by St. Margaret who be was and whence he came, he replied: 
"My name is Veltis, and I am one of those whom Solomon by virtue of his 
spells, confined in a copper cauldron at Babylon; but when the Babylonians, 
in the hope of finding treasure dug up the cauldron and opened it, we all 
made our escape. Since that time our efforts have been directed to the des-
truction of righteous persons ; and I have long been striving to turn thee 
from the course thou hast em-braced."


Verdelet : A demon of the second order, master of ceremonies at the infernal 
court.  He is charged with the transport of witches to the Sabbath.  He 
takes the names of Master Persil, Sante-Buisson, and other names of a 
pleasant sound, 50 as to entice women into his snares.

Vervain : A sacred herb with which the altars of Jupiter were sprinkled.  
Water containing vervain was also sprinkled in houses to cast out evil 
spirits.  Among the druids particularly it was employed in connection with 
many forms of superstition.  They gathered it at day-break, before the sun 
had risen. Later sorcerers followed the same usage, and the demonologists 
believe that in order to evoke demons it is necessary to be crowned with 
vervain.

Vidya in Theosophy is the knowledge by which man on the Path can discern the 
true from the false and so direct his efforts aright by means of the mental 
faculties which he
has learnt to use.  It is the antithesis of Avidya.  (See Path, Avidya, and 
Theosophy.)

Vila, The : Vila were nymphs who frequented the forests that clothe the 
bases of the Eastern Alps.  They have been seen traversing glades, mounted 
on stags; or driving from peak to peak on chariots of cloud. Serbian ballads 
tell how Marko the great hero of ancient Serbia, was joined in bond of ' 
brotherhood" with a Vita, who showed to him the secrets of the future.  At 
that period Serbia was a mighty nation, extending from the Alps to the Black 
Sea, from the Danube to the Adriatic-before her freedom was lost at the 
battle of Varna.

Villanova, Arnold de : Arnold de Villanova was a physician by profession, 
and is reported to have been something of a theologian besides a skilled 
alchemist.  His natal place has never been determined, but Catalonia, Milan 
and Montpellier have all been suggested ; while as to the precise date of 
his advent, this too is uncertain yet appears to have been about the middle 
of the thirteenth century. Arnold studied medicine for many years at the 
Sorbonne in Paris, which in medieval times was the principal European 
nursery of physicians;  and thereafter he travelled for a long time in 
Italy, while subsequently he penetrated to Spain.  Here, however, he heard 
that a friend of his was in the hands of the dreaded Inquisition and, 
fearing that he likewise might be trepanned by that body, he withdrew 
speedily to Italy.  For a considerable period he lived at Naples, enjoying 
there the friendly patronage of the Neapolitan sovereign, and spending his 
time less in the actual practice of his profession than in the compilation 
of various scientific treatises ; while at a later date he was appointed 
physician in ordinary to Pope Clement V., so presumably the rest of his life 
was spent mainly at Rome, or possibly at Avignon.  Meanwhile his interest in 
alchemy had become widely known, and indeed many people declared that his 
skill herein was derived from communications with the arch-fiend himself, 
and that the physician accordingly deserved nothing less than burning at the 
stake ; while he also elicited particular enmity from the clergy by sneering 
openly at the monastic regime, and by declaring boldly that works of charity 
are more acceptable to God than the repetition of paternosters. Thanks to 
Papal favour, nevertheless, Arnold went un-scathed by his enemies; but soon 
after his death, which occurred about the year 1310. the Inquisition decided 
that they had dealt too leniently with the deceased, and in con-sequence 
they signified their hatred of him, by ordering certain of his writings to 
be burned publicly at Tarragona.
     Arnold was acquainted with the preparation of oil of turpentine and oil 
of rosemary, while the marcasite fre-quently mentioned by him is supposed to 
be identical with bismuth.  His most important treatises are his Thesaurus 
Thesaurorum, Rosarium Philosophorum, Speculam  Alchemiae and Perfectum 
Magisterum ; while two others of some moment are his Testamentum and 
Scientia Scientioe. A collected edition of his works was issued in 1520, 
while several writings from his pen are embodied in the Biblio-theca Chemica 
Curiosa of Mangetus, published in 1702.


Villars, l'Abbe de Montfaucon de : French Mystic (1635-1673.) This 
Churchman, author and mystic was what the French style “un meridional" being 
a native of southern Franch. He was born in 1635 at Toulouse, not very far 
from the seaport town of Bordeaux; and at an early age he espoused holy 
orders, while in 1667 he left the south and came to Paris, eager to win fame 
as a preacher.  Nor did this ambition of his go wholly ungratified, his 
eloquence in the pulpit winning him numerous admirers; but he soon grew more 
interested in literature than in clerical affairs, and in 1670 he published 
his first and most important book, Comte du Gabalis. Ostensibly a novel, 
this volume is largely a veiled satire on the writings of La Calprenede, at 
this time very popular both in France and in England; but the satirical 
element in Villars' paper is supplemented by a curious blend of history, 
philosophy and mysticism; and, as much of the last-named is of a nature 
distinctly hostile to the dogmas of Rome, the author soon found himself in 
ill odour with his brother clerics.  Probably it was for this reason that he 
renounced the pulpit, yet his literary activities were not vitiated by 
persecutions; and in 1671 he issued De' la Delicetesse, a speculative 
treatise, couched in the form of dialogues, in which the author takes the 
part of one, a priest who had lately been writing in opposition to Port 
Royal doctrines.  Like its predecessor this new book made a considerable 
stir, and Villars began to write voluminously, at the same time plunging 
deeply into the study of various kinds of mysticism; but his activities were 
suddenly terminated in an unexpected fashion, for in 1673 he was murdered on 
the public high-Toad not far from Lyons, whither he was journeying from 
Paris.  Presumably he had incurred the hatred of some one but the question 
is shrouded in mystery; and, be the solution what it may, no attempt appears 
to have been made to frustrate the posthumous publication of divers works 
from Villars' pen.  Within the first decade succeed-ing his death three such 
works appeared, L’ Amour sans Faiblesse, Anne de Bretague et Ailmanzaris, 
and Critique de la Berenice de Racine et de Corneille, the last-named 
subsequently winning the enconiums of a shrewd judge, 
Mme. de Sevigne ; while so late as 1715 a further production by Villars was 
issued, a sequel to the Comte du Gabalis, bearing the significant title of 
Nouveaux Entretiens sur les Sciences secretes.  This volume elicited ready 
and wide interest among thinkers in the eighteenth century, and it may be 
briefly defined as a treatise opposing the philosophi-cal theories of 
Descartes, or rather, opposing the popular misapprehension and abuse of 
these.


Vintras, Eugene: A Norman peasant of great devoutness, who in the year 1839 
was fixed upon by the Saviours of Louis XVII. (q.v.), as a fitting successor 
to their prophet Martin who had just died.  They addressed a letter to the 
pretended Louis XVII. and arranged that it should fall into the hands of 
Vintras.  It abounded in good promises for the reign to come and in mystical 
expressions calculated to inflame the brain of a person of weak and 
excitable character such as Vintras was.  In a letter Vintras himself 
describes as follows the manner in which this communication reached him :-
     “Towards nine o'clock I was occupied in writing, when there was a knock 
at the door of the room in which I sat, and supposing that it was a workman 
who came on business, I said rather brusquely, 'Come in.'  Much to my 
astonish-ment, in place of the expected workman, I saw an old man in rags.  
I asked merely what he wanted.  He answered with much tranquillity, ' Don't 
disturb yourself, Pierre Michel.'  Now, these names are never used in 
addressing me, for I am known everywhere as Eugene, and even in signing 
documents I do not make use of my first names.  I was conscious of a certain 
emotion at the old man's answer, and this increased when he said: 'I am 
utterly tired, and wherever I appear they treat me with disdain, or as a 
thief.'  The words alarmed me considerably, though they were spoken in a 
saddened and even a woeful tone.  I arose and placed a ten bus piece in his 
hand, say-ing, I do not take you for that, my good man,' and while speaking 
I made him understand that I wished to see him Out.  He received it in 
silence but turned his back with a pained air.  No sooner had he set foot on 
the last step than I shut the door and locked it. I did not hear him go 
down, so I called a workman and told him to come up to my room.  Under some 
business pretext, I was wishing him to search with me all the possible 
places which might conceal my old man, whom I had not seen go out. The 
workman came accordingly. I left the room in his com-pany, again locking my 
door. I hunted through all the nooks and corners, but saw nothing.
     “I was about to enter the factory when I heard on a sudden the bell 
ringing for mass, and felt glad that, not-withstanding the disturbance, I 
could assist at the sacred ceremony.  I ran back to my room to obtain a 
prayer book and, on the table where I had been writing, I found a letter 
addressed- to Mme. de Generes in London; it was written and signed by M. 
Paul de Montfleury of Caen, and embodied a refutation of heresy, together 
with a profession of orthodox faith. The address notwithstanding, this 
letter was intended to place before the Duke of Normandy the most important 
truths of our holy Catholic, Apostolic and Roman religion. On the document 
was laid the ten sous piece which I had given to the old man."
     Vintras immediately concluded that the bringer of the letter was a 
messenger from heaven, and became devoted to the cause of Louis XVII.  He 
became a Visionary.  He had bloody sweats, he saw hearts painted with his 
own blood appear on hosts, accompanied by inscriptions in his own spelling. 
Many believed him a prophet and followed him, among them several priests, 
who alleged that they par-took of his occult vision.  Doctors analysed the 
fluid which flowed from the hosts and certified it to be human blood. His 
enemies referred these miracles to the Devil.  Vintras followers regarded 
him as a new Christ.  But one of them, Gozzoli, published scandalous 
accounts of his doings, alleging that horrible obscenities and sacrilegious 
masses took place in their private chapel at Tilly-sur-seules. The 
unspeakable abominations alluded to are contained in a pamphlet entitled Le 
Prophete Vintras (1851).  The sect was formally condemned by the Pope, and 
Vintras constituted himself sovereign Pontiff. He was arrested on a charge 
of exploiting his cult for money, was tried at Caen, and sentenced to five 
years imprisonment. When freed in 1845 he went to England. and in London 
resumed the head-ship of his cult which seems to have flourished for some 
time afterwards.


Virgil, the Enchanter : (See Italy.)


Visions : (From Latin visus, p.p. of videre, to see.) The appearance to 
mortals of supernatural persons, or scenes. Of great frequency in early and 
medieval times, and among savage or semi-civilised races, visions seem to 
have decreased proportionately with the advance of learning and enlighten-
ment. Thus among the Greeks and Romans of the classic period they were 
comparatively rare, though visions of demons or gods were occasionally seen. 
On the other hand, among Oriental races the seeing of visions was a common 
occurrence, and these took more varied shapes. In medieval Europe, again, 
visions were almost common-places, and directions were given by the Church 
to enable men to distinguish visions of divine origin from those false 
delusions which were the work of the Evil One.  Visions may be roughly 
divided into two classes-those which are spontaneous, and those which are 
induced.  But, indeed, the great majority belong to the latter class.  
Ennemoser enumerates the causes of such appearances thus :  (1) Sensitive 
organism and delicate constitution; (2) Religious education and ascetic life 
(fasting, penance, etc.) ;  (3) Narcotics-opium, wine, incense, narcotic 
salves (witch-salves) ; (4) Delirium, monomania; (5) Fear and expecta-tion, 
preparatory words, songs, and prayers.  Among the visions induced by prayer 
and fasting, and the severe self-discipline of the religious ascetic, must 
be included many historical or traditional instances - the visions of St. 
Francis of Assisi, St. Anthony, St. Bernard Ignatius, St. Catherine of 
Siena, St. Hildegarde, Joan of Arc.  It may be noted that the convent has 
ever been the special haunt of religious visions, probably for the reasons 
above men-tioned.  But the most potent means for the inductions of visionary 
appearances are those made use of by the Orientals.  Narcotics of all kinds 
- opium, haschish, and so on-are indulged in, and physical means used for 
this express purpose.  Thus the Brahmins will gaze for hours at a time at 
the sun or moon, will remain for months in practically the some position, or 
will practise all manner of mortification of the body, so that they may fall 
at length into the visionary sleep (a species of catalepsy.)  The narcotic 
salves with which they anoint themselves are said to be similar to the 
witch-salves used in the Middle Ages, which induced in the witch the 
hallucination that she was flying through the air on a goat or a broomstick.  
Opium also is said to produce a sensation of flying, as well as visions of 
celestial delight.  Alcoholic intoxication induces visions of insects and 
small animals, as does also nitrogen. The vapours rising from the ground in 
some places, or those to be found in certain caverns, are said to exercise 
an effect similar to that of narcotics.  The Indians of North America 
practise similar external methods of inducing visions - solitude, fasting, 
and the use of salves or ointments.  The savages of Africa have dances 
which, by producing severe dizziness, help them towards the desired 
visionary ecstasy. The northern savages attain the same end by the use of 
drums and noisy music.  Spontaneous visions, though less common, are yet 
sufficiently numerous to merit atten-tion here.  The difficulty is, of 
course, to know just how far " fear and expectation" may have operated to 
induce the vision.  In many cases, as in that of Swedenborg, the visions may 
have commenced as " visions of the night," hardly to be distinguished from 
dreams, and so from vision of an" internal" nature to clearly externalised 
apparitions. Swedenborg himself declares that when seeing visions of the 
latter class he used his senses exactly as when awake, dwelling with the 
spirits as a spirit, but able to return to his body when he pleased.  An 
interesting case of spon-taneous vision is that of Benvenuto Cellini (q.v.).  
Visions are by no means confined to the sense of sight.  Taste, hearing, 
smelling, touch, may all be experienced in a vision.  Joan of Arc, for 
instance, heard voices encouraging her to be the deliverer of her country.  
Examples may be drawn from the Bible, as the case of the child Samuel in the 
Temple, and instances could be multiplied from all ages and all times. The 
visions of Pordage and the" Phila-delphia Society, or, as they called 
themselves later, the Angelic Brethren "-in 1651 are noteworthy in this 
respect because they include the taste of " brimstone, salt, and soot."  In 
the presence of the " Angelic Brethren pictures were drawn on the window-
panes by invisible hands, and were seen to move about.
     Physiological explanations of visions have from time to time been 
offered.  Plato says  " The eye is the organ of a fire which does not burn 
but gives a mild light.  The rays proceeding from the eye meet those of the 
outward light. With the departure of the outward light the inner also 
becomes less active; all inward movements become calmer and less disturbed ; 
and should any more prominent influences have remained they become in 
various points where they congregate, so many pictures of the fancy."
     Democritus held that visions and dreams are passing shapes, ideal forms 
proceeding from other beings.  Of death-bed visions Plutarch says: " It is 
not probable that in death the soul gains new powers which it was not before 
possessed of when the heart was confined within the chains of the body; but 
it is much more probable that these powers were always in being, though 
dimmed and clogged by the body; and the soul is only then able to practise 
them when the cor-poreal bonds are loosened, and the drooping limbs and 
stagnating juices no longer oppress it." The spiritualistic theory of 
visions can hardly be called a physiological one, save in so far as spirit 
is regarded as refined matter.  An old theory of visionary ecstasy on these 
lines was that the soul left the body and proceeded to celestial spheres, 
where it remained in contemplation of divine scenes and persons. Very 
similar to this is the doctrine of Swedenborg, whose spirit, he believed, 
could commune with discarnate spirits-the souls of the dead-as one of 
themselves.  To this may be directly traced the doctrines of modern 
spiritualism, which thus regards visions as actual spirits or spirit scenes, 
visible to the ecstatic or entranced subject whose spirit was projected to 
discarnate planes.  The question whether or no visions are contagious has 
been much disputed.  It has been said that such appearances may be 
transferred from one person to another by the laying on of hands.  In the 
case of the Scottish seers such a transference may take place even by 
accidental contact with the seer.  The vision of the second person is, 
however, less distinct than that of the original seer.  The same idea 
prevailed with regard to the visions of magnetised patients.  In so far as 
these may be identified with the collective hallucinations of the hypnotic 
state, there is no definite scientific evidence to prove their existence.
     Visions have by no means been confined to the ignorant or the 
superstitious. Many men of genius have been subject to visionary appearance.  
While Raphael was trying to paint the Madonna she appeared to him in a 
vision.  The famous composition known as the " Devil's Sonata" was dictated 
to Tartini by the Evil One himself.  Goethe also had visions.  Blake's 
portraits of the Patriarchs were done from visionary beings which appeared 
to him in the night. And such instances might easily be multiplied.

Vitality, according to theosophists, comes from the sun. When a physical 
atom is transfused with vitality, it draws to itself six other atoms and 
thus makes an etheric element. The sum of their vitality is then divided 
among each of the atoms and in this state the element enters the physical 
body by means of one of the sense organs or chaksams of the etheric double-
that situated opposite the spleen. Here the element is divided into its 
component parts and these are conveyed to the various parts of the physical 
body.  It is on vitality that the latter depends, not only for life but for 
its well-being in life.  A person sufficiently supplied with it enjoys good 
health and one insufficiently supplied is afflicted with poor health.  In 
the case of a healthy person. however, more vitality is drawn in than is 
necessary for the vital purposes and the superfluous vitality acts 
beneficially on his neighbours, whether human or animal, while it can also 
be directed in certain definite channels to the healing of diseases and so 
forth.  With unhealthy persons, the case is, of course, reversed, and they 
devitalise the more healthy, with whom they come in contact.

Wafer: The sacred wafer is often used by devil-worshippers for purposes of 
profanation.  (See' Devil-worship.) There was found in the house of the 
notorious witch, Dame Alice Kyteler (q.v.), a wafer of sacramental bread, 
bearing thereon the name of the Devil.

Waldenses : The name of a Christian sect which arose in the south of France 
about I 170.  They were much the same in origin and ethics as the Albigenses 
(q.v.), that is, their religious system rested upon that of Manichaeism, 
which believed in dualism and severe asceticism.  It undoubtedly arose from 
the desire of the bourgeois class to have changes made in the clerical 
discipline of the Roman Church.  Its adherents called themselves cathari 
thus demonstrating the eastern origin of their system.  There were two 
classes of these, credentes and perfecti, or neophytes and adepts,-the 
perfecti only being admitted to the esoteric doctrines of the Waldensian 
Church.  Outwardly its aim and effort was rationalistic ; but the inner 
doctrine partook more of the occult.  It was in 1170 that Peter Waldo, a 
rich merchant of Lyons, sold his goods and gave them to the poor, and from 
him the sect was named.  The earliest account of Waldensian beliefs is that 
of an enemy, Sacconi, an inquisitor of the Holy Office, who wrote about the 
middle of the thirteenth century.  He divides the Wal-densians into two 
classes, those of Lombardy, and those north of the Alps.  The latter 
believed that any layman might consecrate the sacrament of the altar, and 
that the Roman Church was not the Church of Christ; while the Lombardian 
sect held that the Roman Church was the Scarlet Woman of the Apocalypse.  
They also believed that all men were priests.  As their opinions became more 
wide-spread, persecution became more severe, and the Walden-sians latterly 
withdrew themselves altogether from the Church of Rome, and chose ministers 
for themselves by election.  Papal bulls were issued for their 
extermination, and a crusade was directed against them; but they sur-vived 
these attacks, and so late as the time of Cromwell were protected by him 
against the Duke of Savoy and the French king. Their ministers were later 
subsidised by the government of Queen Anne, and this subsidy was carried on 
until the time of Napoleon, when he granted them an equivalent.  Latterly 
they have received much assistance from various Protestant countries of 
Europe, especially from England  and at the present time number some 12,000 
to 13,000 communicants.
     During the Middle Ages, it was strongly held by the priesthood of the 
Roman Church that, like the Albigenses, the Waldensians had a diabolic 
element in their religion and they have been from time to time classed with 
the various secret societies that sprang up in medieval Europe, such as the 
Knights Templar, the Rosicrucians, and so forth ; but although they 
possessed an esoteric doctrine of their own, there is no reason to believe 
that this was in any way magical, nor in any manner more  esoteric" than the 
inner doctrine of any other Christian sect.

occultist and spiritualist, and friend of Eliphas Levi (q.v.).  He is 
represented by the pseudo-historians of  Satanism" as a right-hand man of 
Albert Pike (q.v.) in his alleged diabolic practices at Charleston, U.S.A.  
(See Devil Worship.)  In reality Walder was an earnest mason and mystic.

Wallace, Alfred Russel : A distinguished British naturalist, who discovered 
the theory of evolution independent of Darwin.  He was born at Usk, in 
Monmouthshire, on the 8th of January, 1823.  His scientific studies included 
an enquiry into. the phenomena of spiritualism, and he became a firm 
believer in the genuineness of these manifestations. Dr. Wallace' had unique 
opportunities for studying these in connection with Mrs. Guppy, who, as Miss 
Nichols, lived for a time with his sister.  Among his works was one entitled 
Miracles and Modern Spiritualism, pub-lished in 1881.  Dr. Wallace's views 
on psychic phenomena remained unchanged until his death in 1903.  His 
scientific position made him a tower of strength to the spiritualists.


Wallenstein, Albert Von, Duke of  Friedland : (See Astrology.)


Wandering Jew, The: A medieval German legend which has several forms.  
Through various writers, and differing in detail, the essential features of 
the narratives which have been handed down to us, are the same.  The legend 
is that as Christ was dragged on his way to Calvary, he passed the house of 
a Jew, and stopping there, sought to rest a little, being weary under the 
weight of his cross.  The Jew, however, inspired with the adverse enthusiasm 
of the mob, drove Him on, and would not allow Him to rest there.  Jesus, 
looking at him, said,  I shall stand and rest, but thou shalt go till the 
last day."  Ever afterwards the Jew was compelled to wander over the earth, 
till this prophecy should be fulfilled.
     The legend of the Wandering Jew is to be regarded as the epic of the 
Semite people in the Middle Ages.
     In some parts of Germany we find the Wandering Jew identified with the 
Wild Huntsman, whilst in several French districts that mythical character is 
regarded as the wind of the night. The blast in his horn, which, rushing 
through the valleys creates a hollow booming sound not unlike a great bugle. 
In this legend we have in all probability the clue to the mythological side 
of the story of the wandering Jew.  Or perhaps the idea. of the Wandering 
Jew has been fused with that of the conception of the wind.  The re-
semblance between the two conceptions would be too strong to escape the 
popular mind.  From a literary point of view this legend has been treated by 
Eugene Sue and Croly.

War, Occult Phenomena during the: A surprising number of ideas regarding the 
supernatural have crystallized around the circumstances of the war.  Perhaps 
the most striking of these was the alleged vision of angels at Mons. The 
first notice regarding this, or at least the most impor-tant and public 
record of the occurrence, was that con-tained in the Evening News for 
September 14th, 1915, ill Which Mr. Machen described the evidence as given 
to him by an officer who was in the retreat from Mons.  This officer was a 
member of a well-known army family and was a person of great credibility, 
who stated that on August 26th, 1914, he was fighting in the battle of Le 
Cateau, from which his division retired in good order.   On the night of the 
27th," he says,  I was riding along the column with two other officers. . . 
. As we rode along I became conscious of the fact that in the fields on both 
sides of the road along which we were marching I could see a very large body 
of horsemen. . . . the other two officers had stopped talking. At last one 
of them asked me if I saw anything in the fields.  I told them what I had 
seen.  The third officer confessed that he, too, had been watching these 
horsemen for the past twenty minutes.  So convinced were we that they were 
really cavalry, that at the next halt one of the officers took a party of 
men out to reconnoitre and found no one there.  The night then grew darker 
and we saw no more.
     Mr. Harold Begbie in his book On the' Side' of the Angels states that a 
vision of angels was seen in the retreat from Mons and gives the narrative 
of a soldier, who states that an officer came up to him "in a state of great 
anxiety" and pointed out to him a ' strange light which seemed to be quite 
distinctly outlined and was not a reflection of the moon, nor were there any 
clouds in the neighbourhood. The light became brighter and I could see quite 
distinctly three shapes. one in the centre having what looked like outspread 
wings.  The other two were not so large, but were quite plainly distinct 
from the centre one. They appeared to have a long, loose-hanging garment of 
a golden tint and they were above the German line facing us. We stood 
watching them for about three-quarters of an hour."  All the men in the 
battalion who saw this with the exception of five were killed.  Mr. Begbie 
goes on to say that he was told by a nurse that a dying soldier spoke to her 
of the reluctance of the Germans to attack our line, because of the 
thousands of troops behind us."  This man had heard German prisoners say so 
and fully believed in the phantasmal nature of those supporting hosts.
     In his monograph on the Bowmen at Mons, Mr. Machen put forward the idea 
that those seen before the retreat from Mons were the spirits of the English 
bowmen who had fought at Agincourt and this idea gained wide prevalence, an 
interesting monograph being written upon it by Mr. Ralph Shirley.  Men from 
the front, too, have stated to interviewers that phantasms of the dead 
frequently appeared in the space between the German and British trenches 
called  No Man's Land."
     Mr. Shirley has also written an excellent pamphlet on “Prophecies and 
Omens of the Great War" dealing with the various oracular utterances on the 
gigantic struggle, which may be referred to with confidence.
     Stories, too, were current in the earlier times of the war regarding 
the appearance of saintly and protective figures resembling the patrons of 
the several allied countries. Thus the English were convinced that in 
certain engage-ments they had beheld the figure of Saint George mounted on a 
white charger and the French were equally sure that the figure in question 
was either Saint Denis or Joan of Arc. Wounded men in base hospitals asked 
for medallions or Coins on which the likenesses of these saints were 
impressed in order to verify the statements they made.


Wayland Smith  A famous character in German mythological romance and father 
of Weltich, whom he trained in the art of warfare and sent to the Court of 
Dietrich in Bern. To him he gave the sword Miming and told him of a mer-
maid, his ancestress, to whom he was to apply when in difficulty.  He is 
also referred to in the Sigfried story, being in company with a smith named 
Mimi, when Sig-fried joins the smithy.  His workmanship is praised in the 
Beowulf Saga and he is mentioned there and elsewhere as a maker of 
impregnable armour.  He is the supernatural smith of the Teutonic peoples, 
and is comparable to Vulcan in Roman, and to Hephaistos in Greek mythology.

Werwolf  A man temporarily or permanently transformed into a wolf, from the 
Anglo-Saxon wer, a man, and wolf, a wolf.  It is a phase of Lycanthropy 
(q.v.), and in ancient and medieval times was of very frequent occurrence.  
It was, of course, in Europe where the wolf was one of the largest 
carnivorous animals, that the super-stition gained currency, similar tales 
in other countries usually introducing bears, tigers, and so forth.
     The belief is probably a relic of early cannibalism. Communities of 
semi-civilised people would begin to shun those who devoured human flesh, 
and they would be ostracised and classed as wild beasts, the idea that they 
had something in common with these would grow, and the conception that they 
were able to transform themselves into veritable animals would be likely to 
arise therefrom.
     There were two kinds of werwolf, voluntary and involun-tary.  The 
voluntary would be, as has been said, those persons who, because of their 
taste for human flesh, had withdrawn from intercourse with their fellows.  
These appeared to possess a certain amount of magical power, or at least 
sufficient of it to transform themselves into the animal shape at will.  
This they effected by merely disrobing, by the taking off a girdle made of 
human skin, or, putting on a similar belt of wolf-skin, obviously a 
substitute for an entire wolf-skin.  But we also hear of their donning the
entire skin.  In other instances the body is rubbed with a magic ointment, 
or water is drunk out of a wolf's foot-print.  The brains of the animal are 
also eaten.  Olaus Magnus says  that the werwolves of Livonia drained a cup 
of beer on initiation, and repeated certain magic words.  In order to throw 
off the wolf shape the animal girdle was removed, or else the magician 
merely muttered a certain formula.  In some instances the transformation was 
supposed to be the work of Satan.
     The superstition regarding werwolves seems to have been exceedingly 
prevalent in France during the 16th century as is evidenced by numerous 
trials, in some of which it is clearly shown that murder and cannibalism 
took place. Self-hallucination, too, was accountable for some of these 
cases, the supposed werwolves fully admitting that they had transformed 
themselves and had slain numerous persons.  But at the beginning of the 17th 
century, commonsense came to the rescue, and persons making such confessions 
were not credited.  In Teutonic and Slavonic countries it was complained by 
men of learning that werwolves did more damage than the real criminals, and 
a regular  college" or institution for the practice of the art of animal 
transformation was attributed to them.
     Involuntary werwolves were often persons transformed into an animal 
shape because of the commission of sin, and condemned to pass so many years 
in that form.  Thus certain saints metamorphosed sinners into wolves.  In 
Armenia it is thought that sinful women are condemned to pass seven years in 
the form of a wolf. To such a woman a demon appears, bringing a wolf-skin. 
He commands her to don it, from which moment she becomes a wolf with all the 
nature of a wild beast, devouring her own children and those of strangers, 
wandering forth at night, undeterred by locks, bolts, or bars, returning 
only with morning to resume her human form.
     Romance, especially French romance, is full of wer-wolves, and one of 
the most remarkable instances of this is the Lay by Marie de France entitled 
Bisclaveret, the Lay of a werwolf.
     Many werwolves were innocent persons suffering through the witchcraft 
of others.  To regain their true form it was necessary for them to kneel in 
one spot for a hundred years, to lose three drops of blood, to be hailed as 
a werwolf, to have the sign of the cross made on their bodies, to be 
addressed thrice by their baptismal names, or to be struck thrice on the 
forehead with a knife.
     According to Donat de Hautemer, quoted by Goulart, “there are some 
lycanthropes who are so dominated by their melancholy humour that they 
really believe them-selves to be transformed into wolves.  This malady, 
accord-ing to the testimony of Aetius in his sixth book, chapter XI., and 
Paulus in his third book, chapter XVI., and other moderns, is a sort of 
melancholy, of a black and dismal nature.  Those who are attacked by it 
leave their homes in the months of February, imitate wolves iii almost every 
particular, and wander all night long among the cemeteries and sepulchres, 
so that one may observe a marvellous change in the mind and disposition, 
and, above all in the depraved imagination, of the lycanthrope. The memory, 
however, is still vigorous, as I have remarked in One of this lycanthropic 
melancholiacs whom we call werwolves.  For one who was well acquainted with 
me was one day seized with his affliction, and on meeting him I withdrew a 
little, fearing that he might injure me. He, having glanced at me for a 
moment, passed on followed by a crowd of people.  On his shoulder he carried 
the entire leg and thigh of a corpse.  Having received careful medical 
treatment, he was cured of this malady.  On meeting me on another occasion 
he asked me if I had not been afraid when he met me at such and such a 
place, which made me think that his memory was not hurt by the vehemence of 
his disease, though his imagination was so greatly damaged."
     “Guillaume de Brabant. in the narrative of Wier, repeated by Goulart, 
has written in his History that a certain man of sense and settled 
understanding was still so tormented by the evil spirit that at a particular 
season of the year he would think himself a ravening wolf, and would run 
here and there in the woods, caves and deserts, chasing little children.  It 
was said that this man was often found running about in the deserts like a 
man out of his senses, and that at last by the grace of God he came to 
himself and was healed. There was also, as is related by Job Fincel in the 
second book On Miracles a villager near Paule in the year 1541, who believed 
himself to be a wolf, and assaulted several men in the fields, even killing 
some.  Taken at last, though not without great difficulty, he stoutly 
affirmed that he was a wolf, and that the only way in which he differed from 
other wolves was that they wore their hairy coats on the outside, while he 
wore his between his skin and his flesh. Certain persons, more inhuman and 
wolfish than he, wished to test the truth of this story, and gashed his arms 
and legs severely. Then, learning their mistake, and the innocence of the 
melan-choliac, they passed him over to the consideration of the surgeons, in 
whose hands he died some days after.  Those afflicted with this disease are 
pale, with dark and haggard eyes, seeing only with difficulty; the tongue is 
dry, and the sufferer very thirsty.  Pliny and others write that the brain 
of a bear excites such bestial imaginations. It is even said that one was 
given to a Spanish gentleman to eat. in our times, which so disturbed his 
mind, that imagin-ing himself to be transformed into a bear, he fled to the 
mountains and deserts."
     “As for the lycanthropes, whose imagination was so damaged," says 
Goulart,  that by some Satanic efficacy they appeared wolves and not men to 
those who saw them running about and doing all manner of harm, Bodin main-
tains that the devil can change the shape of one body into that of another, 
in the great power that God gives him in this elementary world. He says, 
then, that there may be lycanthropes who have really been transformed into 
wolves, quoting various examples and histories to prove his contention. In 
short, after many disputes, he believes in Colt's forms of lycanthropy.  And 
as for the latter, there is represented at the end of this chapter the 
summary of his proposition, to wit, that men are some-times transformed into 
beasts, retaining in that form the human reason  it may be that this comes 
about by the direct power of God, or it may be that he gives this power to 
Satan, who carries out his will, or rather his redoubtable judgments.  And 
if we confess (he says) the truths of the sacred history in Daniel, 
concerning the transformation of Nebuchadnezzar, and the history of Lot's 
wife changed into motionless stone, the changing of men into an ox or a 
stone is certainly possible; and consequently the trans-formation to other 
animals as well."
     G. Peucer says in speaking of lycanthropy:   “As for me I had formerly 
regarded as ridiculous and fabulous the stories I had often heard concerning 
the transformation of men into wolves ; but I have learnt from reliable 
sources, and from the testimony of trustworthy witnesses, that such things 
are not at all doubtful or incredible, since they tell of such 
transformations taking place twelve days after Christmas in. Livonia and the 
adjacent coun-tries; as they have been proved to be true by the con-fessions 
of those who have been imprisoned and tortured for such crimes.  Here is the 
manner in which it is done. Immediately after Christmas day is past, a lame 
boy goes round the country calling these slaves of the devil, of which there 
are a great number, and enjoining them to follow him.  If they procrastinate 
or go too slowly, there immediately appears a tall man with a whip whose 
thongs are made of iron chains, with which he urges them onwards, and 
sometimes lashes the poor wretches so cruelly, that the marks of the whip 
remain on their bodies till long afterwards, and cause them the greatest 
pain. As soon as they have set out on their road, they are all changed into 
wolves     They travel in thousands, having for their conductor the bearer 
of the whip, after whom they march. When they reach the fields, they rush 
upon the cattle they find there, tearing and carrying away all they can, and 
doing much other damage; but they are not permitted to touch or wound 
persons. When they approach any rivers, their guide separates the waters 
with his whip, so that they seem to open up and leave a dry space by which 
to cross. At the end of twelve days the whole band scatters, and everyone 
returns to his home, having regained his own proper form. This 
transformation, they say, comes about in this wise. The victims fall 
suddenly on the ground as though they were taken with sudden illness, and 
remain motionless and extended like corpses, deprived of all feeling, for 
they neither stir, nor move from one place to another, nor are in any wise 
transformed into wolves, thus resembling carrion, for although they are 
rolled or shaken, they give no sign of life."
     Bodin relates several cases of lycanthropy and of men changed into 
beasts.
     “Pierre Mamot, in a little treatise he has written on sorcerers, says 
that he has observed this changing of men into wolves, he being in Savoy at 
the time. Henry of Cologne in his treatise de' Lamiis regards the trans-
formation as beyond doubt. And Ulrich in a little book dedicated to the 
emperor Sigismund, writes of the dispute before the emperor, and says that 
it was agreed, both on the ground of reason, and of the experience of 
innumerable examples, that such transformation was a fact; and he adds that 
he himself had seen a lycanthrope at Constance, who was accused, convicted, 
condemned, and finally executed after his confession. And several books pub-
lished in Germany say that one of the greatest kings of Christendom, who is 
not long dead, and who had the reputation of being one of the greatest 
sorcerers in the world, often changed into a-wolf."
     “I remember that the attorney-general of the King, Bourdin, has 
narrated to me another which was sent to him from the Low Countries, with 
the whole trial signed by the judge and the clerks, of a wolf, which was 
struck by an arrow on the thigh, and afterwards found himself in bed, with 
the arrow (which he had torn out). on regain-ing his human shape, and the 
arrow was recognised by him who had fired it-the time and place testified by 
the con-fession of the person."
    “Garnier, tried and condemned by the parliament of Dole, being in the 
shape of a werwolf, caught a girl of ten or twelve years in a vineyard of 
Chastenoy, a quarter of a league from Dole, and having slain her with his 
teeth and claw-like hands, he ate part of her flesh and carried the rest to 
his wife. A month later, in the same form, he took another girl, and would 
have eaten her also, had he not, as he himself confessed, been prevented by 
three persons who happened to be passing by; and a fortnight after he 
strangled a boy of ten in the vineyard of Gredisans, and ate his flesh; and 
in the form of a man and not of a wolf, he killed another boy of twelve or 
thirteen years in a wood of the village of Porouse with the intention of 
eating him, but was again prevented.  He was condemned to be burnt, and the 
sentence was executed."
     “At the parliament of Bezancon, the accused were Pierre Burgot and 
Michel Verdun, who confessed to having renounced God, and sworn to serve the 
devil. And Michel Verdun led Burgot to the bord du Chastel Charlon where 
everyone carried a candle of green wax which shone with a blue flame. There 
they danced and offered sacrifices to the devil. Then after being anointed 
they were turned into wolves, running with incredible swiftness; then they 
were changed again into men, and suddenly transformed back to wolves, when 
they enjoyed the society of female wolves as much as they had done that of 
their wives. They confessed also that Burgot had killed a boy of seven years 
with his wolf-claws and teeth, intending to eat him, but the peasants gave 
chase, and prevented him. Burgot and Verdun had eaten four girls between 
them; and they had caused people to die by the touch of a certain powder."
     “Job Fincel, in the eleventh book of his Marvels wrote that there was 
at Padua a lycanthrope who was caught and his wolf-claws cut, and at the 
same instant he found his arms and feet cut.  That is given to strengthen 
the case against the sorcerers of Vernon (1556) who assembled themselves in 
an old and ruined chateau under the shape of an infinite number of cats.  
There happened to arrive there one evening four or five men, who decided to 
spend the night in the place. They were awakened by a multi-tude of cats, 
who assaulted them, killed one of their number, and wounded others. The men, 
however, succeeded in wounding several of the cats, who found on recovering 
their human shape that they were badly hurt. And in-credible as it may seem, 
the trial was not proceeded with."
     “But the five inquisitors who had experimented in these causes have 
left it in writing that there were three sorcerers in Strasbourg who, in the 
guise of three large cats, assaulted a labourer, and in defending himself he 
wounded and dispersed the cats, who found themselves, at the same moment, 
laid on sick-beds, in the form of women severely wounded. At the trial they 
accused him who had struck them, and he told the judges the hour and the 
place where he had been assaulted by the cats, and how he had wounded them."

West Indian Islands : Magic and sorcery in the West Indian Islands are 
wholly the preserve of the negro population, who possess special magical 
cults called Obeah and Vaudoux, variants of West African fetishism. The root 
idea of Obeahism and Vaudoux is the worship and propitiation of, the snake-
god Obi-a West African word typifying the Spirit of Evil.  Vaudoux or Voodoo 
is a form of Obeah practised in Haiti, San Domingo, and the French West 
Indies.  Its rites are always accompanied by the sacrifice of fowls and 
goats, and in only too many cases by the offering up of the goat without 
horns "-the human sacrifice, usually a young girl or boy. The lonely groves 
and mountain caves where the devotees of Vaudoux enjoy the orgies of a 
Walpurgis night seldom give up their secrets.. There are two sects of 
Vaudoux-the white and the red. The former, which only believes in the 
sacrifice of white fowls and goats, is tolerated by the laws of Haiti, and 
its rites are as commonly practised as those of the Catholic Church.  But 
even the red sect, which openly stands for human sacrifice, is seldom 
interfered with.  The authorities dare not suppress it, for their own 
policemen and soldiers stand in awe of the "Papaloi" and  Mamaloi"-the 
priests and priestess of the snake-god.  More than that, there have been 
Presidents of Haiti in recent years who believed in Vaudoux.  Hippolyte was 
even a " Papaloi" himself.  He beat the black goatskin drum in the streets 
of the capital to call the faithful together to see him kill the sen-sel 
fowl. Another president, Geffard, tried to do his duty and stamp out the 
cult.  A terrible revenge was taken upon him.  His young daughter, Cora, was 
shot dead as she knelt in prayer before the altar of a church in Port-au-
Prince.  Today there is a temple of the red sect in the Haitian capital near 
a triumphal arch, which is inscribed with the unctuous words, 
" Liberty - education - progress."  Under British government Obeahism 
perforce takes forms less dangerous to the social order than it does in 
Haiti; but it is none the less a constant public peril in Jamaica and the 
other British West Indian Islands.  It is a bitter foe of religion, 
education and social advancement In olden days it worked by means of 
wholesale poisoning, and in quite recent days there have been not a few 
cases of Obeahmen seeking to do murder in the old way. A favourite method of 
the Obeahmen, both in Jamaica and Haiti, is to mix the infinitesimal hairs 
of the bamboo in the food of persons who refuse to bow the knee to them. 
This finally sets up malignant dysentery.  If the afflicted one remains 
contumacious, he dies  if he makes his peace with the Obeahman, and gives 
him a handsome present, the slow process of poisoning ceases, and he lives.  
In all the crises and troubles of life the negro flies to the Obeahman. If 
he has to appear at the Police Court he pays the Obeah-man to go there also 
and "fix de eye" of the magistrate, so that he will be discharged. Perhaps 
he has been turned out of his office of deacon in the Baptist Chapel by a 
white minister for immorality.  In that case the Obeahman will arrange for a 
choice collection of the most powerful spells-such as dried lizards, fowls' 
bones, and graveyard earth-to be placed in the minister's Bible for him to 
stare upon when he looks up the text of his sermon. Then, if the Obeah works 
properly, the erring deacon will be received back to office. Even coloured 
men of education and official position are often tainted with Obeahism. They 
often make use of. it for profit and to increase their power over the 
ignorant negroes. The mulatto chairman of a Parochial Board-the Jamaican 
equivalent of our County Council-was sent to goal for practising Obeah only 
a few years ago.  A prominent member of the Kingston City Council was the 
leading Obeahman in the island-the pontiff of the cult. He was so clever 
that the police could never catch him, although he was supposed to make over 
3,000 pounds a year by his nefarious practices. Once some detectives raided 
his place, but he received timely warning and fled.
     A writer to the press thus describes a " red " Vaudoux ceremony: " I 
had seen the ' white  ritual several times in Port-au-Prince and elsewhere 
when at last I was per-mitted through the kindness of a mulatto general, to 
witness the ' red ' rite. I was informed that only cocks and goats would be 
sacrificed, and that turned out to be the fact. The General conducted me to 
a small wood about three miles from the town of Jacmel. By the light of 
kerosene oil flares I saw about forty men and women gathered round a rude 
stone altar, on which, twined around a cocomacacque stick, was the sacred 
green snake. The 'Mamoli' a tall, evil-looking negress, was dressed in a 
scarlet robe, with a red turban on her head.  She was dancing a sinuous 
dance before the altar, and droning an ancient West African chant, which the 
onlookers repeated. Rapidly she worked herself up to a frantic pitch of 
excite-ment, pausing now and then to take a drink from one of the rum 
bottles which passed freely from hand to hand. At last she picked up a 
glittering machete from the altar, and with her other hand seized a black 
cock held by a bystander. She whirled the bird round her head violently 
until the feathers were flying in all directions, and then severed the head 
from the body with one swift stroke. The tense and horrible excitement had 
kept the worshippers silent, but they burst into a savage yell when the 
priestess pressed the bleeding neck of the slaughtered fowl to her lips. 
After-wards she dipped her finger in the blood and made the sign of the 
cross on her forehead and pressed it to the forehead of some of her 
disciples."
     The obeah man can always be easily recognised by one who has had much 
to do with negroes.  He has an indes-cribably sinister appearance. He is 
unwashed, ragged, often half mad, usually diseased, and almost always has an 
ulcerated leg. This last, indeed, is a badge of the tribe. Often he is a 
very old negro who knew "slavery days" and more than half believes in his 
magical pretensions. But not all are of this disreputable type.  Even some 
of the white planters themselves do not scorn to make use of obeah, 
although, of course, they have no belief in it. The theft of growing crops 
by the negroes is one of the greatest trials of their lives.  Sometimes they 
adorn the trees round the edge of a" banana piece" or orange grove with 
miniature coffins, old bones, bottles of dirty water, and other obeah 
objects; and then the negroes will not dare to enter and steal.  An 
interesting report published in a Jamaican journal during 1908 gives 
particulars of an obeah case of possession or haunting as follows:
     “The cause celebre at Half-way Tree Court, Jamaica, recently, was the 
case of Rex v. Charles Donaldson for unlawfully practising obeah.  Robert 
Robinson, who stated that he was a labourer living at Trench Pen, in the 
parish of St. Andrew, stated that on Tuesday, the 8th ult., he was sitting 
down outside the May Pen cemetery on the Spanish Town Road.  He was on his 
way from work, and had a white handkerchief tied around his head. He was 
feeling sick, and that led him to sit down.  While there sitting the 
prisoner came to him.  He did not know the man before, but he began by 
asking him what was the matter.  Witness replied,  " I  am  well sick."  The 
prisoner said, " No, you are not sick; you have two ghosts on you-one creole 
and one coolie."  Witness told the prisoner to go away and was left.  He 
next saw prisoner on Wednesday 9th.  He came to him at Bumper Hall, where he 
was working, and he said to him, "Man, how you find me here?"  "Oh," replied 
the prisoner, "if a man is in hell self I can find him; I come for you to 
give me the job ? " Witness then inquired, " What job?" and accused told him 
he wanted to "take off the two ghosts." He would do it for 25 pounds, and 
he" killed" for any sum from 25 pounds to 50 pounds.  He had worked for all 
classes-white, black, coolie, Chinese, etc.  Witness said he did not give 
him any “good consent" at the time, but reported the matter after the 
accused left to Clark and Wright, two witnesses in the case.  Clark told him 
he must not scare the man but go home.  On Thursday, the 10th, the defendant 
came to him at his yard at French Pen.  The accused told him he would come 
back to him to take off the ghost.  He also told him to get a bottle of rum 
and 5s.  He (witness) con-sented to the arrangement.  The defendant began by 
taking off his jacket.  He then opened his " brief bag" and took out a piece 
of chalk.  The accused then made three marks on the table and took out a 
phial and a white stone.  The phial contained some stuff which appeared be 
quicksilver.  He arrayed his paraphernalia on the table. They consisted of a 
large whisky bottle with some yellow stuff, a candle, a pack of cards, a 
looking-glass, three cigarette pictures, a pocket knife, etc.  The accused 
also took out a whistle which he sounded, and then placed the cards on the 
table.  He then asked for the 5s. which was given to him.  He placed the 
coins on the cards around a lighted candle. The pint of rum which he 
(witness) had brought was on the table and prisoner poured some of it into a 
pan.  He went outside and sprinkled the rum at the four corners of the 
house.  Accused came back in and said, " Papa!  papa!  your case is very 
bad! There are two ghosts outside.  The creole is bad, but the coolie is 
rather worse. But if he is made out of hell I will catch him."
     The prisoner then began to blow his whistle in a very funny way-a way 
in which he had never heard a whistle blown before.  He also began to speak 
in an unknown tongue and to call up the ghosts.
     Mr. Lake - " Aren't there a lot of you people who believe that ghosts 
can harm and molest you?
     Witness-" No, I am not one.'
     Mr. Lake-" Did you not tell him that a duppy struck you on your back 
and you heard voices calling you ?"
     Witness-" He told me so."  Continuing, witness said he had seen all 
sorts of ghosts at all different times and of different kinds also.
     Mr. Lake" Of all different sexes, man and woman?" 
     Witness-" Yes  any man who can see ghosts will know a man ghost from a 
woman ghost. Dem never walk straight."


Westcar Papyrus: An Egyptian papyrus dating from the eighteenth century 
B.C., devoted chiefly to tales of magic and enchantment. The commencement 
and ending are wanting, yet enough of the subject matter has survived to 
enable us to form a fairly correct idea of the whole. Wiede-mann says 
concerning it (Popular Literature in Ancient Egypt)  "The papyrus tells how 
Kheops-the king whom notices of Greek writers have made universally famous 
as the builder of the Great Pyramid of Gizeh - commands stories of magic to 
be told to him.  The first of these, of which the conclusion only remains, 
is supposed to have occurred in the reign of King T'eser of the Third 
Dynasty. The next, which is complete, belongs to the reign of Nebka, a 
somewhat earlier king.  In those days it came to the ears of a great 
nobleman that his faithless wife was in the habit of meeting her lover by 
the side of a lake.  Being skilled in magic he modelled a crocodile in wax 
and ordered one of his servants to cast it into the water.  It was 
immediately transformed into a real crocodile and devoured the lover, Seven 
days later the king was walking by the lake with his friend the nobleman, 
when at the command of the latter the crocodile came to the shore and laid 
its victim at their feet.  The king shuddered at the sight of the monster 
but at the touch of its maker it became once more a mere figure of wax.  
Then the whole astonishing story was told to the king. who thereupon granted 
the crocodile per-mission to take away that which was its own.  The creature 
plunged into the depths of the lake and disappeared with the adulterer, 
while the guilty wife was burnt to death and her ashes were scattered in the 
stream.
     A tale of enchantment follows, the scene of which is laid during the 
reign of King Sneferu, the predecessor of Kheops. The king was one day 
taking his pleasure on a lake in a boat rowed by twenty beautiful maidens, 
when one of the girls dropped a malachite ornament into the water.  The king 
promised to give her another in its stead, but this did not content her, for 
she wanted her own jewel and no other.  A magician was summoned who repeated 
a spell by the might of which he piled one half of the lake on the top of 
the other, so that the water, which at first was twelve ells deep in the 
middle of the lake, now stood twenty-four ells high.  The jewel, found lying 
in the mud in the dry portion of the lake, was restored to its owner ; and 
the magician having once more mumbled his spell the water returned to its 
former place.
     When Kheops had listened for some time with much interest to the 
accounts of the strange events that had transpired in the days of his 
predecessors, then stepped forward Prince Horduduf, who is really known to 
us from the song in the tomb-temple of King Antef as renowned for his 
wisdom.  He told the king that all marvels were not things of the past but 
that even then there was living a magician named Deda, who was one hundred 
and ten years old, and consumed every day five hundred loaves, a side of 
beef, and a hundred jars of beer.
     Kheops was so much interested that he sent the prince to escort the 
magician to his presence.  Deda obeyed the royal summons and performed his 
chief feat before the King. This consisted in decapitating a goose, a duck, 
and an ox, and charming the heads back again on to the bodies so that the 
creatures lived and breathed as before.  Kheops fell into talk with the 
magician, who told him that the wife of a priest in Sakhebu was awaiting the 
birth of three sons, children of the god Ra, who should one day sit on the 
throne of Egypt.  Deda sought to allay the king's natural distress at this 
information by prophesying that only after the reigns of his son and 
grandson should the power fall into the hands of the descendants of the Sun-
god.  But Kheops was not to be consoled ; he inquired into the details of 
the story and announced that he would himself travel to Sakhebu, no doubt 
with the ultimate intention of finding an opportunity to put out of the way 
the pretenders to his throne.
     The scene of the sequel is laid in Sakhebu.  The birth and infancy of 
the three children are described in detail, and all sorts of marvellous 
incidents are represented as influencing their fate.  The gods cared for the 
safety of the little ones.  A maid to whom the secret was known being 
enraged by a severe punishment inflicted upon her, threatened to betray all 
to Kheops.  Her own brother beat her, and when she went down to the water 
she was carried off by a crocodile.  Here the papyrus ceases, but it is 
possible to a certain extent to restore the conclusion. The names of the 
three children of Ra show that they stand for the first three kings of the 
Fifth Dynasty, the family that followed the house of Kheops.  The papyrus 
must therefore have told how the boys escaped all the snares laid for their 
lives and in due time ascended the throne for which they were destined."

Whistling : It is considered unlucky for sailors to whistle aboard ship.  
This is of the nature of sympathetic magic, as it might possibly raise a 
whistling wind.

Wild-Women:	A species of nature spirits believed in by the German 
peasantry.  Says Keightley concerning them:
     "The Wilde Frauen or Wild-women of Germany bear a very strong 
resemblance to the Elle-maids of Scandinavia. Like them they are beautiful, 
have fine flowing hair, live within hills, and only appear singly or in the 
society of each other.  They partake of the piety of character we find among 
the German Dwarfs.
     “The celebrated Wunderberg, or Wunderberg, on the great moor near 
Salzburg, is the chief haunt of the Wild-women.  The Wunderberg is said to 
be quite hollow, and supplied with stately palaces, churches, monasteries, 
gardens, and springs of gold and silver.  Its inhabitants, besides the Wild-
women, are little men, who have charge of the treasures it contains, and who 
at midnight repair to Salzburg to perform their devotions in the cathedral; 
giants, who used to come to the church of Grodich and exhort the people to 
lead a godly and pious life ; and the great emperor Charles V., with golden 
crown and sceptre, attended by knights and lords.  His grey beard has twice 
encompassed the table at which he sits, and when it has the third time grown 
round it, the end of the world and the appearance of the Antichrist will 
take place.
The following is the only account we have of the Wild-women.
     "The inhabitants of the village of Grodich and the peasantry of the 
neighbourhood assert that frequently, about the year i753, the Wild-women 
used to come out of the Wunderburg to the boys and girls that were keeping 
the cattle near the hole within Glanegg, and give them bread to eat
     “The Wild-women used frequently to come to where the people were 
reaping.  They came down eagerly in the morning, and in the evening, when 
the people left off work, they went back into the Wunderburg without 
partaking of the supper.
     “It once fell out near this hill, that a little boy was sitting on a 
horse which his father had tethered on the headland of the field.  Then came 
the Wild-women out of the hill and wanted to take away the boy by force. But 
the father, who was well acquainted with the secrets of this hill, and what 
used to occur there, without any dread hasted up to the women and took the 
boy from them, with these words : ' What makes you presume to come so often 
out of the hill, and now to take away my child with you ?  What do you want 
to do with him ?'  The Wild-women answered      He will be better with us, 
and have better care taken of him than at home.  We shall be very fond of 
the boy, and he will meet with no injury'  But the father would not let the 
boy out of his hands, and the Wild-women went away weeping bitterly.
     “One time the Wild-women came out of the Wunderberg, near the place 
called the Kugel-mill, which is prettily situated on the side of this hill, 
and took away a boy who was keeping cattle.  This boy, whom every one knew, 
was seen about a year after by some wood-cutters, in a green dress, and 
sitting on a rock of this hill.  Next day they took his parents with them, 
intending to search the hill for him, but they all went about it to no 
purpose, for the boy never appeared any more."


Will is in theology, one of the aspects of the triplicity, of the Logos, and 
hence since the Monad is essentially a part of the Logos, it is also an 
aspect of the Monad, taken on when the latter commences his descent into 
matter by entering the Spiritual World and appearing as Spirit.


William Rufus  Son of William the Conqueror, and tyrant of England in the 
eleventh century; a wicked and cruel prince.  He was much disliked, 
particularly by the priests and monks, whom he reduced to the extremest 
poverty. One day when he was out hunting (in the year 1100, the forty-fourth 
year of his life, the thirtieth of his reign) he was killed by an arrow 
launched by an invisible hand. While he was drawing his last breath the 
Comte de Comon-ailles, who had been separated from the hunt, saw a shaggy 
black goat carrying off a mangled human form, pierced by an arrow.  The 
comte cried aloud to the goat to halt, and asked who he was, and where he 
was going.  The goat responded that he was the devil, and was carrying off 
William Rufus, to present him before the great tribunal, where he would be 
condemned for his tyranny and forced to accompany him (the devil) to his 
abode.


Williams, Charles: An English medium who began to practice about 1870.  In 
1871 he went into partnership with the medium Herne.  During the earlier 
years of their mediumship Mrs. Guppy, herself a well-known medium, was their 
patroness.  The phenomena then produced were not of a very ambitous 
character, but consisted of lights, apports, movements of the furniture 
without contact, spirit voices, and the appearance of fiery letters in the 
air. One of the most curious feats of these early seances was the transit of 
Mrs. Guppy.  (See Levitation.)  Soon afterwards materialisation was 
attempted by Messrs. Herne and Williams, in emulation of the feats of Miss 
Florence Cook, who had been a sitter at their early seances.  In 1878 
Williams's was the mediumship chosen for investigation by the Research 
Committee of the British National Associa-tion of Spiritualists (q.v.). 
Notwithstanding the favourable report of the Committee, Williams's 
mediumship was not destined to last much longer.  In company with a new 
partner, Rita, he had gone to Amsterdam, and there were found in their 
possession false beards, spirit draperies, and phosphorised oil.  The 
exposure was entirely carried out and given to the public by indignant 
spiritualists.


Willow-tree  The Willow, as might be expected, had many superstitious 
notions connected with it, since, according to the authorized version of the 
English Bible, the Israelites are said to have hung their harps on willow 
trees. The weeping willow is said to have, ever since the time of the Jews' 
captivity in Babylon, drooped its branches, in sympathy with this 
circumstance. The common willow was held to be under the protection of the 
devil and it was said that, if any were to cast a knot upon a young willow, 
and sit under it, and thereupon renounce his or her baptism, the devil would 
confer upon them supernatural power.


Windsor Castle : Windsor Castle is said to be the haunt of numerous  
spectres.  Queen  Elizabeth,  Henry VIII., Charles I., and some of the 
Georges have all been reputed to haunt the Castle, while Herne the Hunter 
(q.v.) is also said to roam the Great Park.  An officer of the Foot Guards, 
while on duty, was once sitting in the library reading in the gloaming when 
he declares he heard a rustle of silken dress, and, looking up, saw the 
ghost of Queen Elizabeth glide across the room. He buckled on his sword, and 
reported the matter. The story attracted the attention of the country for 
some weeks. Sir Richard Holmes and his assistants kept watch for many 
nights, but the ghost did not re-appear.  Not long ago a housemaid in St. 
John's Tower thought she saw a ghost, and was so frightened that she became 
ill, and had to be sent home. In 1908 a sentry discharged five rounds of 
ball cartridge at a figure which he declared was a spectre which appeared on 
the terrace.


Winged Disk : (See Horbehutet.)


Wirdig's Magnetic Sympathy: The doctrine of magnetic attraction and 
repugnance formulated by Tenzel Wirdig, professor at Rostock, who published 
his Tenzelius Wirdig, Nova medicina spirituum in 1673.  Wirdig believed that 
everything in the universe possessed a soul, and that the earth itself was 
merely a larger animal.  Between the souls of things in accordance with each 
other there was a magnetic sympathy and a perpetual antipathy between those 
of an uncongenial nature.  To this sympathy and antipathy Wirdig gave the 
name of magnetism.  He says:
“Out of this relationship of sympathy and antipathy arises a constant 
movement in the whole world, and in all its parts, and an uninterrupted 
communion between heaven and earth, which produces universal harmony.  The 
stars whose emanations consist merely of fire and spirits, have an 
undeniable influence on earthly bodies; and their influence on man 
demonstrates itself by life, movement, and warmth, those things without 
which he cannot live. The influence of tile stars is the strongest at birth.  
The new-born child inhales this influence, and on whose first breath 
frequently his whole constitution depends, nay, even his whole life."


Wisconsin Phalanx : A spiritualistic community founded by Warren Chase in 
1844.  Chase had settled in Southport, Wisconsin, in 1838, and there, with 
his wife and child, he lived for a time in the deepest poverty.  At length, 
however, their circumstances brightened, and Chase attained to a position of 
civic honour in Southport.  Meanwhile he had studied mesmerism and socialism 
with the aid of a few periodicals-Laroy Sunderland's Magnet and the New York 
Tribune-and was filled with the idea of founding a community where his 
ideals of social order and harmony might be carried out. With the aid of his 
friends such a community was formed, each member with a share of twenty-five 
dollars.  The chosen settlement-near the town of Ripon-was christened 
Ceresco, in honour of Ceres. For six years the Wisconsin Phalanx flourished, 
having as its leader and ruling spirit Warren Chase himself.  But at last 
dissensions arose, and in 1850 it was dissolved, When its affairs were wound 
up it was found that a con-siderable profit fell to the share of its 
members.  In all, it was one of the most successful spiritualistic or 
socialistic communities of the time.


Wisdom Religion : (See Theosophy.)


Witchcraft: (From Saxen Wicca, a contraction of witega. a prophet or 
sorcerer.)  The cult of persons who, by means of satanic assistance or the 
aid of evil spirits or familiars, are enabled to practise minor black magic.  
But the difference between the sorcerer and the witch is that the former has 
sold his soul to Satan for complete dominion over him for a stated period, 
whereas the witch usually appears as the devoted and often badly treated 
servant of the diabolic power.  But she is often mistress of a familiar, her 
bounden slave, and among certain savage peoples her occult powers are self-
evolved. The concept of witchcraft was perhaps brought into being by the 
mythic influence of conquered races.  It closely resembles in ritual and 
practice the demonism of savage races, from which it probably sprang.  (See 
Devil Worship.)  That is, the non-Aryan peoples of Europe who preceded the 
Aryan population,. carrying on the practice and traditions of their 
religions more or less in secret, awoke in the Aryan mind the idea that such 
practices were of a " magical" character. This idea they would not fail to 
assist, and would probably exaggerate such details as most strongly 
impressed the Aryan mind, to which their gods would appear as" devils," and 
their religious ritual as sorcery.  This view has been combatted on the 
ground that the gap betwixt, say, the extinction of the pre-Aryan religion 
known as Druidism and the first notices of witchcraft, is too great to 
bridge. But Druidism continued to exist long after it was officially 
extinct, and British witchcraft is its lineal successor. The theory is 
further advanced that on the failure of the non-Aryan priesthood novices 
would be adopted from the invading race for the purpose of carrying on the 
old religion.. It seems to the present writer that the circumstance that the 
greater number of the upholders of this ancient tradition were women points 
to the likelihood of an early custom of the adoption or marriage of Aryan 
women by a non-Aryan people who would prefer to recruit their novices and 
devotees from the more plastic sex, naturally distrusting the masculine 
portion of an alien people to fall in with their religious ideas, and that 
the almost exclusive employ-ment of women in the cult (in Britain, at least) 
originated in this practice.  Then individually all claimed to have been 
initiated.  Says Gomme, " I am inclined to lay great stress upon the act of 
initiation.  It emphasises the idea of a caste distinct from the general 
populace, and it postu-lates the existence of this caste anterior to the 
time when those who practice their supposed powers first come into notice.  
Carrying back this act of initiation age after age, as the dismal records of 
witchcraft enable us to do for some centuries, it is clear that the people 
from time to time thus introduced into the witch caste carried on the 
practices and assumed the functions of the caste even though they came to it 
as novices and strangers.  We thus arrive at an artificial means of descent 
of a peculiar group of superstition, and it might be termed initiatory 
descent." This concept, thinks Gomme (Folklore as an Historical Science, 
p.20! at seq.) was influenced in the Middle Ages by another.
     "Traditional practices, traditional formulae, and traditional beliefs 
are no doubt the elements of witchcraft, but it was not the force of 
tradition which produced the miserable doings of the Middle Ages, and of the 
seventeenth century against witches. These were due to a psychological 
force, partly generated by the newly acquired power of the people to read 
the Bible for themselves, and so to apply the witch stories of the Jews to 
neighbours of their own who possessed powers or peculiarities which they 
could not understand, and partly generated by the carrying on of traditional 
practices by certain families or groups of persons who could only acquire 
knowledge of such practices by initiation or family teaching.  Lawyers, 
magistrates, judges, nobles and monarchs are concerned with witchcraft.  
These are not minds that have been crushed by civilisation, but minds which 
have misunderstood it or misused it."
     Sabbath.-The medieval criminal records abound in descriptions of a 
ceremony at which the rites of the witch cult were periodically celebrated.  
This was the witches' Sabbath. The Sabbath was generally held in some wild 
and solitary spot, often in the midst of forests or on the heights of 
mountains, at a great distance from the residence of most of the visitors.  
The circumstance connected with it most difficult of proof was the method of 
transport from one place to another.  The witches nearly all agreed in the 
statement that they divested themselves of their clothes and anointed their 
bodies with an ointment made for that especial purpose.  They then strode 
across a stick, or any similar article, and, muttering a charm, were carried 
through the air to the place of meeting in an incred-ibly short space of 
time.  Sometimes the stick was to be anointed as well as their persons.  
They generally left the house by the window or by the chimney, which perhaps 
suggests survival of the custom of an earth-dwelling people.  Sometimes the 
witch went out by the door, and there found a demon in the shape of a goat, 
or at times of some other animal, who carried her away on his back, and 
brought her home again after the meeting was dissolved.  In the confessions 
extorted from them at their trials, the witches and sorcerers bore testimony 
to the truth of all these particulars; but those who judged them, and who 
wrote upon the subject, asserted that they bad many other independent proofs 
in corroboration.
     We are told by Bodin that a man who lived at the little town of Loches 
having observed that his wife frequently absented herself from the house in 
the night, became suspicious of her conduct, and at last by his threats 
obliged her to confess that she was a witch, and that she attended the 
Sabbaths.  To appease the anger of her husband, she agreed to gratify his 
curiosity by taking him with her to the next meeting, but she warned him on 
no account whatever to allow the name of God or of the Saviour to cross his 
lips.  At the appointed time they stripped and anointed themselves, and, 
after uttering the necessary formula, they were suddenly transported to the 
landes of Bordeaux, at an immense distance from their own dwelling. The 
husband there found himself in the midst of a great assembly of both sexes 
in the same state of deshabille as himself and his wife, and in one part he 
saw the devil in a hideous form ; but in the first moment of his surprise he 
inadvertently uttered the exclamation, " Mon Dieu! ou sommes-nous ? " and 
all disappeared as suddenly from his view, leaving him cold and naked in the 
middle of the fields, where he wandered till morning, when the country-men 
coming to their daily occupations told him where he was, and he made his way 
home in the best manner he could.  But he lost no time in denouncing his 
wife, who was brought to her trial, confessed, and was burnt.
     As the witches generally went from their beds at night to the meetings, 
leaving their husbands and family behind them, it may seem extraordinary 
that their absence was not
more frequently perceived. They had, however, a method of providing against 
this danger, by casting a drowsiness over those who might be witnesses, and 
by placing in their bed an image which, to all outward appearance, bore an 
exact resemblance to themselves, although in reality was nothing more than a 
besom or some other similar article.  But the belief was so inculcated that 
the witches did not always go in body to the Sabbath-that they were present 
only in spirit, whilst their body remained in bed, Some of the more rational 
writers on witchcraft taught that this was the only manner in which they 
were ever carried to the Sabbaths, and various instances are deposed to 
where that was manifestly the case. The president, Touretta told Bodin that 
he had examined a witch, who was subsequently burnt in the Dauphine, and who 
was carried to the Sabbath in this manner.  Her master one night found her 
stretched on the floor before the fire in a state of insensibility and 
imagined her to be dead.  In his attempt to arouse her, he first beat her 
body with great severity, and then applied fire to the more sensitive parts, 
which being without effect, he left her in the belief that she had died 
suddenly.  His astonishment was great when in the morning he found her in 
her own bed, in an evident state of great suffering. When he asked what 
ailed her, her only answer was," Ha!  mon maistre, tant m'avez batue!”
     When further pressed, however, she confessed that during the time her 
body lay in a state of insensibility, she had been herself to the witches' 
Sabbath, and upon this avowal she was committed to prison.  Bodin further 
informs us that at Bordeaux, in 1571, an old woman, who was con-demned to 
the fire for witchcraft, and confessed that she was transported to the 
Sabbath in this manner.  One of her judges, who was personally known to 
Bodin, while she was under examination, pressed her to show him how she was 
effected, and released her from the fetters for that purpose. She rubbed 
herself in different parts of the body with " a certain grease," and 
immediately became stiff and insensible and, to all appearance, dead.  She 
remained in this state about five hours, and then as quickly revived, and 
told her inquisitors a great number of extraordinary things, which showed 
that she must have been spiritually transported to far distant places.
     The description of the Sabbath given by the witches differed only in 
slight particulars of detail  for their examinations were all carried on 
upon one model and measure-a veritable bed of Procrustes, and equally fatal 
to those who were placed upon it.  The Sabbath was, in general, an immense 
assemblage of witches and demons, sometimes from distant parts of the earth, 
at others only from the province or district in which it was held.  On 
arriving, the visitors performed their homage to the evil one with unseemly 
ceremonies, and presented their new converts.  They then gave an account of 
all the mischief they had done since the last meeting.  Those who had 
neglected to do evil, or who had so far overlooked them-selves as to do 
good, were treated with disdain, or severely punished.  Several of the 
victims of the French courts in the latter part of this century confessed 
that, having been unwilling or unable to fulfil the commands of the evil 
one, when they appeared at the Sabbath he had beaten them in the most cruel 
manner.  He took one woman, who had refused to bewitch her neighbour's 
daughter, and threatened to drown her in the Moselle. Others were plagued in 
their bodies, or by destruction of their property.  Some were punished for 
their irregular attendance at the Sabbath ; and one or two, for slighter 
offences, were condemned to walk home from the Sabbath instead of being 
carried through the air. Those, on the other hand, who had exerted most 
their mischievous propensities were highly honoured at the Sabbath, and 
often rewarded with gifts of money.  After this examination was passed, the 
demon distributed among his worshippers unguents, powders, and other 
articles for the perpetration of evil. A French witch, executed in 1580, 
confessed that some of her companions offered a sheep or a heifer; and 
another, executed the following year, stated that animals of a black colour 
were most acceptable.  A third, executed at Gerbe-ville in 1585 declared 
that no one was exempt from this offering, and that the poorer sort offered 
a hen or a chicken, and some even a lock of their hair, a little bird, or 
any trifle, they could put their hands upon.  Severe punish-ments followed 
the neglect of this ceremony.  In many instances, according to the 
confessions of the witches, besides their direct worship of the devil, they 
were obliged to show their abhorrence of the faith they had deserted by 
trampling on the cross, and blaspheming the saints, and by other 
profanations.
     Before the termination of the meeting, the new witches received their 
familiars, or imps, who they generally addressed as their " little masters," 
although they were bound to attend at the bidding of the witches, and 
execute their desires.  These received names, generally of a popular 
character, such as were given to cats, and dogs, and other pet animals and 
the similarity these names bear to each other in different countries is very 
remarkable.
     After all these preliminary ceremonies had been transacted, and a great 
banquet was laid out, and the whole company fell to eating and drinking and 
making merry. At times, every article of luxury was placed before them, and 
they feasted in the most sumptuous manner.  Often, however, the meats served 
on the table were nothing but toads and rats, and other articles of a 
revolting nature. In general they had no salt, and seldom bread.  But, even 
when best served, the money and the victuals fur-nished by the demons were 
of the most unsatisfactory character; a circumstance of which no rational 
explanation is given. The coin when brought forth by open daylight, was 
generally found to be nothing better than dried leaves or bits of dirt ; 
and, however, greedily they may have eaten at the table, they commonly left 
the meeting in a state of exhaustion from hunger.
     The tables were next removed, and feasting gave way to wild and 
uproarious dancing and revelry. The common dance, or carole, of the middle 
ages appears to have been performed by the persons taking each other's hand 
in a circle, alternately a man and a woman. This, probably the ordinary 
dance among the peasantry, was the one generally practised at the Sabbaths 
of the witches, with this peculiar-ity, that their backs instead of their 
faces were turned inwards.  The old writers endeavour to account for this, 
by supposing that it was designed to prevent them from seeing and 
recognising each other.  But this, it is clear, was not the only dance of 
the Sabbath; perhaps more fashionable ones were introduced for witches in 
better conditions in society; and moralists of the succeeding age 
maliciously insinuate that many dances of a not very decorous character 
invented by the devil himself to heat the imaginations of his victims, had 
subsequently been adopted in classes in society who did not frequent the 
Sabbath.  It may be observed, as a curious circumstance that the modern 
waltz is first traced among the meetings of the witches and their imps  It 
was also confessed, in almost every case, that the dances at the Sabbaths 
produced much greater fatigue than commonly arose from such exercises.  Many 
of the witches declared that, on their return home, they were usually unable 
to rise from their bed for two or three days.
     Their music, also, was by no means of an ordinary character, The songs 
were generally obscene, or vulgar, or ridiculous.  Of instruments there was 
considerable variety, but all partaking of the burlesque character of the 
proceedings. "Some played the flute upon a stick or bone; another was seen 
striking a horse's skull for a lyre; there you saw them beating the drum on 
the trunk of an oak, with a stick ;  here, others were blowing trumpets with 
the branches.  The louder the instrument, the greater satis-faction it gave; 
and the dancing became wilder and wilder, until it merged into a vast scene 
of confusion, and ended in scenes over which, though minutely described in 
the old treatises on demonology, it will be better to throw a veil." The 
witches separated in time to reach their homes before cock-crow.
     We then see that Satan had taken the place of the deities of the older 
and abandoned cults of the non-Aryans, whose obscene rites were attended by 
" initiated " or "adopted" neophytes of a race to the generality of which 
they were abominable, that witches often worked by means of familiars, whose 
shapes they were able to take, or by means of direct satanic agency.  But 
there were probably mythological elements in witchcraft as well.
     Powers of Witches -In the eyes of the populace the powers of witches 
were numerous.  The most peculiar of these were  The ability to blight by 
means of the evil eye (q.v.) the sale of winds to sailors, power over 
animals, and capacity to transform themselves into animal shapes. Thus, says 
Gomme-" The most usual transformations are into cats and hares, and less 
frequently into red deer, and these have taken the place of wolves. Thus, 
cat-transformations are found in Yorkshire, hare-transforma-tions in 
Devonshire, Yorkshire and Wales, and Scotland, deer-transformations in 
Cumberland, raven-transformations in Scotland, cattle-transformations in 
Ireland.  Indeed the connection between witches and the lower animals is a 
very close one, and hardly anywhere in Europe does it occur that this 
connection is relegated to a subordinate place.  Story after story, custom 
after custom is recorded appertaining to witchcraft, and animal 
transformation appears always.
     Witches also possessed the power of making themselves invisible, by 
means of a magic ointment supplied to them by the devil, and of harming 
others by thrusting nails into a waxen image representing them.
     Witchcraft among Savage People.-Witchcraft among savage people is, of 
course, allied to the various cults of demonism in vogue among barbarian 
folk all over the world.  These are indicated in the various articles 
dealing with uncultured races.  The name witchcraft is merely a convenient 
English label for such savage demon-cults, as is " witch-doctors " applied 
to those who  smell out these practitioners of evil.
     Evidence for Witchcraft.-The evidence for witchcraft, says Podmore 
(Modern Spiritualism) falls under four main heads  (a) the confessions of 
witches themselves ; (b) the corroborative evidence of lycanthropy, 
apparitions, etc. ; (c) the witch-marks ; (d) the evidence of the evil 
effects produced upon the supposed victims.
     “(a)-The confessions, as is notorious, were for the most part extracted 
by torture, or by lying promises of release. In England, where torture was 
not countenanced by the law, the ingenuity of Matthew Hopkins and other pro-
fessional witch-finders could generally devise some equally efficient 
substitute, such as gradual starvation, enforced sleeplessness, or the 
maintenance for hours of a constrained and painful posture.  But apart from 
these extorted con-fessions, there is evidence that in some cases the 
accused persons were actually driven by the accumulation of testimony 
against them, by the pressure of public opinion, and the singular 
circumstances in which they were placed, to believe and confess that they 
were witches indeed. Some of the women in Salem who had pleaded guilty to 
witchcraft explained afterwards, when the persecution had died down and they 
were released, that they had been consternated and affrighted even out of 
their reasons to confess that of which they were innocent.  And there were 
not a few persons who voluntarily confessed to the practice of witchcraft, 
nocturnal rides, compacts with the devil, and all the rest of it."  The most 
striking instances of this voluntary confession are afforded by children.  
For even among the earlier writers on witchcraft the opinion was not 
uncommonly held that the nocturnal rides and banquets with the devil were 
merely delusions, thought the guilt of the witch was not lessened thereby.  
And in the sixteenth centuries, at least in English-speaking countries this 
belief seems to have been generally alike by believers in witchcraft and 
their opponents.  Thus Gaule: " But the more prodigious or stupendous (of 
the things narrated by witches in their confessions) are effected merely by 
the devil  the witches all the while either in a rapt ecstasie, a charmed 
sleepe, or a melancholy dreame; and the witches imagination, phantasie, 
common sense, only deluded with what is now done, or pretended.  Even 
Antoinette Bourig-non, observing her scholars eat " great pieces of bread 
and butter" at breakfast, pointed out-to them that they could not have such 
good appetites if they had really fed on dainty meats at the devil's Sabbath 
the night before.
     “(b)-But if the witch's own account of her marvellous feats may be 
explained as, at best, the vague remembrance of a nightmare, it is hardly 
necessary to go beyond this explanation to account for the prodigies 
reported by others. In most cases there is no need to suppose even so much 
foundation for the marvels, since the evidence (e.g., for lycanthropy) is 
purely traditional.  And when we get accounts at first hand, they are 
commonly concerned, not with such matters as levitation, or transformation 
of hares into old women, but merely with vague shapes seen in the dusk, or 
the unexplained appearance of a black dog.  Even so the evidence comes 
almost exclusively from ignorant peasants, and is given years after the 
events."
     “(c)-The evidence for " witch-marks " does not greatly concern us.  The 
insensible patches on which Matthew Hopkins and other witch-finders relied 
may well have been genuine in some cases.  Such insensible areas are known 
to occur in hysterical subjects, and the production of insen-sibility by 
means of suggestion is a commonplace in modern times.  The supposed witches' 
teats, which the imps sucked, appear to have been found almost exclusively, 
like the imps themselves, in the English-speaking countries. Any watt, boil, 
or swelling would probably form a sufficient warrant for the accusation ; we 
read in Cotton Mather of a jury of women finding I preter-natural teat upon 
a witch's body, which could not be discovered when a second search was made 
three or four hours later, and of a witch's mark upon the finger of a small 
child, which took the form of" a deep red spot, about the bigness of a flea-
bite." And the witch-mark which brought conviction to the mind of Increase 
Mather in the case of George Burroughs was his ability to hold a heavy gun 
at arm's length, and to carry a barrel of cider from the canoe to the 
shore."
     “(d)-Of most of the evidence based upon the injuries suffered by the 
witches' supposed victims, it is difficult to speak seriously.  If a man's 
cow ran dry, if his horse stumbled, his cart stuck in a gate, his pigs or 
fowls sickened, if his child had a fit, his wife or himself an unaccustomed 
pain, it was evidence acceptable in a court of law against any old woman who 
might be supposed within the last twelve months-or twelve years-to have 
conceived some cause of offence against him and his.  Follies of this kind 
are too well known to need repetition.
But there is another feature of witchcraft, at any rate of the cases 
occurring in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries in England and America, 
which is not so well recognised, and which has a more direct bearing upon 
our present inquiry-the predominant part played in the initial stages of 
witch persecution by malevolent or merely hysterical children and young 
women."
     Symptoms of Bewitchment. -Mr. Pod more remarks: "The symptoms of the 
alleged bewitchment were, in all these cases monotonously alike.  The 
victims would fall into fits or convulsions, of a kind which the physicians 
called in were unable to diagnose or to cure.  In these fits the children 
would commonly call out on the old woman who was the imaginary cause of 
their ailment; would profess, at times, to see her shape present in the 
room, and would even stab at it with a knife or other weapon.  (In the most 
conclusive cases the record continues that the old woman, being straightway 
sought for, would be found attempting to conceal a corresponding wound on 
her person.)  These fits, which sometimes lasted, with slight intermission, 
for weeks together would be increased in violence by the approach of the 
supposed witch; or, as Hutchinson notes, by the presence of sympathetic 
specta-tors.  The fits, as was also commonly noted by contem-porary 
chroniclers, would diminish or altogether cease when the witch was 
imprisoned or condemned; on the other hand, if the supposed witch were 
released the victim would continue to suffer horrible tortures, insomuch 
that at the Salem trials one old woman who had been acquitted by the jury 
was, because of the hideous outcry from the afflicted persons in court, 
straightway re-tried and con-demned.  The witch's touch would always provoke 
severe attacks, indeed, contact with the witch or the establishment of 
rapport between her and the victim by means of some garment worn by the 
latter, as in Mistress Faith Corbet's case, was generally regarded as an 
essential pre-requisite of the enchantment.  Once this rapport established 
the mere look of the witch, or the direction of her evil will would suffice.  
The afflicted in Salem were, as the Mathers testify, much tortured in court 
by the malevolent glances of the poor wretches on trial ; and two ' 
visionary' girls added greatly to the weight of the evidence by foretelling 
with singular accuracy, when such or such of the afflicted persons then 
present would feel the baneful influence, and howl for anguish.  It should 
be added-though the evidence as we now understand the word, for the fact 
alleged is of course practically negligible-that it was commonly reported 
that the witch's victim could, although blind-folded, distinguish her 
tormentor by the touch alone from all other persons, and could even foresee 
her approach and discern her actions at a considerable distance.
     "The effect of the convulsions and cataleptic attacks, which modern 
science would unhesitatingly dismiss as being simply the result of hysteria, 
was heightened in many cases by manifestations of a more material kind.  It 
was a common feature for the victim to vomit pins, needles, wood, stubble, 
and other substances ; or for thorns or needles to be found embedded in her 
flesh.  In a case recorded by Glanvil an hysterical servant girl, Mary 
Longdon, in addition to the usual fits, vomiting of pins, etc., was 
tormented by stones being continually flung at her, which stones when they 
fell to the ground straightway vanished.  Her master bore witness in court 
to the falling of the stones and their miraculous disappearance.  More-over, 
the same Mary Longdon would frequently be trans-ported by an invisible power 
to the top of the house, and there " laid on a board betwixt two Sollar 
beams," or would be put into a chest, or half suffocated between two 
feather-beds.
     “Gross as these frauds appear to us, it is singular that for the most 
part they remained undetected, and even, it would seem, unsuspected, not 
merely by the ignorant peasants, for whose benefit the play was acted in the 
first instance, but in the larger theatre of a law court.  But there are 
some notorious instances of confession or detection. Edmund Robinson, the 
boy on whose accusation the Lancashire witches were tried, subsequently 
confessed to imposture.  Other youths were detected with blacklead in their 
mouths when foaming in sham epileptic fits, colouring their urine with ink, 
concealing crooked pins about their persons in order to vomit them later, 
scratch-ing the bed posts with their toes, and surreptitiously eating to 
repletion during a pretended fast.  But commonly the spectators were so 
convinced beforehand of the genuineness of such portents that they held it 
superfluous to examine the claims of any particular performance of this kind 
on their credence.
     “It is difficult to know in such cases where self-deception ends and 
where malevolent trickery begins.  Nor would the examination of these bygone 
outbreaks of hysteria trivial in themselves as terrible in their 
consequences-be of interest in the present connection, except for the fact 
that we find here the primitive form of those Poltergeist manifestations 
which gave the popular impetus in 1848 to the belief in Modern Spiritualism, 
and which are still appealed by those who maintain the genuineness of the 
physical manifestations of the seance room as instances of similar phenomena 
occurring spontaneously."
     Difference between British and Continental Witchcraft.-The salient 
difference between British and Continental witchcraft systems seems to have 
been that whereas the former was an almost exclusively female system, the 
Continental one favoured the inclusion in the ranks of sorcerers (as foreign 
witches were called) of the male element; this at least was the case in 
France and Germany, but there is evidence that in Hungary and the Slavonic 
countries, the female element was the more numerous. In Ireland we find 
women also pre-eminent; this is prob-ably to be accounted for by the 
circumstance before noted that the non-alien priesthoods in their decline 
became almost entirely dependent upon the offices of women.  But the various 
forms of witchcraft are duly entered in the several articles dealing with 
European countries.
     Growth of Belief in Witchcraft.-It is significant that in early times 
the supernatural side of witchcraft won little public credence.  People 
believed in such things as magical poisoning and the raising of tempests by 
witches. but they refused to give credence to such superstitions as that the 
witch rode through the air, or had communion in any way with diabolic 
agency.  As early as 800 A.D. an Irish synod pronounced the belief of flight 
through the air and vam-pirism, to be incompatible with Christian doctrine, 
and many early writers like Stephen of Hungary and Regino state that flight 
by night and kindred practices are merely a delusion.  Indeed those who held 
these beliefs were actively punished by penance.  In face of the later 
develop-ment of belief in witchcraft, this frank scepticism is almost 
amazing, and it is most strange that the tenth and eleventh centuries should 
have rejected superstitions embraced widely by the sixteenth and 
seventeenth.
     From the thirteenth to the fifteenth centuries we find the conception 
of witchcraft and demonology greatly furthered and assisted by the writings 
of scholars and the institu-tion of the Inquisition to deal with the rise of 
unbelief. A vast amount of literature was circulated dealing with questions 
relating to magic and sorcery, and regarding the habits and customs of 
witches, magicians and practitioners in" black magic," and many hairs were 
split.  The Church gladly joined in this campaign against what it regarded 
as the forces of darkness, and indeed both accused and accusers seem to have 
lingered under the most dreadful delusions-delusions which were to cost 
society dear as a whole. The scholastic conception of demonology was that 
the witch 'was not a woman but a demon.  Rationalism was at a discount and 
the ingenuity of medieval scholars disposed of all objections to the 
phenomena of witchcraft. The deities of pagan times were cited as 
practitioners of sorcery, and erudition, especially in- ecclesiastical 
circles, ran riot on the subject. There also arose a class of judges or 
inquisitors like Bodin in France and Sprenger in Germany, who composed 
lengthy treatises upon the manner of discovering witches, of putting them to 
the test, and generally of presiding in witchcraft trials. The cold-blooded 
cruelty of these textbooks on current demonology can only be accounted for 
by the likelihood that their authors felt themselves justified in their 
composition through motives of fidelity to their church and religion.  The 
awful terror disseminated especially among the intelligent by the 
possibility of a charge of witchcraft being brought against them at any 
moment brought about an intolerable con-dition of things.  The intellectual 
might be arraigned at any time on a charge of witchcraft by any rascal who 
cared to make it.  Position or learning were no safeguard against such a 
charge, and it is peculiar that the more thoughtful and serious part of the 
population should not have made some attempt to put a period to the dreadful 
condition of affairs brought about by ignorance and superstition.  Of course 
the principal reason against their being able to do so was the fact that the 
whole system was countenanced by the Church, in whose hands the entire 
procedure of trials for witchcraft lay.
     Strangely enough convents and monasteries were often the centres of 
demoniac possession. The conception of the incubi and succubi undoubtedly 
arose from the ascetic tortures of the monk and the nun. Wholesale trials, 
too, of wretched people who were alleged to attend Sabbatic orgies of the 
enemy of mankind on dreary heaths were gone through with an elaborateness 
which spread terror in the public mind.  The tortures inflicted on those un-
fortunates were generally of the most fiendish des-cription, but they were 
supposed to be for the good of the souls of those who bore them.  In France 
the majority of these trials took place in the fifteenth century; whereas in 
England we find that most of them were current in the seventeenth century.  
Full details regarding these will be found in the articles France and 
England.  The famous outburst of fanaticism in New England under Cotton 
Mather (See America) in 1691 to 1692 was by no means the last in an English-
speaking country, for in 1712 a woman was convicted of witchcraft in 
England, and in Scotland the last trial and execution for sorcery took place 
in 1722.  In Spain we find burnings by the Inquisition in 1781 ; in Germany 
as late as 1793, and as regards Latin South America a woman was burned in 
Peru so recently as i888.  The death of the belief in witchcraft was brought 
about by a more sane spirit of criticism than had before obtained.  Even the 
dull wits of the inquisitorial and other courts began to see that the 
wretched creatures upon whom they passed sentence either confessed because 
of the extremity of torture they had to suffer, or else were. under 
hallucination regarding the nature of their connection to the satanic power.  
Reginald Scot in his Discover; of Witchcraft (1584) proved that the belief 
on the part of the witch that she was a servant of the Devil was purely 
imaginary, and in consequence drew upon his work the wrath of the British 
Solomon, James I., who warmly replied to him in his Demonologie.  But 
Friedrich von Spee's Cautio Criminalis, 1631, advanced considerations of 
still greater weight from the rationalistic point of view-considerations of 
such weight indeed that Bodin, the arch-demonologist, denounced him and 
demanded that he should be added to the long list of his victims.
     Psychology of Witchcraft.-No doubt exists nowadays when the conditions 
of savage witchcraft have been closely examined and commented upon, that the 
witch and the sorcerer of the Middle Ages, like their prototypes among the 
native races of Africa, America, Asia and elsewhere, have a firmly-rooted 
belief in their own magical powers, and in their connection with unseen and 
generally diabolic agencies.  It is a strange circumstance that in many 
instances the confessions wrung from two or more witches, when a number of 
them have been concerned in the same case, have tallied with one another in 
almost every detail. This would imply that these women suffered from 
collective hallucination, and actually believed that they had seen the 
supernatural beings with whom they confessed fellow-ship, and had gone 
through the rites and acts for which they suffered.  A period arrived in the 
medieval campaign against witchcraft when it was admitted that the whole 
sys-tem was one of hallucination; yet, said the demonologists, this was no 
palliation of the offence, for it was equally as evil to imagine such 
diabolic acts as actually to take part in them.
     There is also evidence which would lead to the belief that the witch 
possessed certain minor powers of hypnotism and telepathy, which would give 
her real confidence in her belief that she wielded magical terrors.  Again 
the phen-omena of spiritualism and the large possibilities it offers for 
fraud suggest that some kindred system might have been in use amongst the 
more shrewd or the leaders in these Sabbatic meetings, which would 
thoroughly con-vince the ignorant among the sisterhood of the existence in 
their midst of diabolic powers.  Trance and hysteria, drugs and salves, 
there is good reason to believe, were also used unsparingly, but the' great 
source of witch-belief undoubtedly exists in auto-suggestion, fostered and 
fomented from ecclesiastical and scholastic sources, and by no means 
lessened by popular belief.
     Since the above article was written an exhaustive examination of the 
phenomena of witchcraft has been made by Miss M. A. Murray, lecturer on 
Egyptology at University College, London,  Basing her conclusions upon the 
sug-gestions of C. G. Leland, in his "Aradia, or the Witches of Italy," and 
those of other modern writers, she inclines to the hypothesis that 
witchcraft was in reality the modern and degraded descendant of an ancient 
nature-religion, the rites of which were actually carried out in deserted 
places and included child-sacrifice and other barbarous customs. In the 
Satanic presence at such gatherings she sees the attendance of a priest of 
the cult.  In brief, her hypothesis tends to prove the actual reality of the 
witch-religion as against that of hallucination which, until recently, was 
the explanation accepted by students of the subject.  Her remarks, too, upon 
the familiar, go to show that a large body of proof exists for the belief 
that this conception also rested upon actual occurrences.  (See her papers 
in Man and elsewhere.)
     Recent researches on the part of the writer have con-vinced him of the 
soundness of these views, but have added the conviction that witchcraft 
religion was, in some manner, possessed of an equestrian connection, the 
precise nature of which is still dark to him.  The broomstick appears to be 
the magical equivalent of a horse, the witches occasionally rode to the 
Sabbath on horseback, and one of the tests for a witch was to see if her eye 
held the reflection or like-ness of a horse.  May it not be that the witch-
religion was the remnant of a prehistoric horse-totem cult ?  But this is, 
after all, merely of the nature of surmise.  The writer has also found good 
evidence for the existence of a witch-cult precisely similar to that of 
Europe in pre-Columbian Mexico, and has even encountered a picture of a 
naked witch with peaked cap riding on a broomstick in the native Mexican 
painting known as the Codex Fejervary--Mayer, which seems to show that the 
witch-religion was in no sense limited to Europe, and was of most ancient 
origin.


Wolf, The : Amongst the ancient Romans, the wolf was a fruitful source of 
augury, and many are the tales in which he has figured as a good or evil 
omen.  A wolf running to the right with his mouth full was a sign of great 
joy.  If a wolf, after he had entered a Roman camp, escaped unhurt it was 
regarded as a sign of defeat ; and the terrible result of the second Punic 
war was said to have been augured from the carrying off of the sword of a 
sentinel in the camp by a waif.  Plutarch tells of a wolf who ate the 
landmarks of a proposed new settlement at Libya and thus stopped its 
colonisation; but later another wolf which had stolen a burnt sacrifice led 
his pursuers to a place where they after-wards settled in.  It is said that 
a wolf ran off with Hiero's slate when he was a schoolboy, and this was 
regarded as a sign of his future greatness.  The peasants of Sweden do not 
dare to speak of a wolf by name but call him the " grey one" or " old grey" 
: they seem to regard the pronounc-ing of his name as unlucky.


Wonders of the Invisible World : (See America, U.S. of.)


World Period : (See Planetary Chains.)


Worlds, Planes, or Spheres :  According to theosophists, these are seven in 
number and are as follows: The older Sanskrit names, which are now 
superseded, being given for reference -Divine, or Adi; Monadic or Anutadaka, 
Spiritual or Nirvana, Intuitional or Buddhi, Mental or Manas, Astral or 
Karma, and Physical or Sthula. These worlds are not physically separate in 
the manner which planets appear to be, but interpenetrate each other, and 
they depend for their differences, on the relative density of the matter 
which composes them, and the consequent difference in the rates at which the 
matter of each world vibrates.
     Except for the physical world (the densest) our know-ledge of them, so 
far as it extends, is dependent on clair-voyance, and the more exalted the 
vision of the clairvoyant the higher the world to which his vision can 
pierce.  Each world has its appropriate inhabitants, clothed in appro-priate 
bodies, and possessing appropriate states of con-sciousness.  The two 
highest worlds, the Divine and the Monadic are at present incapable of 
attainment by human powers, the remaining five are in greater or less 
degree. The monad for the purpose of gathering experience and for 
development, finds it necessary to pass downwards into the material sphere, 
and, when it has taken possession of the spiritual, intuitional, and higher 
Mental Worlds, it may be looked on as an ego or soul embodying will, 
intuition and intellect, continuing eternally the same entity. never 
altering except by reason of increasing development, and hence being 
immortal.  These Worlds, however, do not afford sufficient scope to the 
Monad and it presses c ill farther down into matter, through the lower 
Mental, into the Astral and Physical Worlds.  The bodies with which it is 
there clothed form its personality and this personality suffers death and is 
renewed at each fresh incarnation. At the death of the physical body, the 
ego has merely cast aside a garment and thereafter continues to live in the 
next higher world, the Astral.
     At the death of the Astral body in turn, another garment is cast aside, 
the ego is clear of all appendages and as it was before its descent into 
denser matter, having returned to the Mental World, the Heaven World.  The 
ego finds itself somewhat strange to this owing to insufficient development, 
and it again descends into matter as before.  This round is completed again 
and again, and each time the ego returns with a fresh store of experience 
and knowledge, which strengthens and perfects the mental body.  When at last 
this process is complete, this body in turn is cast aside and the ego is 
clothed with its casual body.  Again it finds itself strange and the round 
of descents into matters again begins and continues till the casual body has 
been fully developed. The two remaining worlds are but imperfectly known but 
the intuitional, as it's name indicates is that where the ego's vision is 
quickened to see things as they really are, and in the Spiritual World the 
divine and the human become unified and the divine purpose is fulfilled.

Wraith: The apparition or "double" of a living person, generally supposed to 
be an omen of death. The wraith closely resembles its prototype in the 
flesh, even to details of dress.  It is believed possible for people to see 
their own wraiths, and among those who have been warned of approaching 
dissolution in this wise are numbered Queen Elizabeth, Shelley, and 
Catherine of Russia, the latter of whom, seeing her " double" seated upon 
the throne, ordered her guards to fire upon it I But wraiths of others may 
appear to one or more persons.  Lord Balcarres saw the wraith of his friend 
" Bonnie Dundee" at the moment when the latter fell at Killiecrankie, while 
Ben Jonson saw his eldest son's double when the original was dying of the 
plague.  The belief flourishes also on the continent, and in different parts 
of Britain it goes under different names, such as "waff," " swarth," " 
task," "fye," etc.  Variants of the wraiths are the Irish " fetch " (q.v.), 
and the Welsh “lledrith."  In Scotland it was formerly believed that the 
wraith of one about to die might be seen wrapped in a winding-sheet.  The 
higher the shroud reached the nearer was the approach of death.  Something 
analogous to wraith-seeing comes within the scope of modern psychical 
science, and the apparition is explained in various ways, as a projection of 
the "astral body," an emanation from the person of its living prototype, or, 
more scientifically perhaps, on a telepathic basis.  A well-known case in 
point is that of the Birkbeck Ghost, where three children witnessed the 
apparition of their mother shortly before her death. This instance, which is 
recorded in the " Proceedings" of the Psychical Research Society, is 
noteworthy because of the fact that Mrs. Birkbeck was conscious before she 
died of having spent the time with her children.

Xylomaney : Divination by means of wood, practised particularly in Slavonia.  
It is the art of reading omens from the position of small pieces of dry wood 
found in one's path.  No less certain presages of future events may be drawn 
from the arrangement of logs in the fire-place, from the manner in which 
they burn, etc.  It is perhaps the survival of this mode of divination which 
makes the good people say, when a brand is disturbed, that "they are going 
to have a visitor."



Y


Y-Kim, Book of: A Chinese mystical book attributed to the Emperor Fo-Hi, and 
ascribed to the year, 3468 B.C.  It consists of ten chapters, and is stated 
by Eliphas Levi in his History of Magic to be a complement and an appendix 
to the Kabalistic Zohar, or record of the utterances of Rabbi Simeon Ben 
Jochai. The Zohar, says Levi, explains universal equilibrium, and the Y-Kim 
is the hieroglyphic and ciphered demonstration thereof.  The key to the Y-
Kim is a pantacle known as the Trigrams of Fo-Hi.  In the Vay-Ky of Leon-
Tao-Yuen, composed in the Som dynasty (about eleventh century) it is 
recounted that the Emperor Fo-Hi was one day seated on the banks of a river, 
deep in meditation, when to him there appeared an animal having the parts of 
both a horse and a dragon. Its back was covered with scales, on each of 
which shone the mystic Trigrammic symbol.  This animal initiated the just 
and righteous Fo-Hi into universal science.  Number-ing its scales, he 
combined the Trigrams in such a manner that there arose in his mind a 
synthesis of sciences com-pared and united with one another through the 
harmonies of nature.  From this synthesis sprang the tables of the Y-Kim.  
The numbers of Fo-Hi are identical with those of the Kabala, and his 
pantacle is similar to that of Solomon.  His tables are in correspondence 
with the subject-matter of the Sephir Yetzirah and the Zohar. The whole is a 
commentary upon the Absolute which is con-cealed from the profane, concludes 
Levi, but as he had little real acquaintance with the subject, these 
analogies must be taken as of small value.

Yaksha or Jak: A species of Indian fiend or imp.  Says Mr. Crookes : " The 
Jak is the modern representative of the Yaksha, who in better times was the 
attendant of Kuvera, the god of wealth, in which duty he was assisted by the 
Guhyaka.  The character of the Yaksha is not very certain
He was called Punya-janas, "the good people," but he sometimes appears as an 
imp of evil.  In the folk-tales, it must be admitted, the Yakshas have an 
equivocal reputa-tion.  In one story the female, or Yahshini, bewilders 
travellers at night, makes horns grow on their foreheads, and finally 
devours them; in another the Yakshas have, like the Churel, feet turned the 
wrong way and squinting eyes; in a third they separate the hero from the 
heroine because he failed to make due offerings to them on his wedding day. 
On the other hand, in a fourth tale the Yakshini is des-cribed as possessed 
of heavenly beauty; she appears again when a sacrifice is made in a cemetery 
to get her into the hero's power, as a heavenly maiden beautifully adorned, 
seated in a chariot of gold surrounded by lovely girls; and lastly, a 
Brahman meets some Buddhist ascetics, performs the Uposhana vow, and would 
have become a god, had it not been that a wicked man compelled him by force 
to take food in the evening, and so he was re-born as a Guhyaha.
     “In the modern folk-lore of Kashmir, the Yaksha has turned into the 
Yech or Yach, a humorous, though power-ful, sprite in the shape of a civet 
cat of a dark colour, with a white cap on his head.  This small high cap is 
one of the marks of the Irish fairies, and the Incubones of Italy wear caps, 
' the symbols of their hidden, secret natures. The feet of the Yech are so 
small as to be almost invisible, and it squeaks in a feline way.  It can 
assume any shape, and if its white cap can be secured, it becomes the 
servant of the possessor, and the white cap makes him invisible.
     “In the Vishnu Purana we read that Vishnu created the Yaks has as 
beings emaciate with hunger, of hideous aspect, and with big beards, and 
that from their habit of crying for food they were so named.  By the 
Buddhists they were regarded as benignant spirits.  One of them acts as sort 
of chorus in the Meghaduta or ‘Cloud Messen-ger ' of Kalidasa.  Yet we read 
of the Yaka Alawaka, who, according to the Buddhist legend, used to live in 
a Banyan tree, and slay any one who approached it; while in Ceylon they are 
represented as demons whom Buddha destroyed.  In later Hinduism they are 
generally of fair repute, and one of them was appointed by Indra to be the 
attendant of the Jaina Saint Mahavira."

Yeats, William Butler : Irish Author and Mystic.  William Butler Yeats was 
born at Dublin in 1866, his father being John Yeats, a talented portrait-
painter whose works include a fine likeness of Synge; and during his boyhood 
the future author lived chiefly at his native town, and occasionally with 
his grandparents in County Sligo.  At first he intended to make painting his 
life's work, and accordingly he entered the Dublin Art School; but he soon 
left it, having realised that his true bent was for Literature; and in 1887 
he went to London, where he became intimate with Mr. Arthur Symons, and 
subse-quently with Mr. George Moore.  Prior to this Mr. Yeats had issued a 
little play, Mosada; and now his gifts began to develop apace, the result 
being sundry volumes of beautiful poetry, notably The' Wanderings of Oisin 
and The Wind among the' Reeds.  At this time, also, the author began to show 
himself an eminently thoughtful critic of literature ; while in 1870 he 
published a collection of Irish folk tales, and in the preface thereto he 
observed in relation to his compatriots that "a true literary conscious-
ness-national to the centre-seems  gradually to be forming out of all this 
disguising and prettyfing this penumbra of half-culture.  We are preparing 
likely enough for a new Irish literary movement        Nor 'was the prophecy 
unfulfilled, for, during the closing decade of the 19th century, the 
intellectuals of Ireland began to manifest a tense interest in their 
country's legendary lore, while simultaneously it transpired that the rising 
genera-tion of writers in Ireland included many men of fine promise. Most of 
these last regarded Mr. Yeats as their leader, they rallied round him, he 
returned from London to Ireland, and anon he achieved the founding of the 
Irish Literary Theatre in Dublin, its raison d'etre being the staging of 
plays by the new school of Hibernian authors.
     This is not the place to detail the Irish artistic revival of the 
nineties of last century, and the reader may be referred to the monograph 
thereon by Mr. H. S. Krans, and more especially to Mr. George Moores' Hail 
and Farewell.  Pass-ing to speak of Mr. Yeats' contributions to the 
literature of Mysticism, these are mostly contained in a volume of collected 
essays, Ideas of Good and Evil; and prominent among them are studies of the 
mystic element in Blake and Shelley, while another notable paper is one 
concerned with "The Body of the Father Christian Rosencrux."  But still more 
important than these, perhaps, is a long study of "Magic," contained in the 
same volume, and here the author begins by bravely stating his creed  " I 
believe in the practice and philosophy of what we have agreed to call magic, 
and what I must call the evocation of spirits, though I do not know what 
they are, in the power of creating magical illusions, in the visions of 
truth in the depths of the mind when the eyes are closed      
     After this declaration he tells how once an acquaintance of his, 
gathering together a small party in a darkened room, held a mace over" a 
tablet of many coloured squares, at the same time repeating "a form of words 
" ; and straightway Mr. Yeats found that his" imagination began to move of 
itself, and to bring before me vivid images. He goes on to descant on these 
visions, while in the re-mainder of his essay he offers some details about 
super-stitions in remote parts of Ireland ; and also furnishes sundry 
examples of thought-transmission and the like, most of them fresh and 
interesting.
     But the author's interest in the supernatural does not transpire only 
in his prose, and, turning to his poems, one finds them permeated by a 
curious kind of mysticism which is perhaps essentially Celtic.  For Mr. 
Yeats, it would seem, is only incidentally interested in holding communi-
cations with the dead, or with the spirit-world ; yet, like old bards of his 
native Ireland, he seems to find inanimate nature a living reality, he seems 
to have a strange intimacy therewith.  A dreamer of dreams and a beholder of 
visions, he frequently crystalises these in his verse ; but the mystic 
element in his output consists pre-eminently in this, that he appears to 
hold actual converse with all those things which to ordinary men are no more 
than lifeless with. flowers and trees, with rivers, lakes and mountains.

Yoga, meaning " union," is applied in theosophy to assistance rendered to 
evolutionary process. The theosophical idea of evolution postulates a 
universal consciousness from which particular consciousness has come and to 
which each is returning along the path of evolution.  The journey along this 
path can be quickened by the Yoga, the union of each particular with the 
universal consciousness.  By the concentration of thought on any particular 
idea, that idea, in course of time becomes worked into the constitu-tion of 
the thinker, so that, if the thought be good he will correspondingly help on 
the process of evolution. This general principle, applied in the light of 
past experience to the multifarious activities of the human mind, is of vast 
importance and influence in the moulding of the characters both of 
individuals and communities.

Z


Zabulon : A demon who possessed a lay sister of Loudon.


Zachaire, Denis : Alchemist.  This French alchemist is chiefly remembered by 
his book, Opuscule de la Philosophie de Metaux, traitant de l'Augmentation 
et Perfection de ceux, and in the preface thereto he gives some account of 
his life, yet fails to state the precise date at which he was born. However, 
the event is commonly supposed to have taken place about Is 10; while it is 
known that Denis was a native of La Guyenne, and that his parents were com-
fortably off, if not actually rich.  As a young man he studied at Bordeaux, 
and subsequently at Toulouse, intending to become a lawyer; yet he soon 
became more interested in alchemy than in legal affairs, and in 1535, on his 
father's death putting him in possession of some money, he decided to try 
and multiply it by artificial means. Associating himself with an abbe who 
was reckoned a great adept in gold-making, Denis had soon disposed of the 
bulk of his patrimony; hut the charlatan's futile experi-ments, far from 
disillusioning him, served rather to nerve him to further endeavours, and in 
1539 he went to Paris, where he made the acquaintance of many renowned 
alchemists.  From one of them, so he declares, he imbibed the precious 
Secret ; and thereupon he hastened to the court of the King of Navarre, 
Antoine d'Albert, grandfather of Henri IV., offering to make gold if the 
requisite materials were supplied.  His majesty was deeply interested, and 
promised a reward of no less than four thousand crowns in the event of the 
researches proving fruitful ;  but Zackaire's vaunted skill failed him in 
the hour of need, and he retired discomfited to Toulouse.  Here he became 
friendly with a certain priest, who advised him strongly to renounce his 
quest, and study natural science instead; so Denis went off to Paris once 
more, intending to act in accordance with his counsel.  Ere a little while, 
neverthe-less, he was deep in alchemy again, making actual experi-ments, and 
studying closely the writings of Raymond Lully and Arnold di Villanova; 
while, according to his own account of his career, on Easter day in the year 
1550 he succeeded in converting a large quantity of quick-silver into gold. 
Then, some time after this alleged triumph, he left France to travel in 
Switzerland, and lived for a while at Lausanne; while later on he wandered 
to Ger-many, and there he died.  It is probable that his closing years were 
spent in dire poverty, but this is not recorded definitely, nor has the 
exact date of the alchemist's demise ever been ascertained
     As regards the book by Zachaire cited above, it was published 
originally at Antwerp in 1567, it was repeatedly reprinted thereafter, and 
even won the honour of being translated into Latin; while to this day, 
indeed, it is sought keenly by French philosphers with a taste for the 
curious.


Zacornu : A tree in the Mohamedan hell, which has for fruit the heads of 
devils.


Zadkiel : One of the angels in the Jewish rabbinical legend of the celestial 
hierarchies.  He is the ruler of Jupiter, and through him pass grace, 
goodness, mercy, piety, and munificence, and he bestows clemency, 
benevolence and justice on all.

Zaebos : Grand count of the infernal regions.  He appears in the shape of a 
handsome soldier mounted on a crocodile. His head is adorned with a ducal 
coronet.  He is of a gentle disposition.

Zagam : Grand king and president of the infernal regions. He appears under 
the form of a bull with the wings of a griffin.  He changes water into wine, 
blood into oil, the fool into a wise man, lead into silver, and copper into 
gold. Thirty legions obey him.


Zahuris or Zahories : French people who had travelled in Spain frequently 
had curious tales to tell concerning the Zahuris; people who were so keen-
sighted that they could see streams of water and veins of metal hidden in 
the earth, and could indicate the 'whereabouts of buried treasure and the 
bodies of murdered persons.  Explana-tions have been offered on natural 
lines.  It was said that these men knew' where water was to be found by the 
vapours arising at such spots; and that they were able to trace mines of 
gold and silver and copper by the particular herbs growing in their 
neighbourhood.  But to the Spaniard such explanations are unsatisfactory;  
they persist in believing that the Zahuris are gifted with supernatural 
faculties, that they are en rapport 'with the demons, and that, if they 
wished, they could, without any physical aid, read thoughts and discover 
secrets which were as a sealed book to the grosser senses of ordinary 
mortals.  For the rest, the Zahuris have red eyes; and in order that one 
should become a Zahuri it is necessary that he should have been born on Good 
Friday.


Zanoni, by Bulwer Lytton: (See Fiction, Occult.)


Zapan :	According to Wierius, one of the Kings of Hell.


Zedekias : Notwithstanding the credulity of the French people in the reign 
of Pepin the Short, they refused to believe in the existence of elementary 
spirits.  The Kabalist Zedekias, being minded to convince the world, 
thereupon commanded the sylphs to become visible to all men. According to 
the Abbe de Villars, the admirable creatures responded magnificently.  They 
were beheld in human form, sometimes ranged in battle, whether marching in 
good order, or under arms, or camping in superb pavilions and, again, in 
aerial navies of marvellous structure, whose flying flotillas sailed through 
the air, at the will of the Zephyrs.  But the ignorant generation to which 
they appeared failed entirely to understand the significance of the strange 
spectacle.  They believed at first that the creatures were sorcerers who had 
betaken themselves to aerial regions for the purpose of exciting storms  and 
sending down hail on the harvests. The sages and  
juris--consuls were of the popular opinion. The emperors shared the same 
idea, which became so widespread that even the wise Charlemagne, and after 
him Louis the Debonnair, imposed heavy penalties on these supposed aerial 
tyrants. (See Elementary Spirits and France.)

Zeernebooch : A dark god, monarch of the empire of the dead among the 
ancient Germans.

Zepar : Grand duke of the infernal empire, who may be identical with Vepar, 
or Separ.  Nevertheless, under the name of Zepar he has the form of a 
warrior.  He casts men into the evil passions. Twenty-eight legions obey 
him.

Ziazaa : A black and white stone; it renders its possessor litigious, and 
causes terrible visions.

Ziito : One of the most remarkable magicians of whom history has left any 
record.  He was a sorcerer at the court of King Wenceslaus of Bohemia 
(afterwards Emperor of Germany) towards the end of the fourteenth century, 
and among his more famous exploits is one chronicled by Dulsavius, bishop of 
Olmutz, in his History of Bohemia. On the occasion of the marriage of 
Wenceslaus with Sophia, daughter of the elector Palatine of Bavaria, the 
elector, knowing his son-in-law's liking for juggling and magical 
exhibitions, brought in his train a number of  morris-dancers, jugglers and 
such entertainers.  When they came forward to give their exhibition Ziito 
remained unobtrusively among the spectators.  He was not entirely unnoticed, 
however, for his remarkable appearance drew the attention of those about 
him.  His oddest feature was his mouth, which actually stretched from ear to 
ear. After watching the magicians for some time in silence, Ziito appeared 
to become exasperated at the halting way in which the tricks were carried 
through, and going up to the principal magician he taunted him with 
incompetency. The rival professor hotly defended his performance, and a 
discussion ensued which was ended at last by Ziito swallowing his opponent, 
just as he stood, leaving only his shoes, which he said were dirty and unfit 
for consumption.  After this extraordinary feat, he retired for a little 
while to a closet, from which he shortly emerged, leading the rival magician 
by the hand. He then gave a performance of his own which put the former 
exhibition entirely in the shade.  He changed himself into many divers 
shapes, taking the form of first one person and then another, none of whom 
bore any resemblance either to himself or to each other.  In a car drawn by 
barn-door fowls he kept pace with the King's carriage. When the guests were 
assembled at dinner, he played a multitude of elfish tricks on them, to 
their amuse-ment or annoyance, as the case might be.  Indeed, he was at all 
times an exceedingly mischievous creature as is shown by another story told 
of him.  Feigning to be in want of money, and apparently casting about 
anxiously for the means of obtaining some, he at length took a handful of 
corn, and made it look like thirty fat hogs. These he took to Michael, a 
rich but very mean dealer.  The latter purchased them after some haggling, 
but 'was warned not to let them drink at the river.  But the warning was 
disre-garded, and the hogs turned into grains of corn. The enraged dealer 
went in search of Ziito, whom he found at last in a vintner's shop.  In vain 
Michael shouted and stamped, the magician took no notice, but seemed to be 
in a fit of abstraction. The dealer, beside himself, seized Ziito's foot and 
pulled it as hard as he could. To his dismay, the foot and leg came right 
off, while Ziito screamed lustily, and hauled Michael before the judge, 
where the two presented their complaints. What the decision was, history 
does not relate, but it is unlikely that the ingenious Ziito came off worse.


Zizis : The name which the modern Jews give to their phylacteries.


Zlokobinca : (Evil-meter.)  Slavonic name for a witch.  (See Slavs.)


Zoaphite : According to the Journal des Voyage's of Jean Struys, a species 
of Cucumber which feeds on neighbouring plants.  Its fruit has the form of a 
lamb, with the head, feet, and tail of that animal distinctly apparent, 
whence it is called, in the language of the country, Canaret, or Conarer, 
signifying a lamb.  Its skin is covered with a white down as delicate as 
silk. The Tartars think a great deal of it and most of them keep it 
carefully in their houses, where the author of the Journal des Voyages saw 
it several times.  It grows on a stalk about three feet in height, to which 
it is attached by a sort of tendril.  On this tendril it can move about, and 
turn and bend towards the herbs on which it feeds, and without which it soon 
drys up and withers. Wolves love it, and devour it with avidity, because it 
tastes like the flesh of lamb. The author adds that he has been assured that 
it has bones, flesh, and blood, whence it is also known in its native 
country as Zoaphite, or animal plant.
