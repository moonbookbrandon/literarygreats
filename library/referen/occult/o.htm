<P>Oak Apples : </B>As diviners. It is said that if one wishes to discover 
whether a child be bewitched, one may do so by following this procedure drop 
three <I>oak apples </I>into a basin of water under the child's cradle, at the 
same time preserving the strictest silence; if they float the child is not 
fascinated, but if they sink it is.</P><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Oak Tree : </B>The <I>oak, </I>from time immemorial, has held a high place as 
a sacred tree. The Druids worshipped the <I>oak, </I>and performed many of their 
rites under the shadow of its branches. When Augustine preached Christianity to 
the ancient Britons, he stood under an <I>oak tree. </I>The ancient Hebrews 
evidently held the <I>oak </I>as a sacred tree. There is a tradition that 
Abraham received his heavenly visitors under an <I>oak. </I>Rebekah's nurse was 
buried under an <I>oak, </I>called afterwards the <I>oak </I>of weeping. Jacob 
buried the idols of Shechem under an <I>oak. </I>It was under the <I>oak </I>of 
Ophra, Gideon saw the angel sitting. who gave him instructions as to what he was 
to do to free Israel. When Joshua and Israel made a covenant to serve God, a 
great stone was set up in evidence under an <I>oak </I>that was by the sanctuary 
of the Lord. The prophet sent to prophesy against Jeroboam was found at Bethel 
sitting under an oak. Saul and his sons were buried under an oak, and, according 
to Isaiah, idols were made of <I>oak </I>wood. Abimelech was made king by the 
<I>oak </I>that was in Shechem. During the eighteenth century its influence in 
curing diseases was believed in. The toothache could be cured by boring with a 
nail the tooth or gum till blood came, and then driving the nail into an <I>oak 
tree. </I>A child with rupture could be cured by splitting an <I>oak </I>branch, 
and passing the child through the opening backwards three times; if the splits 
grew together afterwards, the child would be cured.</P><B>

<P>Obercit, Johnan Hermann</B> <B>:</B> Swiss Mystic and Alchemist, 
<B>1725</B>-<B>1798</B>. Born in <B>1725 </B>at Arbon, in Switzerland, <I>Johann 
Obercit </I>was the son of a scientist keenly interested in Hermetic philosophy, 
and no doubt the boy's own taste therefore developed the more speedily on 
account of the parental predilection. Very soon <I>Johann </I>became determined 
to discover the philosopher's stone, hoping thereby to resuscitate the fortunes 
of his family, which he found at a low ebb, presumably because the elder Obercit 
had expended large sums on his alchemistic pursuits; and the young man worked 
strenuously to gain his ends, maintaining all along that whoso would triumph in 
this endeavour must not depend on scientific skill, but rather on constant 
communion with God. Notwithstanding this pious theory of his, he soon found 
himself under the ban of the civic authorities, who came to his laboratory, and 
forced him to forego further operations, declaring that these constituted a 
danger to public health and safety. That, at least, they gave as their reason; 
but the likelihood is that, in their ignorance, they looked askance upon all 
scientific researches. <I>Obercit, </I>bitterly incensed, appears to have left 
his native place, and to have lived for some time thereafter with one Lavater, a 
brother of the noted physiognomist of that name; while it would seem that, at a 
later date, he renounced the civilised world altogether, and took up his abode 
in the lofty fastnesses of the Alps. No hermit's life did he live here, however; 
for, according to his own recital, he took to himself as bride a seraphic 
shepherdess named Theantis, with whom he dwelt peacefully during a number of 
subsequent years. Whether children were born of this union between the 
terrestrial and the ethereal is not recorded, and the alchemist's account of the 
affair reads rather like Joe Smith's tale about receiving sacred books from an 
angel on the summit of a mountain overlooking Salt Lake City; nor is there much 
to be said for two further works from <I>Obercit's </I>pen, the one entitled 
<I>Les Promenades </I>de <I>Gamaliel, juif Philosophe, </I>and the other <I>La 
Connexion Originaire des Esprits et des Corps, d'apres les Principes de Newton 
</I>(Augsburg, <B>1776</B>). Still, if our alchemist cannot be called an able 
writer, he must be hailed as a picturesque character; and it is matter for 
regret that so little is known about his life, which extended to the year 
<B>1798</B>.</P><B>

<P>Oberion : </B>A<B> </B>spirit. <I>(See </I><B>England.</B>)</P><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Obsession and Possession : </B><I>Obsession, </I>from Latin <I>obsessionem - 
obsidere, </I>to besiege, is a form of insanity caused, according to traditional 
belief, by the persistent attack of an evil spirit without, this being the 
opposite of <I>possession, </I>control by an evil spirit from within, both 
meaning however the usurpation of the individuality and control of the body by a 
foreign and discarnate entity. This belief may be found in the earliest records 
of human history, and in the magical rites and formulae of ancient religions, 
used as charms against and exorcism of these invading influences. Indian, Greek 
and Roman literature teem with instances, the Bible also furnishing many from 
the case of Saul&quot; troubled with an evil spirit&quot; only to be 
dispossessed by the music of David's harping, to the miracles of Jesus Christ 
who cast out legions of possessing spirits. Plato in his <I>Republic </I>not 
only speaks of demons of various grades, but mentions a method of treating and 
providing for those obsessed by them. Sophocles and Euripides describe the 
possessed and mention of the subject is also to be found in Herodotus, Plutarch, 
Horace, and many others of the classics. Terrible and appalling episodes in the 
Middle Ages are to be traced to the unquestioned belief in the possibility of 
<I>possession </I>and <I>obsession </I>by the Devil and his legions. All madness 
was caused thereby, was indeed the visible manifestation of the Evil One, only 
to be exorcised by charms, averted by the observance of sacred rites, or later, 
to be burned and destroyed bodily for the good of the tortured soul within. The 
rites of Black Magic, in all ages and places, deliberately evoke this 
<I>possession </I>by the Devil and his demons for the communication and benefit 
of the infallible knowledge it was believed they conferred and its consequent 
power and control of man and his destinies.</P>
<P>Modern science with its patient and laborious researches into human 
psychology, has given the key to this baffling mystery, showing the human mind 
to be an incomparably delicate instrument, peculiarly at the mercy of the 
perceptions of the senses and their multitudinous impressions on the brain, its 
balance so easily shaken by a shock, a drug, a momentary excitement, oftener by 
prolonged and intense concentration upon single groups of ideas. It is to be 
noted that in the hallucinatory epidemics of all ages and countries there is to 
be found this unvarying characteristic: they are connected with some dominant 
cause, train of thought or religious sentiment prevalent at the time. In the 
Middle Ages when there flourished an intense belief in the positive apparitions 
of angels, saints and devils, the people's imagination was dominated and 
rendered intensely dramatic thereby. The transmigration of the human soul into 
animals was another popular belief and to this again can be traced the terrible 
superstition of Lycanthropy (q.v.) which possessed large numbers of people in 
France and Germany in the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries. The Flagellant 
mania took its rise at Perouse in the thirteenth century, caused by the panic 
attendant upon an outbreak of plague. These people maintained that there was no 
remission of sins without flagellation. This they preached with fanatical 
fervour and bands of them, gathering adherents everywhere, roamed through city 
and country, clad in scanty clothing on which were depicted skeletons and with 
frenzied movements publicly lashed themselves. It was to these exhibitions, the 
name of the&quot; Dance of Death&quot; was first applied. The Dancing mania, 
accompanied by aberration of mind and maniacal distortions of the body was very 
prevalent in Germany in the fourteenth century, and in the sixteenth century in 
Italy where it was termed &quot;Tarantism&quot; and as a variant in source, was 
ascribed to the bite of the Tarantula spider. The music and songs employed for 
the cure are still preserved. Edmund Parrish in his work <I>Hallucinations and 
Illusions </I>makes the following observations on this subject:</P>
<P>&quot;If not reckoned as true chorea, the epidemic of dancing which raged in 
Germany and the Netherlands in the Middle Ages comes under this head. Appearing 
in Aix it spread in a few months to Liege, Utrecht and the neighbouring towns, 
visited Metz, Cologne and Strasburg (<B>1418</B>) and after lingering into the 
sixteenth century gradually died out. This malady consisted in convulsions, 
contortions accompanying the dancing, hallucinations and so forth. The attack 
could be checked by bandaging the abdomen as well as by kicks and blows on that 
part of the body. Music had a great influence on the dancers, and for this 
reason it was played in the streets in order that the attacks might by this 
means reach a crisis and disappear the sooner. Quite trifling circumstances 
could bring on these seizures, the sight of pointed shoes for instance, and of 
the colour red which the dancers held in horror. In order to prevent such 
outbreaks the wearing of pointed shoes was forbidden by the authorities. During 
their dance many of the afflicted thought they waded in blood, or saw heavenly 
visions.</P>
<P>The same author remarks on other instances To this category also belongs the 
history of demoniacal <I>possession. </I>The belief of being possessed by 
spirits, frequently met with in isolated cases, appeared at certain periods in 
epidemic form. Such an epidemic broke out in Brandenburg, and in Holland and 
Italy in the sixteenth century, especially in the convents. In 
<B>1350</B>-<B>60</B> it attacked the convent of St. Brigitta, in Xanthen, a 
convent near Cologne, and others. The nuns declared that they were visited by 
the Devil, and had carnal conversation with him. These and other possessed' 
wretches were sometimes thrown into dungeons, sometimes burnt. The convent of 
the Ursulines at Aix was the scene of such a drama (<B>1609</B>-<B>11</B>) where 
two possessed nuns, tormented by all kinds of apparitions, accused a priest of 
witchcraft on which charge he was burnt to death <I>(See </I><B>Grandler, 
Urbain). </B>The famous case of the nuns of Loudun (<B>1632</B>-<B>39</B>) led 
to a like tragic conclusion, as well as the Louvier case (<B>1642</B>) in which 
the two chief victims found their end in lifelong imprisonment and the 
stake.&quot;</P>
<P>The widespread belief in and fear of magic and witchcraft operating on 
superstitious minds produced the most extraordinary hallucinations. Religious 
ecstasy partakes of the same character, the difference being that it is 
<I>possession </I>by and contact with so-called good spirits. The sacred books 
of all nations teem with instances of this and profane history can also furnish 
examples. The many familiar cases of ecstatic visions and revelations in the Old 
Testament may be cited, as well as those found in the legends of saints and 
martyrs, where they either appear as revelations from heaven or temptations of 
the Devil. In the latter case, a scientific authority, Krafft-Ebing, points out 
the close connection of religious ecstasy with sexual disturbances. That this 
condition of &quot; ecstasy&quot; was and is sought and induced the following 
passage amply proves Among Eastern and primitive peoples such as Hindoos, 
American Indians, natives of Greenland, Kamtschatka and Yucatan, 
fetish-worshipping Negroes, and Polynesians, the ecstatic state accompanied with 
hallucinations is frequently observed, sometimes arising spontaneously, but more 
often artificially induced. It was known also among the nations of antiquity. 
The means most often employed to induce this state are beating of magic drums 
and blowing of trumpets, howlings and hour-long prayers, dancing, flagellation, 
convulsive movements and contortions, asceticism, fasting and sexual abstinence. 
Recourse is also had to narcotics to bring about the desired result. Thus the 
flyagaric is used in Western Siberia, in San Domingo the herb coca, tobacco by 
some tribes of American Indians, and in the East opium and hashish. The ancient 
Egyptians had their intoxicating drinks, and receipts for witch's salves and 
philtres have come down to us from mediaeval times.&quot; In many countries this 
condition of <I>possession </I>is induced for religious and prophetic purposes, 
also for mere fortune-telling. The extent to which this belief in <I>obsession 
</I>and <I>possession </I>obtains at the present day is testified by Tylor in 
<I>Primitive Culture </I>It is not too much to assert that the doctrine of 
demoniacal <I>possession </I>is kept up, substantially the same theory to 
account for substantially the same facts, by half the human race, who thus stand 
as consistent representatives of their forefathers back in primitive 
antiquity.&quot; In the cults of Modern Spiritualism and Theosophy it may be 
found as a leading tenet of their creeds. The obsessional theory is used to 
account for all forms of insanity and crime. The following passage taken from 
the publication of a modern seer <I>Diakka and their Victims </I>by A. J. Davis 
indicates this modern belief :-&quot; The country of the diakka is where the 
morally deficient and the affectionately unclean enter upon a strange probation 
They are continually victimizing sensitive persons still in the flesh making 
sport of them and having a jolly laugh at the expense of really honest and 
sincere people. They (these demon-like spirits) teach that they would be 
elevated and made happy if only they could partake of whiskey and tobacco, or 
gratify their burning free-love propensities Being unprincipled 
intellectualities their play is nothing but pastime amusement at the expense of 
those beneath their influence.&quot; These creatures are also said to be of a 
malignant and blood-thirsty nature, inciting the beings they possess to murder, 
often of a terrible character.</P><I>
<P>Signs of Demoniac </I>Possession.-Melanchthon, in one of his letters, says 
that though there may occasionally be some natural causes for a frenzy or mania, 
it is also quite certain that devils enter certain persons and there cause 
torment and fury with or without natural causes, just as one sees at times 
maladies cured with remedies which are not natural. Moreover, such spectacles 
are in the nature of wonders and forecasts of things to come. Twelve years 
before a woman of Saxony, who could neither read nor write, being controlled by 
a devil, spoke, after the torment was over, words in Greek and Latin to the 
effect that there would be great distress among the people.</P>
<P>Dr. Ese gives the following as possible signs of pos<I>session :-</I></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>i<B>. </B>Imagining oneself possessed.</P>
<P>ii. Leading an evil life.</P>
<P>iii. Living alone.</P>
<P>iv. Chronic ailments, unusual symptoms, a deep sleep, the vomiting of strange 
things.</P>
<P>v. Blaspheming and frequent reference to the Devil.</P>
<P>vi. Making a compact with the Devil.</P>
<P>vii. Being controlled by spirits.</P>
<P>viii. Having a face that inspires horror and fear.</P>
<P>ix. Being tired of living and the giving up of hope.</P>
<P>x. Being enraged and violent in action.</P>
<P>xi. Making the cries and noises of a beast.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>In an account of those possessed in Loudon, we find the questions put to the 
University of Montpellier by Santerre, priest and founder of the bishopric and 
diocese of Nimes touching on the signs and the judicial answers of this 
University.</P>
<P>Q.-Whether the bending and moving of the body, the head at times, touching 
the soles of the feet, with other contortions and strange positions are good 
signs of <I>possessions</I></P>
<P>A.-Mimics and acrobats make such strange movements, bending and twisting 
themselves in so many ways that one must conclude that there is no sort of 
position which men and women cannot take up, after long practice and 
application, even being able, with the ease of experience, to extend and spread 
out abnormally the legs and other parts of the body, by the extension of the 
nerves, muscles and tendon-such performances are not without the bounds of 
nature.</P>
<P>Q.-Whether the rapidity of the movement of the head backwards and forwards, 
touching the chest and the back, is an infallible sign of <I>possession? 
</I></P>
<P>A.-This movement is so natural that nothing need be added to what has been 
said about the movements of the other parts of the body.</P>
<P>Q.-Whether the sudden swelling of the tongue, the throat and the face, and 
the sudden changing of colour, are sure signs of <I>possession </I>?</P>
<P>A.-The swelling and disturbance of the chest through interruption are the 
efforts of breathing or inspiration the normal actions in respiration-and 
<I>possession </I>cannot be inferred from them. The swelling of the throat may 
proceed from the retention of the breath and that of the other parts from the 
melancholic vapours which are often observed wandering through all parts of the 
body. Hence it follows that this sign of <I>possession </I>is inadmissible.</P>
<P>Q.-whether a feeling, stupidly heedless, or the lack of feeling, to the point 
of being pricked or pinched without complaining or moving and not even changing 
colour are certain signs of <I>possession ?</I></P>
<P>A.-The young Lacedemonian who allowed himself to be bitten by a fox which he 
had stolen without seeming to feel it, and those who flog themselves, even to 
death, before the altar of Diana, without turning a hair, they all show that, 
with resolution, pin-pricks can be endured without complaining. Moreover, it is 
certain that in the human body, small areas of skin are met with in some 
persons, which are insensitive, although the neighbouring parts may be quite 
sensitive, a condition which occurs the more frequently after some previous 
illness. Such a condition has, therefore, no bearing on <I>possession.</I></P>
<P>Q.-whether the total lack of bodily movement which, at the command of the 
exorciser, occurs in those supposedly possessed during, and in the middle of, 
their most violent actions, is an undeniable sign of a true diabolic 
<I>possession?</I></P>
<P>A.-The movements of the parts of the body being voluntary it is natural for 
well-disposed persons to move themselves or not at will, so that such a 
cessation of movement, if there is not entire lack of feeling; is not sufficient 
ground from which to infer a diabolic <I>possession.</I></P>
<P>Q.-Whether the yelping or noise like that of a dog, which comes from the 
chest rather than from the throat, is a mark of <I>possession ?</I></P>
<P>A.-Human skill adapts itself so easily to the counterfeiting of all kinds of 
expressions, that persons are met with every day who can give perfectly the 
expressions, cries and songs of all sorts of animals, and that with a 
practically imperceptible movement of the lips. Again, many are to be found who 
form their words in the stomach and they would seem to come from some other 
object rather than from the one who forms them. Such persons are called 
ventriloquists. However, such a condition is natural, as Pasquier shows, in 
Chap. <B>38</B> of his <I>Researches, </I>with one, Constantin, a jester, as an 
example.</P>
<P>Q.-Whether keeping the gaze fixed on some object without moving the eye, is a 
good sign of <I>possession?</I></P>
<P>A.-The movement of the eye is voluntary, like that of the other parts of the 
body, and it is natural to move it or keep it still-there is therefore, nothing 
of note in this.</P>
<P>Q.-Whether the answers, given in French, to questions rut in Latin, to those 
supposedly possessed, are a mark of <I>possession ?</I></P>
<P>A.-We assert that to understand and speak languages which one has not learnt 
is certainly supernatural, and would lead to the supposition that it occurred 
through the ministrations of the Devil or from some other cause beyond; but 
merely to answer some questions suggests nothing more than long practice, or 
that one of the number is in league with them and able to contribute to such 
answers making it appear a fallacy to say that the devils hear the questions put 
to them in Latin and answer in French and in the tongue natural to the one who 
is to pass for the demoniac. If follows from this that such a result does not 
infer the occupation by a demon, more especially if the questions are of few 
words and not involved.</P>
<P>Q.-Whether the vomiting of such things as one has swallowed is a sign of 
<I>possession ?</I></P>
<P>A.-Delrio, Bodin, and other authors say that by witch craft, sorcerers 
sometimes manage to vomit nails, pins, and other strange things, by the work of 
the devil, who is able to do the same for the truly possessed. But to vomit 
things one has swallowed is natural, there being people with weak stomachs who 
keep down for several hours what they have swallowed and then return it as they 
have taken it; also the lientery returns food through the bowel as it has been 
taken by the mouth.</P>
<P>Q.-Whether pricks with a lancet, in different parts of the body, without the 
drawing of blood, are a good sign of <I>possession?</I></P>
<P>A.-This is related to the composition of the melancholic temperament, in 
which the blood is so thick that it cannot issue from such small wounds and it 
is because of this that many when pricked by the surgeon's lancet, even in their 
very veins, do not bleed a drop, as is shown by experience. There is thus 
nothing extraordinary here.</P><I>
<P>Recorded Incidents of </I>Possession.-Bouloese tells how twenty-six devils 
came out of the body of the possessed Nicoli, of Laon: &quot;At two o'clock in 
the afternoon, the said Nicoli, being possessed of the Devil, was brought to the 
said church, where the said de Motta proceeded as before with the exorcism. In 
spite of all entreaty the said Beelzebub told them in a loud voice that he would 
not come out. Returning to their entreaties after dinner, the said de Motta 
asked him how many had come out, and he answered, 'twenty-six&rsquo;.' 'You and 
your followers,' then said de Motta, ' must now come out like the others.' 'No,' 
he replied,' I will not come out here, but if you like to take me to Saint 
Restitute, we will come out there. It is sufficient for you that twenty-six are 
out.' Then the said de Motta asked for a convincing sign of how they had come 
out. For witness he told them to look in the garden of the treasury over the 
front gate. for they had taken and carried away three tufts <I>(i.e. 
</I>branches) from a green may-pole (a small fir) and three slates from above 
the church of Liesse, made into a cross, as others in France commonly, all of 
which was found true as shown by the Abbot of Saint-Vincent, M. de Velles, 
Master Robert de May, canon of the Church Notre-Dame of Laon, and 
others.&quot;</P>
<P>The same author gives an account of the contortions of the demoniac of Laon: 
he says :-&quot; As often as the reverend father swung the sacred host before 
her eyes, saying, 'Begone, enemy of Cod,' so did she toss from side to side, 
twisting her face towards her feet, and making horrible noises. Her feet were 
reversed, with the toes in the position of the heel, and despite the restraining 
power of eight or the men, she stiffened herself and threw herself into the air 
a height of six feet, the stature of a man, so that the attendants, sometimes 
even carried with her into the air, perspired at their work. And although they 
bore down with all their might, still could they not restrain her, and torn away 
from the restraining hands, she freed herself without any appearance of being at 
all ruffled.</P>
<P>&quot;The people, seeing and hearing such a horrible sight, one so monstrous, 
hideous and terrifying cried out, ' Jesus, have mercy on us !' Some hid 
themselves not daring to look; others, recognising the wild cruelty of such 
excessive and incredible torment, wept bitterly, reiterating piteously, Jesus, 
have mercy on us!' The reverend father then gave permission to those who wished 
to touch and handle the patient, disfigured, bent, and deformed, and with the 
rigidity of death. Chief among these were the would-be reformers, such men as 
Francois Santerre, Christofle, Pasquot, Gratian de la Roche, Masquette, Jean du 
Glas, and others well-known for their tendencies towards reform, all vigorous 
men. They all endeavoured, but in vain, to straighten her limbs, and bring them 
to a normal position, and to open her eyes and mouth-it was futile. Further, so 
stiff and rigid was she, that the limbs would have broken rather than give, as 
also the nose and ears. And then, as she said afterwards) she was possessed, 
declaring that she was enduring incredible pain. That is, by the soul torment, 
the devil makes the body become stone or marble.&quot;</P>
<P>Jean Le Breton gives the following concerning those possessed in 
Louviers:-</P>
<P>&quot;The fourth fact is that many times a day they show transports of rage 
and fury, during which they call themselves demons, without, however, offending 
anyone or even hurting the fingers of the priests, which were put into their 
mouths at the height of their fury.</P>
<P>&quot;The fifth is that during these furies they show strange convulsions and 
contortions, bending themselves back, among other things, in the form of a 
circle, without the use of the hands, and in such a way that their bodies are 
supported as much on the forehead as oh the feet. The rest of the body is 
unsupported and remains so for a long time-the position being repeated seven or 
eight times. After such feats as this and many others, kept up sometimes for 
four hours, chiefly during the exorcism and during the warmest parts of the dog 
days, they are found on coming to, to be as normal, as fresh and with a pulse as 
even as if nothing had happened to them.</P>
<P>&quot;The sixth is that some of them faint away at will during the exorcism 
and this condition occurs at a time when the face is the most suffused with 
blood and the pulse is the strongest. They come to of themselves and the 
recovery is more remarkable than the swooning-it begins as a movement of the 
toe, then of the foot and in their order, of the leg, thigh, abdomen, chest and 
throat, the movement of the, last three being one of wide dilation. The face, 
meanwhile is apparently devoid of expression, which finally returns with 
grimaces and shootings, the spiritual element returning at the same time with 
its former disturbing contortions.&quot;</P>
<P>Doctor Ese gives the following as the case of Sister Mary, of the Convent at 
Louviers</P>
<P>&quot;The last was Sister Mary of St. Esprit, supposedly possessed by Dagon, 
a large woman, slender-waisted, and of good complexion, with no evidence of 
illness. She came into the refectory. . . head erect and eyes wandering from 
side to side, singing, dancing and skipping. Still moving about and touching 
lightly those around her, she spoke with an elegance of language expressive of 
the good feeling and good nature which were his (using the person of the devil.) 
All this was done with movements and carriage alike haughty, following it up 
with a violence of blasphemy, then a reference to his dear little friend 
Magdalen, his darling and his favourite mistress. And then, without springing or 
using effort of any kind, she projected herself into a pane of glass and hanging 
on to a central bar of iron passed bodily through it, but on making an exit from 
the other side the command was given in Latin, ' est in nomine Jesu rediret non 
per aliam sed per eadem viam.' After some discussion and a definite refusal to 
return she, however, returned by the same route, whereupon the doctors examined 
her pulse and tongue, all of which she endured while laughing and discussing 
other things. They found no disturbance such as they had expected, nor any sign 
of the violence of her actions and words, her coming to being accompanied with 
some trivial remarks. The company then retired.&quot;</P>
<P>Another writer on those possessed in Louviers gives the following astonishing 
fact:-</P>
<P>&quot;Placed in the middle of the nave of this chapel was a vase of some kind 
of marble, some two feet in diameter and a little under a foot deep, with sides 
about three fingers breadth in thickness. So heavy was it that three of the most 
robust persons would have had difficulty in raising it while on the ground, yet 
this girl, to all appearances of very low vitality, came into the chapel and 
grasping the vase merely by the ends of her fingers, raised it from the pedestal 
on which it was placed, turned it upside down and threw it on to the ground with 
as much ease as if it had been a piece of cardboard or paper. Such great 
strength in one so weak astonished all those present. Moreover, the girl, 
appearing wild and possessed, ran hither and thither with movements so abrupt 
and violent that it was difficult to stop her. One of the clerics present, 
having caught her by the arm, was surprised to find that it did not prevent the 
rest of her body from turning over and over as if the arm wert fixed to the 
shoulder merely by a spring. This wholly unnatural performance was carried out 
some seven or eight times and that with an ease and speed difficult to 
imagine.&quot;</P>
<P>The <I>Relation des Ursulines possedees d'Auxonne </I>contains the 
following:-</P>
<P>&quot;M. de Chalons was no sooner at the altar (at midnight&gt; than from the 
garden of the monastery and around the house was heard a confused noise, 
accompanied by unknown voices and some whistling; at times loud cries with 
strange and indistinct sounds as from a crowd, all of which was rather 
terrifying among the shadows of the night. At the same time stones were thrown 
from different places against the windows of the choir where they were 
celebrating holy mass and this despite the fact that these windows were a good 
distance from the walls which enclosed the monastery which made it improbable 
that they came from without. The glass was broken in one place but the stone did 
not fall into the choir. This noise was beard by several persons, inside and 
out. The sentinel in the citadel on that side of the town took alarm at it as he 
said the next day, and at the altar the bishop of Chalons could not but feel a 
suspicion that something extraordinary was going on in the house and that demons 
or sorcerers were making some attempts at that moment which he repelled from 
where he was by secret imprecations and inward exorcisms.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The Franciscan nuns of the same town heard the noise and were terrified 
by it. They thought that the monastery shook beneath them and in this confusion 
and fear they were compelled to have recourse to prayer.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;At the same time voices were heard in the garden, weak and moaning and 
as if asking for help. It was nearly an hour after midnight and very dark and 
stormy. Two clerics were sent out to see what was the matter and found 
Marguerite Constance and Denise Lamy in the monastery garden, the former up a 
tree and the latter seated at the foot of the stairway into the choir. They were 
at liberty and in the full possession of their senses, yet appeared distracted, 
especially the latter, and very weak and pale, though with blood on her face; 
she was terrified and had difficulty in composing herself. The other had blood 
on her face also though she was not wounded. The doors of the house were tightly 
closed and the walls of the garden were some ten or twelve feet high.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;In the afternoon of the same day the bishop of Chalons, with the 
intention of exorcising Denise Lamy, sent for her and when she was not found, he 
inwardly commanded her to come to him in the chapel of St. Anne where he was. It 
was striking to see the prompt obedience of the demon to this command, 
formulated merely in the mind, for in about a quarter of an hour a violent 
knocking was heard at the door of the chapel, as if by one hard pressed. On 
opening the door this girl entered the chapel abruptly, leaping and bounding, 
her face changed greatly and with high colour and sparkling eyes. So bold and 
violent was she that it was difficult to restrain her, nor would she allow the 
putting on of the stole which she seized and threw violently into the air 
despite the efforts of four or five clerics who did their best to stop her, so 
that finally it was proposed to bind, her, but this was deemed too difficult in 
the condition in which she was.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;On another occasion, at the height of her frenzy the demon was ordered 
to stop the pulse in one of her arms, and it was immediately done, with less 
resistance and pain than before. Immediate response. was also made to the 
further order to make it return. The command being given to make the girl 
insensible to pain, she avowed that she was so, boldly offering her arm to be 
pierced and burnt as wished. The exorcist, fortified by his earlier experience, 
took a sufficiently long needle and drove it, full length, into the nail and 
flesh, at which she laughed aloud, saying that she felt nothing at all. 
Accordingly as he was ordered, blood was allowed to flow or not, and she herself 
took the needle and stuck it into different parts of her arm and hand. Further, 
one of the company took a pin and, having drawn out the skin a little above the 
wrist, passed it through and through so that the two ends were only visible, the 
rest of the pin being buried in the arm. Unless the order was given for some no 
blood issued, nor was there - the least sign of feeling or pain.&quot;</P>
<P>The same account gives, as proofs of the <I>possession </I>of the Auxonne 
nuns, the following:-</P>
<P>&quot;Violent agitation of the body only conceivable to those who have seen 
it. Beating of the head with all their might against the pavement or walls, done 
so often and so hard that it causes one to shudder on seeing it and yet they 
show no sign of pain, nor is there any blood, wound or contusion.</P>
<P>&quot;The condition of the body in a position of extreme violence, where they 
support themselves on their knees with the head turned round an inclined towards 
the ground for a foot or so, which makes it appear as if broken. Their power of 
bearing, for hours together without moving, the head being lowered behind below 
the level of the waist; their power of breathing in this condition; the 
unruffled expression of the face which never alters during these disturbances; 
the evenness of the pulse; their coolness during these movements; the tranquil 
state they are in when they suddenly return and the lack of any quickening in 
the respirations; the turning back of the head, even to the ground, with 
marvellous rapidity. Sometimes the movement to and fro is done thirty or forty 
times running, the girl on her knees and with her arms crossed in front; at 
other times, in the same position with the head turned about, the body is wound 
around into a sort of semicircle, with results apparently incompatible with 
nature.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Fearful convulsions, affecting all the limbs and accompanied with 
shouts and cries. Sometimes fear at the sight of certain phantoms and spectres 
by which they say they are menaced, causes such a change in their facial 
expression that those present are terrified; at other times there is a flood of 
tears beyond control and accompanied by groans and piercing cries. Again, the 
widely-opened mouth, eyes wild and showing nothing but the white, the pupil 
being turned up under cover of the lids-the whole returning to the normal at the 
mere command of the exorcist in conjunction with the sign of the cross.</P>
<P>&quot;They have often been seen creeping and crawling on the ground without 
any help from the hands or feet; the back of the head or the forehead may be 
touching the soles-of the feet. Some lie on the ground, touching it with the pit 
of the stomach only, the rest of the body, head, feet and arms. being in the air 
for some length of time. Sometimes, bent back so that the top of the head and 
the soles of the feet touch the ground, the rest of the body being supported in 
the air like a table, they walk in this position without help from the hands. It 
is quite common for them, while on their knees to kiss the ground, with the face 
twisted to the back so that the top of the head touches the soles of the feet. 
In this position and with the arms crossed on the chest they make the sign of 
the cross on the pavement with their tongues.</P>
<P>&quot;A marked difference is to be noticed between their condition when free 
and uncontrolled and that which they show when controlled and in the heat of 
their frenzy. By reason of their sex and delicate constitutions as much as from 
illness they may be weak, but when the demon enters them and the authority of 
the church compels them to appear they may become at times so violent that all 
the power of four or five men may be unable to stop them. Even their faces 
become so distorted and changed that they are no longer recognisable. What is 
more astonishing is that after these violent transports, lasting sometimes three 
or four hours; after efforts which would make the strongest feel like resting 
for several days ; after continuous shrieking and heart-breaking cries; when 
they become normal again-a momentary proceeding-they are unwearied and quiet, 
and the mind is as tranquil, the face as composed, the breathing as easy and the 
pulse as little changed as if they had not stirred out of a chair.</P>
<P>&quot;It may be said, however, that among all the signs of <I>possession 
</I>which these girls have shown, one of the most surprising, and at the same 
time the most common, is the understanding of the thought and inward commands 
which are used every day by exorcists and priests, without there being any 
outward manifestation either by word or other sign. - To be appreciated by them 
it is merely necessary to address them inwardly or mentally, a fact which has 
been verified by so many of the experiences during the stay of the bishop of 
Chalons and by any of the clergy, who wished to investigate, that one cannot 
reasonably doubt such particulars and many others, the details of which cannot 
be given here.</P>
<P>A number of archbishops or bishops and doctors in Sorbonne made the following 
notification with regard to the condition at Auxonne.</P>
<P>&quot;That among these differently-placed girls there are seculars, novices, 
postulants and professed nuns; some are young, others old; some from the town, 
others not; some of high estate, others of lesser parentage; some rich, others 
poor and of low degree. That it is ten years or more since the trouble began in 
this monastery; that it is remarkable that a reign of deceit was able for so 
long to preserve the secret among girls in such numbers and of conditions and 
interests so varied. That after research and a stricter enquiry, the said Bishop 
of Chalons has found nobody, either in the monastery or in the town, who could 
speak other than well of the innocence and integrity, alike of the girls and of 
the clergy who worked with him in the exorcisms, and, for himself, he finds them 
with the bearing of persons of uprightness and worth-evidence which he gives in 
the interest of truth and justice.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Added to the above is the certificate of Morel, doctor and present at 
everything, who asserts that all these things exceed the bounds of nature and 
can only occur as the work of a demon; in short, we consider that all the 
extra-ordinary findings with these girls 'are beyond the powers of human nature 
and can only be instigated by a demon possessing and controlling their 
bodies.&quot;</P>
<P>Goulart culls from Wier many stories of demoniacs.</P>
<P>&quot;Antoine Benivenius in the eighth chapter of the <I>Livre </I>des 
<I>causes cachees des maladies </I>tells of having seen a girl of sixteen years 
whose hands contracted curiously whenever she was taken with a pain in the 
abdomen. With a cry of terror her abdomen would swell up so much that she had 
the appearance of being eight months pregnant-later the swelling went down and, 
not being able to lie still, she tossed about all over the bed, sometimes 
putting her feet above her head as if trying a somersault. This she kept up 
throughout the throes of her illness and until it had gone down by degrees. When 
asked what had happened to her, she denied any remembrance of it. But on seeking 
the causes of this affection we were of opinion that it arose from a choking of 
the womb and from the rising of malignant vapours affecting adversely the heart 
and brain. We were at length forced to relieve her with drugs but these were of 
no avail and becoming more violent and congested she at last began to throw up 
long iron nails all bent, brass needles stuck into wax, and bound up with hair 
and a part of her breakfast-a mass so large that a man would have had difficulty 
in swallowing it all. I was afraid, after seeing several of these vomitings, 
that she was possessed by an evil spirit, who deluded those present while he 
removed these things and afterwards we heard predictions and other things given 
which were entirely beyond human comprehension.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Meiner Clath, a nobleman living in the castle of Boutenbrouch in the 
duchy of Juliers, had a valet named William who for fourteen years had had the 
torments of a <I>possession </I>by the devil, and when, at the instigation of 
the devil, he began to get ill, he asked for the cure of St. Gerard as confessor 
who came to carry out his little part. but failed entirely. Seeing him with a 
swollen throat and discoloured face and with the fear of his suffocating, 
Judith, wife of Clath and an upright woman, with all in the house, began to pray 
to God. Immediately there issued from William's mouth, among other odds and 
ends, the whole of the front part of the trousers of a shepherd, stones, some 
whole and other broken, small bundles of thread, a peruke such as women are 
accustomed to use, needles, a piece of the serge jacket of a little boy, and a 
peacock's feather which William had pulled from the bird's tail eight days 
before he became ill. Being asked the cause of his trouble he said that he had 
met a woman near Camphuse who had blown in his face and that his illness was the 
result of that and nothing else. Some time after he had recovered he 
contradicted what he had said and confessed that he had been instructed by the 
devil to say what he had. He added that all those curious things had not been in 
his stomach but had been put into his throat by the devil despite the fact that 
he was seen to vomit them. Satan deceives by illusions. The thought comes at 
times to kill oneself or to run away. One day, having got into a hog-shed and 
protected more carefully than usual he remained with his eyes so firmly closed 
that it was impossible to open them. At last Gertrude, the eldest daughter of 
Clath, eleven years old, came along and advised him to pray to God for the 
return of his sight, but he asked her to pray and the fact of her praying, to 
the great surprise of both, opened his eyes. The devil exhorted him often not to 
listen to his mistress or anyone else who bowed the head at the name of God, who 
could not help him as he had died once, a fact which was openly 
preached.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;He had once attempted rudely to touch a kitchen-maid and she had 
reproved him by name, when he answered in a voice of rage that his name was not 
William but Beelzebub, at which the mistress asked-' Do you think we fear you ? 
He Whom we serve is infinitely more powerful than you are.' Clath then read the 
eleventh chapter of St. Luke where mention is made of the casting out of the 
dumb devil by the power of the Saviour and also of Beelzebub, prince of devils. 
Finally William began to rest and slept till morning like a man in a swoon, then 
taking some broth and feeling much relieved he was sent home to his parents, 
after having thanked his master and mistress and asked God to reward them for 
the trouble they had been caused by his affliction. He married afterwards and 
had children, but was never again tormented by the devil.&quot;</P>
<P>On the <B>18</B>th March, <B>1566</B>, there occurred a memorable case in 
Amsterdam, Holland, on which the Chancellor of Gueldres, M. Adrian Nicolas, made 
a public speech, from which is the following :-&quot; Two months or so ago 
thirty children of this town began to be strangely disturbed, as if frenzied or 
mad. At intervals they threw themselves on the ground and for half an hour or an 
hour at the most this torment lasted. Recovering, they remembered nothing, but 
thought they had had a sleep and the doctors, sorcerers, and exorcists were all 
equally unable to do any good. During the exorcism the children vomited a number 
of pins and needles, finger-stalls for sewing, bits of cloth, and of broken jugs 
and glass, hair and other things. The children didn't always recover from this 
but had recurrent attacks of it-the unusualness of such a condition causing 
great astonishment.&quot;</P>
<P>Jean Languis, a learned doctor, gives the following, in the first book of his 
<I>Epitres, </I>as having happened in <B>1539</B> in Fugenstall, a village in 
the bishopric of Eysteten and sworn to by a large number of witnesses</P>
<P>&quot;Ulric Neusesser, a ploughman in this village, was greatly troubled by a 
pain in the side. On an incision being made into the skin by a surgeon an iron 
nail was removed, but this did not relieve the pain, rather did it increase so 
that, becoming desperate, the poor man finally committed suicide. Before burying 
him two surgeons opened his stomach, in front of a number of persons, and in it 
found some long round pieces of wood, four steel knives, some sharp and pointed, 
others notched like a saw, two iron rods each nine inches long and a large tuft 
of hair, One wondered how and by what means this mass of old iron could be 
collected together into the space of his stomach, There is no doubt that it was 
the work of the devil who is capable of anything which will maintain a dread of 
him.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Antoine Lucquet, knight of the order of the Fleece, of high repute 
throughout Flanders, and privy counsellor of Brabant, had married in Bruges, and 
his wife, soon after the nuptials, began to show the torments of an evil spirit, 
so much so that at times, even in company, she was suddenly taken up and dragged 
through rooms and thrown from one corner to another, despite the efforts of 
those around to restrain and hold her. She was little conscious of her bodily 
welfare while in this frenzy and it was the general opinion that her condition 
had been induced by a former lover of her young and light-hearted husband. 
Meanwhile she became pregnant without a cessation in the evil torment and the 
time of her delivery being at hand the only woman present was sent for the 
midwife but instead, she came in and herself acted as midwife which disturbed 
the invalid so much that she fainted. She found, on recovering, that she had 
been delivered, yet to the astonishment of both there was no sign of a child. 
The next day on wakening up she found a child in swaddling clothes in the bed 
and she nursed it a couple of times. Falling asleep shortly afterwards the child 
was taken from her side and was never seen again. It was reported that notes 
with the hall-mark of magic had been found inside the door.&quot;</P>
<P>Goulart gives an account from Wier, of the multitude of terrible convulsions 
suffered by the nuns of the convent of Kentorp near Hammone, &quot;Just before 
and during the attack their breath was fetid and sometimes continued so for 
hours. While affected they did not lose their power of sound judgment nor of 
hearing and recognising those around them, despite the fact that owing to the 
spasm of the tongue and respiratory organs they could not speak during the 
attack. All were not equally affected but as soon as one was affected the 
others, though in different rooms, were immediately affected also. A soothsayer, 
who was sent for, said they had been poisoned by the cook, Else Kamense, and the 
devil taking advantage of the occasion increased their torment, making them bite 
and strike each other and throw each other down. After Else and her mother had 
been burnt some of the inhabitants of Hammone began to be tormented by an evil 
spirit. The minister of the Church took five of them home to warn them and 
strengthen them against the machinations of the enemy. They laughed at him and 
mentioned certain women of the place whom they would like to visit on their 
goats, which were to carry them there. Immediately one straddled a stool calling 
out that he was off, while another, squatting down, doubled himself up and 
rolled towards the door of the room which opened suddenly and through which he 
went falling to the bottom of the steps without hurting himself.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The nuns of the Convent of Nazareth at Cologne (according to the same 
writer) were affected much the same as those of Kentorp. After being troubled 
for along time and in various ways by the devil they were more terribly affected 
in <B><I>1564</B> </I>when they would lie out on the ground, with clothing 
disordered, as if for the companion-ship of man. During this their eyes would be 
closed and they would open them later with shame and feeling that they had 
endured some deep injury. A young girl of fourteen named Gertrude who had been 
shut -op in this convent was subject to this misfortune. She had often been 
troubled by wild apparitions in bed as witness her mocking' laughter, although 
she tried in vain to overcome it. A companion slept near her specially to 
protect her from the apparition but the poor girl was terrified at the noise 
from Gertrude's bed, the devil finally controlling the latter and putting her 
through a variety of contortions. The beginning of all this trouble was in the 
acquaintance picked up with one or two of the nuns on a neighbouring tennis 
court by some dissolute young man who kept up their amours over the 
walls.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The torments suffered by the nuns in Wertet in the county of Home are 
also wonderful. The beginning is traced to a poor woman who borrowed from the 
nuns during Lent some three pounds of salt and returned double the amount before 
Easter. From that they began to find in their dormitory small white balls like 
sugar-plums, and salt to the taste, which they did not eat, nor did they know 
whence they came. Shortly after they heard a moaning as of a sick man, then 
warnings to rise and go to the help of a sick sister, which they would do but 
would find nothing. Sometimes in endeavouring to use a chamber it would be 
pulled away suddenly with a consequent soiling of the bed. At times they were 
pulled out by the feet, dragged some length, and tickled so much on the soles of 
the feet that they nearly died with laughter. Pieces of flesh were pulled out of 
some, while others had their legs, arms and heads twisted about. Thus tormented 
some would throw up a large quantity of black fluid, although for six weeks 
previously they had taken nothing but the juice of horseradish without bread. 
This fluid was so bitter and so sharp that it blistered their mouths and one 
could evolve nothing which would give them an appetite for anything else. Some 
were raised into the air to the height of a man and as suddenly thrown to the 
ground again. When some thirty of their females visited this convent to 
congratulate those who seemed relieved and practically cured, some of them 
immediately fell backwards from the table they were at, losing the power of 
speech and of recognising anyone, while others were stretched out as if dead 
with arms and legs turned around. One of them was raised into the air against 
the restraining efforts of those present and then brought again to the ground so 
forcibly that she seemed dead. She rose, however, as if from a deep sleep and 
left the convent uninjured. Some moved about on the fronts of their legs as if 
lacking feet and as he dragged in a loose sack from behind. Others even climbed 
trees like cats and came down as easily. The Abbess told Margaret, Countess of 
Bure, that she cried aloud when pinched in the leg; it was as severe as if a 
piece had been pulled out, and that she was carried to bed at once and the place 
became black and blue, but she finally recovered. This derangement of the nuns 
was an open secret for three years but has been kept dark since.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What we have just said applies equally to the early case of the Budget 
nuns in their convent near Xanthus. Now, they gambol or bleat like sheep or make 
horrible noises. Sometimes they were pushed from their seats in church where 
their veils would be fastened above their heads. At other times their throats 
would be so stopped up that they could swallow no food, and this affliction 
lasted for ten years in some of them. It was said that the cause of all this was 
a young nun whose parents had refused to allow her to marry the young man she 
loved Further that the devil in the form of this young man had come to her at 
the height of her passion and had advised her to return to the convent which she 
did at once and when there she became frenzied and her actions were, strange and 
terrible. The trouble spread like the plague through the other nuns, and the 
first, one abandoned herself to her warder and had two children. - Thus does 
Satan both within and without the convent, carry out his hateful 
schemes.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Cardan relates that a ploughman often threw up glass, nails and hair 
and, on recovering, felt within a large quantity of broken glass which made a 
noise like that from a sackful of broken glass. This noise he said troubled him 
greatly and for some eighteen nights towards seven o'clock, although he had not 
observed the time and although he had felt cured for some eighteen years, he had 
felt blows in his heart to the number of hours which were to strike. All this he 
bore not without great agony.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I have often seen,&quot; says Goulart, &quot;a demoniac named George, 
who for thirty years on and off was tormented by an evil spirit and often I have 
seen her swell up, and become so heavy that eight strong men could not raise her 
from the ground. Then, exhorted and encouraged in the name of God and the hand 
of some good man extended to her, she would rise to her feet and return home, 
bent and groaning. She did harm to no one whether by day or night while in this 
condition, and she lived with a relative who had a number of children so used to 
her ways that when they saw her twisting her arms, striking her hands and her 
body swelling up in this strange way, they would gather in some part of the 
house and commend her to God and their prayers were never in vain. Finding her 
one day in another house of the village in which she lived I exhorted her to 
patience. . . She began to roar in a strange way and with a marvellous quickness 
shot out her left hand at me and enclosed in it my two hands, holding me as 
firmly as if I had been bound with stout cords. I tried, but in vain, to free 
myself, although I am of average strength. She interfered with me in no other 
way nor did she touch me with her right hand. - I was held as long as it has 
taken to tell the incident and then she let me go suddenly, begging my pardon, 
and I commended her to God and led her quietly home. . . . Some days before her 
death being much tormented she went to bed with a low fever. The fury of the 
evil one was then so much curtailed that the patient, wonderfully strengthened 
inwardly, continued to praise God who bad been so merciful to her in her 
affliction and comforting all who visited her. . . . I may add that Satan was 
overcome, and that she died peacefully, calling on her Saviour.&quot;</P>
<P>According to Goulart &quot; there was, in the village of Leuensteet and duchy 
of Brunswick, a young girl of twenty years, Margaret Achels, who lived with her 
sister. Wishing to clean some shoes one day in June she took a knife some six 
inches long and sat down in a corner of the room for she was still weak from a 
fever of long standing, whereupon an old woman entered and inquired how she was 
and whether she still had the fever and then left without further words. After 
the shoes were cleaned she let the knife fall in her lap but subsequently could 
not find it despite a diligent search. The girl was frightened and still more so 
when she found a black dog under the table. She drove it out, hoping to find the 
knife, but the dog got angry, showed its teeth and growlingly made its way into 
the street and fled. The girl at once seemed to feel something indefinable which 
passed down her back like a chill and fainting suddenly she remained so for 
three days when she began to breathe better and to take a little food. When 
carefully questioned as to the cause of her illness she said that the knife 
which had fallen into her lap had entered her left side and that there she felt 
pain. Although her parents contradicted her, attributing her condition to a 
melancholic disposition, her long abstinence and other things she did not cease 
to complain, to cry and to keep a continuous watch, so much so that her mind 
became deranged and sometimes for two days at a time she would take nothing even 
when kindly entreated to do so, so that sometimes force had to be used. Her 
attacks were more severe at times than others and her rest was broken by the 
continuous pains which beset bar, being forced as she was to hold herself 
doubled over a stick. What increased her pain and lessened the chance of relief 
was her firm belief that the knife was buried in her body and the stubborn 
contradiction of the others who said it was impossible and thought it nothing 
but a phantom of the mind, since they saw nothing which would give them ground 
for believing her unless it were her continual complaints and tears. These were 
kept up for some months and until there appeared on her left side between the 
two false ribs a tumour as large as an egg which fluctuated in size with the 
changes in her own girth. Then the girl said to them: Up to the present you 
haven't wanted to believe that the knife was in my side, but you will soon see 
now that it is.' On the <B>30</B>th June, that is after almost thirteen months 
of the trouble, the ulcer which developed on her side poured out so much 
material that the swelling began to go down and the point of the knife showed 
and the girl wanted to pull it out but her parents prevented her and sent for 
the surgeon of Duke Henry who was at the Castle of Walfbutel. This surgeon 
arrived on the <B>4</B>th July and begged the curate to comfort, instruct and 
encourage the girl, and to take particular note of her answers since she was 
regarded as a demoniac. She agreed to be attended by the surgeon, not without 
the idea that a quick death would follow. The latter, seeing the point of the 
knife projecting, grasped it with his instruments and found that it was just 
like the other in the sheath and very much worn about the middle of the blade. 
The ulcer was finally cured.&quot;</P>
<P>Goulart, quoting Melanchthon, says that &quot;there was a girl in the 
marquisate of Brandebourg who pulled some hairs off the clothing of some person 
and that these hairs wore at once changed into coins of the realm which tile 
girl chewed with a horrible cracking of the teeth. Some of these coins are kept 
still by persons who snatched them away from the girl and found them real. From 
time to time this girl was much tormented but after some months got quite well 
and has remained so since. Prayers, but nothing more, are often offered up for 
her.&quot;</P>
<P>The same author also says : &quot; I have heard that there was in Italy a 
demented woman who when controlled by a devil and asked by Lazare Bonami for the 
best verse of Virgil, answered at once:</P>
<P>&lsquo;Discite Justitiam Moniti et non temnere divos.'</P>
<P>'That,' she added, ' is the best and most-deserving verse that Virgil every 
wrote; begone and don't come back here again to try me.'</P>
<P>Louise Maillat, a young demoniac who lived in <B>1598</B> lost the use of her 
limbs and was found to be possessed by five demons who called themselves, wolf, 
cat, dog, beauty and a griffin. At first two of these demons came out from her 
mouth in the form of balls the size of the fist, the first fire-red, the second, 
which was the cat, quite black; the others left her with less violence. On 
leaving her they all made a few turns round the hearth and disappeared. Frances 
Secretain was known to have made this girl swallow these devils in a crust of 
bread the colour of manure.&quot;</P>

<P>Od Force :</B> <I>(See<B> </I>Emanations.</B>)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Odyle (also Od, Odic Force, Odyllic Force) :</B> The term first used by Baron 
von Reichenbach to denote the subtle effluence which he supposed to emanate from 
every substance in the universe, particularly from the stars and planets, and 
from crystals, magnets and the human body. the <I>odyle </I>was perceptible only 
to sensitives, in whom it produced vague feelings of heat or cold, according to 
the substance from which it radiated; or a sufficiently sensitive person might 
perceive the odyllic light, a clear flame of definite colour, issuing from the 
human finger-tips, the poles of the magnet, various metals, chemicals, etc., and 
hovering like a luminous cloud over new-made graves. The colours varied with 
each substance; thus silver and gold had a white flame; cobalt, a blue; copper 
and iron, a red. The English mesmerists speedily applied Reichenbach's methods 
to. their own sensitives, with results that passed their expectations. The 
thoroughness of Reichenbach's experiments, and the apparent soundness of his 
scientific methods, made a deep impression of the public mind. The objections of 
Braid, who at this time advanced his theory of suggestion, were ignored by the 
protagonists of <I>odyle. </I>In after years, when spiritualism had established 
itself in America, there remained a group of &quot; rational&quot; defenders of 
the movement, who attributed the phenomena of spiritualism as well as those of 
the poltergeist to the action of odylic force. Table-turning and rapping were 
also referred to this emanation by many who laughed to scorn Faraday's theory of 
unconscious muscular action. Others again, such as Mr. Guppy, regarded the 
so-called&quot; spirit&quot; intelligences producing the manifestations as being 
compounded of odylic vapours emanating from the medium, and probably connected 
with an all-pervading thought-atmosphere-an idea sufficiently like the &quot; 
cosmic fluid&quot; of the early magnetists.</P>

<P>Ointment, Witches' :</B> It was believed in mediaeval times that all the 
wonders performed by <I>witches-i.e., </I>changing themselves into animals, 
being transported through the air, etc.-were wrought by anointing themselves 
with a potent salve. As ointments are still used in Oriental countries as a 
means of inducing visions, it is possible that something of the kind may account 
for the hallucinations which the <I>witches </I>seem to have experienced. Lord 
Verulam says, &quot;The <I>ointment, </I>that <I>witches </I>use, is reported to 
be made of the <I>fat </I>of <I>children, </I>digged out of their <I>groves 
</I>; of the <I>juices </I>of <I>smallage, wolfe-bane, </I>and <I>cinque 
</I>foil, mingled with the <I>meal </I>of fine <I>wheat </I>but I suppose that 
the soporiferous medicines are likest to do it, which are <I>hen-bane, hemlock, 
mandrake, moonshade, tobacco, opium, saffron, poplar leaves, </I>etc.&quot;</P>

<P>Olcott, Colonel Henry Steel :</B> The founder, together with Madame 
Blavatsky, of the movement known as Theosophy, and president of the Theosophical 
Society. Before he identified himself with this movement he was a well-known 
authority on matters connected with agriculture. In <B>1856</B> he founded in 
America an agricultural school on the Swiss model, was offered by the American 
Government the Chief Commissionership of Agriculture and by the Greek Government 
the Professorship of Agriculture at Athens. He was for a time agricultural 
editor of Horace Greeley's <I>New York Tribune, </I>and published three works on 
agriculture. When the Civil War broke out he joined the Northerners, saw active 
service, and was invalided home. The government then made him Special 
Commissioner of the War Department. On the cessation of the war he retired into 
private life, and from <B>1875</B> till his death in <B>1906</B> taught the 
doctrines of Theosophy and neo-Buddhism. On the death of Madame Blavatsky he 
associated himself with Mrs. Annie Besant as the leader of Theosophy in India.

<P>Old Hat :</B> used for Raising the Devil : A popular mode of raising <I>the

<P>Om :</B> A Sanskrit word of peculiar sanctity in the Hindu religion. It is 
pronounced at the beginning and end of every lesson in the <I>Veda, </I>and is 
also the introductory word of the <I>Puranas. </I>It is said in the <I>Katha- 
Upanishad:</I></P>
<P>&quot;Whoever knows this syllable obtains whatever he wishes.&quot; Various 
accounts are given of its origin; one that it is the term of assent used by the 
gods, and probably an old contracted form of the Sanskrit word evam meaning 
thus.&quot; The laws of the <I>Menu </I>say that the word was formed by Brahma 
himself, who extracted the letters a u <I>m </I>from the <I>Vedas, </I>one from 
each; and they thus explain its mysterious power and sanctity. Om is also the 
name given by the Hindus to the spiritual sun, as opposed to&quot; Sooruj the 
natural sun.</P>

<P>Onimancy :</B> or the observation of the angel Uriel, is thus performed. Upon 
the nails of the right hand of an unpolluted boy or a young virgin, or the palm 
of the hand, is put some oil of olives, or what is better, oil of walnuts 
mingled with tallow or blacking. If money or things hidden in the earth be 
sought. the face of the child must be turned towards the east. If crime be 
inquired into, or the knowledge of a person out of affection, towards the south; 
for robbery towards the west, and for murder towards the south. Then the child 
must repeat the seventy-two verses of the Psalms, which the Hebrew kabalists 
collected for the Urim and Thummim: These will be found in the third book of 
Reuclin on the kabalistical art, and in a treatise <I>de verbo mirifico. </I>In 
each of these verses occurs the venerable name of four letters, and the three 
lettered name of the seventy-two angels, which are referred to the inquisitive 
name Schemhammaphoras, which was hidden in the folds of the lining of the tippet 
of the high priest. When the curious student has done thus much, Saunders 
assures him that he &quot; shall see wonders,&quot; but he omits to specify what 
these wonders are. Chiromancers give the name Onyomancy to the inspection of the 
natural signs on the nails.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Onion :</B> The <I>Onion </I>was regarded as a symbol of the universe among 
the ancient Egyptians, and many curious beliefs were associated with it. It was 
believed by them that it attracted and absorbed infectious matters, and was 
usually hung up in rooms to prevent maladies. This belief in the absorptive 
virtue of the <I>onion </I>is prevalent even at the present day. &quot;When a 
youth,&quot; says Napier,&quot; I remember the following story being told, and 
isuplicitly believed by all. There was once a certain king or nobleman who was 
in want of a physician, and two celebrated doctors applied. As both could not 
obtain the situation, they agreed among themselves that the one was to try to 
poison the other, and he who succeeded in overcoming the poison would thus be 
left free to fill the situation. They drew lots as to who should first take the 
poison. The first dose given was a stewed toad, but the party who took it 
immediately applied a poultice of peeled <I>onions </I>over his stomach, and 
thus abstracted all the poison of the toad. Two days after, the other doctor was 
given the <I>onions </I>to eat. He ate them, and died. It was generally believed 
that the poultice of peeled <I>onions </I>laid on the stomach, or underneath the 
armpits, would cure anyone who had taken poison.&quot;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Onomancy :</B> it has been properly said, more correctly signifies divination 
by a donkey, than by a name; and the latter science ought to be termed 
Onomamancy, or Onomatomancy. The notion that an analogy existed between men's 
names and their fortunes is supposed to have originated with the Pythagoreans; 
it furnished some reveries to Plato, and has been the source of much small wit 
in Ausonius, which it may amuse the classical scholar to collate from his 
epigrams.</P>
<P>Two leading rules in the science of <I>Onomancy </I>were first, that an even 
number of vowels in a man's name signifies something amiss in his left side; an 
uneven number a similar affection on the right; so that, between the two, 
perfect sanity was little to be expected. Secondly, of two competitors, that one 
would prove successful the numeral letters in whose name when summed up exceeded 
the amount of those in the name of his rival; and this was one of the reasons 
which enabled Achilles to triumph over Hector.</P>
<P>The Gothic King, Theodotus, is said, on the authority of Caelius Rhodiginus 
to have practised a peculiar species of <I>Onomancy </I>on the recommendation of 
a Jew. The diviner advised the prince, when on the eve of a war with Rome, to 
shut up thirty hogs in three different styes, having previously given some of 
them Roman and others Gothic names. On an appointed day, when the styes were 
opened, all the Romans were found alive, but with half their bristles fallen 
off-all the Goths, on the other hand, were dead; and from this prognostic the 
onomantist foreboded that the Gothic army would be utterly destroyed by the 
Romans, who, at the same time, would lose half their own force.</P><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Onychomancy :</B> Divination by the finger-nails. It is practised by watching 
the reflection of the sun in the nails of a boy, and judging the future by the 
shape of the figures which show themselves on their surface.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Onyx : </B>Its properties resemble those of Jasper, besides which it 
increases saliva in boys, and is said to bring terrible shapes to the dreamer. 
If applied to the eye it acts as if it were alive, by creeping about and 
removing anything noxious.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Ooscopy and Oomantia :</B> Two methods of divination by eggs. An example 
under the former name is related by Suetonius, who says, that Livia, when she 
was anxious to know whether she should be the mother of a boy or girl, kept an 
egg in her bosom at the proper temperature, until a chick with a beautiful 
cockscomb came forth. The latter name denotes a method of divining the signs or 
characters appearing in eggs. The custom of pasche or paste eggs, which are 
stained with various colours, and given away at Easter, is well known, and is 
described at considerable length by Brand. The custom is most religiously 
observed in Russia, where it is derived from the Greek Church. Gilded or 
coloured eggs are mutually exchanged both by men and women, who kiss one 
another, and if any coolness existed previously become good friends again on 
these occasions. The egg is one of the most ancient and beautiful symbols of the 
new birth, and has been applied to natural philosophy as well as the spiritual 
creation of man.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Opal :</B> Recreates the heart, preserves from contagion in the air, and 
dispels sadness; it is also good for weak eyes. Pliny's description of this 
stone glows with enthusiasm, and he gives the preference to those which are 
shadowed as it were with the colour of wine. The name <I>poederos, </I>applied 
to the <I>opal, </I>is understood to indicate the beautiful complexion of 
youth.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Ophites :</B> This gnostic sect seems to have dated from the second century. 
A full system of initiation was in vogue among the members, and they possessed 
symbols to represent purity, life, spirit and fire. The whole appears to have 
been of Egyptian origin. <I>(See </I>Gnostic..)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Oracles :</B> Shrines where a god speaks to human beings through the mouths 
of priests or priestesses. The concept of the god become vocal in this manner 
was by no means confined to Greece or Egypt. Our object here is to deal with the 
most celebrated <I>oracles </I>of all nations as well as those of antiquity. 
Probably all the primitive gods-those, that is to say, of the fetish class, now 
under consideration-were consulted as <I>oracles; </I>it is certain that they 
derived this character in a state of animism and that they transmitted it to 
gods of the most advanced type. In early times the great question was whether 
man would have food on the morrow or no; perhaps the first <I>oracle </I>was the 
spirit which directed the hungry savage in his hunting and fishing expeditions. 
The Esquimaux still consult spirits for this purpose, and their wizards are as 
familiar with the art of giving ambiguous replies to their anxious clients as 
were the well-informed keepers of the <I>oracles </I>of Greece. As advancement 
proceeded, the direction of the gods was obtained in all the affairs of private 
and public life.</P><I>
<P>Greece.-The Oracle of Delphi. </I>When Jupiter was once desirous to ascertain 
the central point of the earth, he despatched two eagles, or two crows, as they 
are named by Strabo. The messengers took flight in opposite courses, from 
sunrise and sunset; and they met at Delphi, which place was thenceforward 
dignified with the title The navel of the earth; &quot; an umbilicus&quot; being 
represented in white marble within its celebrated temple. Delphi thus became a 
place of great distinction, but it was not yet oracular, till the fumes which 
issued from a neighbouring cave were first discovered by a shepherd named 
Coretas. His attention was forcibly attracted to a spot round which whenever his 
goats were browsing they gambolled and bleated more than was their wont. Whether 
these fumes arose in consequence of an earthquake, or whether- they were 
generated by demoniacal art is not to be ascertained; but the latter hypothesis 
is thought by Clasen to be the more probable of the two. Coretas, on approaching 
the spot, was seized with ecstacy, and uttered words which were deemed inspired. 
It was not long before the danger arising in consequence of the excitement of 
curiosity among the neighbours, the deadly stupefaction often produced among 
those who inhaled the fumes without proper caution, and the inclination which it 
aroused in some to plunge themselves into the depths of the cavern below, 
occasioned the fissure to be covered by a sort of table, having a hole in the 
centre, and called a tripod, so that those who wished to try the experiment 
could resort there in safety. Eventually a young girl, of unsophisticated 
manners, became the chosen medium of the responses, now deemed oracular and 
called Pythian, as proceeding from Apollo, the slayer of Python, to whom Delphi 
was consecrated. A sylvan bower of laurel branches was erected over the spot, 
and at length the marble temple and the priesthood of Delphi arose where the 
Pythoness, seated on her throne, could be charged with the divine 
&quot;afflatus,&quot; and was thus rendered the vehicle of Apollo's 
dictation.</P>
<P>As the <I>oracle </I>became more celebrated, its prophetic machinery was 
constructed of more costly materials. The tripod was then formed of gold, but 
the lid, which was placed in its hollow rim, in order to afford the Pythoness a 
more secure seat, continued to be made of brass. She prepared herself by 
drinking out of a sacred fountain (Castalia). adjoining the crypt, the waters of 
which were reserved for her only, and in which she bathed her hair; by chewing a 
laurel leaf, and by circling her brows with a laurel crown. The person who made 
inquiry from the <I>oracle, </I>first offered a victim, and then having written 
his question in a note-book, handed it to the Pythoness, before she ascended the 
tripod; and he also as well as the priestess, wore a laurel crown. In early 
times the <I>oracle </I>spoke only in one month of the year, named 
&quot;Byssus,&quot; in which it originated; and at first only on the seventh day 
of that month, which was esteemed the birth-day of Apollo, and was called &quot; 
Polypthonus.&quot;</P>
<P>Virginity was at first an indispensable requisite in the Pythoness; on 
account, as Diodorus tells us, of the purity of that state and its relation to 
Diana; moreover, because virgins were thought better adapted than others of 
their sex to keep oracular mysteries secret and inviolate. But an untoward 
accident having occurred to one of these consecrated damsels, the guardians of 
the temple, in order, as they imagined, to prevent its repetition for the future 
permitted no one to fulfil the duties of the office till she had attained the 
mature age of fifty; they still indulged her, however, with the use of a 
maiden's habit. The response was always delivered in Greek.</P><I>
<P>Oracle of Dodona. </I>Another celebrated <I>oracle, </I>that of Jupiter, was 
at Dodona, in Epirus, from which Jupiter derived the name of Dodonus. It was 
situated at the foot of Mount Tomarus, in a wood of oaks; and there the answers 
were given by an old woman under the name of Pelias. Pelias means dove in the 
Attic dialect, from which the fable arose, that the doves prophesied in the 
groves of Dodona. According to Herodotus, this legend contains the following 
incident, which gave rise to the <I>oracle </I>-Two priestesses of Egyptian 
Thebes were carried away by Phoenician merchants; one of them was conveyed to 
Libya, where she founded the <I>oracle </I>of Jupiter Ammon; the other to 
Greece. The latter one remained in the Dodonian wood, which was much frequented 
on account of the acorns. There she had a temple built at the foot of an oak in 
honour of Jupiter, whose priestess she had been in Thebes; and here afterwards a 
regular <I>oracle </I>was founded. He adds, that this priestess was called a 
dove, because her language could not be understood. The Dodonid and African 
<I>oracles </I>were certainly connected, and Herodotus distinctly states, that 
the manner of prophecy in Dodona was the same as that in Egyptian Thebes. Diana 
was worshipped in Dodona in conjunction with Zeus, and a female figure was 
associated with Amun in the Libyan Ammonium. Besides this, the dove was the bird 
of Aphrodite, the Diana of Zeus, or the Mosaic divine love, which saved mankind 
from complete destruction. According to other authors, there was a wondrous 
intoxicating spring at Dodona; and in later times more material means were 
employed to produce the prophetic spirit.</P>
<P>Several copper bowls, namely, were placed upon a column, and the statue of a 
boy beside them. When the wind moved a rod or scourge having three bones 
attached to chains, it struck upon the metallic bowls, the sound of which was 
heard by the applicants. These Dodonian tones gave rise to a proverb: <I>aes 
Dodonaeum &ndash; an </I>unceasing babbler. The <I>oracle </I>at Dodona was 
dedicated to the Pelasgian Zeus, who was worshipped here at the same time as the 
almighty ruler of the world, and as the friendly associate of mankind. In the 
course of the theogonic process, Diana was associated with him as his wife,-the 
mother of Aphrodite. The servants of Zeus were Selles, the priests of Diana, the 
so-called Peliades. According to Homer, the Selles inhabited the sanctum at 
Dodona, sleeping upon the earth, and with naked unwashed feet; they served the 
Pelasgian Zeus. It is probable that they slept upon the earth on the hides of 
newly-sacrificed animals, to receive prophetic dreams, as was customary at other 
places, Calchos and Oropus, with many others.</P>
<P>As regards the mantic of Dodona, it was partly natural, from the excitement 
of the mind, partly artificial. Of the latter we may mention three modes-the 
ancient oak of Zeus, with its prophetic doves, the miraculous spring, and the 
celebrated Dodonian bowls of brass.</P>
<P>The far-spreading, speaking tree, the incredible wonder, as AEschylus calls 
it, was an oak, a lofty beautiful tree, with evergreen leaves and sweet edible 
acorns, which according to the belief of the Greeks and Romans, were the first 
sustenance of mankind. The Pelasgi regarded this tree as the tree of life. In 
this tree the god was supposed to reside, and the rustling of its leaves and the 
voices of birds showed his presence. When the questioners entered, the oak 
rustled, and the Peliades said, &quot; Thus speaks Zeus.&quot; Incense was 
burned beneath it, which may be compared to the altar of Abraham under the oak 
Ogyges, which had stood there since the world's creation. According to the 
legend, sacred dove', continually inhabited the tree, like the Marsoor <I>oracle 
</I>at Tiora Mattiene, where a sacred hawk foretells futurity from the top of a 
wooden pillar.</P>
<P>At the foot of the oak a cold spring gushes as it were from its roots, and 
from its murmur the inspired priestesses prophesied.</P>
<P>Of this miraculous fountain it is related, that lighted torches being thrust 
into it were extinguished, and that extinguished torches were re-lit; it also 
rose and fell at various seasons. &quot;That extinction and rekindling 
has,&quot; says Lassaulx, &quot;perhaps the mystical signification that the 
usual sober life of the senses must be extinguished, that the prophetic spirit 
dormant in the soul may be aroused. The torch of human existence must expire, 
that a divine one may be lighted; the human must die that the divine may be 
born; the destruction of individuality is the awakening of God in the soul, or, 
as the mystics say, the setting of sense is the rising of truth.&quot;</P>
<P>The extinguishing of a burning light shows that the spring contained carbonic 
acid gas, which possesses stupifying and deadly properties, like all exhalations 
arising especially from minerals. The regular rising and sinking of the water is 
a frequent phenomenon, and has been observed from the earliest ages.</P>
<P>It appears that predictions were drawn from the tones of the Dodonian brass 
bowls, as well as from the rustling of the sacred oak and the murmuring of the 
sacred well.</P>
<P>The Dodonian columns, with that which stood upon them, appears to express the 
following -The medium-sized brazen bowl was a hemisphere, and symbolised of 
heaven; the boy-like male statue a figure of the Desniurgos, or constructor of 
the universe; the bell-like notes a symbol of the harmony of the universe and 
music of the spheres. That the Demiurgos is represented as a boy is quite in the 
spirit of Egypto-Pelasgian theology as it reigned in Samothrace. The miraculous 
bell told all who came to Dodona to question the god that they were on holy 
ground, must inquire with pure hearts, and be silent when the god replied. It is 
easily imagined that these tones, independent and uninfluenced by human will, 
must have made a deep impression upon the minds of pilgrims. Those who 
questioned the god were also obliged to take a purificatory bath in the temple, 
similar to that by which the Deiphian Pythia prepared herself for prophecy.</P>
<P>Besides this artificial soothsaying from signs, natural divination by the 
prophetic movements of the mind was practised. Where there are prophesying 
priestesses, there must also be ecstatic ones, similar to those in the magnetic 
state. Sophocles calls the Dodonean priestesses divinely inspired: Plato 
(Phaesdrus) says, more decidedly, that the prophetess at Delphi and the 
priestesses at Dodona bad done much good in sacred madness, in private and 
public affairs. to their country, but in their senses little or nothing. We may 
see from this that the Delphian Pythia, as well as the Dodonian priestesses, did 
not give their oracles in the state of common waking consciousness, but in real 
ecstasy, to which the frequent incense-and drink-offerings would assist. 
Aristides states, still more clearly than the others, that the priestesses at 
Dodona neither knew, before being seized upon by the spirit, what would be said, 
nor remembered afterwards, when their natural consciousness returned, what they 
had uttered; so that all others, rather than they, knew it.</P><I>
<P>Oracle of Jupiter Trophonius.-Trophonius, </I>according to Pausanias, was the 
most skilful architect of his day. Concerning the origin of his <I>oracle 
</I>there are many opinions. Some say he was swallowed up by an earthquake in 
the cave which afterwards became prophetic; others, that after having completed 
the Adytum of Apollo at Delphi (a very marvellous specimen of his workmanship, 
which Dr. Clarke thought might at some time be discovered on account of its 
singularity), he declined asking any specific pay, but modestly requested the 
god to grant him whatever was the greatest benefit a man could receive; and in 
three days afterwards he was found dead. This <I>oracle </I>was discovered after 
two years of scarcity in its neighbourhood, when the Pythoness ordered the 
starving population, who applied to her, to consult Trophonius in Lebedna. The 
deputation sent for that purpose could not discover any trace of such an 
<I>oracle, </I>till Saon, the oldest among them, obtained the desired 
information by following the flight of a swarm of bees. The responses were given 
by the genius of Trophonius to the inquirer, who was compelled to descend into a 
cave, of the nature of which Pausanias has left a very lively representation. 
The votary resided for a certain number of days in a sanctuary of good fortune, 
in which he underwent customary lustrations, abstained from hot baths, but 
dipped in the river Hercyna, and was plentifully supplied with meat from the 
victims which he sacrificed. Many, indeed, were the sacred personages whom he 
was bound to propitiate with blood; among them were Trophonius himself and his 
sons, Apollo, Saturn, Jupiter, Vasileus, Juno Henioche, and Ceres Europa, who is 
affirmed to have been the nurse of Trophonius. From an inspection of the 
entrails, a soothsayer pronounced whether Trophonius was in fit humour for 
consultation. None of the &quot;exta,&quot; however favourable they might have 
been, were of the slightest avail, unless a ram, immolated to Agamedes at the 
mouth of the cave on the very night of the descent, proved auspicious. When that 
propitious signal had been given the priests led the inquirer to the river 
Hercyna, where he was anointed and washed by two Lebadaean youths, thirteen 
years of age, named &quot; Hermai.&quot; He was then carried farther to the two 
spring-heads of the stream, and there he drank first of Lathe, in order that he 
might forget all past events and present his mind to the <I>oracle </I>as a 
&quot; tabula rasa&quot; ; and secondly of Mnemosyne, that he might firmly 
retain remembrance of every occurrence which was about to happen within the 
cave. An image, reputed to be the workmanship of Daedalus, was then exhibited to 
him, and so great was its sanctity, that no other eyes but those of a person 
about to undertake the adventure of the cave were ever permitted to behold it. 
Next he was clad in a linen robe, girt with ribbons, and shod with sandals 
peculiar to the country. The entrance to the <I>oracle </I>was a very narrow 
aperture in a grove on the summit of a mountain, protected by a marble parapet 
about two cubits in height, and by brazen spikes above it. The upper part of the 
cave was artificial, like an oven, but no steps were cut in the rock, and the 
descent was made by a ladder brought to the spot on each occasion. On 
approaching the mouth of the adytum itself the adventurer lay flat, and holding 
in each hand some honeyed cakes, first inserted his feet into the aperture, then 
drew his knees and the remainder of his body after them, till he was caught by 
some bidden force, and carried downward as if by a whirlpool. The responses were 
given sometimes by a vision, sometimes by words; and a forcible exit was then 
made through the original entrance, and in like manner feet foremost. There was 
only a single instance on record of any person who had descended failing to 
return and that one deserved his fate; for his object was to discover treasure, 
not to consult the <I>oracle. </I>Immediately on issuing from the cavern, the 
inquirer was placed on a seat called that of Mnemosyne, not far from the 
entrance, and there the priests demanded a relation of everything which he had 
seen and beard; be was then carried once again to the sanctuary of good fortune, 
where he remained for some time overpowered by terror and lost in forgetfulness. 
By degrees his former powers of intellect returned, and, in contradiction to the 
received opinion, he recovered the power of smiling.</P>
<P>Dr. Clarke, in his visit to Lebadaea, found everything belonging to the 
hieron of Trophonius in its original state, excepting that the narrow entrance 
to the adytum was choked with rubbish. The Turkish governor was afraid of a 
popular commotion if he gave permission for cleansing this aperture. Mr. Cripps, 
however, introduced the whole length of his body into the cavity, and by 
thrusting a long pole before him found it utterly stopped. The waters of Lathe 
and Muemosyne at present supply the washer-women of Lebadaea.</P><I>
<P>Oracles of Delos and Branchus. - The oracle </I>of &quot; Delos,&quot; 
notwithstanding its high reputation, had few peculiarities its virtue was 
derived from the nativity of Apollo and Diana in that island. At Dindyma, or 
Didyma, near Miletus, Apollo presided over the <I>oracle </I>of the &quot; 
Branchidae,&quot; so called from either one of his sons or of his favourites 
Branchus of Thessaly, whom he instructed in soothsaying while alive, and 
canonized after death. The responses were given by a priestess who bathed and 
fasted for three days before consultation, and then sat upon an axle or bar, 
with a charming-rod in her hand, and inhaling the steam from a hot spring. 
Offerings and ceremonies were necessary to render the inspiration effectual, 
including baths, fasting, and solitude, and lamblichus censures those who 
despise them.</P><I>
<P>Oracle of the Clarian Apollo at Colophon.-Of </I>the <I>oracle </I>of Apollo 
at Colophon, lamblichus relates that it prophesied by drinking of water. &quot; 
It is known that a subterranean spring exists there, from which the prophet 
drinks; after be has done so, and has performed many consecrations and sacred 
customs on certain nights, he predicts the future; but he is invisible to all 
who are present. That this water can induce prophecy is clear, but how it 
happens, no one knows, says the proverb.&quot; It might appear that the divine 
spirit pervades this water, but it is not so. God is in all things, and is 
reflected in this spring, thereby giving it the prophetic power. This 
inspiration of the water is not of an entirely divine nature, for it only 
prepares us and purifies the light of the soul, so that we are fit to receive 
the divine spirit. There the divine presence is of such a nature that it 
punishes every one who is capable of receiving the god. The soothsayer uses this 
spirit like a work-tool over which he has no control. After the moment of 
prediction he does not always remember that which has passed; often he can 
scarcely collect his faculties. Long before the water-drinking, the soothsayer 
must abstain day and night from food, and observe religious customs, which are 
impossible to ordinary people, by which means he is made capable of receiving 
the god. It is only in this manner that he is able to hold the mirror of his 
soul to the radiance of free inspiration.&quot;</P><I>
<P>Oracle of Amphiaraus.-Another </I>very celebrated <I>oracle </I>was that of 
Amphiaraus, who distinguished himself so much in the Theban war. He was 
venerated at Oropus, in Boeotia, as a seer. This <I>oracle </I>was consulted 
more in sickness than on any other occasion. The applicants had here, also, to 
lie upon the skin of a sacrificed ram, and during sleep had the remedies of 
their diseases revealed to them. Not only, however, were sacrifices and 
lustrations performed here, but the priests prescribed other preparations by 
which the minds of the sleepers were to be enlightened. They had to fast one 
day, and refrain from wine three. Amphilochus, as son of Amphiaraus, had a 
similar <I>oracle </I>at Mallos, in Cilicia, which Pausanias calls the most 
trustworthy and credible of the age. Plutarch speaks of the <I>oracles </I>of 
Amphilochus and Mopsus as being in a very flourishing state; and Lucian mentions 
that all those who wished to question the <I>oracle </I>had to lay down two 
oboles.</P><I>
<P>Egyptian Oracles.-The oracles </I>of Ancient Egypt were as numerous as those 
of Greece. It must have been due to foreign influence that the <I>oracle, 
</I>that played so important a part in the Greek world at this time, was also 
thoroughly established on the banks of the Nile. Herodotus knew of no fewer than 
seven gods in Egypt who spake by <I>oracles, </I>Of these, the most reliable was 
considered to give an intimation of their intentions by means of remarkable 
events. These are carefully observed by the Egyptians, who write down what 
follows upon these prodigies. They also consider that the fate of a person is 
fixed by the day of his birth, for every day belongs to a special god. The 
<I>oracle </I>of Jupiter Ammon at the oasis of that name and the same deity at 
Thebes existed from the twentieth to the twenty-second Dynasty. He was consulted 
not only concerning the fate of empires but upon such trifling matters as the 
identification of a thief. In all serious matters, however, it was sought to 
ascertain his views. Those about to make their wills sought his <I>oracle, 
</I>and judgments were ratified by his word.</P>
<P>&quot;According to the inscriptions, intercourse between king and god was 
arranged as follows -The King present himself before the god and preferred a 
direct question, so framed as to admit of an answer by simple yes or no; in 
reply the god nodded an affirmative, or shook his head in negation. This has 
suggested the idea that the <I>oracles </I>were worked by manipulating statues 
of divinities mechanically set in motion by the priests. But as yet no such 
statues have been found in the Valley of the Nile, and contrivances of this kind 
could have had no other object than to deceive the people,-a supposition 
apparently excluded in this case by the fact that it was customary for the king 
to visit the god alone and in secret. Probably the king presented himself on 
such occasions before the sacred animal in which the god was incarnate, 
believing that the divine will would be manifested by it movements.&quot;</P>
<P>The Apis bull also possessed <I>oracles. </I>Bes, too, god of pleasure or of 
the senses, had an <I>oracle </I>at Abydos.</P><I>
<P>American Oracles.-Among </I>the American races the <I>oracle </I>was 
frequently encountered. All the principal gods of aboriginal America universally 
act as <I>oracles. </I>With the ancient inhabitants of Peru, the <I>huillcas 
</I>partook of the nature of <I>oracles. </I>Many of these were serpents, trees, 
and rivers, the noises made by which appeared to the primitive Peruvians-as, 
indeed, they do to primitive folk all over the world-to be of the quality of 
articulate speech. Both the Huillcamayu and the Apurimac rivers at Cuzco were 
<I>huillca oracles </I>of this kind, as their names, ' Huillcariver &quot; and 
&quot;Great Speaker,&quot; denote. These <I>oracles </I>often set the mandate of 
the Inca himself at defiance, occasionally supporting popular opinion against 
his policy.</P>
<P>The Peruvian Indians of the Andes range within recent generations continued 
to adhere to the superstitions they had inherited from their fathers. A rare and 
interesting account of these says that they &quot;admit an evil being, the 
inhabitant of the centre of the earth, whom they consider as the author of their 
misfortunes, and at the mention of whose name they tremble. The most shrewd 
among them take advantage of this belief to obtain respect, and represent 
themselves as his delegates. Under the denomination of <I>mohanes, </I>or 
<I>agoreros, </I>they are consulted even on the most trivial occasions. They 
preside over the intrigues of love, the health of the community, and the taking 
of the field. Whatever repeatedly occurs to defeat their prognostics, falls on 
themselves; and they are wont to pay for their deceptions very dearly. They chew 
a species of vegetable called <I>piripiri, </I>and throw it into the air, 
accompanying this act by certain recitals and incantations, to injure some, to. 
benefit others, to procure rain and the inundation of rivers, or, on the other 
hand, to occasion settled weather, and a plentiful store of agricultural 
productions. Any such result, having been casually verified on a single 
occasion, suffices to confirm the Indians in their faith, although they may have 
been cheated a thousand times.</P>
<P>There is an instance on record of how the <I>huillca </I>could refuse on 
occasion to recognise even royalty itself. Manco, the Inca who had been given 
the kingly power by Pizarro, offered a sacrifice to one of these oracular 
shrines. The <I>oracle </I>refused to recognise him, through the medium of its 
guardian priest, stating that Manco was not the rightful Inca. Manco therefore 
caused the <I>oracle, </I>which was in the shape of a rock, to be thrown down, 
whereupon its guardian spirit emerged in the form of a parrot and flew away. It 
is probable that the bird thus liberated had been taught by the priests to 
answer to the questions of those who came to consult the shrine. But we learn 
that on Manco commanding that the parrot should be pursued it sought another 
rock, which opened to receive it, and the spirit of the <I>huillca </I>was 
transferred to this new abode.</P>
<P>Like the greater idols of Mexico, most of the principal huacas of Peru seem 
to have been also <I>oracles. </I>The guardians of the great speaking huacas 
appear to have exercised in virtue of their office an independent influence 
which was sometimes sufficiently powerful to resist the </P>
<P>Apu-Ccapac-Inca himself. It was perhaps natural that they should be the 
exponents of the popular feeling which supported them, rather than of the policy 
of the sovereign chiefs, whose interest it was to suppress them : there was even 
a tradition that the Huillac-umu, a venerable huillac whom the rest acknowledged 
as their head, had in old times possessed jurisdiction over the supreme 
war-chiefs.</P>
<P>Many Indian tribes employ fetishes as <I>oracles, </I>and among the ancient 
Mexicans practically all the great gods were oracular.</P>

qualities of electrum are of a tell-tale nature.</P>

<P>Orton :</B> Alluded to by Froissart as the familiar of the Lord of Corasse, 
near Orthes. A clerk whom his lordship had wronged set this spirit the task of 
tormenting his superior, but by fair words the Lord of Corasse won him over to 
himself so that <I>Orton </I>became his familiar. Nightly <I>Orton </I>would 
shake his pillow and waken him to tell him the news of the world. Froissart says 
of their connection</P>
<P>&quot;So <I>Orton </I>continued to serve the Lord of Corasse for a long time. 
I do not know whether he had more than one master, but, every week, at night, 
twice or thrice. he visited his master, and related to him the events which had 
happened in the different countries he had traversed, and the lord of Corasse 
wrote of them to the Count of Foix, who took a great pleasure in them, for he 
was the man in all the world who most willingly heard news of strange 
countries.</P>
<P>&quot;Now it happened that the Lord of Corasse, as on other nights, was lying 
in his bed in his chamber by the side of his wife, who had become accustomed to 
listen to <I>Orton </I>without any alarm. <I>Orton </I>came, and draw away the 
lord's pub's'.', for he was fast asleep, and his lord awoke, and cried, ' Who is 
this ? ' He answered, ' It is I, <I>Orton.' </I>' And whence comest thou?' ' I 
come from Prague, in Bohemia.' 'And how far from hence is this Prague, in 
Bohemia ?' ' Why,' said he, 'about sixty days' journey.' 'And thou hast come so 
quickly? ' &lsquo;Faith, I go as quickly as the wind, or even swifter.' ' And 
thou hast wings?' ' Faith, none. 'How then canst thou fly so quickly? ' <I>Orton 
</I>replied-It does not concern thee to know.' ' Nay,' said he, ' I shall be 
very glad to know what fashion and form thou art of,' <I>Orton </I>answered, ' 
It does not concern thee to know; it is sufficient that I come hither, and bring 
thee sure and certain news.' By G-, <I>Orton,' </I>exclaimed the lord of 
Corasse, ' I should love thee better if I had seen thee.' Since you have so keen 
a desire to see me,' said <I>Orton </I>' the first thing thou shalt see and 
encounter to-morrow morning, when you rise from your bed, shall be-I.' ' That is 
enough,' said the Lord of Corasse. ' Go, therefore; I give thee leave for this 
night.'</P>
<P>&quot;When the morrow came, the Lord of Corasse began to rise, but the lady 
was so affrighted that she fell sick and could not get up that morning, and she 
said to her lord, who did not wish her to keep her bed, ' See if thou seest 
<I>Orton. </I>By my faith, I neither wish, if it please God, to see nor 
encounter him.' ' But I do,' said the Lord of Corasse He leapt all nimbly from 
his bed, and seated himself upon the edge, and waited there to see <I>Orton, 
</I>hut saw nothing. Then he went to the windows and threw them upon that he 
might see more clearly about the room, but he saw nothing, so that he could say, 
' This is <I>Orton.' </I>The day passed, the night returned. When the Lord of 
Corasse was in his bed asleep, <I>Orton </I>came, and began speaking in his 
wonted manner. Go, go,' said his master, 'thou art a fibber: thou didst promise 
to show me to-day who thou wert, and thou hast not done so.' ' Nay,' said he, 
'but I did.' Thou didst not.' 'And didst thou not see anything,' inquired 
<I>Orton, </I>'when thou didst leap out of bed?' The Lord of Corasse thought a 
little while, and said-' Yes, while sitting on my bed, and thinking of thee, I 
saw two long straws upon the pavement, which turned towards each other and 
played about.' ' And that was I,' cried <I>Orton; ' </I>I had assumed that 
form.' Said the Lord of Corasse: ' It does not content me: I pray thee change 
thyself into some other form, so that I may see and know thee.' <I>Orton 
</I>replied : ' You will act so that you will lose me.' ' Not so, 'said the Lord 
of Corasse: ' When I have once seen you, I shall not want to see you ever 
again.' 'Then,' said <I>Orton, </I>'you shall see me to-morrow; and remember 
that the first thing you shall see upon leaving your chamber, will be I.' ' Be 
it so,' replied the Lord of Corasse. ' Begone with you, therefore, now. I give 
thee leave, for I wish to sleep.'</P><I>
<P>&quot;Orton </I>departed. When the morrow came, and at the third hour, the 
Lord of Corasse was up and attired in his usual fashion, he went forth from his 
chamber into a gallery that looked upon the castle-court. He cast therein his 
glances, and the first thing he saw was the largest sow he had ever seen; but 
she was so thin she seemed nothing but skin and bones, and she had great and 
long teats, pendant and quite attenuated, and a long and inflamed snout. The 
Sire de Corasse marvelled very much at this sow, and looked at her in anger, and 
exclaimed to his people, ' Go quickly, bring the dogs hither, and see that this 
Sow be well hunted.' The varlets ran nimbly, threw open the place where the dogs 
lay, and set them at the sow. The sow heaved a loud cry, and looked up at the 
Lord of Corasse, who supported himself upon a pillar buttress in front of his 
chamber. She was seen no more afterwards, for she vanished, nor did any one note 
what became of her. The Sire de Corrasse returned into his chamber pensively, 
and bethought himself of <I>Orton, </I>and said, ' I think that I have seen my 
familiar; I repent me that I set my dogs upon him, for I doubt if I shall ever 
behold him again, since he has several times told me that as soon as I should 
provoke him I should lose him, and he would return no more.' He spoke truly; 
never again did <I>Orton </I>return to the Lord of Corasse, and the knight died 
in the following year.&quot;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Oupnekhat, The :</B> The <I>Oupnekhat </I>or <I>Oupnekhata </I>(Book of the 
Secret) written in Persian, gives the following instructions for the production 
of visions. &quot; To produce the wise Maschqgui (vision), we must sit on a 
four-cornered base, namely the heels, and then close the gates of the body. The 
ears by the thumbs; the eyes by the forefingers; the nose by the middle; the 
lips by the four other fingers. The lamp within the body will then be preserved 
from wind and movement, and the whole body will be full of light. Like the 
tortoise, man must withdraw every sense within himself; the heart must be 
guarded, and then Brahma will enter into him, like fire and lightning. In the 
great fire in the cavity of the heart a small flame will be lit up, and in its 
centre is Atma (the soul) ; and he who destroys all worldly desires and wisdom 
will be like a hawk which has broken through the meshes of the net, and will 
have become one with the great being.&quot; Thus will he become Brahma-Atma 
(divine spirit), and will perceive by a light that far exceeds that of the sum. 
&quot; Who, therefore, enters this path be Brahma must deny the world and its 
pleasures; must only cover his nakedness, and staff in hand collect enough, but 
no more, alms to maintain life. The lesser ones only do this; the greater throw 
aside pitcher and. staff, and do not even read the <I>Oupnekhata.&quot;</P>

<P>Owen, Robert :</B> An early convert to spiritualism. He had. been for many 
years an advanced socialist, and though at the time he embraced the 
spiritualistic doctrines-<B>1853</B>-he was already in his eighty-third year, he 
preached the new faith with undiminished vigour and with characteristic scorn of 
caution. Having first published his views in his periodical, the <I>Rational 
Quarterly Review, </I>he brought out, in <B>1854</B>, the <I>New Existence of 
Man upon Earth, </I>at this period the only English paper devoted to the 
interests of spiritualism. Owen's view of the movement was that it was the 
inauguration of a sort of millennium, a social revolution, for which he had 
looked throughout his life.</P></FONT>
