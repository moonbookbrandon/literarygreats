<P>Zachaire, Denis : </B>Alchemist. This French alchemist is chiefly remembered 
by his book,<B> </B><I>Opuscule </I>de<B> </B><I>la Philosophie de Metaux, 
traitant de l'Augmentation et Perfection de ceux, </I>and in the preface thereto 
he gives some account of his life, yet fails to state the precise date at which 
he was born. However, the event is commonly supposed to have taken place about 
<B>1510</B>; while it is known that <I>Denis </I>was a native of La Guyenne, and 
that his parents were comfortably off, if not actually rich. As a young man he 
studied at Bordeaux, and subsequently at Toulouse, intending to become a lawyer; 
yet he soon became more interested in alchemy than in legal affairs, and in 
<B>1535</B>, on his father's death putting him in possession of some money, he 
decided to try and multiply it by artificial means. Associating himself with an 
abbe who was reckoned a great adept in gold-making, <I>Denis </I>had soon 
disposed of the bulk of his patrimony; hut the charlatan's futile experiments, 
far from disillusioning him, served rather to nerve him to further endeavours, 
and in <B>1539</B> he went to Paris, where he made the acquaintance of many 
renowned alchemists. From one of them, so he declares, he imbibed the precious 
Secret ; and thereupon he hastened to the court of the King of Navarre, Antoine 
d'Albert, grandfather of Henri IV., offering to make gold if the requisite 
materials were supplied. His majesty was deeply interested, and promised a 
reward of no less than four thousand crowns in the event of the researches 
proving fruitful ; but <I>Zackaire's </I>vaunted skill failed him in the hour of 
need, and he retired discomfited to Toulouse. Here he became friendly with a 
certain priest, who advised him strongly to renounce his quest, and study 
natural science instead; so <I>Denis </I>went off to Paris once more, intending 
to act in accordance with his counsel. Ere a little while, nevertheless, he was 
deep in alchemy again, making actual experiments, and studying closely the 
writings of Raymond Lully and Arnold di Villanova; while, according to his own 
account of his career, on Easter day in the year <B>1550</B> he succeeded in 
converting a large quantity of quick-silver into gold. Then, some time after 
this alleged triumph, he left France to travel in Switzerland, and lived for a 
while at Lausanne; while later on he wandered to Germany, and there he died. It 
is probable that his closing years were spent in dire poverty, but this is not 
recorded definitely, nor has the exact date of the alchemist's demise ever been 
ascertained.</P>
<P>As regards the book by <I>Zachaire </I>cited above, it was published 
originally at Antwerp in <B>1567</B>, it was repeatedly reprinted thereafter, 
and even won the honour of being translated into Latin; while to this day, 
indeed, it is sought keenly by French philosphers with a taste for the 
curious.</P><B>

and justice on all.</P>

copper into gold. Thirty legions obey him.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Zahuris or Zahories :</B> French people who had travelled in Spain frequently 
had curious tales to tell concerning the <I>Zahuris; </I>people who were so 
keen-sighted that they could see streams of water and veins of metal hidden in 
the earth, and could indicate the 'whereabouts of buried treasure and the bodies 
of murdered persons. Explanations have been offered on natural lines. It was 
said that these men knew' where water was to be found by the vapours arising at 
such spots; and that they were able to trace mines of gold and silver and copper 
by the particular herbs growing in their neighbourhood. But to the Spaniard such 
explanations are unsatisfactory; they persist in believing that the <I>Zahuris 
</I>are gifted with supernatural faculties, that they are <I>en rapport 
</I>'with the demons, and that, if they wished, they could, without any physical 
aid, read thoughts and discover secrets which were as a sealed book to the 
grosser senses of ordinary mortals. For the rest, the <I>Zahuris </I>have red 
eyes; and in order that one should become a <I>Zahuri </I>it is necessary that 
he should have been born on Good Friday.</P><B>

<P>Zedekias : </B>Notwithstanding the credulity of the French people in the 
reign of Pepin the Short, they refused to believe in the existence of elementary 
spirits. The Kabalist <I>Zedekias, </I>being minded to convince the world, 
thereupon commanded the sylphs to become visible to all men. According to the 
Abbe de Villars, the admirable creatures responded magnificently. They were 
beheld in human form, sometimes ranged in battle, whether marching in good 
order, or under arms, or camping in superb pavilions and, again, in aerial 
navies of marvellous structure, whose flying flotillas sailed through the air, 
at the will of the <I>Zephyrs. </I>But the ignorant generation to which they 
appeared failed entirely to understand the significance of the strange 
spectacle. They believed at first that the creatures were sorcerers who had 
betaken themselves to aerial regions for the purpose of exciting storms and 
sending down hail on the harvests. The sages and juris-consuls were of the 
popular opinion. The emperors shared the same idea, which became so widespread 
that even the wise Charlemagne, and after him Louis the Debonnair, imposed heavy 
penalties on these supposed aerial tyrants. </P>

<P>Ziito :</B> One of the most remarkable magicians of whom history has left any 
record. He was a sorcerer at the court of King Wenceslaus of Bohemia (afterwards 
Emperor of Germany) towards the end of the fourteenth century, and among his 
more famous exploits is one chronicled by Dulsavius, bishop of Olmutz, in his 
<I>History of Bohemia. </I>On the occasion of the marriage of Wenceslaus with 
Sophia, daughter of the elector Palatine of Bavaria, the elector, knowing his 
son-in-law's liking for juggling and magical exhibitions, brought in his train a 
number of morris-dancers, jugglers and such entertainers. When they came forward 
to give their exhibition <I>Ziito </I>remained unobtrusively among the 
spectators. He was not entirely unnoticed, however, for his remarkable 
appearance drew the attention of those about him. His oddest feature was his 
mouth, which actually stretched from ear to ear. After watching the magicians 
for some time in silence, Z<I>iito </I>appeared to become exasperated at the 
halting way in which the tricks were carried through, and going up to the 
principal magician he taunted him with incompetency. The rival professor hotly 
defended his performance, and a discussion ensued which was ended at last by 
<I>Ziito </I>swallowing his opponent, just as he stood, leaving only his shoes, 
which he said were dirty and unfit for consumption. After this extraordinary 
feat, he retired for a little while to a closet, from which he shortly emerged, 
leading the rival magician by the hand. He then gave a performance of his own 
which put the former exhibition entirely in the shade. He changed himself into 
many divers shapes, taking the form of first one person and then another, none 
of whom bore any resemblance either to himself or to each other. In a car drawn 
by barn-door fowls he kept pace with the King's carriage. When the guests were 
assembled at dinner, he played a multitude of elfish tricks on them, to their 
amusement or annoyance, as the case might be. Indeed, he was at all times an 
exceedingly mischievous creature as is shown by another story told of him. 
Feigning to be in want of money, and apparently casting about anxiously for the 
means of obtaining some, he at length took a handful of corn, and made it look 
like thirty fat hogs. These he took to Michael, a rich but very mean dealer. The 
latter purchased them after some haggling, but 'was warned not to let them drink 
at the river. But the warning was disregarded, and the hogs turned into grains 
of corn. The enraged dealer went in search of <I>Ziito, </I>whom he found at 
last in a vintner's shop. In vain Michael shouted and stamped, the magician took 
no notice, but seemed to be in a fit of abstraction. The dealer, beside himself, 
seized <I>Ziito's </I>foot and pulled it as hard as he could. To his dismay, the 
foot and leg came right off, while <I>Ziito </I>screamed lustily, and hauled 
Michael before the judge, where the two presented their complaints. What the 
decision was, history does not relate, but it is unlikely that the ingenious 
<I>Ziito </I>came off worse.</P><B>

<P>Zoaphite : </B>According to the<B> </B><I>Journal des Voyage's </I>of Jean 
Struys, a species of Cucumber which feeds on neighbouring plants. Its fruit has 
the form of a lamb, with the head, feet, and tail of that animal distinctly 
apparent, whence it is called, in the language of the country, <I>Canaret, 
</I>or <I>Conarer, </I>signifying a lamb. Its skin is covered with a white down 
as delicate as silk. The Tartars think a great deal of it and most of them keep 
it carefully in their houses, where the author of the <I>Journal des Voyages 
</I>saw it several times. It grows on a stalk about three feet in height, to 
which it is attached by a sort of tendril. On this tendril it can move about, 
and turn and bend towards the herbs on which it feeds, and without which it soon 
drys up and withers. Wolves love it, and devour it with avidity, because it 
tastes like the flesh of lamb. The author adds that he has been assured that it 
has bones, flesh, and blood, whence it is also known in its native country as 
<I>Zoaphite, </I>or animal plant.</P><B>
