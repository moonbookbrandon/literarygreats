<P>Saba :</B> In Ossianic legend, wife of Finn and mother of Oisin. In the form 
of a fawn, she was captured by Finn in the chase, but noticing that his 
man-hounds would do her no hurt, he gave her shelter in his Dun of Allen. The 
next morning he found her transformed into a beautiful woman. She told him that 
an enchanter had compelled her to assume the shape of a fawn, but that her 
original form would be restored if she reached Dun Allen. Finn made her his 
wife, and ceased for a while from battle and the chase. Hearing one day, 
however, that the Northmen&rsquo;s warships were in the Bay of Dublin, he 
mustered his men and went to fight them. He returned victorious, but to find 
<I>Saba </I>gone. The enchanter, taking advantage of his absence, had appeared 
to her in the likeness of Finn with his hounds and so lured her from the dun, 
when she became a fawn again.</P>

<P>Sabellicus, Georgius :</B> A magician who lived about the same time as 
Faustus of Wittenberg, about the end of the <B>15</B>th century. His chief 
claims to fame as a sorcerer rest on his own wide and arrogant advertisement of 
his skill in necromancy. He styles himself, &quot;The most accomplished 
<I>Georgius Sabellicus, </I>a second Faustus, the spring and centre of 
necromantic art, an astrologer, a magician, consummate in chiromancy, and in 
agromancy, pyromancy and hydromancy inferior to none that ever lived.&quot; 
Unfortunately, no proof is forthcoming that he ever substantiated these 
bombastic claims, or was ever regarded by anyone else as anything but a 
charlatan.</P>

<P>Saint Germain, Comte de :</B> Born probably about <B>1710</B>, one of the 
most celebrated mystic adventurers of modern times. Like Cagliostro and others 
of his kind almost nothing is known concerning his origin, but there is reason 
to believe that he was a Portuguese Jew. There are, however, hints that he was 
of royal birth, but these have never been substantiated. One thing is fairly 
certain, and that is that he was an accomplished spy, for he resided at many 
European Courts, spoke several languages fluently, and was even sent upon 
diplomatic missions by Louis XV. He had always abundance of funds at his 
command, and is alluded to by Grimm as the most capable and able man he had ever 
known. He pretended to have lived for centuries, to have known Solomon, the 
Queen of Sheba and many other persons of antiquity; but although obviously a 
charlatan, the accomplishments upon which he based his reputation were in many 
ways real and considerable. Especially was this the case as regards chemistry, a 
science in which he was certainly an adept, and he pretended to have a secret 
for removing the flaws from diamonds, and to be able to transmute metals, and of 
course he possessed the secret of the elixir of life. He is mentioned by Horace 
Walpole as being in London about <B>1743</B>, and as being arrested as a 
Jacobite spy, who was later released. Walpole writes of him &quot; He is called 
an Italian, a Spaniard, a Pole, a somebody who married a great fortune in Mexico 
and ran away with her jewels to Constantinople, a priest, a fiddler, a vast 
nobleman.&quot; Five years after his London experience, he attached himself to 
the court of Louis XV. where he exercised considerable influence, over that 
monarch, and was employed by him upon several secret missions. He was distinctly 
the fashion about this time, for Europe was greatly inclined to the pursuit of 
the occult at this epoch; and as he combined mystical conversation with a 
pleasing character, and not a little flippancy, he was the rage. But he ruined 
his chances at the French court by interfering in a dispute between Austria and 
France, and was forced to remove himself to England. He resided in London for 
one or two years, but we trace him to St. Petersburg, <B>1762</B>, where he is 
said to have assisted in the conspiracy which placed Catherine II. on the 
Russian throne. After this he travelled in Germany where he is said in the 
<I>Memoirs of Cagliostro </I>to have become the founder of freemasonry, and to 
have initiated Cagliostro into that rite. <I>(See Cagliostro.) </I>In 
Cagliostro&rsquo;s account can be credited, he set about the business with 
remarkable splendour, and not a little bombast, posing as a &quot; deity,&quot; 
and behaving in a manner calculated to gladden pseudo-mystics of the age. He was 
nothing if not theatrical, and it is probably for this reason that he attracted 
the Land-grave Charles of Hesse, who set aside a residence for the study of the 
occult sciences. He died at Schleswig somewhere between the years <B>1780</B> 
and <B>1785</B>, but the exact date of his death and its circumstances are 
unknown. It would be a matter of real difficulty to say whether he possessed any 
genuine occult power whatsoever, and in all likelihood he was merely one of 
those charlatans in whom his age abounded. Against this view might be set the 
circumstance that a great many really clever and able people of his own time 
thoroughly believed in him; but we must remember the credulous nature of the age 
in which he flourished. It has been said that XVIII. century Europe was 
sceptical regarding everything save occultism and its professors, and it would 
appear to unbiassed minds that this circumstance could have no better 
illustration than the career of the <I>Comte de Saint Germain.</I></P>
<P>A notable circumstance regarding him was that he possessed a magnificent 
collection of precious stones, which some consider to be artificial, but which 
others better able to judge believe to have been genuine. Thus he presented 
Louis XV. with a diamond worth <B>10</B>,<B>000</B> livres. All sorts of stories 
were in circulation concerning him. One old lady professed to have encountered 
him at Venice fifty years before, where he posed as a man of <B>60</B>, and even 
his valet was supposed to have discovered the secret of immortality. On one 
occasion a visitor rallied this man upon his master being present at the 
marriage of Cana in Galilee, asking him if it were the case. &quot; You forget, 
sir,&quot; was the reply, &quot; I have only been in the Comte&rsquo;s service a 
century.&quot;</P>

<P>St. John&rsquo;s Crystal Gold : </B>&quot; In regard of the Ashes of 
Vegetables,&quot; says Vaughan, &quot;although their weaker exterior Elements 
expire by violence of the fire, yet their Earth cannot be destroyed, but is 
Vitrified. The Fusion and Transparency of this substance is occasioned by the 
Radicall moysture or Seminal water of the Compound. This water resists the fury 
of the fire, and cannot possibly be vanquished. &lsquo;In hac Aqua&rsquo; (saith 
the learned Severine), &lsquo; Rosa latet in Hieme.&rsquo; These two principles 
are never separated for Nature proceeds not so far in her Dissolutions. When 
death hath done her worst, there is a Union between these two, and out of them 
shall God raise us to the last day, and restore us to a spiritual constitution. 
I do not conceive there shall be a Resurrection of every Species, but rather 
their Terrestrial parts, together with the element of water (for &lsquo;there 
shall be no more sea&rsquo;: Revelations), shall be united in one mixture with 
the Earth, and fixed to a pure Diaphanous substance. This is <I>St. John&rsquo;s 
Crystal Gold, </I>a fundamental of the New Jerusalem-so called, not in respect 
of Colour, but constitution. Their Spirits, I suppose, shall be reduced to their 
first Limbus, a sphere of pure, ethereal fire, like rich Eternal Tapestry spread 
under the throne of God.&quot;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>St. John&rsquo;s Wort :</B> <I>St. John&rsquo;s Wort. </I>In classical 
mythology the summer solstice was a day dedicated to the sun, and was believed 
to be a day on which witches held their festivities. <I>St. John&rsquo;s Wort 
</I>was their symbolical plant and people were wont to judge from it whether 
their future would be lucky or unlucky; as it grew they read in its progressive 
character their future lot. The Christians dedicated this festive period to 
<I>St. John&rsquo;s Wort </I>or root, and it became a talisman against evil. In 
one of the old romantic ballads a young lady falls in love with a demon, who 
tells her:-</P>
<P>&quot;Gin you wish to be leman mine</P>
<P>Lay aside the <I>St. John&rsquo;s Wort </I>and the vervain.&quot;</P>
<P>When hung up on St. John&rsquo;s day together with a cross over the doors of 
houses it kept out the devil and other evil spirits. Te gather the root on St. 
John&rsquo;s day morning at sunrise, and retain it in the house, gave luck to 
the family in their undertakings, especially in those begun on that day.</P>

<P>St. Martin, Louis Claude de :</B> French Mystic and Author, commonly known as 
&quot;le philosophe inconnu.&quot; (<B>1743</B>-<B>1803</B>). The name of 
<I>Louis de St. Martin </I>is a familiar one, more familiar, perhaps, than that 
of almost any other French mystic; and this is partly due to his having been a 
voluminous author, and partly to his being virtually the founder of a sect, 
&quot; the Martinistes&quot; ; while again, St. Beuve wrote about him in his 
<I>Causeries du Lundi, </I>and this has naturally brought him under wide 
notice.</P>
<P>Born in <B>1734</B> at Amboise, <I>St. Martin </I>came of a family of some 
wealth and of gentle birth. His mother died while he was a child, but this 
proved anything but unfortunate for him; for his step-mother besides lavishing a 
wealth of affection on him, early discerned his rare intellectual gifts, and 
made every effort to nurture them. &quot; C&rsquo;est a elle,&quot; he wrote 
afterwards in manhood, &quot; que je dois peut-etre tout mon bonheur, puisque 
c&rsquo;est elle que m&rsquo;a donna&rsquo; les premiers elements de cette 
education douce, attentive et pieuse, qui m&rsquo;a fait aimer de Dieu et des 
hommes.&quot; The boy was educated at the College de Pontlevoy, where he read 
with interest numerous books of a mystical order, one which impressed him 
particularly being Abbadie&rsquo;s <I>Art de se connaitre soi-meme </I>and at 
first he intended to make law his profession, but he soon decided on a military 
career instead, and accordingly entered the army. A little before taking this 
step he had affiliated himself with the freemasons and, on his regiment being 
sent to garrison Bordeaux, he became intimate with certain flew rites which the 
Portuguese Jew, Martinez Pasqually (q.v.), had lately introduced into the 
masonic lodge there. For a while <I>St. Martin </I>was deeply interested, not 
just in the aforesaid but in the philosophy of Pasqually ; yet anon he declared 
that the latter&rsquo;s disciples were inclined to be too materialistic, and 
soon he was deep in the writings of Swedenborg, in whom he found a counsellor 
more to his taste. The inevitable result of studies of this nature was that he 
began to feel a great distaste for regimental life, and so, in <B>1771</B>, he 
resigned his commission, determining to devote the rest of his life to 
philosophical speculations. He now began writing a book, <I>Des Erreurs el de la 
Verite, on les Hommes rappeles au Principe de la Science, </I>which was 
published in <B>1775</B>, at Edinburgh, at this time on the eve of becoming a 
centre of literary activity of all sorts and it is worth recalling that this 
pristine effort by <I>St. Martin </I>was brought under the notice of Voltaire, 
the old cynic observing shrewdly that half a dozen folio volumes might well be 
devoted to the topic of <I>erreurs, </I>but that a page would suffice for the 
treatment of <I>virite !</I></P>
<P>The young author&rsquo;s next important step was to pay a visit to England, 
and thence in <B>1787</B> he went to Italy along with Prince Galitzin, with whom 
he had lately become friendly. They stayed together for some time at Rome, and 
then <I>St. Martin </I>left for Strassburg, his intention being to study German 
there, for he had recently grown interested in the teaching of Jacob Boehme, and 
he was anxious to study the subject thoroughly. Very soon he had achieved this 
end, and at a later date, indeed, he translated a number of the German 
mystic&rsquo;s writings into French; but meanwhile returning to France, he found 
his outlook suddenly changed, the revolution breaking out in <B>1789</B>, and a 
reign of terror setting in. No one was safe, and <I>St. Martin </I>was arrested 
at Paris, simply on account of his being. a gentleman by birth; but his 
affiliation with the freemasons stood him in good stead. in this hour .of need, 
and he was liberated by a decree of the ninth Thermidor. Accordingly he resumed 
activity with his pen, and in <B>1792</B> he issued a new book, <I>Nouvel Homme; 
</I>while two years later he was commissioned to go to his native Amboise, 
inspect the archives and libraries of the monasteries in that region, and draw 
up occasional reports on the subject. Shortly afterwards he was appointed an 
<I>eleve professeur </I>at the <I>Ecole Normale </I>in Paris, in consequence of 
which he now made his home in that town; and among others with whom he became 
acquainted there was Chateaubriand, of whose writing, he was an enthusiastic 
devotee, but who, on his parts appears to have received the mystic with his 
usual haughty coldness. <I>St. Martin </I>did not lack a large circle of 
admirers, however, and he continued to work had, publishing in <B>1795</B> one 
of his most important books, <I>Lettres </I>a <I>un Ami, </I>ou 
<I>Considerations politiqiues, philosophiques et riligieuses sur la Revolution, 
</I>which was succeeded in <B>1800</B> by two speculative treatises, <I>Ecce 
Homo </I>and <I>L&rsquo;Esprit des Choses. </I>Then, in <B>1802</B>, he issued 
yet another volume, <I>Ministere de l&rsquo;Homme Esprit; </I>but in the 
following year his labours were brought to an abrupt close, for while staying at 
Annay, not far from Paris, with a friend called Lenoir-Laroche, he succumbed to 
an apopleptic seizure. After his death it was found that he had left a 
considerable mass of manuscripts behind him, and some of these were issued by 
his executors in <B>1807</B>, while in <B>1862</B> a collection of his letters 
appeared.</P><I>
<P>St. Martin </I>was never married, but he appears to have exercised a most 
extraordinary fascination over women; and in fact divers scandalous stories are 
told in this relation, some of them implicating various courtly dames of the 
French nobility of the Empire. As a philosopher <I>St. Martin </I>found a host 
of disciples among his contemporaries, these gradually forming themselves almost 
into a distinct sect, and, as observed before. acquiring the name of&rsquo; 
&quot;Martinistes.&quot; What, then, was the teaching of their leader ? and what 
the nature of the tenets promulgated in his voluminous writings ? It is 
difficult to give an epitome in so limited a space as that at disposal here, but 
turning to the author&rsquo;s <I>l&rsquo;Homme da Desir </I>(<B>1790</B>), and 
again to his <I>Tableau natural des Rap ports qui existent entre Die, el 
l&rsquo;Homme et <B>1</B>&rsquo; Univers (<B>1</I>782</B>), we find this pair 
tolerably representative of all his writing, and their key-note may certainly be 
defined as consisting in aspiration. Man is divine despite the fall recounted in 
the Scriptures, dormant within him lies a lofty quality of which he is too often 
scarcely conscious, and it is incumbent on him to develop this quality, striving 
thereafter without ceasing, and waiving the while everything pertaining to the 
category of materialism-such is the salient principle in <I>St. Martin&rsquo;s 
</I>teaching, a principle which seems literally trite nowadays, for it has been 
propounded by a host of modern mystics, notably A.E. in <I>The Hero in Man. 
</I>In writing in this wise, the French mystic undoubtedly owed a good deal to 
Swendenborg, while obligations to Boehme are of course manifest throughout his 
later works; and, while his debt to Martinez Pasqually has probably been 
exaggerated somewhat, there is no doubt that the Portuguese Jew influenced him 
greatly for a while, the latter&rsquo;s teaching coming to him at a time when he 
was still very young and susceptible, and fresh from readings of Abbadie.</P>

<P>Salagrama, The :</B> An Indian stone, credited with possessing magical 
properties, and worn as an amulet. This stone is black in colour, about the size 
of a billiard ball, and pierced with holes. It is said that it can only be found 
in the Gandaki, a river in Nepaul, which some believe rises at the foot of 
Vishnu, and others in the head of Siva. It is kept in a clean cloth, and often 
washed and perfumed by its fortunate owner. The .water in which it has been 
dipped is supposed thereby to gain sin-expelling potency, and is therefore drunk 
and greatly valued. It possesses other occult powers, and is a necessary 
ingredient of the preparations of those about to die. The departing Hindu holds 
it ill his hand, and believing in its powers has hope for the future, and dies 
peacefully.</P>

<P>Salamander&rsquo;s Feather :</B> Otherwise known as Asbestos. A mineral of an 
incombustible nature, which resembles flax, being of fine fibrous texture. It 
was used by the Pagans to light their temples : when once it was lighted, they 
believed it could not be put out, even by lain and storms. Leonardus says: 
&quot; Its fire is nourished by an inseparable unctuous Humid flowing from its 
substance; therefore, being once kindled it preserves a constant light without 
feeding it with any moisture.&quot;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Sallow :</B> A tree or shrub of the willow kind. Rods of this particular wood 
were much in use amongst the Scythians and the Alani for purposes of augurial

Buddhists still ascribe a sacred magical power to it, and hold that it 
reconciles man to God. It is a good amulet against fear, promotes the flow of

<P>Witchcraft </I>-In medieval times Scandinavian examples of witchcraft are 
rare, but in <B>1669</B> and <B>1670</B> a great Outbreak of fanaticism against 
it commenced in Sweden in the district of Elfdale.</P>
<P>The villages of Mohra and Elfdale are situated in the dales of the 
mountainous districts of the central parts of Sweden. In the first of the years 
above mentioned, a strange report went abroad that the children of the 
neighbourhood were carried away nightly to a place they called Blockula, where 
they were received by Satan in person; and the children themselves, who were the 
authors of the report, pointed out to them numerous women, who, they said were 
witches and carried them thither. The alarm and terror in the district became so 
great that a report was at last made to the king, who nominated commissioners, 
partly clergy and partly laymen, to inquire into the extraordinary circumstances 
which had been brought under his notice, and these commissioners arrived in 
Mohra and announced their intentions of opening their proceedings on the 
<B>13</B>th of August, <B>1670</B>.</P>
<P>On the <B>12</B>th of August, the commissioners met at the parsonage-house, 
and heard the complaints of the minister and several people of the better class, 
who told them of the miserable condition they were in, and prayed that by some 
means or other they might be delivered from the calamity. They gravely told the 
commissioners that by the help of witches some hundreds of their children had 
been drawn to Satan, who had been seen to go in a visible shape through the 
country, and to appear daily to the people the poorer sort of them, they said, 
he had seduced by feasting them with meat and drink,</P>
<P>The commissioners entered upon their duties on the next day with the utmost 
diligence, and the result of their misguided zeal formed one of the most 
remarkable examples of cruel and remorseless persecution that stains the annals 
of sorcery. No less than threescore and ten inhabitants of the village and 
district of Mohra, three-and-twenty of whom made confessions, were condemned and 
executed. One woman pleaded that she was with child, and the rest denied their 
guilt, and these were sent to Fahluna, where most of them were afterwards put to 
death, Fifteen children were among those who suffered death, and thirty-six 
more, of different ages between nine and sixteen, were forced to run the 
gauntlet, and be scourged on the hands at the church-door every Sunday for one 
year; while twenty more, who had been drawn into these practices more 
unwillingly, and were very young, were condemned to be scourged with rods upon 
their hands for three successive Sundays at the church-door. The number of the 
children accused was about three hundred.</P>
<P>It appears that the commissioners began by taking the confessions of the 
children, and then they confronted them with the witches whom the children 
accused as their seducers. The latter, to use the words of the authorised 
report, having &quot; most of them children with them, which they had either 
seduced or attempted to seduce, some seven years of&rsquo; age, nay, from four 
to sixteen years,&quot; now appeared before the commissioners. &quot; Some of 
the children complained lamentably of the &lsquo;misery and mischief they were 
forced sometimes to suffer of the devil and the witches.&quot; Being asked, 
whether they were sure, that they were at any time carried away by the devil? 
they all replied in the affirmative. &quot; Hereupon the witches themselves were 
asked, whether the confessions of those children were true, and admonished to 
confess the truth, that they might turn away from the devil unto the living God. 
At first, most of them did very stiffly, and without shedding the least tear, 
deny it, though much against their will and inclination. After this the children 
were examined every one by themselves, to see whether their confessions did 
agree or no, and the commissioners found that all of them, except some very 
little ones, which could not tell all the circumstances, did punctually agree in 
their confessions of particulars. In the meanwhile, the commissioners that were 
of the clergy examined the witches, but could not bring them to any confession, 
all continuing steadfast in their denials, till at last some of them burst into 
tears, and their confession agreed with what the children said; and these 
expressed their abhorrence of the fact, and begged pardon. Adding that the 
devil, whom they called Locyta, had Stopped the mouths of some of them, so loath 
was he to part with his prey, and had stopped the ears of others. And being now 
gone from them, they could no longer conceal it; for they had now perceived his 
treachery.&quot; The witches asserted that, the journey to Blockula was not 
always made with the same kind of conveyance; they commonly used men, beasts, 
even spits and posts, according as they had opportunity. They preferred, 
however, riding upon goats, and if they had more children with them than the 
animal could conveniently carry, they elongated its back by means of a spit 
anointed with their magical ointment. It was further stated, that if the 
children did at any time name the names of those, either man or woman, that had 
been with them, and had carried them away, they were again carried by force, 
either to Blockula or the crossway, and there beaten, insomuch that some of them 
died of it; &lsquo; and this some of the witches confessed, and added, that now 
they were exceedingly troubled and tortured in their minds for it.&quot; One 
thing was wanting to confirm this circumstance of their confession. The marks of 
the whip could not be found on the persons of the victims, except on one boy, 
who had some wounds and holes in his back, that were given him with thorns; but 
the witches said they would quickly vanish.</P>
<P>The account they gave of Blockula was, that it was situated in a large 
meadow, like a plain sea, &quot;wherein you can see no end.&quot; The house they 
met at had a great gate painted with many divers colours. Through this gate they 
went into a little meadow distinct from the other, and here they turned their 
animals to graze. When they had made use of men for their beasts of burden, they 
set them up against the wall in a state of helpless slumber, and there they 
remained till wanted for the homeward flight. In a very large room of this 
house, stood a long table, at which the witches sat down; and adjoining to this 
room was another chamber, where there were &quot; lovely and delicate 
beds.&quot;</P>
<P>As soon as they arrived at Blockula, the visitors were required to deny their 
baptism, and devote themselves body and soul to Satan, whom they promised to 
serve faithfully. Hereupon he cut their fingers, and they wrote their name with 
blood in his book. He then caused them to b baptized anew, by priests appointed 
for that purpose. Upon this the devil gave them a purse, wherein there were 
filings of clocks, with a big stone tied to it, which they threw into the water, 
and said, &quot; As these filings of the clock do never return to the clock, 
from which they were taken, so may my soul never return to heaven!&quot; Another 
difficulty arose in verifying this statement, that few of the children had any 
marks on their fingers to show where they had been cut. Bet here again the story 
was helped by a girl who had her finger much hurt, and who declared, that 
because she would not stretch out her finger, the devil in anger had thus 
wounded it.</P>
<P>When these ceremonies were completed, the witches sat down at the table, 
those whom the fiend esteemed most being placed nearest to him; but the children 
were made to stand at the door, where he himself gave them meat and drink, 
Perhaps we may look for the origin of this part of the story in the pages of 
Pierre de Lancre. The food with which the visitors to Blockula were regaled, 
consisted of broth, with coleworts and bacon in it; oatmeal bread spread with 
butter, milk and cheese. Sometimes they said, it tasted very well, and sometimes 
very ill. After meals they went to dancing, and it was one peculiarity of these 
northern witches&rsquo; sabbaths, that the dance was usually followed by 
fighting. Those of Elfdale confessed that the devil used to play upon a harp 
before them. Another peculiarity of these northern witches was, that children 
resulted from their intercourse with Satan, and these children having married 
together became the parents of toads and serpents.</P>
<P>The witches of Sweden appear to have been less noxious than those of most 
other countries, for, whatever they acknowledged themselves, there seems to have 
been no evidence of mischief done by them. They confessed that they were obliged 
to promise Satan that they would do all kinds of mischief, and that the devil 
taught them to milk, which was after this manner. They used to stick a knife in 
the wall, and hang a kind of label on it, which they drew and stroaked and as 
long as this lasted, the persons they had power over were miserably plagued, and 
the beasts were milked that way, till sometimes they died of it. A woman 
confessed that the devil gave her a wooden knife, wherewith, going into houses, 
she had power to kill anything she touched with it ; yet there were few that 
could confess that they had hurt any man or woman. Being asked whether they had 
murdered any children, they confessed that they had indeed tormented many, but 
did not know whether any of them died of these plagues, although they said that 
the devil had showed them several places where he had power to do mischief. The 
minister of Elfdale declared, that one night these witches were, to his 
thinking, on the crown of his head, and that from thence he had a long continued 
pain of the head. And upon this one of the witches confessed that the devil had 
sent her to torment that minister, and that she was ordered to use a nail, and 
strike it into his head, but his skull was so hard that the nail would not 
penetrate it, and merely produced that headache. The hard-headed minister said 
further, that one night he felt a pain as if he were torn with an instrument 
used for combing flax, and when he awoke he heard somebody scratching and 
scraping at the window, but could see nobody; and one of the witches confessed, 
that she was the person that had thus disturbed him. The minister of Mohra 
declared also, that one night one of these witches came into his house, and did 
so violently take him by the throat, that he thought he should have been choked, 
and awaking, he saw the person that did it, but could not know her; and that for 
some weeks he was not able to speak, or perform divine service. An old woman of 
Elfdale confessed that the devil had helped her to make a nail, which she stuck 
into a boy&rsquo;s knee, of which stroke the boy remained lame a long time. And 
she added, that, before she was burned or executed by the hand of justice, the 
boy would recover.</P>
<P>Another circumstance confessed by these witches was, that the devil gave them 
a beast, about the shape and bigness of a cat, which they called a carrier; and 
a bird as big as a raven, but white; and these they could send anywhere, and 
wherever they came they took away all sorts of victuals, such as butter, cheese, 
milk, bacon, and all sorts of seeds, and carried them to the witch. What the 
bird brought they kept for themselves, but what the carrier brought they took to 
Blockula, where the arch-fiend gave them as much of it as he thought good. The 
carriers, they said, filled themselves so full oftentimes, that they were forced 
to disgorge it by the way, and what they thus rendered fell to the ground, and 
is found in several gardens where coleworts grow, and far from the houses of the 
witches. It was of a yellow colour like gold, and was called witches&rsquo; 
butter.</P>
<P>Such are the details, as far as they can now be obtained, of this 
extraordinary delusion, the only one of a similar kind that we know to have 
occurred in the northern part of Europe during the &quot; age of 
witchcraft.&quot; In other countries we can generally trace some particular 
cause which gave rise to great persecutions of this kind, but here, as the story 
is told, we see none, for it is hardly likely that such a strange series of 
accusations should have been the mere involuntary creation of a party of little 
children. Suspicion is excited by the peculiar part which the two clergymen of 
Elfdale and Mohra acted in it, that they were not altogether strangers to the 
fabrication. They seem to have been weak superstitious men, and perhaps they had 
been reading the witchcraft books of the south till they imagined the country 
round them to be over-run with these noxious beings. The proceedings at Mohra 
caused so much alarm throughout Sweden, that prayers were ordered in all the 
churches for delivery from the snares of Satan, who was believed to have been 
let loose in that kingdom. On <I>a </I>sudden a new edict of the king put a stop 
to the whole process, and the matter was brought to a close rather mysteriously. 
It is said that the witch prosecution was increasing so much in intensity, that 
accusations began to be made against people of a higher class in society, and 
then a complaint was made to the king, and they were stopped</P>
<P>Perhaps the two clergymen themselves became alarmed, but one thing seems 
certain, that the moment the commission was revoked, and the persecution ceased, 
no more witches were heard of.</P><I>
<P>Spiritualism.-In </I><B>1843</B> an epidemic of preaching occurred in 
Southern Sweden, which provides Ennemoser, with material for an interesting 
passage in his <I>History of Magic. </I>The manifestation of this was so similar 
in character to those described elsewhere, that it is unnecessary to allude to 
it in detail. A writer in the London <I>Medium and Daybreak </I>of <B>1878</B> 
says &quot; It is about a year and a half since I changed my abode from 
Stockholm to this place, and during that period it is wonderful how Spiritualism 
has gained ground in Sweden. The leading papers, that used in my time to refuse 
to publish any article on Spiritualism excepting such as ridiculed the doctrine, 
have of late thrown their columns wide open to the serious discussion of the 
matter. Many a Spiritualist in secret, has thus been encouraged to give 
publicity to his opinions without standing any longer in awe of that demon, 
public ridicule, which intimidates so many of our brethren. Several of Allan 
Kardec&rsquo;s works have been translated into Swedish, among which I may 
mention his <I>Evangile selon Ie Spiritisme </I>as particularly well-rendered in 
Swedish by Walter Jochnick. A spiritual Library was opened in Stockholm on the 
<B>1</B>st of April last, which will no doubt greatly contribute to the 
spreading of the blessed doctrine. The visit of Mr. Eglinton to Stockholm was of 
the greatest benefit to the cause. Let us hope that the stay of Mrs. Esperance 
in the south of Sweden may have an equally beneficial effect. Notwithstanding 
all this progress of the cause in the neighbouring country, Spiritualism is 
looked upon here as something akin to madness, but even here there are thin, 
very thin rays, and very wide apart, struggling to pierce the darkness. In 
Norway, spiritualism as known to modern Europe, did not seem to have become 
existent until about <B>1880</B>. A writer in a number of the <I>Dawn of Light 
</I>published in that year says Spiritualism is just commencing to give a sign 
of its existence here in Norway. The newspapers have begun to attack it as a 
delusion and the expose&rsquo; of Mrs. C., which recently took place at 
<B>38</B>, Great Russell Street, London, has made the round through all the 
papers in <I>Scandinavia. </I>After all, it must sooner or later take root as in 
all other parts of the world. Mr. Eglinton, the English medium, has done a good 
work in Stockholm, showing some of the great savants a new world; and a couple 
of years ago Mr. Slade visited Copenhagen. The works of Mr. Zollner, the great 
astronomer of Leipzig, have been mentioned in the papers and caused a good deal 
of sensation.</P>
<P>&quot;Of mediums there are several here, but all, as yet, afraid to speak 
out. One writes with both hands; a gentleman is developing as a drawing medium. 
A peasant, who died about five years ago, and lived not far from here, was an 
excellent healing medium; his name was Knud, and the people had given him the 
nickname of Vise Knud (the wise Knud) ; directly when he touched a patient he 
knew if the same could be cured or not, and often, in severe cases, the pains of 
the sick person went through his own body. He was also an auditive medium, 
startling the people many times by telling them what was going to happen in the 
future; but the poor fellow suffered much from the ignorance and fanaticism 
around him, and was several times put in prison.</P>
<P>&quot;I am doing all I can to make people acquainted with our grand 
cause.&quot;</P>
<P>A second and more hopeful letter of <B>1881</B>, addressed to the editor of 
the <I>Revue Spirite, </I>is as follows:-</P>
<P>&quot; My dear Brothers,-Here our science advances without noise. An 
excellent writing medium has been developed among us, one who writes 
simultaneously with both hands; while we have music in a room where there are no 
musical instruments ; and where there is a piano it plays itself. At Bergen, 
where I have recently been, I found mediums, who in the dark, made sketches-were 
dessinateurs-using also both hands. I have seen, also, with pleasure that 
several men of letters and of science have begun to investigate our science 
spirite. The pastor Eckhoff, of Bergen, has for the second time preached against 
Spiritualism, &lsquo; this instrument of the devil, this psychographie&rsquo;; 
and to give more of eclat to his sermon he has had the goodness to have it 
printed; so we see that the spirits are working. The suit against the medium, 
Mme. F., in London, is going. the rounds of the papers of Christiania; these 
journals opening their columns, when occasion offers, to ridicule Spiritualism. 
We are, however, friends of the truth, but there are scabby sheep among us of a 
different temperament. From Stockholm they write me that a library of spiritual 
works has been opened there, and that they are to have a medium from Newcastle, 
with whom seances are to be held.&quot;</P>
<P>In the <I>London Spiritual Magazine </I>of May, <B>1885</B>, is a long and 
interesting paper on Swedish Spiritualism, by William Howitt, in which he gives 
quite a notable collection of narratives concerning Phenomenal Spiritual 
Manifestations in Sweden, most of which were furnished by an eminent and learned 
Swedish gentleman - Count Piper. The public have become so thoroughly sated with 
tales of hauntings, apparitions, prevision, etc., that Count Piper&rsquo;s 
narrations would present few, if any features of interest, save in justification 
of one assertion, that Spiritualism is rife in human experience everywhere, even 
though it may not take the same form as a public movement, that it has done in 
America and England.</P>
<P>As early as <B>1864</B>, a number of excellent leading articles commending 
the belief in Spiritual ministry, and the study of such phenomena as would 
promote communion between the &quot;two worlds,&quot; appeared in the columns of 
the <I>Afton Blad, </I>one of the most popular journals circulated in 
Sweden.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Schroepfer :</B> <I>(See </I><B>Germany.</B>)</P>

<P>Scotland :</B> (For early matter <I>see </I>the article <B>Celts.</B>)</P>
<P>Witchcraft.-Witchcraft and sorcery appear to have been practised in the 
earliest historical and traditional times. It is related that during the reign 
of Natholocus in the second century there dwelt in Iona a witch of great renown, 
and so celebrated for her marvellous power that the king sent one of his 
captains to consult her regarding the issue of a rebellion then troubling his 
kingdom. The witch declared that within a short period the king would be 
murdered, not by his open enemies but by one of his most favoured friends, in 
whom he had most especial trust. The messenger enquired the assassin&rsquo;s 
name. &quot;Even by thine own hands as shall be well-known within these few 
dayes,&quot; replied the witch. So troubled was the captain on hearing these 
words that he railed bitterly against her, vowing that he would see her burnt 
before he would commit such a villainous crime. But after reviewing the matter 
carefully in his mind, he arrived at the conclusion that if he informed the king 
of the witch&rsquo;s prophecy, the king might for the sake of his personal 
safety have him put to death, so thereupon he decoyed Natholocus into his 
private chamber and falling upon him with a dagger slew him outright. About the 
year <B>388</B> the devil was so enraged at the piety of St. Patrick that he 
assailed the saint by the whole band of witches in <I>Scotland. </I>St. Patrick 
fled to the Clyde embarking in a small boat for Ireland. As witches cannot 
pursue their victims over running water, they flung a huge rock after the 
escaping saint, which however fell harmless to the ground, and which tradition 
says now forms Dumbarton Rock. The persecution of witches constitutes one of the 
blackest chapters of history. All classes, Catholic and Protestant alike, 
pursued the crusade with equal vigour, undoubtedly inspired by the passage in 
Exodus xxll., <B>18</B>. While it is most probable that the majority of those 
who practised witchcraft and sorcery were of weak mind and enfeebled intellect, 
yet a large number adopted the supposed art for the purpose of intimidation and 
extortion from their neighbours. Witches were held to have sold themselves body 
and soul to the devil. The ceremony is said to consist of kneeling before the 
evil one, placing one hand on her head and the other under her feet, and 
dedicating all between to the service of the devil, and also renouncing baptism. 
The witch was thereafter deemed to be incapable of reformation. No minister of 
any denomination whatever would intercede or pray for her. On sealing the 
compact the devil proceeded to put his mark upon her. Writing on the 
&quot;Witches&rsquo; Mark&quot; Mr. Bell, minister of Gladsmuir in <B>1705</B> 
says:-</P>
<P>&quot;The witches&rsquo; mark is sometimes like a blew spot, or a little 
tale, or reid spots, like fleabiting, sometimes the flesh is sunk in and hollow 
and this is put in secret places, as among the hair of the head, or eyebrows, 
within the lips, under the armpits, and even in the most secret parts of the 
body.&quot; Mr. Robert Kirk of Aberfoill in his <I>Secret Commonwealth 
</I>states: &quot;A spot that I have seen, as a small mole, horny, and brown 
coloured, throw which mark when a large brass pin was thrust (both in buttock, 
nose, and rooff of the mouth) till it bowed (bent) and became crooked, the 
witches, both men and women, nather felt a pain nor did bleed, nor knew the 
precise time when this was doing to them (their eyes only being 
covered).&quot;</P>
<P>In many cases the mark was invisible, and as it was considered that no pain 
accompanied the pricking of it, there arose a body of persons who pretending 
great skill therein constituted themselves as &quot; witch prickers &quot; and 
whose office was to discover and find out witches. The method employed was 
barbarous in the extreme. Having stripped and bound his victim the witch pricker 
proceeded to thrust his needles into every part of the body. When at last the 
victim worn out with exhaustion and agony remained silent, the witch pricker 
declared that he had discovered the mark. Another test for detection was trial 
by water. The suspects were tied hands and great toes together, wrapped in a 
sheet and flung into a deep pool. In cases where the body floated, the water of 
baptism was supposed to give up the accused, while those who sank to the bottom 
were absolved, but no attempt was made at rescue. When confession was demanded 
the most horrible of tortures were resorted to, burning with irons being 
generally the last torture applied. In some cases a diabolic contrivance called 
the &lsquo; witches&rsquo; bridle &quot; was used. The bridle encircled the 
victim&rsquo;s head while an iron bit was thrust into the mouth from which 
prongs protruded piercing the tongue, palate and cheeks. In cases of execution, 
the victim was usually strangled and thereafter burned at the stake.</P>
<P>Witches were accused of a great variety of crimes. A common offence was to 
bewitch milch cattle by turning their milk sour, or curtailing the supply, 
raising storms, stealing children from their graves, and promoting various 
illnesses. A popular device was to make a waxen image of their victim, thrust 
pins into it and sear it with hot irons, all of which their victim felt and at 
length succumbed. Upon domestic animals they cast an evil eye, causing 
emaciation and refusal to take food till at length death ensued. To those who 
believed in them and acknowledged their power, witches were supposed to use 
their powers for good by curing disease and causing prosperity. Witches had a 
weekly meeting at which the devil presided, every Saturday commonly called 
&quot;the witches&rsquo; Sabbath,&quot; their meetings generally being held in 
desolate places or in ruined churches, to which they rode through the air 
mounted on broomsticks. If the devil was not present on their arrival, they 
evoked him by beating the earth with a fir-stick, and saying &quot; Rise up foul 
thief.&quot; The witches appeared to see him in different guises; to some he 
appeared as a boy clothed in green, others saw him dressed in white, while to 
others he appeared mounted on a black horse, After delivering a mock sermon, be 
held a court at which the witches had to make a full statement of their doings 
during the week. Those who had not accomplished sufficient evil were belaboured 
with their own broomsticks, while those who had been more successful were 
rewarded with enchanted bones. The proceedings finished with a dance, the music 
to which the fiend played on his bagpipes.</P>
<P>Robert Burns in his <I>Tale of Tam o&rsquo; Shanter </I>gives a graphic 
description of this orgy. There were great annual gatherings at Candlemas, 
Beltane and Hallow-eve. These were of an International character at which the 
witch sisterhood of all nations assembled, those who had to cross the sea 
performing the journey in barges of egg-shell, while their aerial journeys were 
on goblin horses with enchanted bridles.</P>
<P>Witchcraft was first dealt with by law in <I>Scotland </I>when by a statute 
passed in <B>1563</B> in the Parliament of Queen Mary it was enacted : &quot; 
That na maner of person nor persons of quhatsumever estaite, degree or condition 
they be of, take upon hand in onie times hereafter to use onie maner of 
witchcraft, sorcerie, or necromancie, under the paine of death, alsweil to be 
execute against the user, abuser, as the seeker of the response of 
consultation.&quot;</P>
<P>The great Reformer, John Knox, was accused by the Catholics of <I>Scotland 
</I>of being a renowned wizard and having. by sorcery raised up saints in the 
churchyard of St. Andrews when Satan himself appeared and so terrified 
Knox&rsquo;s secretary that he became insane and died. Knox was also charged 
that by his magical arts in his old age he persuaded the beautiful young 
daughter of Lord Ochiltree to marry him. Nicol Burne bitterly denounces Knox for 
having secured the affections of &quot;ane damosil of nobil blude, and he ane 
auld decrepit creatur of maist bais degree of onie that could be found in the 
country.&quot;</P>
<P>There were numerous trials for witchcraft in the Justiciary Court in 
Edinburgh and at the Circuit Courts, also session records preserved from 
churches all over <I>Scotland </I>show that numerous cases were dealt with by 
the local authorities and church officials, A. J. B. G.</P>
<P>Rodgers, in his <I>Social Life in Scotland, </I>says : &quot; From the year 
<B>1479</B> when the first capital sentence was carried out thirty thousand 
persons had on the charge of using enchantment been in Great Britain cruelly 
immolated of these one fourth belonged to <I>Scotland. </I>No inconsiderable 
number of those who suffered on the charge of sorcery laid claim to necromantic 
acts with intents felonious or unworthy.</P>
<P>When James VI. of <I>Scotland, </I>in the year <B>1603</B>, was called upon 
to ascend the throne of Great Britain and Ireland, his own native kingdom was in 
rather a curious condition. James himself was a man of considerable learning, 
intimate with Latin and Theology, yet his book on Demonology marks him as 
distinctly superstitious and, while education and even scholarship were 
comparatively common at this date in <I>Scotland, </I>more common in fact than 
they were in contemporary England, the great mass of Scottish people shared 
abundantly their sovereign&rsquo;s dread of witches and the like. The efforts of 
Knox and his doughty <I>confreres, </I>it is true, had brought about momentous 
changes in Scottish life, but if the Reformation ejected certain superstitions 
it undoubtedly tended to introduce others. For that stern Calvinistic faith, 
which now began to take root in Scotland, nourished the idea that sickness and 
accident are a mark of divine anger, nor did this theory cease to be common in 
the north till long after King James&rsquo;s day.</P>
<P>It is a pity that the royal author, in the curious treatise mentioned above, 
volunteers but few precise facts anent the practitioners of magic who throve in 
<I>Scotland </I>during his reign. But other sources of information indicate that 
these people were very numerous, and whereas, in Elizabethan England, it was 
customary to put a witch to death by the merciful process of hanging, in 
Jacobean <I>Scotland </I>it was usual to take stronger measures. In short, the 
victim was burnt at the stake ; and it is interesting to note that on North 
Berwick Law, in the county of East Lothian, there is standing to this day a tall 
stone which, according to local tradition, was erstwhile used for the ghastly 
business in question. Yet it would be wrong to suppose that witches and 
sorcerers, though handled roughly now and then, were regarded with universal 
hatred; for in seventeenth century <I>Scotland </I>medicine and magic went hand 
in hand, and the man suffering from a physical malady, particularly one whose 
cause he could not understand, very seldom entrusted himself to a professional 
leech, and much preferred to consult one who claimed healing capacities derived 
from intercourse with the unseen world. Physicians of the latter kind, however, 
were generally experts in the art of poisoning; and, while a good many cures are 
credited to them, their triumphs in the opposite direction would seem to have 
been much more numerous. Thus we find that in July, <B>1702</B>, a certain James 
Reid of Musselburgh was brought to trial, being charged not merely with 
achieving miraculous cures, but with contriving the murder of one David 
Libbertoun, a baker in Edinburgh. This David and his family, it transpires, were 
sworn enemies of a neighbouring household, Christie by name, and betimes their 
feud grew as fierce as that between the Montagues and Capulets; so the Christies 
swore they would bring things to a conclusion, and going to Reid they petitioned 
his nefarious aid. His first act was to bewitch nine stones, these to be cast on 
the fields of the offending baker with a view to destroying his crops; while 
Reid then proceeded to enchant a piece of raw flesh, and&rsquo; also to make a 
statuette of wax-the nature of the design is not recorded, but presumably 
Libbertoun himself was represented-and Mrs. Christie was enjoined to thrust the 
meat under her enemy&rsquo;s door, and then to go home and melt the waxwork 
before her own fire. These instructions she duly obeyed, and a little later the 
victim breathed his last; but Reid did not go unscathed, and after his trial the 
usual fate of burning alive was meted out to him.</P>
<P>A like sentence was passed in July <B>1605</B> on Patrick Lowrie, a native of 
Halic in Ayrshire, and known there as Pat the Witch,&quot; who was found guilty 
of foregathering with endless sorceresses of the neighbourhood, and of assisting 
them in disinterring bodies which they afterwards</P>
<P>dismembered. Doubtless&quot; Alloway&rsquo;s auld haunted Kirk,&quot; sacred 
to the memory of Burns, was among those ransacked for corpses by the band ; yet 
if the crime was a gruesome one it was harmless withal, and assuredly 
Lowrie&rsquo;s ultimate&rsquo; fate was distinctly a hard one! On the other hand 
Isobel Griersone, a Prestonpans woman, received no more than justice when burnt 
to death on the Castle Rock, Edinburgh, in March <B>1607</B>; for the record of 
her poisonings was a formidable one, rivalling that of Wainewright or that of 
Cellini himself while it is even recorded that she contrived to put an end to 
several people simply by cursing them Equally wonderful were the exploits of 
another sorceress, Belgis Todd of Longniddry, who is reported to have compassed 
the death of a man she hated just by enchanting his cat; but this picturesque 
<I>modus operandi </I>was scorned by a notorious Perthshire witch Janet Irwing, 
who about the year <B>1610</B> poisoned sundry members of the family of Erskine 
of Dun, in the county of Angus. The criminal was detected anon, and suffered the 
usual fate; while a few years later a long series of tortures, culminating in 
burning, were inflicted on Margaret Dein (nee Barclay), whose accomplishments 
appear to have been of no commonplace nature. The wife of a burgess of Irvine, 
John Dein, this woman conceived a violent aversion for her brother-in-law, 
Archibald; and on one occasion, when the latter was setting out for France, 
Margaret hurled imprecations at his ship, vowing none of its crew or passengers 
would ever return to their native <I>Scotland. </I>Months went by, and no word 
of Archibald&rsquo;s arrival reached Irvine; while one day a pedlar named 
Stewart came to John Dein&rsquo;s house, and declared that the baneful prophecy 
had been duly fulfilled. The municipal authorities now heard of the affair, and 
arresting Stewart, whom they had long suspected of practising magic, they 
commenced to cross-examine him. At first he would tell nothing, but when torture 
had loosened his tongue he confessed how, along with Margaret Dein, he had made 
a clay model of the ill-starred barque, and thrown this into the sea on a 
particularly stormy night. His audience were horrified at the news, but they 
hastened to lay hands on the sorceress, whereupon they dealt with her as noted 
above.</P>
<P>No doubt this tale, and many others like it, have blossomed very considerably 
in the course of being handed down from generation to generation, and no doubt 
the witches of Jacobean <I>Scotland </I>are credited with triumphs far greater 
than they really achieved. At the same time, scanning the annals of sorcery, we 
find that a number of its practitioners avowed stoutly, when confronted by a 
terrible death, that they had been initiated in their craft by the foul fiend 
himself, or haply by a band of fairies; and thus, whatever capacities these 
bygone magicians really had, it is manifest that they possessed in abundance 
that confidence which is among the secrets of power, and is perhaps the very key 
to success in any line of action. Small wonder, then, that they were dreaded by 
the simple, illiterate folk of their day ; and, musing on these facts, we feel 
less amazed at the credulity displayed by an erudite man like James VI., we are 
less surprised at his declaring that all sorcerers&quot; ought to be put to 
death according to the law of God, the civill and imperiale Law, and municipall 
Law of all Christian nations.&quot;</P>
<P>The last execution of a witch in <I>Scotland </I>took place in Sutherland in 
<B>1722</B>. An old woman residing at Loth was charged amongst other crimes of 
having transformed her daughter into a pony and shod by the devil which caused 
the girl to turn lame both in hands and feet, a calamity which entailed upon her 
son. Sentence of death was pronounced by Captain David Ross, the 
Sheriff-substitute. Rodgers relates &quot; The poor creature when lead to 
the&rsquo; stake was unconscious of the stir made on her account, and warming 
her wrinkled hands at the fire kindled to consume her, said she was thankful for 
so good a blaze. For his rashness in pronouncing the sentence of death, the 
Sheriff was emphatically reproved.&quot;</P>
<P>The reign of ignorance and superstition was fast drawing to a close.</P>
<P>Witchcraft, if it can be so called nowadays, is dealt with under the laws 
pertaining to rogues, vagabonds, fortune-tellers, gamesters, and such like 
characters. <I>(See </I><B>Fortune-telling.</B>)</P><I>
<P>Magic and Demonology.-Magic </I>of the lower cultus, perhaps the detritus of 
Druidism, appears to have been common in <I>Scotland </I>until a late period. We 
find in the pages of Adamnan that the Druids were regarded by St. Columba and 
his priest as magicians, and that he met their sorcery with a superior celestial 
magic of his own. Thus does the religion of one race become magic in the eyes of 
another. Notices of sorcery in <I>Scotland </I>before the thirteenth century are 
scanty, if we except the tradition that Macbeth encountered three witches who 
prophesied his fate to him. We have no reason to believe that Thomas the Rhymer 
(who has been endowed by later superstition with adventures similar to those of 
Tannhauser) was other than a minstrel and maker of epigrams, or that Sir Michael 
Scot was other than a scholar and man of letters. Workers of sorcery were 
numerous but obscure, and although often of noble birth as Lady Glamis and Lady 
Fowlis, were probably very ignorant persons. We get a glimpse of Scottish 
demonology in the later middle ages in the rhymed fragment known as &quot;The 
Cursing of Sir John Rowil,&quot; a priest of Corstorphine, near Edinburgh, which 
dates perhaps from the last quarter of the fifteenth century. It is an invective 
against certain persons who have rifled his poultry-yard, upon whom the priest 
calls down the divine vengeance. The demons who were to torment the evildoers 
are: Garog, Harog, Sym Skynar, Devetinus &quot;the devill that maid the 
dyce,&quot; Firemouth, Cokadame, Tutivillus, Browny, and Syr Garnega, who may be 
the same as that Girnigo, to whom cross children are often likened by angry 
mothers of the Scottish working-classes, in such a phrase as &quot; eh, 
ye&rsquo;re a wee girnigo,&quot; and the Scottish verb, to &quot;girn,&quot; may 
find its origin in the name of a medieval fiend, the last shadow of some 
Teutonic or Celtic deity of unlovable attributes. In Sym Skynar, we may have 
Skyrnir, a Norse giant in whose glove Thor found shelter from an earthquake, and 
who sadly fooled him and his companions. Skyrnir was, of course, one of the 
Jotunn or Norse Titans, and probably one of the powers of winter ; and he may 
have received the popular surname of &quot; Sym&quot; in the same manner as we 
speak of &quot; Jack&quot; Frost. A great deal has still to be done in 
unearthing the minor figures of Scottish mythology and demonology, and even the 
greater ones have not received the attention due to them. In Newhaven, a fishing 
district near Edinburgh, for example, we find the belief current in a fiend 
called Brounger, who is described as an old man who levies a toll of fish and 
oysters upon the local fisherman. If he is not placated with these, he wreaks 
vengeance on the persons who fail to supply him. He is also described as a Flint 
and the son of a Flint,&quot; which proves conclusively that, like Thor and many 
other gods of Asia and America, he was a thunder or weather deity. In fact his 
name is probably a mere corruption of an ancient Scandinavian word meaning 
&quot;to strike,&quot; which still survives in the Scottish expression to &quot; 
make a breenge &quot; at one. To return to instances of practical magic, a 
terrifying and picturesque legend tells how Sir Lewis Bellenden, a lord of 
session, and superior of the Barony of Broughton, near Edinburgh, succeeded by 
the aid of a sorcerer in raising the Devil in the backyard of his own house in 
the Canongate, some-where about the end of the sixteenth century. Sir Lewis was 
a notorious trafficker with witches, with whom his barony of Broughton was 
overrun. Being desirous of beholding his Satanic majesty in person, he secured 
the services of one Richard Graham. The results of the evocation were disastrous 
to the inquisitive judge, whose nerves were so shattered at the apparition of 
the Lord of Hades that he fell ill and shortly afterwards expired.</P>
<P>The case of Major Weir is one of the most interesting in the annals of 
Scottish sorcery. &quot; It is certain,&quot; says Scott, &quot;that no story of 
witchcraft or necromancy, so many of which occurred near and in Edinburgh, made 
such a lasting impression on the public mind as that of Major Weir. The remains 
of the house in which he and his sister lived are still shown at the head of the 
West Bow, which has a gloomy aspect, well suited for a necromancer. It was at 
different times a brazier&rsquo;s shop and a magazine for lint, and in my 
younger days was employed for the latter use; but no family would inhabit the 
haunted walls as a residence; and bold was the urchin from the High School who 
dared approach the gloomy ruin at the risk of seeing the Major&rsquo;s enchanted 
staff parading through the old apartments, or hearing the hum of the necromantic 
wheel, which procured for his sister such a character as a spinner.</P>
<P>&quot;The case of this notorious wizard was remarkable chiefly from his being 
a man of some condition (the son of a gentleman, and his mother a lady of family 
in Clydesdale), which was seldom the case with those that fell under similar 
accusations. It was also remarkable in his case that he had been a Covenanter, 
and peculiarly attached to that cause. In the years of the Commonwealth this man 
was trusted and employed by those who were then at the head of affairs, and was 
in <B>1649</B> commander of the City-Guard of Edinburgh, which procured him his 
title of Major. In this capacity he was understood, as was indeed implied in the 
duties of that officer at the period, to be very strict in executing severity 
upon such Royalists as fell under his military charge. It appears that the 
Major, with a maiden sister who had kept his house, was subject to fits 
of&rsquo; melancholic lunacy, an infirmity easily reconcilable with the formal 
pretences which he made to a high show of religious zeal, He was peculiar in his 
gift of prayer, and, as was the custom of the period, was often called to 
exercise his talent by the bedside of sick persons, until it came to be observed 
that, by some association, with it is more easy to conceive than to explain, he 
could not pray with the same warmth and fluency of expression unless when he had 
in his hand a stick of peculiar shape and appearance, which he generally walked 
with. It was noticed, in short, that when this stick was taken from him, his wit 
and talent appeared to forsake him. This Major Weir was seized by the 
magistrates on a strange whisper that became current respecting vile practices, 
which he seems to have admitted without either shame or contrition. The 
disgusting profligacies which he confessed were of such a character that it may 
be charitably hoped most of them were the fruits of a depraved imagination, 
though he appears to have been in many respects a wicked and criminal hypocrite. 
When he had completed his confession, he avowed solemnly that he had not 
confessed the hundredth part of the crimes which he had committed. From this 
time he would answer no interrogatory, nor would he have recourse to prayer, 
arguing that, as he had no hope whatever of escaping Satan, there was no need of 
incensing him by vain efforts at repentance. His witchcraft seems to have been 
taken for granted on his own confession, as his indictment was chiefly founded 
on the same document, in which he alleged he had never seen the devil, but any 
feeling he had of him was in the dark. He received sentence of death, which he 
suffered <B>12</B>th April, <B>1670</B>, at the Gallow-hill, between Leith and 
Edinburgh. He died so stupidly sullen and impenitent as to justify the opinion 
that he was oppressed with a kind of melancholy frenzy, the consequence perhaps 
of remorse, but such as urged him not to repent, but to despair. It seems 
probable that he was burnt alive. His sister, with whom he was supposed to have 
had an incestuous connection, was condemned also to death, leaving a stronger 
and more explicit testimony of their mutual sins than could be extracted from 
the Major. She gave, as usual, some account of her connection with the queen of 
the fairies, and acknowledged the assistance she received from that sovereign in 
spinning an unusual quantity of yarn. Of her brother she said that one day a 
friend called upon them at noonday with a fiery chariot, and invited them to 
visit a friend at Dalkeith, and that while there her brother received 
information of the event of the battle of Worcester. No one saw the style of 
their equipage except themselves. On the scaffold this woman, determining, as 
she said, to die &quot; with the greatest shame possible&quot; was with 
difficulty prevented from throwing off her clothing before the people, and with 
scarce less trouble was she flung from the ladder by the executioner. Her last 
words were in the tone of the sect to which her brother had so long affected to 
belong:</P>
<P>&quot;Many,&quot; she said, &quot; weep and lament for a poor old wretch like 
me; but alas, few are weeping for a broken covenant.&quot;</P><I>
<P>Alchemy.- James </I>IV. was attached to the science of alchemy. &quot;Dunbar 
speaks of the patronage which the king bestowed upon certain adventurers, who 
had studied the mysteries of alchemy, and were ingenious in making &lsquo; 
quintiscence&rsquo; which should convert other metals into pure gold; and in the 
Treasurer&rsquo;s Accounts there are numerous payments for the &lsquo;quinta 
essentia,&rsquo; including wages to the persons employed, utensils of various 
kinds, coals and wood for the furnaces, and for a variety of other materials, 
such as quicksilver, aqua vitae, litharge, auri, fine tin, burnt silver, alum, 
salt and eggs, saltpetre, etc. Considerable sums were also paid to several 
&lsquo; Potingairs&rsquo; for stuff of various kinds to the Quinta Essentia. 
Thus, on the <B>3</B>rd of March, <B>1501</B>, &lsquo;the king sent to Strivelin 
(Stirling) four Harry nobles in gold, &lsquo;-a sum equal, as it is stated, to 
nine pounds Scots money-&rsquo; for the leech to multiply.&rsquo; On the 
<B>27</B>th of May, <B>1502</B>, the Treasurer paid to Robert Bartoun, one of 
the king&rsquo;s mariners, &lsquo; for certain droggis (drugs) brocht home by 
him to the French leich, &pound;<B>31</B> : <B>4</B> : o.&rsquo; On the 
<B>11</B>th of February, <B>1503</B>-<B>4</B>, we find twenty shillings 
given&rsquo; to the man suld mak <I>aurum potabile, </I>be the king&rsquo;s 
commands.&rsquo; And on the <B>13</B>th of October, <B>1507</B>, the Treasurer 
paid six pounds for a puncheon of wine to the Abbot of Tungland, to&rsquo; mak 
Quinta Essentia.&rsquo; The credulity and indiscriminate generosity of the 
Scottish monarch appear to have collected around him a multitude of quacks of 
all sorts, for, besides the Abbot, mention is made of &lsquo; the leech with the 
curland hair&rsquo; ; of &lsquo;the lang Dutch doctor,&rsquo; of one Fullertone, 
who was believed to possess the secret of making precious stones ; of a Dr. 
Ogilvy who laboured hard at the transmutation of metals, and many other 
empirics, whom James not only supported in their experiments, but himself 
assisted in their laboratory. The most noted of these adventurers was the person 
who is variously styled in the Treasurer&rsquo;s Accounts &lsquo;the French 
Leich,&rsquo; &lsquo; Maister John the French Leich,&rsquo; &lsquo; Maister John 
the French Medicinar,&rsquo; and &lsquo;French Maister John.&rsquo; The real 
name of this empiric was John Damian; and we learn from Dunbar that he was a 
native of Lombardy, and had practised surgery and other arts in France before 
his arrival in Scotland. His first appearance at the court of James was in the 
capacity of a French leech, and as he is mentioned among the persons who 
received &lsquo; leveray&rsquo; in <B>1501</B>-<B>2</B>, there can be no doubt 
that he held an appointment as a physician in the royal household. He soon 
succeeded in ingratiating himself with the king, and it is probable that it was 
from him that James imbibed a strong passion for alchemy, as he about this time 
erected at Stirling a furnace for prosecuting such experiments, and continued 
during the rest of his reign to expend considerable sums of money in attempts to 
discover the philosopher&rsquo;s stone. &lsquo;Maister John,&rsquo; says Bishop 
Lesley, &lsquo; caused the king believe, that he by multiplying and utheris his 
inventions sold make fine gold of uther metal, quhilk science he callit the 
Quintassence, whereupon the king made great cost, but all in vain.&rsquo; There 
are numerous entries in the Treasurer&rsquo;s Accounts of sums paid for 
saltpetre, bellows, two great stillatours, brass mortars, coals, and numerous 
vessels of various shapes, sizes, and denominations, for the use of this foreign 
adept in his mystical studies. &lsquo; These, however, were not his sole 
occupations ; for after the mysterious labours of the day were concluded, Master 
John was wont to play at cards with the sovereign-a mode by which he probably 
transferred the contents of the royal exchequer into his own purse, as 
efficaciously as by his distillations.&rsquo; We find that on the <B>4</B>th of 
March, <B>1501</B>, nine pounds five shillings were paid &lsquo; to the king and 
the French leich to play at cartis.&rsquo; A few months later, on the occasion 
of a temporary visit which the empiric found it necessary to pay to France, 
James made him a present of his own horse and two hundred pounds. Early in the 
year <B>1504</B>, the Abbot of Tungland, in Galloway, died, and the king, with a 
reckless disregard of the dictates of duty, and even of common decency, 
appointed this unprincipled adventurer to the vacant office. On the <B>11</B>th 
March, the Treasurer paid &lsquo;to Gareoch Parsuivant fourteen shillings to 
pass to Tungland for the Abbacy to French Maister John.&rsquo; On the 
<B>12</B>th of the same month, &lsquo;by the king&rsquo;s command,&rsquo; he 
paid &lsquo;to Bardus Altovite Lumbard twenty-five pounds for Maister John, the 
French Mediciner, new maid Abbot of Tungland, whilk he aucht (owed) to the said 
Bardus ; &lsquo; and a few days later on the <B>17</B>th, there was given 
&lsquo;to Maister John the new maid Abbot of Tungland, seven pounds.&rsquo; 
Three years after, in <B>1507</B>, July <B>27</B>, occurs the following entry: 
&lsquo; Item,. lent, by the king&rsquo;s command to the Abbot of Tungland, and 
can nocht be gettin fra him &pound;<B>33</B> : <B>6</B>: <B>8</B>.&rsquo; An 
adventure which befel this dexterous impostor afforded great amusement to the 
Scottish court. On the occasion of an embassy setting out from Stirling to the 
court of France, he had the assurance to declare that by means of a pair of 
artificial wings which he had constructed, he would undertake to fly to Paris 
and arrive long before the ambassadors. &lsquo;This time,&rsquo; says Bishop 
Lesley, &lsquo;there was an Italiane with the king, who was made Abbot of 
Tungland. This abbot tuke in hand to flie with wings, and to be in France before 
the said ambassadors; and to that effect he caused make ane pair of wings of 
feathers, quhilk bein festinitt uponn him he flew off the castle-wall of 
Stirling but shortly he fell to the ground and broke his thie-bane; but the wyte 
(blame) thereof he ascribed to their beand some hen feathers in the wings, 
quhilk yarnit, and coveted the myddin and not the skies.&rsquo; This incident 
gave rise to Dunbar&rsquo;s satirical ballad entitled, &lsquo; Of the Fenyeit 
Friar of Tungland,&rsquo; in which the poet exposes in the most sarcastic strain 
the pretensions of the luckless adventurer, and relates with great humour the 
result of his attempt to soar into the skies, when he was dragged to the earth 
by the low-minded propensities of the &lsquo; hen feathers,&rsquo; which he had 
inadvertently admitted into the construction of his wings. The unsuccessful 
attempt of the abbot, though, according to Lesley, it subjected him to the 
ridicule of the whole kingdom, does not appear to have lost him the king&rsquo;s 
favour, for the Treasurer&rsquo;s books, from October, <B>1507</B>, to August, 
<B>1508</B>, repeatedly mention him as having played at dice and cards with his 
majesty; and on the <B>8</B>th of September, <B>1508</B>, &lsquo;Damiane, Abbot 
of Tungland,&rsquo; obtained the royal permission to pursue his studies abroad 
during the space of five years. He must have returned to Scotland, however, 
before the death of James; and the last notice given to this impostor is quite 
in character. On the <B>27</B>th of March, <B>1513</B>, the sum of twenty pounds 
was paid to him for his journey to the mine in Crawford Moor, where the king had 
at that time artisans at work searching for gold.&quot; From this reign to that 
of Mary no magician or alchemical practitioner of note appears to have existed 
in <I>Scotland, </I>and in the reign of James VI. too great severity was 
exhibited against such to permit of them avowing themselves publicly. In 
James&rsquo;s reign, however, lived the celebrated Alexander Seton (q.v.), of 
Port Seton near Edinburgh, known abroad as &lsquo;The Cosmopolite&rsquo; who is 
said to have succeeded in achieving the transmutation of metals. L S.</P><I>
<P>Highlands.-Pagan Scotland </I>appears to have been entirely devoid of 
benevolent deities. Those representatives of the spirit world who were on 
friendly terms with mankind were either held captive by magic spells, or had 
some sinister object in view which caused them to act with the most plausible 
duplicity. The chief demon or deity - one hesitates which to call her-was a 
one-eyed Hag who had tusks like a wild bear. She is referred to in folk tales 
as&quot; the old wife&quot; (Cailleach), &quot; Grey Eyebrows&quot; &quot;the 
Yellow Muitearteach,&quot; etc., and reputed to be a great worker of spells. 
Apparently she figured in a lost creation myth, for fragmentary accounts survive 
of how she fashioned the hills, brought lochs into existence and caused 
whirlpools by vengeful operations in the sea. She is a lover of darkness, 
desolations and winter. With her hammer she alternately splinters mountains, 
prevents the growth of grass or raises storms. Numerous wild animals follow her, 
including deer, goats, wild boars. When one of her sons is thwarted in his love 
affairs by her, he transforms her into a mountain boulder &quot; looking over 
the sea,&quot; a form she retains during the summer. She is liberated again on 
the approach of winter. During the Spring months the Hag drowns fishermen and 
preys on the food supply : she also steals children and roasts them in her cave. 
Her progeny includes a brood of monstrous giants each with several heads and 
arms. These are continually operating against mankind, throwing down houses, 
abducting women and destroying growing crops. Heroes who fight against them 
require the assistance of the witch who is called &quot; Wise Woman,&quot; from 
whom they obtain magic wands. The witch of Scottish folk tales is the &quot; 
friend of man,&quot; and her profession was evidently regarded in ancient times 
as a highly honourable one. Wizards also enjoyed high repute ; they were the 
witch - doctors, priests and magicians of the Scottish Pagans, and it was not 
until the sixteenth century that legal steps were taken to suppress them in the 
Highland districts. There was no sun-worship or moon-worship in <I>Scotland; 
</I>neither sun nor moon were individualised in the Gaelic language; these 
bodies; however were reputed to exercise a magical influence. The moon 
especially was a &quot; Magic Tank &quot; from which supplies of power were 
drawn by those capable of performing requisite ceremonies. But although there 
were no lunar or solar spirits, there were numerous earth and water spirits. The 
water wife,&quot; like the English &quot; mere wife,&quot; was a greatly dreaded 
being who greedily devoured victims. She must not be confused with the Banshee, 
that Fate whose chief business it was to foretell disasters, either by washing 
blood-stained garments or knocking, knocking on a certain boulder beside a 
river, or in the locality where some great tragedy was impending. The water wife 
usually confronted a late traveller at a ford. She claimed him as her own and if 
he disputed her claim, asked what weapons he had to use against her. The unwary 
one named each in turn, and when he did so the power to harm her passed away. 
One story of this character runs : &quot;The wife rose up against the smith who 
rode his horse, and she said, &quot;I have you: what have you against me 
?&quot;&quot; My sword,&quot; the man answered. &quot; I have that,&quot; she 
said, what else ? &quot; &quot;My shield,&quot; the man said. &quot; I have that 
and you are mine.&quot; &quot;But,&quot; protested the man, &quot; I have 
something else.&quot; &quot;What is that? &quot; the water wife demanded. To 
this question the cautious smith answered, &quot;I have the long, grey, sharp 
thing at my thigh.&quot; This was his dirk, and not having named it, he was able 
to make use of it. As he spoke he flung his plaid round the water wife and 
lifted her up on his horse behind him. Enclosed in the magic circle she was 
powerless to harm him, and he rode home with her, deaf to her entreaties and 
promises. He took her to his smithy and tied her to the anvil. That night her 
brood came to release her. They raised a tempest and tore the roof off the 
smithy, but the smith defied them. When day dawned they had to retreat. Then he 
bargained with the water wife, and she consented if he would release her that 
neither he nor any of his descendants should ever be drowned in any three rivers 
he might name. He named three and received her promise, but as she made her 
escape she reminded him of a fourth river. &quot; It is mine still,&quot; she 
added. In that particular river the smith himself ultimately perished.&quot; To 
this day fishermen will not name either the fish they desire to procure or those 
that prey on their catches. Haddocks are &quot; white bellies,&quot; salmon 
&quot;red ones,&quot; and the dog-fish &quot;the big black fellow.&quot; It is 
also regarded unlucky to name a minister, or refer to Sunday, in a fishing 
boat-a fact which suggests that in early Christian times fishermen might be 
pious churchmen on land but continued to practise paganism when they went to 
sea, like the Icelandic Norsemen who believed that Christ ruled their island, 
and Thor the ocean. Fairies must not be named on Fridays or at Hallowe&rsquo;en, 
and Beltain (May Day) when charm fires were lit.</P>
<P>Earth worship, or rather the propitiation of earth spirits, was a prominent 
feature of Scottish paganism. There again magic played a leading role. Compacts 
were confirmed by swearing over a piece of turf, certain moors or mounds were 
set apart for ceremonial practices, and these were visited for the performance 
of child-procuring and other ceremonies which were performed at a standing 
stone. In cases of sickness a divination cake was baked and left at a sacred 
place; if it disappeared during the night, the patient was supposed to recover; 
if it remained untouched until the following morning it was believed that the 
patient would die. This practice is not yet obsolete. Offerings were constantly 
made to the earth spirits. In a witch trial recorded in Humbie Kirk Session 
Register (<B>23</B>rd September, <B>1649</B>) one Agnes Gourlay is accused of 
having made offerings of milk, saying, &quot; God betuch ws to; they. are wnder 
the yird that have as much need of it as they that are above the yird&quot; ; 
<I>i.e., </I>&quot; God preserve us too ; they are under the earth that have as 
much need of it as they that are above the earth.&quot; The milk poured out upon 
the earth at magical ceremonies was supposed to go to the fairies. Gruagach 
stones have not yet entirely vanished in the Highlands. These are flat stones 
with deep cup&quot; marks. After a cow is milked, the milker pours into a hole 
the portion of milk required by the Gruagach, a long-haired spirit who is 
usually &quot; dressed like a gentleman.&quot; If no offering is given to him, 
the cream will not rise on the milk, and, if it does the churning will be a 
failure. There are interesting records in the Presbytery records of Dingwall, 
Ross-shire, regarding the prevalence of milk pouring and other ceremonies during 
the seventeenth century. Among the &quot;abominations&quot; referred to are 
those for which Gairloch parish continued to be notorious-frequent approaches to 
some ruinous chappels and circulateing them ; and that future events in 
reference especiallie to lyfe and death, in takeing of journeyes, was exspect to 
be manifested by a holl (hole) of a round stone quherein (wherein) they tryed 
the entering of their heade, which (if they) could doe, to witt, be able to put 
in their heade, they exspect thair returning to that place, and failing they 
considered it ominous.&quot; Objection was also taken by the horrified 
Presbytery to &quot;their adoring of wells and superstitious monuments and 
stones,&quot; and to the &quot; sacrifice of bulls at a certaine tyme uppon the 
<B>25</B> of August&quot; and to &quot;pouring milk upon hills as 
oblationes.&quot;</P>
<P>The seer was usually wrapped in the skin of a sacrificed bull and left lying 
all night beside a river. He was visited by supernatural beings in the darkness 
and obtained answers regarding future events. Another way to perform this 
divination ceremony was to roast a live cat. The cat was turned on a spit until 
the &quot; Big Cat&quot; (the devil) appeared and either granted the wish of the 
performer of the ceremony, or foretold what was to take place in answer to a 
query. At the present day there are many surviving beliefs regarding witchcraft, 
fairies, the evil eye, second sight and magical charms to cure or injure.</P>
<P>Individuals, domesticated animals and dwellings are charmed against 
witchcraft by iron and certain herbs or berries. The evil eye influence is 
dispelled by drinking &quot;water of silver&quot; from a wooden bowl or ladle. 
The water is taken from a river or well of high repute ; silver is placed in it; 
then a charm is repeated, and when it has been passed over a fire, the victim is 
given to drink and what remains is sprinkled round the hearth-stone with 
ceremony which varies in districts. Curative charms are handed down in families 
from a male to a female and a female to a male. Blood-stopping charms are still 
regarded with great sanctity and the most persistent collectors have been unable 
to obtain them from those who are reported to be able to use these with effect. 
Accounts are still given of &quot; blood-stopping&quot; from a distance. 
Although the possessor of the power has usually a traditional charm, he or she 
rarely uses it without praying also. Some Highland doctors bear testimony in 
private to the wonderful effects of &quot; blood-stopping&quot; operations. A 
few years ago a medical officer of Inverness-shire stated in his official report 
to the County Council that he was watching with interest the operations of 
&quot; King&rsquo;s Evil Curers &quot; who still enjoy great repute in the 
Western Isles. These are usually seventh sons.&quot; &quot; Second-sight,&quot; 
like the power to cure and stop blood, runs in families. There is not a parish 
in the Scottish Highlands without its family in which one or more individuals 
are reputed to have occult powers. Some have visions either while awake or 
asleep. Others hear ominous sounds on occasions and are able to understand what 
they signify. Certain individuals confess, but with no appreciation of the 
faculty, that they are sometimes, not always, able to foretell that a person is 
likely to die are long. Two instances of this kind may be given. A younger 
brother caught a chill. When an elder brother visited him he knew at once the 
young man would die soon, and communicated a statement to that effect to a 
mutual friend. According to medical opinion the patient who was not confined to 
bed, was in no danger, but three months afterwards he developed serious symptoms 
and died suddenly. When intelligence of the death was communicated to the elder 
brother he had a temporary illness. The same individual met a gentleman in a 
friend&rsquo;s house and had a similar experience: he &quot;felt&quot; he could 
not explain how, that this man was near death. On two occasions within the 
following week he questioned the gentleman&rsquo;s daughter regarding her 
father&rsquo;s health and was informed that he was &quot;as usual.&quot; The 
daughter was surprised at the inquiries. Two days after this meeting the 
gentleman in question expired suddenly while sitting in his chair. Again the 
individual, on hearing of the death, had a brief but distressing illness, with 
symptoms usually associated with shock. The mother of this man has a similar 
faculty. On several occasions she has seen lights. One day during the Boer War 
an officer passing her door bade her good-bye as he had been ordered to South 
Africa. She said, &quot; He will either be slain or come back deformed,&quot; 
and turned ill immediately. A few months afterwards the officer was wounded in 
the lower jaw with a bullet and returned home with his face much deformed.</P>
<P>The &quot; Second-sight&quot; faculty manifests itself in various ways, as 
these instances show, and evidence that it is possessed by individuals may occur 
only once or twice in a lifetime. There are cases, however, in which it is 
constantly active. Those who are reputed to have the faculty are most reticent 
regarding it, and appear to dread it. At the close of the nineteenth century 
tow-charms to cure sprains and bruises were sold in a well-known Highland town 
by a woman who muttered a metrical spell over each magic knot she tied as the 
afflicted part was treated by her. She had numerous patients among all classes. 
Bone-setters still enjoy high repute in localities: not many years ago a public 
presentation was made to a Ross-shire bone-setter in recognition of his lifelong 
services to the community. His faculty was inherited from his forbears.</P>
<P>Numerous instances may be gleaned in the Highlands of the appearance of the 
spirits of the living and the dead. The appearance of the spirit of a living 
person is said to be a sure indication of the approaching death of that 
individual. It is never seen by a member of the family, but appears to intimate 
friends.</P>
<P>Sometimes it speaks and gives indication of the fate of some other mutual 
acquaintance. </P>

<P>Scott, David and William Bell :</B> These brothers, of whom <I>David </I>is 
by far the more important, certainly deserve a place in this volume, Born at 
Edinburgh in <B>1777</B>, <I>David </I>lived a comparatively uneventful life, 
his lofty gifts being quite unrecognised by his contemporaries, and his death in 
<B>1849</B> being hastened in some degree by this persistent neglect. Nowadays, 
however, connoisseurs in Scotland are beginning to appreciate him, perceiving in 
his output technical merits far transcending those of Raeburn himself; while 
people who care for art dealing with the supernatural are coming to see, slowly 
but surely, that Scott&rsquo;s <I>Paracelsus </I>and <I>Vasco de Gama </I>are in 
the forefront of work of this kind; and that his beautiful drawings for <I>The 
Ancient Mariner </I>render the very spirit of Coleridge, the arch-mystic, render 
it with a skill unsurpassed in any previous or subsequent illustrations to the 
poem.</P><I>
<P>William Bell Scott </I>was also a native of Edinburgh, being born there in 
<B>1811</B>, and his career was very different from <I>David&rsquo;s, </I>for he 
won worldly success from the first, and ere his death in <B>1890</B> he had 
received many laurels. Etching some of his brother&rsquo;s works, and painting a 
host of pictures, he was also a voluminous writer; and his <I>Autobiography 
</I>contains some really valuable comments on the mystic symbolism permeating 
the painting of the middle-ages, and embodies also a shrewd and interesting 
account of Rossetti&rsquo;s essays in table-turning and kindred practices. 
Moreover, <I>William Bell&rsquo;s </I>poems are almost all of a metaphysical 
order; and though it is extravagant to call him &quot;the Scottish Blake,&quot; 
as many people have done, his mystical verse undoubtedly reflects a certain 
&quot; meditative beauty,&quot; as Fiona Macleod once wrote on the 
subject.</P><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Scott or Scot, Michael :</B> Scottish Astrologer and Magician 
(<B>1175</B>-<B>1234</B>). Though <I>Michael Scott&rsquo;s </I>life is wrapped 
in obscurity his name is rather a familiar one, various causes having brought 
this about. In the first place, Dante refer to him in his <I>Inferno, 
</I>speaking of him as one singularly skilled in magical arts; while he is also 
mentioned by Boccaccio, who hails him as among the greatest masters of 
necromancy. Moreover, Coleridge projected a drama dealing with <I>Michael, 
</I>whom he asserted was a much more interesting personality than Faustus; and 
then there is a novel about him by Allan Cunningham, while, above all, he 
figures in <I>The&rsquo; Lay of the Last Minstrel. </I>And Sir Walter Scott, no 
very careful antiquarian, identifies the astrologer with one <I>Sir Michael 
Scott </I>of Balwearie, who, along with Sir David Wemyss of Wemyss, went to 
bring the Maid of Norway to Scotland in <B>1290</B>; but this identification is 
manifestly wrong, for in a poem by Vincent de Beauvais published so early as 
<B>1235</B>, <I>Michael </I>is mentioned as lately deceased. Of course this does 
not vitiate the idea that he emanated from the family of Balwearie, whose 
estates were situate near Kirkcaldy, in Fife; and it is almost certain indeed, 
that he was a man of gentle birth, it being recorded that he studied at Oxford 
university, where it is improbable he would have gone had his parents not been 
in comparatively affluent circumstances. When his Oxonian days were over 
<I>Michael </I>proceeded to the Sorbonne at Paris, where he acquired the title 
of <I>mathematicus; </I>and from the French capital he wandered on to Bologna, 
in those days famous as a seat of learning. He did not tarry here for long, 
however, but went to Palermo; while subsequently he settled for a while at 
Toledo, for he was anxious to study Arabic, and that town afforded good 
facilities therefor. He appears to have been successful with these studies, 
mastering the intricacies of the Arabic tongue thoroughly; yet there was nothing 
to induce him to continue in Spain, and accordingly he went to Sicily, where he 
became attached to the court of Ferdinand II., probably in the capacity of 
state-astrologer. At least, he is so designated in an early manuscript copy, now 
in the Bodleian Library, of his book on astronomy; yet it is clear that, at some 
time or other, <I>Michael </I>had espoused holy orders. For in <B>1223</B> the 
Pope, Honorius III., wrote to the Archbishop of Canterbury, urging him to 
procure an English benefice for <I>Scott, </I>while it appears that in the 
following year the Archbishopric of Cashel in Ireland was offered to him, and 
that he declined this on account of his total ignorance of the Erse language. 
This refusal to take a post for which he was unsuited reflects great credit on 
him, and it is patent that he was highly esteemed at the Vatican, for in 
<B>1227</B> Gregory IX., successor of Honorius, made further overtures to the 
English primate on behalf of <I>Michael; </I>and, whether these proved fruitful 
or not, according to Roger Bacon the necromancer came to England in <B>1230</B>, 
bringing with him the works of Aristotle-at that date virtually unknown in this 
country-and contriving to give them a certain popularity amongst scholars.</P>
<P>It is reasonable to suppose that <I>Michael, </I>having come to England, also 
paid a visit to his native Scotland. And, though no documentary evidence is 
forthcoming to support this theory, local tradition at Melrose contends that the 
astrologer came to that town in his old age, and that he died there and was 
buried somewhere in the neighbourhood. Various other places in the Borders 
likewise claim this distinction, and Sir Walter Scott tells that, throughout the 
south of Scotland, &quot;any great work of great labour or antiquity is ascribed 
either to Auld Michael, Sir William Wallace, or the Devil.&quot; One popular 
story about the necromancer maintains that he used to ride through the air on a 
demon horse, and another that he was wont to sail the seas on the back of some 
fabulous animal; while yet a further legend recounts that he went as Scottish 
envoy to the king of France, and that the first stamp of his black steed&rsquo;s 
horse rang the bells of Notre Dame, whereupon his most Christian majesty granted 
the messenger all he desired.</P>
<P>As regards the writings of <I>Michael, </I>he is credited with a translation 
of Aristotle&rsquo;s <I>De Animalibus, </I>but the ascription is not very well 
founded. However, it is almost certain that he wrote <I>Quaesto Curiosa </I>de 
<I>Natura Solis et Lunae, </I>which is included in the <I>Theatrum Chemicum; 
</I>while he was undoubtedly author of <I>Mensa Philosophica, </I>published at 
Frankfort in <B>1602</B> ; and also of <I>Liber Physiognomiae Magistri Michaelis 
Scot, </I>a book which was reprinted nearly twenty times, and was translated 
into various languages. Reference has already been made to a manuscript in the 
Bodleian Library attributed to <I>Michael, </I>and it behoves to add here that 
at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, at the Vatican and at the Sorbonne, there are 
further documents purporting to have been penned by the astrologer himself, to 
have been written at his dictation, or to have been copied out by scribes soon 
after the actual author&rsquo;s decease.</P>

<P>Sea Phantoms and Superstitions :</B> Sailors as a class are invariably 
superstitious, while their predilection herein is shared in general by 
fishermen, and others who dwell by the marge of the great deep. The old songs of 
the outer Hebrides are full of wizardry, and this figures too in many a chanty 
composed by bygone seamen; while Captain Marryat, a writer who understood 
sailors as few others have done, testified repeatedly to their firm belief in 
the supernatural. Nor is he the only author who has dealt with this, for, not to 
mention less notable names, Coleridge touched on the matter in his poem of the 
Ancient Mariner; while turning from literature to painting, that exquisite 
Scottish master David Scott, in a memorable canvas now domiciled in the seaport 
town of Leith, shows Vasco de Gama and his henchmen gazing thunderstruck at an 
apparition rising from the waves. And it is scarcely surprising, after all, that 
credulity, in this relation should be a salient characteristic of sailors, the 
mere fact that they live in constant danger of sudden death constituting a good 
explanation and apology. In the duchy of Cornwall, so rich in romantic 
associations of all Sorts, quite a number of stories concerning marine spectres 
have been handed down from generation to generation, and are current and even 
popular to this day. One of these stories ?elates how, on a winter&rsquo;s 
evening when a fierce gale was raging round the Cornish headlands, a fisherman 
chanced to see a ship in distress; and away the man hastened at once, calling on 
some of his fellows to come and aid him in the work of rescuing the perishing. 
In a few minutes a rowing boat had been manned, for Cornish fisherfolk are 
accustomed to go afloat in all weathers and to face the peril of drowning while 
very soon the gallant rescuers were almost within earshot of the distressed 
vessel, and could see her name clearly on the stern: They thought to jump on 
board, their idea being that, were the ship blest with a skilful pilot 
acquainted with the dangers of the coast, she might be steered safely into 
Falmouth harbour; but, just as one of the fishermen stood up in the prow of the 
boat with intent to throw a rope, the great vessel looming before him 
disappeared from sight altogether. She could not have sunk, for had that been 
her fate, some relics thereof must certainly have survived upon the seething 
foam and billows; and, vowing that the devil had conjured up a phantom to induce 
them to put out to sea, the rowers put their boat about speedily, and pulled for 
home with might and main. One and all, they were more afraid of the evil 
one&rsquo;s machinations than of the more genuine perils they were encountering; 
and an analogous, but more reasonable form of credulity on the part of the 
Cornish fisherfolk is instanced by another of their traditions, one associated 
with the village of Sennen Cove. This place is situate at the head of a bay 
flanked by two mighty capes. Sometimes a band of misty vapour stretches right 
across the bay, obscuring the villagers&rsquo; outlook towards the sea beyond 
and whenever this occurs the fisherfolk regard it with awe, believing that it 
warns them not to put out in their boats. At one time, so it is recorded in the 
neighbourhood, Sennen Cove numbered among its inhabitants a group of doughty 
spirits who, wont to laugh at this superstition, were minded to demonstrate its 
absurdity; and accordingly, when the warning band of vapour next made its 
appearance, they sailed off singing gaily. But their boat never returned, their 
fate remained a mystery; and in fine they contrived to strengthen rather than 
weaken the belief they had ridiculed.</P>
<P>Scotland also has her stories of phantom barques. Near Ballachulish, on the 
west coast of Argyllshire, there is a rocky island on which the Macdonalds of 
Glencoe were wont to bury their honoured and laurelled dead; and the lore of the 
district tells that once, some hundreds of years ago, a skiff bearing a beloved 
chieftain&rsquo;s corpse to this place of interment foundered ere reaching its 
destination. A horrible thing was this thought the Macdonalds, a horrible thing 
that the father of the clan should be swept from sea to sea, and be denied a 
resting-place beside his ancestors while anon it appeared as though the affair 
had verily been contrived by supernatural agency, for invariably, just before 
any misfortune overtook the tribe of Macdonald, the wrecked skiff was seen 
drifting about the sea, its dead oarsman clinging to it, and a coffin floating 
in its wake. Only too often this weird vision appeared, and it is said that, on 
the eve of the massacre of Glencoe, the spectre boat bore a crew of ghostly 
female mourners who sang a loud coronach, their wails reverberating far among 
the neighbouring mountains.</P>
<P>Another Highland story contends that a large ship, wrecked off the coast of 
Ross at the time of the first transportation of Celts to Canada, still rises 
occasionally from the waves which erstwhile claimed it as their prey, and, after 
sailing gallantly for a few minutes, suddenly lurches and sinks beneath the 
ocean; while dwellers by the shores of the Solway tell how a certain craft, 
which went down there while conveying a gay bridal party towards Stranraer, is 
frequently seen driving at full speed before the gale, the bride and bridegroom 
clinging to the rigging as though in terror of immediate death by drowning. Nor 
is this the only phantom wherein the Solway rejoices, for that proverbially 
treacherous firth, round which Sir Walter Scott has cast so potent a halo of 
romance in <I>Redgauntlet, </I>witnessed once upon a time the foundering of two 
Scandinavian pirate-vessels, and these are said to rise periodically from the 
water, the fierce and murderous crew of each calling the while for the mercy 
which they themselves never accorded their victims.</P>
<P>Bidding adieu to British legends, and looking further afield, we find that 
religion plays a prominent part in stories of spectre ships. At Boulogne, for 
example, there is a tradition to the effect that on one occasion, at a remote 
date in the middle ages, the townspeople were desirous of building a church, for 
at this time they were without any public place of worship ; but, anxious as 
they were to choose a site which the Almighty would approve, they found it dim 
cult to come to a decision on this head, everyone suggesting a different place. 
Finally, in despair, a body of them assembled on the beach, intending to offer 
up prayer for a solution to the problem; and while they were engaged thus they 
happened to look out to sea, when lo a vessel was see,&rsquo; sailing towards 
them, the sacred Virgin herself Oh board. Standing erect in the bows, she 
pointed with her hand in a certain direction; and the devout people realised at 
once that their petition had been answered whereupon the mysterious phantom 
vanished as quickly as it had come. Another French spectre-ship. however, was 
wont to remain in sight for longer periods, while its appearance invariably 
struck terror in to the hearts of all who beheld it. Small wonder too, the 
vessel being manned by a crew of demons and great&rsquo; dogs-the perjured souls 
of men who had been guilty of fearful crimes; yet the pious knew that in reality 
they had little to fear, the priests having told them that the repetition of a 
<I>paternoster </I>was adamantine proof against molestations from the hideous 
vision. Somewhat akin to this story is one associated with Venice, where, one 
stormy evening about the middle of the fourteenth century, a fisherman was 
requested to row three saints to a neighbouring village on the Adriatic; and, 
after bending to his oars for a while, he suddenly stopped and gazed as though 
petrified, a galley filled with swarthy Saracens having risen beside his boat. 
The oarsman vowed he would put back with all speed, but his godly passengers 
bade him be of good cheer, and while they sang an <I>ave maria </I>the ominous 
galley was submerged by the hungry waves. So the fisherman rowed forward and 
reached his haven, the three saints rewarded him with a present of a gold ring, 
and that is why that article figures in the old coat-of-arms of the Venetian 
Republic.</P>
<P>Go where we will, to countries fringed or intersected by the sea, we find 
stories like this, or something like it. In Japan there ate tales of phantom 
junks, and the Chinaman still paints a pair of great eyes on the prow of his 
craft, thinking that these will detect any monsters which chance to be prowling 
afloat; while even on the coasts of America, usually considered so very prosaic 
a land, traditions anent spectral vessels prevail to this day. Kindred stories 
are known in the Ionian Islands, and the folk-lore of Shetland embodies a wealth 
of matter of this sort; while round about the serried coast of Denmark, and the 
windswept fiords of Norway, many a phantom barque is supposed to hover; and 
indeed it was on the North Sea that the most famous of all supernatural ships 
was wont to sail, the ship known to us as &quot;The Flying Dutchman,&quot; and 
to the Germans as &lsquo; Der Fliegende Hollander.&quot; A sailor, so goes the 
romance, had loved a maiden not wisely but too well, and having wronged her he 
grew weary of the <I>liaison, </I>left his sweetheart to languish, and put forth 
on the high seas where he committed many flagrant acts of piracy. But he was not 
to go unrequited, and the fates condemned him to sail wearily and everlastingly 
from shore to shore, this punishment to be endured till be should contrive to 
win the staunch affection of a virtuous woman and prove faithful to her. So the 
wayfarer&rsquo;s barque was driven hither and thither, the guilty man longed to 
tread solid ground once more; but whenever he dared to put in to port, and 
commenced paying addresses to one whom he thought might be able to save him, the 
devil soon placed him on board ship again, and his interminable voyage commenced 
afresh. Century after century went past in this fashion, the ill-starred barque 
gradually becoming familiar to all who sailed upon the grey North Sea, or dwelt 
by its shores; and the legend was not destined to dwindle away before the 
onslaughts of incoming civilisation, for betimes a great artist arose to give a 
new and more genuine immortality to the story. Yes! Richard Wagner evolved from 
it a mighty drama; and sometimes, as we listen to his music-charged so 
abundantly with the weirdness, mystery and glamour of the surging ocean-we can 
verily picture the Dutchman&rsquo;s craft driving before a fearsome gale, and 
see the criminal sitting terror-struck and hopeless at his useless helm.</P>

<P>S&eacute;ance :</B> A sitting held for the purpose of communicating with the 
dead, an essential requirement being that at least one member of the company be 
possessed of mediumistic powers. <I>(See<B> </I>Medium.</B>) Antiquity furnishes 
many examples of what may be called &quot; seances <I>- </I>Saul&rsquo;s 
consultation with the Witch of Endor-but the term is generally used only in 
connection with modern spiritualism. When, in <B>1848</B>, the Fox family at 
Hydesville called in their neighbours to listen to the mysterious sounds which 
have since become famous as the &quot; Rochester Rappings,&quot; the gathering 
was too informal to be called a <I>seance, </I>though all the necessary elements 
were present; but within the next two or three years the contagion spread 
throughout a large part of the eastern states, many &quot; circles&quot; (q.v.) 
were formed, and the phenomena which was in the first instance apparently 
spontaneous was now deliberately induced. In the early stages of the movement 
these <I>seance&rsquo;s </I>were conducted by private mediums, who took no fee 
for their performances, but later professional mediums arose whose 
<I>seance&rsquo;s </I>were open to the public on the payment of a fee. Both 
public and private <I>seance&rsquo;s </I>continued, and still continue, to be an 
indispensable feature of spiritualism.</P>
<P>Besides the presence of a medium there ate other conditions which must be 
observed if the <I>seance&rsquo; </I>is to be productive of phenomena. The chief 
of these is, perhaps, the darkness or semi-darkness of the seance-room, though 
this is by no means an invariable condition. The reason given by spiritualists 
is that light interferes with the manifestations of the spirits, though a less 
charitable construction is sometimes put upon the insistent demand for darkness. 
Sometimes the actual <I>seance&rsquo; </I>is preceded by playing or singing, a 
proceeding which one of Home&rsquo;s sitters states &quot;always gave us a good 
<I>seance.&quot; </I>That this playing and singing was not without its purpose 
we may readily infer, for a state of expectancy and increased receptivity might 
easily be induced thereby, and it may be recalled, <I>en passant, </I>that 
D&rsquo;Eslon and other disciples of Mesmer enjoined their patients to sing, or 
had some instrument played while the patients were seated around the <I>baquet, 
</I>or magnetic tub. To return to the <I>seance </I>; the sitters take their 
places around a table and join hands, thus forming a &quot;chain.&quot; The 
Baron de Guldenstubbe, in giving directions for the forming of a circle and the 
conducting of a <I>seance&rsquo;, </I>says: &quot; In order to form a chain, the 
twelve persons each place their right hand on the table and their left hand on 
that of their neighbour, thus making a circle round the table. Observe that the 
medium or mediums, if there be more than one, are entirely isolated from those 
who form the chain.&quot; Dr. Lapponi, in his <I>Hypnotism and Spiritism, 
</I>says: &quot; He (the medium) then invites some of his assistants to place 
their hands on the table in the following manner. The two thumbs of each person 
are to be touching each other, and each little finger is to be in communication 
with the little fingers of the persons on either side. He himself completes the 
<I>chain </I>with his two hands. The hands of all together rest on the edge of 
the table.&quot; Sometimes, again, as in the <I>seances </I>for table-turning 
and talking, the chain is formed simply by all the operators placing their 
finger-tips on the table. When the spirits have announced their presence by 
raps, tilting of the table, and so on, the chain may or may not be broken, but 
so long as it remains unbroken the sitters are entirely at the mercy of the 
spirits.</P>
<P>The phenomena which are thereafter witnessed are so diverse and varied that 
scarcely any account of a <I>seance&rsquo; </I>precisely matches another in 
detail, yet undoubtedly they all belong to certain well-defined classes. In the 
sphere of &quot;physical&quot; phenomena we have the movements of furniture, 
beginning with the table round which the members of the circle are seated, and 
affecting, perhaps, all the furniture in the room. These antics of inanimate 
objects in the seance-room are often practically identical with the spontaneous 
outbreaks of the poltergeist. Then there are the levitations (q.v.) both of the 
human body and of furniture and inanimate things. We are told of heavy wardrobes 
being raised to the ceiling without visible agency, and of several mediums 
floating upwards in like manner, Elongation (q.v.) is another phenomenon of the 
s&eacute;ance-room, an increase or apparent increase, of from a few inches to a 
foot taking place in the medium&rsquo;s height. Locked doors and cupboards are 
opened without keys, and with-out any trace of violence. Apports (q.v.) of small 
objects-flowers, fruit, jewels, anything, in fact-are brought from a distance 
through closed doors and barred windows, or abstracted in mysterious fashion 
from sealed boxes. Inanimate things show in their actions an almost human 
intelligence. Heavy objects become light enough to be raised by the touch of a 
finger, light articles become so weighty that the combined force of all present 
will not suffice to lift them. The medium can hold live coals in his hand, or in 
his handkerchief, without either being burned. Instruments are played upon when 
no visible hand is near them, or music is produced from the empty air without 
any instruments at all. Luminous hands and faces float in the air, sometimes 
recognised by the sitters as belonging to deceased friends and relatives, and 
touchings and caresses are felt. A breeze suddenly springs up in the seance-room 
though the doors and windows are still closed-and curtains and the clothes of 
the sitters are inflated. If the <I>stance&rsquo; </I>is an especially 
successful one, complete spirit forms may be materialised. If the latter 
manifestation is to be asked for, a small cabinet is usually provided, into 
which the medium retires. Soon afterwards the filmy spirit form or forms are 
seen to issue from the cabinet, and in them the Sitters frequently behold lost 
friends or relatives. The spirit forms will move about the room, allow 
themselves to be touched, and will, on occasion, even converse with their 
friends in the flesh, and give away locks of their hair and fragments of their 
clothing. Again, the materialisation may take place in the open, a small 
luminous cloud being first perceived, which gradually developes into a complete 
human figure; or, as has been known to happen, the spirit may seem to issue from 
the medium&rsquo;s side, and remain united to him by a gossamer filament. In 
most cases the head and chin are shrouded in white draperies, only a portion of 
the face being visible. <I>(See </I><B>Materialisation.</B>)</P>
<P>The automatic or &quot;psychical&quot; phenomena are of a different nature. 
Certain manifestations, such as table-tiltings (q.v.), rapping (q.v.), and 
slate-writing (q.v.), where the communication does not apparently come through 
the medium&rsquo;s organism, partake of the character of both</P>
<P>physical&quot; and&quot; psychical&quot; phenomena. Purely&quot; 
psychical&quot; manifestations are the automatic writing and speaking of the 
medium. Sometimes the latter falls spontaneously into a trance, and delivers 
spirit messages while in that state, or the medium may remain to all appearances 
in a normal condition. Not only writings and utterances, but drawings and 
musical compositions may be produced automatically, and though automatism of 
this sort is by no means confined to the seance-room it still plays a large part 
therein, and is especially in favour with the more serious-minded spiritualists, 
to whom communications from the spirit-world are of greater importance than the 
tricks of household furniture.</P>
<P>A representative account of one of the <I>stances </I>of D. D. Home (q.v.), 
is given by H. D. Jencken in <I>Human Nature, </I>February, <B>1867</B>, as 
follows:-</P>
<P>&quot;Mr. Home had passed into the trance still so often witnessed, rising 
from his seat, he laid hold of an armchair, which he held at arms&rsquo; length, 
and was then lifted about three feet clear of the ground ; travelling thus 
suspended in space, he placed the chair next Lord Adare, and made a circuit 
round those in the room, being lowered and raised as he passed each of us. One 
of those present measured the elevation, and passed his leg and arm under Mr. 
Home&rsquo;s feet. The elevation lasted from four to five minutes. On resuming 
his seat, Mr. Home addressed Captain Wynne, communicating news to him of which 
the departed alone could have been cognisant.</P>
<P>&quot;The spirit form that had been seen reclining on the sofa, now stepped 
up to Mr. Home and mesmerised him; a hand was then seen luminously visible over 
his head, about <B>18</B> inches in a vertical line from his head. The trance 
state of Mr. Home now assumed a different character; gently rising he spoke a 
few words to those present, and then opening the door proceeded into the 
corridor; a voice then said :-&rsquo; He will go out of this window and come in 
at that window.&rsquo; The only one who heard the voice was the Master of 
Lindsay, and a cold shudder seized upon him as he contemplated the possibility 
of this occurring, a feat which the great height of the third floor windows in 
Ashley Place rendered more than ordinarily perilous. The others present, 
however, having closely questioned him as to what he had heard, he at first 
replied, &lsquo; I dare not tell you,&rsquo; when, to the amazement of all, a 
voice said, &lsquo;You must tell ; tell directly.&rsquo; The Master then said, 
&lsquo; Yes; yes, terrible to say, he will go out at that window and come in at 
this; do not be frightened, be quiet.&rsquo; Mr. Home now re-entered the room, 
and opening the drawing-room window, was pushed out demi-horizontally into 
space, and carried from one window of the drawing-room to the farthermost window 
of the adjoining room. This feat being performed at a height of about sixty feet 
from the ground, naturally caused a shudder in all present. The body of Mr. 
Home, when it appeared at the window of the adjoining room, was shunted into the 
room feet foremost-the window being only <B>18</B> inches open. As soon as he 
had recovered his footing he laughed and said, &lsquo; I wonder what a policeman 
would have said had he seen me go round and round like a teetotum!&rsquo; The 
scene was, however, too terrible-too strange, to elicit a smile: cold beads of 
perspiration stood on every brow, while a feeling pervaded all as if some great 
danger had passed; the nerves of those present had been kept in a state of 
tension that refused to respond to a joke. A change now passed over Mr. Home, 
one often observable during the trance states, indicative, no doubt, of some 
other power operating on his system. Lord Adare had in the meantime stepped up 
to the open window in the adjoining room to close it-the cold air, as it came 
pouring in, chilling the room; when, to his surprise, he only found the window 
<B>8</B> to <B>24</B> inches open! This puzzled him, for how could Mr. Home have 
passed outside through a window only <B>18</B> to <B>24</B> inches open. Mr. 
Home, however soon set his doubts at rest; stepping up to Lord Adare he said, 
&lsquo; No, no; I did not close the window; I passed thus into the air 
outside.&rsquo; An invisible power then supported Mr. Home all but horizontally 
in space, and thrust his body into space through the open window, head-foremost, 
bringing him back again feet foremost into the room, shunted not unlike a 
shutter into a basement below. The circle round the table having re-formed, a 
cold current of air passed over those present, like the rushing of winds. This 
repeated itself several times. The cold blast of air, or electric fluid, or call 
it what you may, was accompanied by a loud whistle like a gust of wind on the 
mountain top, or through the leaves of the forest in late autumn; the sound was 
deep, sonorous, and powerful in the extreme, and a shudder kept passing over 
those present, who all heard and felt it. This rushing sound lasted quite ten 
minutes, in broken intervals of one or two minutes, All present were much 
surprised and the interest became intensified by the unknown tongues in which 
Mr. Home now conversed. Passing from one language to another in rapid 
succession, he spoke for ten minutes in unknown languages. </P>
<P>&quot;A spirit form now became distinctly visible; it stood next to the 
Master of Lindsay, clad, as seen on former occasions, in a long robe with a 
girdle, the feet scarcely touching the ground, the outline of the face only 
clear, and the tones of the voice, though sufficiently distinct to be 
understood, whispered rather than spoken. Other voices were now heard, and large 
globes of phosphorescent lights passed slowly through the room.&quot;</P>
<P>The following extract is taken from an account of a <I>stance </I>held by 
Professor Lombroso with the famous Italian medium, Eusapia Paladino.</P>
<P>&quot;After a rather long wait the table began to move, slowly at first,-a 
matter explained by the scepticism, not to say the positively hostile spirit, of 
those who were this night in a <I>stance </I>circle for the first time. Then 
little by little, the movements increased in intensity. M. Lombroso proved the 
levitation of the table, and estimated at twelve or fifteen pounds the 
resistance to the pressure which he had to make with his hands in order to 
overcome that levitation.</P>
<P>&quot;This phenomenon of a heavy body sustained in the air, off its centre of 
gravity and resisting a pressure of twelve or fifteen pounds, very much 
surprised and astonished the learned gentleman, who attributed it to the action 
of an unknown magnetic force.</P>
<P>&quot;At my request, taps and scratchings were heard in the table. This was a 
new cause for astonishment, and led the gentlemen to themselves call for the 
putting out of the candles in order to ascertain whether the intensity of the 
noises would be increased, as had been stated, All remained seated and in 
contact.</P>
<P>&quot;In a dim light which did not hinder the most careful surveillance, 
violent blows were first heard at the middle point of the table. Then a bell 
placed upon a round table, at a distance of a yard to the left of the medium (in 
such a way that she was placed behind and to the right of M. Lombroso), rose 
into the air, and went tinkling over the heads of the company, describing a 
circle around our table where it finally came to rest.&quot;</P>
<P>At this <I>seance </I>members of the company also felt themselves pinched and 
their clothes plucked, and experienced the touchings of invisible hands on their 
faces and fingers. The accuracy of the account-written by M. Ciolfi-was 
testified to by Professor Lombroso himself M. J.</P>

<P>Second Sight :</B> The faculty of foreseeing future events which is supposed 
to belong to certain individuals in the Scottish Highlands. The belief in 
<I>second sight </I>dates back to a very early period in the history of these 
regions, and is still very far from being extinct, even in the more accessible 
parts. Saving the name, there is but little in <I>second sight </I>that is 
peculiar to the Celts of Scotland, for it is allied to the clairvoyance, 
prophetic vision, soothsaying, and so on, which have existed from time 
immemorial in practically every part of the world. Yet the <I>second sight 
</I>has certain distinctive features of its own. It may, for instance, be either 
congenital or acquired. In the former case it generally falls to the seventh son 
of a seventh son, by reason, probably, of the potency of the mystic number 
seven. Sometimes a Highlander may find himself suddenly endowed with the 
mysterious faculty. A person gifted with <I>second sight </I>is said to be&quot; 
fey.&quot; Generally there is no apparent departure from the normal 
consciousness during the vision, though sometimes a seer may complain of a 
feeling of disquiet or uneasiness. A vision may be communicated from one person 
to another, usually by contact, but the secondary vision is dimmer than that of 
the original seer. A frequent vision is that of a funeral, indicating that a 
death will shortly take place in the community. This is an instance of the 
<I>second sight </I>taking a symbolical turn, and perhaps this is its usual 
form. Occasionally the apparition of the doomed man will be seen-his wraith, or 
double-while he himself is far distant. Another form frequently taken by the 
<I>second sight </I>is that of &quot;seeing lights.&quot; The lights, too, may 
indicate death, but they may likewise predict lesser happenings, or have no 
significance at all. Thus a light is seen by two persons to hover above the 
&quot;Big House,&quot; then to travel swiftly in the direction of the 
gamekeeper&rsquo;s cottage, where it remains stationary for a while. On the 
morrow the gamekeeper is dead. Again a farmer returning from the market is 
preceded the whole of the way by a ball of fire, rolling along the road ahead of 
him. This time, however, the light portends no alarming occurrence, and the 
excitement of the glen quickly subsides. The lower animals also are said to 
possess <I>second sight, </I>which is especially frequent among dogs and horses. 
Two men were travelling from Easdale to Oban on a stormy night. In traversing a 
short cut through a wood one of them died from fatigue and exposure. That night 
more than one horse had to be carefully led past the spot by his driver, who as 
yet knew nothing of the tragedy. Indeed most Highlanders believe that the 
faculty is common to all the lower animals, else why should they whine and 
bristle when there is nothing visible to human eyes, nothing audible to human 
ears? Notwithstanding that the march of civilisation has caused the Highlander 
partly to conceal his occult beliefs, at least from the unbelieving Sassenach, 
the writer can vouch for the fact that in certain districts <I>second sight 
</I>is almost a commonplace, believed in even by those who avow that they are 
not in the least &quot; superstitious.&quot; M. J.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Secret Tradition :</B> It has long been an article of faith with students of 
occultism that the secret tenets of the various sciences embraced within it have 
been preserved to modern times by a series of adepts, who have handed them down 
from generation to generation in their entirety. There is no reason to doubt 
this belief, but that the adepts in question existed in one unbroken line, and 
that they all professed similar principles is somewhat improbable. But one thing 
is fairly certain, and that is, that proficiency in any one of the occult 
sciences requires tuition from a master of that branch. All serious writers on 
the subject are at one as regards this. It is likely that in neolithic times 
societies existed among our barbarian ancestors, similar in character to the 
Midiwiwin of the North-American Indians, the snake-dancers of the Hopi of New 
Mexico, or the numerous secret societies of aboriginal Australians. This is 
inferred from the certainty that totemism existed amongst neolithic peoples. 
Hierophantic castes would naturally hand down the tradition of the secret things 
of the Society from one generation to another. The early mysteries of Egypt, 
Eleusis, Samothrace, Cabin, and so forth were merely the elaboration of such 
savage mysteries. There would appear to have been throughout the ages, what 
might be called, a fusion of occult beliefs : that when the hierophants of one 
system found themselves in juxtaposition, or even in conflict, with the 
professors of another, the systems in question appear to have received much from 
one another. It has been said that when the ancient mysteries are spoken about, 
it should be understood that one and the same series of sacred ceremonies is 
intended, one and the same initiatory processes and revelations, and that what 
is true of one applies with equal certainty to all the others. Thus Strabo 
records that the strange orgies in honour of the mystic birth of Jupiter 
resembled those of Bacchus, Ceres and Cybele; and the Orphic poems identified 
the orgies of Bacchus with those of Ceres, Rhea, Venus and Isis. Euripides also 
mentions that the rites of Cybele are celebrated in Asia Minor in an identical 
manner with the Grecians mysteries of Dionysius and the Cretan rites of the 
Cabiri. The Rev. Geo. Oliver in his <I>History of Initiation </I>affirms that 
the rites of the science which is now received under the appellation of 
Freemasonry were exercised in the antediluvian world, received by Noah after the 
Flood, practised by man at the building of Babel. conveniences for which were 
undoubtedly contained in that edifice, and at the dispersion spread with every 
settlement already deteriorated by the gradual innovations of the Cabiric 
priests, and moulded into a form, the great outlines of which are distinctly to 
be traced in the mysteries of every heathen nation, and exhibit shattered 
remains of the one true system, whence they were derived. This theory is of 
course totally mischievous, and although there may have been likeneses between 
the rites of certain societies, the idea that all sprang from one common source 
is absurd. One thing, however, is fairly certain: anthropology permits us to 
believe that the concepts of man, religious and mystical, are practically 
identical in whatever part of the world he may exist, and there is every 
possibility that the similarity between early mysteries results in this manner, 
and that it brought about a strong resemblance between the mystical systems of 
the older world. We have satisfactory evidence that the ancient mysteries were 
receptacles of a great deal of occult wisdom, symbolism, magical or semi-magical 
rite, and mystical practice in general; and we are pretty well assured that when 
these fell into desuetude among the more intellectual classes of the various 
countries in which they obtained, they were taken up and practised in secret by 
the lesser ranks of society, even the lowest ranks, who are in all ages the most 
conservative, and who clung faithfully to the ancient systems, refusing to 
partake in the rites of the religions which had ousted them. The same can be 
posited of magical practice. The principles of magic are universal, and there 
can be no reason to doubt that these were handed on throughout the long 
centuries by hereditary castes of priests, shamans, medicine-men, magicians, 
sorcerers, and witches. But the same evidence does not exist with regard to the 
higher magic, concerning which much more difficult questions arise. Was this 
handed on by means of secret societies, occult schools or universities, or from 
adept to adept?&rsquo; We speak not of the sorceries of empirics and savages, 
but of that spiritual magic which, taken in its best sense, shades into 
mysticism. The schools of Salamanca, the mystic colleges of Alexandria, could 
not impart the great truths of this science to their disciples : its nature is 
such that communication by lecture would be worse than useless. It is necessary 
to suppose then that it was imparted by one adept to another. But it is not 
likely that it arose at a very early period in the history of man. In his early 
psychological state he would not require it; and we see no reason for belief 
that its professors came into existence at an earlier period than some three or 
four thousand years B.C. The undisturbed nature of Egyptian and Babylonian 
civilisation leads to the belief that these countries brought forth a long 
series of adepts in the higher magic. We know that Alexandria fell heir to the 
works of these men, but it is unlikely that their teachings were publicly 
disseminated in her public schools. Individuals of high magical standing would 
however be in possession of the occult knowledge of ancient Egypt, and that they 
imparted this to the Greeks of Alexandria is certain, Later Hellenic and 
Byzantine magical theory is distinctly Egyptian in character, and we know that 
its esoteric forms were disseminated in Europe at a comparatively early date, 
and that they placed all other native systems in the background, where they were 
pursued in the shadow by the aboriginal witch and sorcerer. We have thus 
outlined the genealogy of the higher magic from early Egyptian times to the 
European medieval period. Regarding alchemy, the evidence from analogy is much 
more sure, and the same may be said as regards astrology. These are sciences in 
which it is peculiarly necessary to obtain the assistance of an adept if any 
excellence is to be gained in their practice ; and we know that the first 
originated in Egypt, and the second in ancient Babylon. We are not aware of the 
names of those early adepts who carried the sciences forward until the days of 
Alexandria, but subsequent to that period the identity of practically every 
alchemical and astrological practitioner of any note is fully known. In the 
history of no science is the sequence of its professors so clear as is the case 
in alchemy, and the same might almost be said as regards astrology, whose 
protagonists, if they have not been so famous, have at least been equally 
conscientious. We must pass over in our consideration of the manner in which 
occult science survived, the absurd legends which presume to state how such 
societies as the Freemasons existed from antediluvian times; and will content 
ourselves with stating that the probabilities are that in the case of mystical 
brotherhoods a long line of these existed from early times, the traditions of 
which were practically similar. Many persons would be members of several of 
these, and would import the conceptions of one society into the heart of 
another, as we know Rosicrucian ideas were imported into Masonry. <I>(See 
</I><B>Freemasonry.</B>) We seem to see in the mystic societies of the middle 
ages reflections of the older Egyptian and classical mysteries, and there is 
nothing absurd in the theory that the spirit and in some instances even the 
letter of these descended to medieval and perhaps to present times. Such 
organisations die much harder than any credit is given them for doing. We know, 
for example, that Freemasonry was revolutionised at one part of its career, 
about the middle of the seventeenth century, by an influx of alchemists and 
astrologers, who crowded out the operative members, and who strengthened the 
mystical position of the brotherhood, and it is surely reasonable to suppose 
that on the fall or desuetude of the ancient mysteries, their disciples, looking 
eagerly for some method of saving their cults from entire extinction, would join 
the ranks of some similar society, or would keep alive the flame in secret ; but 
the fact remains that the occult idea was undoubtedly preserved through the 
ages, that it was the same in essence amongst the believers in all religions and 
all mysteries, and that to a great extent its trend was in the one direction, so 
that the fusion of the older mystical societies and their re-birth as a new 
brotherhood is by no means an unlikely hypothesis. In the article on the 
&quot;Templars&quot; for example, we have tried to show the possibility of that 
brotherhood having received its tenets from the East, where it sojourned for 
such a protracted period. It seems very likely from what we learn of its rites 
that they were oriental in origin, and we know that the occult systems of Europe 
owed much to the Templars, who, probably, after the fall of their own Order 
secretly formed others or joined existing societies. Masons have a hypothesis 
that through older origins they inherited from the Dionysian artificers, the 
artizans of Byzantium, and the building brotherhoods of Western Europe. To state 
this dogmatically as a fact would not be to gain so much credence for their 
theory as is due to that concerning the dissemination of occult lore by the 
Templars ; but it is much more feasible in every way than the absurd legend 
concerning the rise of Freemasonry at the time of the building of the Temple. 
Secret societies of any description possess a strong attraction for a certain 
class of mind, or else a merely operative handicraft society, such as was 
medieval Masonry, would not have been utilised so largely by the mystics of that 
time. One of the chief reasons that we know so little concerning these 
brotherhoods in medieval times is that the charge of dabbling in the occult arts 
was a serious one in the eyes of the law and the church, therefore they found it 
necessary to carry on their practices in secret. But after the Reformation, a 
modern spirit took possession of Europe, and the protagonists of the occult 
sciences came forth from their caverns and practised in the open light of day. 
In England, for example, numerous persons avowed themselves alchemists; in 
Germany the Rosicrucians sent out a manifesto; in Scotland, Seton, a great 
master of the hermetic art, arose never had occultism possessed such a heyday. 
But it was nearly a century later until further secret societies were formed, 
such as the Academy of the Ancients and of the Mysteries in <B>1767</B>; the 
Knights of the True Light founded in Austria about <B>1780</B>; the Knights and 
Brethren of Asia, which appeared in Germany in the same year; the Order of 
Jerusalem which originated in America in <B>1791</B> ; the Society of the 
Universal Aurora established at Paris in <B>1783</B>. Besides being masonic, 
these societies practised animal magnetism, astrology, Kabalism and even 
ceremonial magic. Others were political, such as the Illuminati, which came to 
such an inglorious end. But the individual tradition was kept up by an 
illustrious line of adepts, who were much more instrumental in keeping alive the 
flame of mysticism than even such societies as those we have mentioned. Mesmer, 
Swedenborg, St. Martin, Pasqually, Willermoz, all laboured to that end. We may 
regard all these as belonging to the school of Christian magicians, as apart 
from those who practised the rites of the grimoires or Jewish Kabalism. The line 
may be carried back through Lavater, Eckartshausen, and so on to the seventeenth 
century. These men were mystics besides being practitioners of theurgic magic, 
and they combined in themselves the knowledge of practically all the occult 
sciences.</P>
<P>With Mesmer began the revival of a science which cannot be altogether 
regarded as occult, when consideration is given to its modern developments, but 
which powerfully influenced the mystic life of his and many later days. The 
mesmerists of the first era are in direct line with the Martinists and the 
mystical magicians of the France of the late eighteenth century. Indeed in the 
persons of some English mystics, such as Greatrakes, mysticism and magnetism are 
one and the same thing. But upon Hypnotism, to give it its modern name, becoming 
numbered with the more practical sciences, persons of &lsquo;a mystical cast of 
mind appear to have, to a great extent, deserted it. Hypnotism does not bear the 
same relation to mesmerism and magnetism as modern chemistry does to alchemy; 
but the persons who practise it nowadays are as dissimilar to the older 
professors of the science as is the modern practitioner of chemistry to the 
medieval alchemist. This is symptomatic of the occult sciences, that they 
despise that knowledge which is exact&quot; in the common sense of the term. 
Their practitioners do not delight in labouring upon a science, the laws of 
which are already known, cut and dried. The student of occultism, as a rule, 
possesses all the attributes of an explorer. The occult sciences have from time 
to time deeply enriched the exact sciences, but these enrichments have been acts 
of intellectual generosity. It is in effect as if the occultist made a present 
of them to the scientist, but did not desire to be troubled with their future 
development in any way. Occultism of the higher sort therefore does not to-day 
possess any great interest in hypnotism, and modern mystics of standing scarcely 
recognise it as a part of the hidden mysteries. But there is no question that 
the early mesmerists formed a link between the adepts of eighteenth-century 
France and those of the present day. The occultists of to-day, however, are 
harking farther back: they recognise that their fore-runners of the seventeenth 
and eighteenth centuries drew their inspiration from older origins, and they 
feel that these may have had cognisance of records and traditions that we wot 
not of, The recovery of these is perhaps for the moment the great question of 
modern magic. But apart from this, modern magic of the highest type strains 
towards mysticism, and partakes more than ever of its character. It disdains and 
ignores ceremonial, and exalts psychic experience. That is not to say that 
numerous bodies do not exist throughout the world for the celebration of magical 
rite ; but such fraternities have existed from time immemorial, and their 
protagonists cannot be placed on a higher footing than the hallucinated 
sorcerers of medieval times.</P>

<P>Secret Words :</B> Certain words relating to the Eucharist were communicated 
by Christ to Joseph of Arimathea and were committed orally from keeper to keeper 
of the Graal. In Robert de Borron&rsquo;s metrical romance, material power is 
added to their Spiritual efficacy and whoever could acquire and retain them, had 
a mysterious power over all around him, could not suffer by evil judgments, 
could not suffer deprivation of his own rights, need not fear the result of 
battle, provided his cause were good. The words were the secret of the Graal and 
were either incommunicable in writing or were written only in the Book of the 
Graal which, de Borron implies, was itself written by Joseph of Arimathea. These 
words are the chief mystery of the Lesser Holy Graal, as the prose version of de 
Borron&rsquo;s poem is called. They were most probably a form of eucharistic 
consecration, and there is evidence that the Celtic church, following the 
example of the Eastern Church used them in addition to the usual consecration as 
practised in the Latin Church, which is merely a repetition of the New Testament 
account of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper. The separate clause they are sup-posed to 
have formed is called Epiclesis and consisted of an invocation of the Holy 
Ghost.</P>

<P>Semites, The :</B> This article on the <I>Semite&rsquo;s </I>applies to the 
more ancient divisions of the race, such as the Babylonians and Assyrians, and 
the Hebrews in Biblical times. For later Semitic occultism see <B>Kabala</B>, 
<B>Arabs</B>, etc. In ancient Babylon, and Chaldea, magic was of course a 
department of priestly activity, and in Mesopotamia we find a sect of priests, 
the Asipu, set apart for the practice of magic, which in their case probably 
consisted of hypnotism, the casting out of demons, the banning of troublesome 
spirits and so forth. The Baru again were augurs who consulted the oracles on 
the future by the inspection of the entrails of animals and the flight of birds, 
&quot;the observation of oil in water, the secret of Anu, Bel, and Ea, the 
tablet of the gods, the sachet of leather of the oracles of the heavens and 
earth, the wand of cedar dear to the great gods.&quot; These priests of Baru and 
Asipu were clothed in vestments peculiar to their. rank, which they changed 
frequently during the ceremonies in which they took part. In the tablets we find 
kings making frequent enquiry through these priestly castes; and in a tablet of 
Sippar, we find treated the installation of a Baru to the Sun-temple, and also 
Sennachrib seeking through the Baro the causes of his father&rsquo;s violent 
death. The Asipu again were exorcists, who removed <I>tabus </I>and laid ghosts. 
We find an Asipu&rsquo;s functions set forth in the following&nbsp;&nbsp; poem

<P>The third caste was the Zammaru, who sang or chanted certain ceremonials.</P>
<P>The lower ranks of sorcery were represented by the Kassapu and Kassaptu, the 
wizard and witch, who, as else-where, practised black magic, and who are stoutly 
combated by the priest-magician caste. We find in the code of Hammurabi a 
stringent law against the professors of black magic :-&quot; If a man has 
charged a man with sorcery and has not justified himself, he who is charged with 
sorcery shall go to the river, he shall plunge into the river, and if the river 
overcome him, he who accused him shall take to himself his house. If the river 
makes that man to be innocent, and he be saved, he who accused him shall be put 
to death. He who plunged into the river shall take to him-self the house of him 
who accused him.&quot; This will recall the test for a witch, that if thrown 
into a pond, if she sinks she is innocent, but. if she floats she is a witch 
indeed. Another series of tablets deals with the black magician and the witch 
who are represented as roaming the streets, entering houses, and prowling 
through towns, stealing the love of men, and withering the beauty of women. The 
exorcist goes on to say that he has made an image of the witch, and he calls 
upon the fire-god to burn it, He seizes the mouth, tongue, eyes, feet, and other 
members of the witch, and piously prays that Sin may cast her into an abyss of 
water and fire, and that her face may grow yellow and green. He fears that the 
witch is directing a like sorcery against himself, that she sits making spells 
against him in the shade of the wall, fashioning images of him. But he sends 
against her the <I>haltappan </I>plant and sesame to undo her spells and force 
back the words into her mouth. He devoutly trusts that the images she has 
fashioned will assume her own character, and that her spells may recoil upon 
herself. Another tablet expresses the desire that the god of night may smite the 
witch in her magic, that the three watches of the night may loose her evil 
sorcery, that her mouth may be fat and her tongue salt, that the words of evil 
that she hath spoken may be poured out like tallow, and that the magic she is 
working be crumbled like salt. The tablets abound in magical matter and in them 
we have the actual wizardry in vogue at the time they were written, which runs 
at least from the seventh century B.C. onwards until the time when the cuneiform 
ceased to be used. Chaldean magic was renowned throughout the world, 
particularly, however, its astrological side. Isaiah says &quot;Let now the 
astrologers, stargazers, monthly prognosticators, stand up and save thee from 
the things that shall come upon thee.&quot; In the book of Daniel, we find the 
magicians called Chaldeans, and up to the present time occultists have never 
tired of singing the praises of the Chaldean magi. Strabo and AElian allude to 
their knowledge of astrology, as did Diodorus Siculus, and it is supposed to 
have been a Chaldean magician OEthanes who introduced his science into Greece, 
which he entered with Xerxes.</P>
<P>The great library of Assurbanipal, king of Assyria, who died in <B>626</B> 
B.C., affords us first-hand knowledge of Assyrian magic. He gathered together 
numerous volumes from the cities of Babylonia, and storing them in his great 
library at Nineveh, had them copied and translated. In fact letters have been 
discovered from Assurbanipal to some of his officials, giving instructions for 
the copying of certain incantations. Many grimoires too come from Babylonia, 
written during the later empire,-the best known of which are the series entitled 
<I>Maklu, </I>burning; <I>Utukki limnuti, </I>evil spirits; <I>Labartu, 
</I>hag-demon; and <I>Nis kati, </I>raising of the hand. There are also 
available many ceremonial texts which throw considerable light on magical 
practice. The <I>Maklu </I>for example contains eight tablets of incantations 
.and spells against wizards and witches-the general idea running through it 
being to instruct the bewitched person how to manufacture figures of his 
enemies, and thus destroy them. The series dealing with the exorcism of evil 
spirits enumerates demons, goblins and ghosts, and consists of at least sixteen 
tablets. They are for the use of the exorcist in driving out devils from 
possessed people, and this is to be accomplished by invoking the aid of the 
gods, so that the demons may be laid under a divine <I>tabu. </I>The demon who 
possesses the unfortunate victim must be described in the most minute manner. 
The series dealing with the <I>Labartu </I>or hag-demon, who is a kind of female 
devil who delights in attacking children, gives directions for making a figure 
of the <I>Labartu </I>and the incantations to be repeated over it. The magician 
and philosopher appear to have worked together in Assyria, for we find medical 
men constantly using incantations to drive out demons, and incantations are 
often associated with prescriptions. Medical magic indeed appears to have been 
of much the same sort as we find amongst the American Indians and peoples in a 
like barbarian condition of existence.</P>
<P>We find the doctrine of the Incommunicable Name established among the early 
Semites, as among the Egyptians: the secret name of a god, which when discovered 
gave the speaker complete power over him by its mere utterance. The knowledge of 
the name, or description, of the person or demon the magician directs his charm 
against, is also essential to success. Drugs also, to which were originally 
ascribed the power vouchsafed by the gods for the welfare of mankind, were 
supposed to aid greatly in exorcism. In Assyrian sorcery, Ea and Marduk are the 
most powerful gods,-the latter being appealed to as intermediary between man and 
his father, Ea: indeed the legend of Marduk going to his father for advice was 
commonly repeated in incantations. When working against an individual too, it 
was necessary to have something belonging to him,-clippings of his hair, or 
nails if possible. The possessed person was usually washed, the principal of 
cleansing probably underlying this ceremony. An incantation called the 
Incantation of Eridu was often prescribed. and this must relate to some such 
cleansing, for Eridu is the Home of Ea, the Sea-god. A formula for exorcising or 
washing away a demon, Rabesu states that the patient is to be sprinkled with 
clean water twice seven times. Of all water none was so sacred as the Euphrates, 
and water from it was frequently used for charms and exorcisms. Fumigation with 
a censor was also employed by the Assyrians for exorcism, but the possessed 
person was often guarded from the attack of fiends by placing him in the middle 
of an enchanted circle of flour, through which it was thought no spirit could 
break. Wearing the glands from the mouth of a fish was also a charm against 
possession. In making a magic circle, the sorcerer usually formed seven little 
winged figures to set before the god Nergal, with a long spell, which states 
that he has completed the <I>usurtu </I>or magic circle with a sprinkling of 
lime. The wizard further prays that the incantation may be performed for his 
patient by the god. This would seem to be a prototype of the circle in use 
amongst magicians of medieval times. Says Campbell Thompson in his <I>Semitic 
Magic</P>
<P>&quot; </I>Armed with all these things-the word of power, the acquisition of 
some part of the enemy, the use of the magic circle and holy water, and the 
knowledge of the magical properties of substances-the ancient warlock was well 
fitted for his trade. He was then capable of defying hostile demons or summoning 
friendly spirits, of driving out disease or casting spells, of making amulets to 
guard the credulous who came to him. Furthermore, he had a certain 
stock-in-trade of tricks which were a steady source of revenus. Lovesick youths 
and maidens always hoped for some result from his philtres or love-charms ; at 
the demand of jealousy, he was ever ready to put hatred between husband and 
wife; and for such as had not the pluck or skill even to use a dagger on a dark 
night, his little effigies, pierced with pins, would bring death to a rival. He 
was at once a physician and wonder-worker for such as would pay him 
fee.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Among the more modern <I>Semite&rsquo;s </I>magic is greatly in vogue 
in many forms, some of them quite familiar to Europeans: indeed we find in the 
<I>Arabian Nights </I>edited by Lane, a story of old women riding on a 
broom-stick. Among Mahommedans the wizard is thought to deserve death by reason 
of the fact that he is an unbeliever. Witches are fairly common in Arabic lore, 
and we usually find them figuring as sellers of potions and philtres. The 
European witch is usually supposed to be able <I>to </I>leave her dwelling at 
night by sprinkling some of the ashes of the hearth <I>on </I>the forehead of 
her husband, whereby he sleeps soundly till the morning. This is identical with 
French medieval practice. In Arab folk tales the <I>moghrebi </I>is the sorcerer 
who has converse with demons, and we find many such in the Old and New 
Testaments, as well as diviners and other practitioners of the occult arts, In 
the <I>Sanhedrin, </I>Rabbi Akiba defines an enchanter as one who calculates the 
times and hours, and other rabbis state that an enchanter is he who grows ill 
when his bread drops from his <I>mouth, </I>or if he drops the stick that 
supports him from his hand, or if his son calls after him, or a crow caws in his 
hearing, or a deer crosses his path, or he sees a serpent at his right hand, or 
a fox on his left.&quot; The Arabs believe that magic will not work while he 
that employs it is asleep. Besides it is possible to over-reach Satan himself, 
and many Arabic tales exist in which me n of wisdom and cunning have succeeded 
in accomplishing this once sent his son to an assembly of honourable people with 
a flint stone, and told him to have the flint stone woven, He came in and said, 
&quot;My father sends his peace, and wishes to have this flint stone 
woven.&quot; A man with a goat-beard said, &quot; Tell your father to have it 
spun, and then we will weave it,&quot; The son went back, and the Devil was very 
angry, and told his son never to put forth any suggestion when a goat-bearded 
man was present, &quot; for he is more devilish than we.&quot; Curiously enough, 
Rabbi Joshua ben Hananiah makes a similar request in a contest against the wise 
men of Athens, who have required him to sew together the fragments of a broken 
millstone. He asks in reply for a few threads made of the fibre of tile stone. 
The good folk of Mosul, too, have ever prided themselves on a ready wit against 
the Devil. Time was, as my servant related to me, when Iblis came to Mosul and 
found a man planting onions. They fell to talking, and in their fellowship 
agreed to divide the produce of the garden. Then, on a day when the onions were 
ready, the partners went to their vegetable patch and the man said, &quot; 
Master, wilt thou take as thy half that which is above ground or that which is 
below ? Now the Devil saw the good green shoots of the onions sprouting high, 
and so carried these off as his share, leaving the gardener chuckling over his 
bargain. But when wheat time came round, and the man was sowing his glebe on a 
day, the Devil looked over the ditch and complained that he had made nothing out 
of the compact. &quot; This time, quoth he, we will divide differently, and thou 
shalt take the tops &quot; ; and so it fell out. They visited the tilth together 
and when the corn was ripe, and the fellah reaped the field and took away the 
ears, leaving the Devil stubbing up the roots. Presently, after he had been 
digging for a month, he began to find out his error, and went to the man, who 
was cheerily threshing his portion. &quot;This is a paltry quibble,&quot; said 
Iblis, &quot; thou hast cozened me this twice.&quot;</P>
<P>Nay,&quot; said the former, &quot; I gave thee thy desire; and furthermore 
thou didst not thresh out thine onion-tops, as I am doing this.&quot; So it was 
a sanguine Devil that sent away to beat the dry onion-stalks, but in vain; and 
he left Mosul sullenly, stalking away in dudgeon, and stopping once in a while 
to shake his hand against so crafty a town. &quot;Cursed be he, ye tricksters ! 
who can outmatch devilry like yours</P>
<P>&quot;In modern times in the East,&quot; says Mr. Thompson, from Morocco to 
Mesopotamia, books of magic are by no means rare, and manuscripts in Arabic, 
Hebrew, Gershuni, and Syriac can frequently be bought, all dealing with some 
form of magic or popular medicine. In Suakin ill the Soudan I was offered a 
printed book of astrology in Arabic illustrated by the most grotesque and 
bizarre woodcuts of the signs of the Zodiac, the blocks for which seem to have 
done duty in other places. Such books existed in manuscript in ancient days, as 
is vouched for by the story of the Sibylline books or the passage in Acts xix., 
<B>19</B>; &lsquo; Not a few of them that practised curious arts brought their 
books together, and burned them in the sight of all.&rsquo;</P>
<P>It is curious to find the charm for raising hatred practically the same among 
the <I>Semites </I>as it is amongst the peoples of Hungary and the Balkan 
States: that is through the agency of the egg of a black hen. We find too, many 
minor sorceries the same among the Semites as among European races. To be 
invisible was another attainment much sought after, and it was thought that if 
one wore a ring of copper and iron engraved with certain magic signs this result 
would be secured, or the heart of a black cat, dried and steeped in honey. The 
article &quot; Solomon&quot; can be referred to for several instances of potent 
enchantments.&rsquo; Sympathetic magic is often resorted to by the Arabic witch 
and wizard, just as it was amongst the ancient Hebrews and Assyrians.</P>
<P>The great repertory of Semitic occultism is of course the Kabala, to which 
the reader is referred for later Hebrew mystical doctrine.</P>

<P>Sethos :</B> A diviner, who was deprived of his sight by the Emperor Manuel 
because of his addiction to Magic. It is said that the Emperor Andronicus 
Comnenus obtained through him by hydromancy an answer to the question of who was 
to succeed him. The evil spirit gave the letters &quot;S I&quot; in reply; and 
on being asked when, said before the Feast of the exaltation of the Cross. This 
prediction was fulfilled, for before the date mentioned Isaac Angelus had thrown 
Andronicus to be torn in pieces by the mob. When the devil spells, he spells 
backwards, so that &quot;S I&quot; may quite fairly be taken to represent Isaac 
according to the laws of magic</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Setna, Papyrus of :</B> A papyrus of very ancient date, dealing with the 
personality of Prince Setna Kha-em-ust, son of Rameses II. of Egypt, and said to 
have been discovered by him under the head of a mummy in the Necropolis at 
Memphis. Says Wiedemann concerning it: The first text, which has been known to 
us since <B>1867</B>, tells that this prince, being skilled and zealous in the 
practice of necromancy, was one day exhibiting his acquirements to the learned 
men of the court, when an old man told him of a magic book containing two spells 
written by the hand of Thoth himself, the god of wisdom. He who repeated the 
first spell bewitched thereby heaven and earth and the realm of night, the 
mountains and the depth of the sea; he knew the fowls of the air and every 
creeping thing; he saw the fishes, for a divine power brought them up out of the 
depth. He who read the second spell should have power to resume his earthly 
shape, even though he dwelt in the grave; to see the sun rising in the sky with 
all the gods and the moon in the form wherein she displays herself. <I>Setna 
</I>inquired where this book was to be found, and learned that it was lying in 
the tomb of Nefer-ka-Ptah, a son of King Mer-neb-Ptah (who is nowhere else 
named), and that any attempt to take away the book would certainly meet with 
obstinate resistance. These difficulties did not withhold <I>Setna </I>from the 
adventure. He entered the tomb of Nefer-ka-Ptah, where he found not only the 
dead man, but the Ka of his wife Ahuri and their son, though these latter had 
been buried in Koptos. But as in many other tales among many other peoples, 
success brought no blessing to the man who had disturbed the repose of the dead. 
<I>Setna </I>fell in love with the daughter of a priest at Memphis, who turned 
out to be a witch, and took advantage of his intimate connection with her to 
bring him to ignominy and wretchedness. At length the prince recognised and 
repented of the sacrilege he had committed in carrying off the book, and brought 
it back to Nefer-ka-Ptah. In the hope of atoning to some extent for his sin he 
journeyed to Koptos, and finding the graves of the wife and child of 
Nefer-ka-Ptah, he solemnly restored their mummies to the tomb of the father and 
husband, carefully closing the tomb he had so sacrilegiously disturbed. The 
second text, edited two years ago by Griffith from a London papyrus, is also 
genuinely Egyptian in its details. Three magic tales, interwoven one with 
another, are brought into connection with Saosiri, the supernaturally born son 
of <I>Setna. </I>In the first, Saosiri, who was greatly <I>Setna&rsquo;s 
</I>superior in the arts of magic, led his father down into the underworld. They 
penetrated into the judgment-hall of Osiris, where the sights they saw convinced 
<I>Setna </I>that a glorious future awaited the poor man who should cleave to 
righteousness, while he who led an evil life on earth, though rich and powerful, 
must expect a terrible doom. Saosiri next succeeded in saving his father, and 
with him all Egypt, from great difficulty by reading without breaking the seal 
of a closed letter brought by an Ethiopian magician, whom he thus forced to 
recognise the superior power of Egypt. The last part of the text tells of a 
powerful magician once dwelling in Ethiopia who modelled in wax a litter with 
four bearers to whom he gave his life. He sent them to Egypt, and at his command 
they sought out Pharaoh in his palace, carried him off to Ethiopia, and, after 
giving him five hundred blows with a cudgel, conveyed him during the same night 
back to Memphis. Next morning the king displayed the weals on his back to his 
courtiers, one of whom. Horus by name, was sufficiently skilled in the use of 
amulets to ward off by their means an immediate repetition of the outrage. Horus 
then set forth to bring from Hermopolis, the all-powerful magic book of the god 
Thoth, and by its aid he succeeded in treating the Ethiopian king as the 
Ethiopian sorcerer had treated Pharaoh. The foreign magician then hastened to 
Egypt to engage in a contest with Horus in magic tricks. His skill was shown to 
be inferior, and in the end he and his mother received permission to return to 
Ethiopia under a solemn promise not to set foot on Egyptian territory for a 
space of fifteen hundred years.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Seton (or Sethon) Alexander :</B> was one of the very few alchemists who 
succeeded in the great experiment of the transmutation of metals. He took his 
name from the village of Seton, which is stated to have been in the vicinity of 
Edinburgh and close to the sea-shore, so that one may reasonably conclude that 
the little fishing community of Port Seton is meant, although Camden in his 
<I>Brittania </I>states that that was the name of his house. In the year 
<B>1601</B>, the crew of a Dutch vessel had the misfortune to be wrecked on the 
coast near his dwelling, and <I>Seton </I>personally rescued several of them, 
lodged them in his house, and treated them with great kindness, ultimately 
sending them back to Holland at his own expense. In the following year he 
visited Holland, and renewed his acquaintance with at least one of the 
ship-wrecked crew, James Haussen, the pilot, who lived at Arksun. Haussen, 
determined on repaying him for the hospitality he had received in Scotland, 
entertained him for some time in his house, and to him <I>Seton </I>disclosed 
the information that he was a master of the art of alchemy, and proved his words 
by performing several transmutations. Haussen, full of the matter, confided it 
to one Venderlinden, a physician of Enkhuysen, to whom he showed a piece of gold 
which he had himself seen transmuted from lead.</P>
<P>This Venderlinden&rsquo;s grandson in turn, showed to the celebrated author, 
D. G. Morhoff, who wrote a letter concerning it to Langlet du Fresnoy, author of 
the <I>Histoire de la Philosophie Hermetique.</P>
<P>Seton </I>visited Amsterdam and Rotterdam, travelled by sea to Italy, and 
thence through Switzerland to Germany, accompanied by a professed sceptic of 
alchemy, one Wolf-gang Dienheim, whom he convinced of the error of his views at 
Basle before several of its principal inhabitants. This person has described 
<I>Seton, </I>and from the pen picture he gives of him we can discern a typical 
Scot of the seventeenth century. &quot; <I>Seton,&quot; </I>he says, was short 
but stout, and high-coloured, with a pointed beard, but despite his corpulence, 
his expression was spiritual and exalted.&quot;He was,&quot; adds Dienheim, 
&lsquo; a native of Molier, in an island of the ocean.&quot; One wonders if 
Molier is the German&rsquo;s corruption of Lothian.</P>
<P>Several experiments of importance were now demonstrated by <I>Seton. </I>In 
one of these the celebrated physician Zwinger himself brought the lead which was 
to be transmuted from his own house. A common crucible was obtained at a 
goldsmith&rsquo;s, and ordinary sulphur was bought on the road to the house 
where the experiment was to take place. <I>Seton </I>handled none of these 
materials and took no part in the operation except to give to those who followed 
his directions a small packet of powder which transformed the lead into the 
purest gold of exactly the same weight. Zwinger appears to have been absolutely 
convinced of the genuine nature of the experiment, for he wrote an account of it 
to his friend Dr. Schobinger, which appears in Lonig&rsquo;s <I>Ephemerides. 
</I>Shortly after this <I>Seton </I>left Basle, and changing his name went to 
Strasbourg, whence he travelled to Cologne, lodging with one Anton Bordemann, 
who was by way of being an alchemist. In this city he was sufficiently imprudent 
to blazon his knowledge far and wide,-on one occasion producing six ounces of 
gold through the application of one grain of his magical powder. The 
circumstance seems to have made an impression on at least one of the savants of 
the Cathedral City, for Theobald de Hoghelande in his <I>Historiae Aliquot 
Transmutationis Mettalicae, </I>which was published at Cologne in <B>1604</B>, 
alludes to it.</P><I>
<P>Seton </I>then went to Hamburg, whence he travelled south to Munich, where 
something more important than alchemy engaged his attention, for he eloped with 
the daughter of a citizen, whom he married. The young Elector of Saxony, 
Christian II. had heard of <I>Seton <B>5</B> </I>brilliant alchemical successes 
and invited him to his court, but <I>Seton, </I>loath to leave his young wife, 
sent his friend, William Hamilton, probably a brother-Scot, in his stead, with a 
supply of the transmuting agent. In the presence of the whole Court, Hamilton 
undertook and carried through an experiment with perfect success and the gold 
then manufactured resisted every known test. This naturally only whetted the 
Elector&rsquo;s desire to see and converse with the magus, and a pressing 
invitation, which amounted to a command, was dispatched to <I>Seton, </I>who, 
thus rendered unable to refuse, betook himself to the electoral court. He was 
received there with every mark of honour, but it soon became evident to him that 
Christian II. had only invited him thither for the purpose of extracting from 
him the nature of his grand secret, but <I>Seton, </I>as an adept in the 
mysteries of alchemy, remained true to his high calling, and flatly refused to 
gratify the Elector&rsquo;s greed. Promises of preferment and threats were alike 
indifferent to him, and in the end the Elector, in a passion, ordered him to be 
imprisoned in a tower, where he was guarded by forty soldiers. There he was 
subjected to every conceivable species of torture, but all to no purpose. The 
rack, the fire, and the scourge, failed to extort from him the methods by which 
he had achieved the grand arcanum. Quite as exhausted as his victim, the Elector 
at last for-bore, and left the unfortunate Scot in peace.</P>
<P>At this juncture a Moravian chemist, Michael Sendivogius, who happened to be 
in Dresden heard of <I>Seton&rsquo;s </I>terrible experiences and possessed 
sufficient influence to obtain permission to visit him. Himself a searcher after 
the philosopher&rsquo;s stone, he sympathised deeply with the adept, and 
proposed to him that he should attempt to effect his rescue. To this <I>Seton 
</I>agreed, and promised that if he were fortunate enough to escape, he would 
reward Sendivogius with his secret. The Moravian travelled back to Cracow, where 
he resided, sold up his property, and returned to Dresden, where he lodged near 
<I>Seton&rsquo;s </I>place of confinement, entertaining the soldiers who guarded 
the alchemist, and judiciously bribing those who wore directly concerned in his 
imprisonment. At last be judged that the time was ripe to attempt 
<I>Seton&rsquo;s </I>salvation. He feasted the guards in a manner so liberal 
that all of them were soon in a condition of tipsy carelessness. He then 
hastened to the tower in which <I>Seton </I>was imprisoned, but found him unable 
to walk, through the severity of his tortures. He therefore supported him to a 
carriage which stood waiting, and which they gained without being observed. They 
halted at <I>Seton&rsquo;s </I>house to take up his wife, who had in her 
possession some of the all-important powder, and whipping up the horses, sped as 
swiftly as possible to Cracow, which they reached in safety. When quietly 
settled in that city, Sendivogius reminded <I>Seton </I>of his promise to assist 
him in his alchemical projects, but was met with a stern refusal, <I>Seton 
</I>explaining to him that it was impossible for him as an adept to reveal to 
his rescuer the terms of such an awful mystery. The health of the alchemist was, 
however, shattered by the dreadful torments through which he had passed, and 
which he survived only for about two years, presenting the remains of his 
magical precipitate to his preserver. The possession of this powder only made 
Sendivogius more eager than ever to penetrate the mysteries of the grand 
arcanum. He married <I>Seton&rsquo;s </I>widow, perhaps with the idea that she 
was in possession of her late husband&rsquo;s occult knowledge, but if so he was 
doomed to disappointment for she was absolutely ignorant of the matter. <I>Seton 
</I>had left behind him, however, a treatise entitled <I>The New Light of 
Alchymy, </I>which Sendivogius laid hands on and published as his own. In its 
pages he thought he saw a method of increasing the powder, but to his intense 
disappointment and disgust, he only succeeded in lessening it. With what 
remained, however, he posed as a successful projector of the grand mystery, and 
proceeded with much splendour from court to court in a sort of triumphal 
procession. In his own country of Moravia, he was imprisoned, but escaped. His 
powder, however, was rapidly diminishing, but he still continued his 
experiments. Borel in his work on French Antiquities mentions that he saw a 
crown piece which had been partially dipped into a mixture of the powder 
dissolved in spirits of wine, and that the part steeped in the elixir was of 
gold, was porous, and was not soldered or otherwise tampered with. The powder 
done, Sendivogius degenerated into a mere charlatan, pretending that he could 
manufacture gold, and receiving large sums on the strength of being able to do 
so. He survived until the year <B>1646</B> when he died at Parma at the age of 
<B>84</B>. <I>Seton&rsquo;s New Light of Alchymy </I>would appear, from an 
examination of it, to deny that the philosopher&rsquo;s stone was to be achieved 
by the successful transmutation of metals. It says :-</P>
<P>&quot;The extraction of the soul out of gold or silver, by. what vulgar way 
of alchymy soever, is but a mere fancy, On the contrary, he which, in a 
philosophical way, can without any fraud, and colourable deceit, make it that it 
shall really tinge the basest metal, whether with gain or without gain, with the 
colour of gold or silver (abiding all requisite tryals whatever), bath the gates 
of Nature opened to him for the enquiring into further and higher secrets, and 
with the blessing of God to obtain them.&quot;</P>

<P>Seven Stewards of Heaven :</B> by whom God governs the world. They are known

Hagith, the sovereign of Venus, whose day is Friday; Ophiel, the Spirit of

<P>Sextus V., Pope :</B> was one of the line of St. Peter accused of sorcery. De 
Thou says of him in his <I>Histoire Universelle </I>(tome XI.) &quot; The 
Spaniards continued their vengeance against this Pontiff even after his death, 
and they forgot nothing in their anxiety to blacken his memory by the libels 
which they flung against him. <I>Sextus, </I>said they, who, by means of the 
magical art, was for a long time in confederacy with a demon, had made a compact 
with this enemy of humanity to give himself up to him, on condition he was made 
Pope, and allowed to reign six years. <I>Sextus </I>was raised to the chair of 
St. Peter, and during the five years he held sway in Rome he distinguished his 
pontificate by actions surpassing the feeble reach of the human intellect. 
Finally, at the end of this term, the <I>Pope </I>fell sick, and the devil 
arriving to keep him to his pact, <I>Sextus </I>inveighed strongly against his 
bad faith, reproaching him with the fact that the term they had agreed upon was 
not fulfilled, and that there still remained to him more than a twelve-month. 
But the devil reminded him that at the beginning of his pontificate he had 
condemned a man who, according to the laws, was too young by a year to suffer 
death, and that he had nevertheless caused him to be executed, saying that he 
would give him a year out of his own life; that this year, added to the other 
five, completed the six years which had been promised to him, and that in 
consequence he did very wrong to complain. <I>Sextus, </I>confused and unable to 
make any answer, remained mute, and turning himself towards the <I>ruelle </I>of 
his bed, prepared for death in the midst of the terrible mental agitation caused 
by the remorse of his conscience. For the rest,&quot; adds De Thou, with amiable 
frankness, &quot; I only mention this trait as a rumour spread by the Spaniards, 
and I should be very sorry to guarantee its truth.&quot;</P>

<P>Shelta Thari :</B> An esoteric language spoken by the tinkers of Great 
Britain, and possibly a descendant of an &quot;inner&quot; language employed by 
the ancient Celtic Druids or bards. It was in <B>1876</B> that the first hint of 
the existence of <I>Shelta Than </I>reached the ears of that prince of practical 
philologists, Charles Godfrey Leland. It seems strange that George Borrow had 
never stumbled upon the language, and that fact may be taken as a strong proof 
of the jealousy with which the nomadic classes guarded it. Leland relates how he 
and Professor E. H. Palmer, were wandering on the beach at Aberystwyth when they 
met a tramp, who heard them indulging in a conversation in Romany. Leland 
questioned the man as to how he gained a living, and he replied, &quot; Shelkin 
gallopas.&quot; The words were foreign even to the master of dialect, and he 
inquired their import. &quot;Why,&quot; said the man, &quot;it means selling 
ferns. That is tinker&rsquo;s language or minklers&rsquo; thari. I thought as 
you knew Romany, you might understand it. The right name for the tinkers&rsquo; 
language is <I>Shelta.&quot; &quot; </I>It was,&quot; says Leland, &quot;with 
the feelings of Columbus the night before he discovered America that I heard the 
word <I>Shelta, </I>and I asked the fern-dealer if he could talk it.&quot; The 
man replied &quot; A little,&quot; and on the spot the philologist collected a 
number of words and phrases from the fern-seller which gave him sufficient 
insight into the language to prove to him that it was absolutely different from 
Romany. The Celtic origin of the dialect soon began to commend itself to Leland, 
and he attempted to obtain from the man some verse or jingle in it, possibly for 
the purpose of observing its syntactical arrangement. But all he was able to 
drag from his informant were some rhymes of no philological value, and he found 
he had soon pumped the tramp dry. It was in America that Leland nearly terrified 
a tinker out of his wits by speaking to him in the lost dialect. The man, 
questioned as to whether he could speak <I>Shelta, </I>admitted the soft 
impeachment. He proved to be an Irishman, Owen Macdonald by name, and he 
furnished Leland with an invaluable list of several hundred words. But Leland 
could not be sure upon which of the Celtic languages the dialect was based. Owen 
Macdonald declared to him that it was a fourth language, which had nothing in 
common with old Irish, Welsh, or Gaelic, and hazarded the information that it 
was the idiom of the &quot;Ould Picts,&quot; but this appears to be rather too 
conjectural for the consumption of the philologist. <I>Shelta </I>is not a 
jargon, for it can be spoken grammatically without using English, as in the 
British form of Romany. Pictish in all probability was not a Celtic language, 
nor even an Aryan one, however intimately it may have been affected by Celtic 
speech in the later stages of its existence. Leland&rsquo;s discovery was 
greeted in some quarters with inextinguishable laughter. The <I>Saturday Review 
</I>jocosely suggested that he had been &quot; sold,&quot; and that old Irish 
had been palmed off on him for a mysterious lingo. He put this view of the 
matter before his tinker friend, who replied with grave solemnity, &quot;And 
what&rsquo;d I be afther makin&rsquo; two languages av thim for, if there was 
but wan av thim ?&quot; Since Leland&rsquo;s day much has been done to reclaim 
this mysterious tongue, chiefly through the investigations of Mr. John Sampson 
and Professor Kuno Meyer. The basis of these investigations rested on the fact 
that the tinker caste of Great Britain and Ireland was a separate class-so 
separate indeed as almost to form a race by itself. For hundreds of years, 
possibly, this fraternity existed with nearly all its ancient characteristics, 
and on the general disuse of Celtic speech had conserved it as a secret dialect. 
The peculiar thing concerning <I>Shelta </I>is the extent of territory over 
which it is spoken. That it is known rather extensively in London itself was 
discovered by Leland, who heard it spoken by two small boys in the Euston Road, 
They were not Gypsies, and Leland found out that one of them spoke the language 
with great fluency. Since Leland&rsquo;s discoveries <I>Shelta </I>has been to 
some extent mapped out into dialects, one of the most important of which is that 
of Ulster, It would be difficult to explain in the course of such an article as 
this exactly how long the Ulster dialect of this strange and ancient tongue 
differs from that in use in other parts of Great Britain and Ireland. But that 
it does so is certain. Nearly eighteen years ago Mr. John Sampson, of Liverpool, 
a worthy successor <I>to </I>Borrow and Leland, and a linguist of repute. 
collected a number of sayings and proverbs from two old Irish tinkers-John 
Barlow and Phil Murray-which he distinctly states are in the Ulster dialect of 
<I>Shelta. </I>Some of these may be quoted to provide the reader with specimens 
of the language :-Krish gyukera have muni Sheldru - Old beggars have good 
<I>Shelta. </I>Stimera dhi-ilsha, stimera aga dhi-ilsha - If you&rsquo;re a 
piper, have your own pipe. Misjo granhes thaber-The traveller knows the road. 
Thom Blorne mjesh Nip gloch-Every Protestant isn&rsquo;t an Orangeman. Nus a 
dhabjon dhuilsha-The blessing of God on you. Misli, gami gra dhi-il-Be off, and 
bad luck to you.</P>
<P>There seems to be considerable reason to believe that the tinker (or more 
properly &quot; tinkler &quot;) class of Great Britain sprang from the remnants 
of its ancient Celtic inhabitants, and differed as completely from the Gypsy, or 
Romany, race as one people can well differ from another. This is almost 
conclusively proved by the criterion of speech, for <I>Shelta </I>is a Celtic 
tongue and that Romany is a dialect of Northern Hindustan is not open to doubt. 
Those who now speak Romany habitually almost invariably make use of <I>Shelta 
</I>as well, but that only proves that the two nomadic races, having occupied 
the same territory for hundreds of years, had gained a knowledge of each 
other&rsquo;s languages. Who, then, were the original progenitors of the tinkers 
? Whoever they were, they were a Celtic-speaking race, and probably a nomadic 
one. <I>Shelta </I>has been referred to as the language of the ancient bards of 
Ireland, the esoteric tongue of an Irish priesthood. Leland puts forward the 
hypothesis that the Shelta-speaking tinker is a descendant of a prehistoric 
guild of bronze-workers. This, he thinks, accounts in part for his secretiveness 
as regards his language. In Italy to this very day the tinker class is 
identified with the itinerant bronze workers. The tinker fraternity of Great 
Britain and Ireland existed with perhaps nearly all its ancient characteristics 
until the advent of railroads. But long before this it had probably amalgamated 
to a great extent with the Gypsy population, and the two languages had become 
common to the two peoples. This is the only explanation that can be given for 
the appearance of <I>Shelta, </I>a Celtic language, in the non-Celtic portions 
of Great Britain. That it originated in Ireland appears to be highly probable, 
for in no other part of these islands during the later Celtic period was there a 
state of civilisation sufficiently advanced to permit of the existence of a 
close corporation of metal-workers possessing a secret language. Moreover, the 
affinities of <I>Shelta </I>appear to be with old Irish more than with any other 
Celtic dialect. There is one other theory that presents itself in connection 
with the origin of <I>Shelta, </I>and that is, that it is the modern descendant 
of the language of the &quot; Ould Picts&quot; mentioned by Owen Macdonald, 
Leland&rsquo;s tinker friend. It has by no means been proved that Pictish was a 
non-Aryan language, and, despite the labours of Professor Rhys, we are as far 
off as ever from any definite knowledge concerning the idiom spoken by that 
mysterious people. But there are great difficulties in the way of accepting the 
hypothesis of the Pictish origin of <I>Shelta, </I>the chief among them being 
its obvious Irish origin. There were, it is known, Picts in the North of 
Ireland, but they were almost certainly a small and barbarous colony, and a very 
unlikely community to form a metal-working confraternity, possessing the luxury 
of a private dialect. It still remains for the Celtic student to classify 
<I>Shelta, </I>It may prove to be &quot; Pictish,&quot; strongly influenced by 
the Gaelic of Ireland and Scotland. A comparison with Basque and the dialect of 
the Iberian tribes of Morocco might bring affinities to light, and thus 
establish the theory of its non-Aryan origin but its strong kinship with Erse 
seems undoubted. </P>

But it is lost to man, though even sounds approximating to it have a magic

Some of the Rabbis say that the word of power contains twelve letters, others, 
forty-two, and yet others seventy-two but these are the letters of the divine

<P>Siberia :</B> The barbarian tribes of <I>Siberia </I>all more or less 
practise the art of Sorcery, and this has been from time immemorial in the hands 
of the shamanistic or medicine-man class. The Samoyeds who are idol-worshippers 
believe also in the existence of an order of invisible spirits which they call 
<I>tadebtsois. </I>These are ever circling through the atmosphere, and are a 
constant menace to the native, who is anxious to propitiate them. This can only 
be effected through the intervention of a <I>tadibe </I>or Necromancer, who. 
when his services are requisitioned, attires himself in magical costume of 
reindeer leather trimmed with red cloth, a mask of red cloth, and a breast-plate 
of polished metal, He then takes a drum of reindeer skin <I>(See </I>Lap-land) 
ornamented with brass rings, and attended by an assistant. walks round in a 
circle invoking the presence of the spirits, shaking a large rattle the while. 
The noise grows louder, and as the spirits are supposed to draw near the 
sorcerer, he addresses them, beating his drum more gently, and pausing in his 
chant to listen to their answers. Gradually he works himself into a condition of 
frenzy, beats the drum with great violence, and appears to be possessed by the 
supernatural influence writhing and foaming at the mouth. All at once he stops. 
and oracularly pronounces the will of the spirits. The Tadibe&rsquo;s office is 
a hereditary one, but if a member of the tribe should exhibit special 
qualifications he is adopted into the priesthood, and by fasts, vigils, the use 
of narcotics and stimulants in the same manner as is employed by the N.A. 
Indians (q.v.), he comes to believe that he has been visited by the spirits. He 
is then adopted as a Tadibe with midnight ceremonial, and is invested with a 
magic drum. A great many of the tricks of the priesthood are merely those of 
ordinary conjuring, such as the rope trick, but some of the illusions which 
these men secure are exceedingly striking. With their hands and feet tied 
together, they sit on a carpet of reindeer skin, and putting out the light, 
summon the assistance of the spirits. Peculiar noises herald their approach, 
snakes hiss, and bears growl, the lights are rekindled and the <I>tadibe </I>is 
seen released from his bonds.</P>
<P>The Samoyeds sacrifice much to the dead, and perform various ceremonies in 
their honour, but they believe that only the souls of the <I>tadibes </I>enjoy 
immortality and hover through the air, demanding constant sacrifice.</P>
<P>Further to the east, inhabiting the more northerly part of <I>Siberia 
</I>dwell the Ostiaks, who have nominally adopted the rites of the Greek Church, 
but magic is rife amongst them. Many Ostiaks carry about with them a description 
of fetish, which they call <I>Schaitan, </I>Whether this name, like the Arabic 
<I>Sheitan, </I>is merely a corruption of that of Satan, it would be difficult 
to say. Larger images of this kind are part of the furniture of an Ostiak lodge, 
but they are attired in seven pearl embroidered garments, and suspended to the 
neck by a string of silver coins, In a strange sort of dualism they are placed 
in many of the huts cheek by jowl with the image of the Virgin Mary, and at 
meal-times their lips are smeared with the blood of raw game or fish.</P>
<P>It is this people, the Ostiaks, with whom the word Shaman&quot; originated. 
These Shamans are merely medicine-men</P>
<P>The Mongols, who inhabit the more southern parts of the great waste of 
<I>Siberia </I>are also ancient practitioners in sorcery, and rely greatly on 
divination. In order to discover what description of weather will be prevalent 
for any length of time they employ a stone endowed With magic virtues called 
<I>yadeh-tash. </I>This is suspended over, or lies in a basin of water with 
sundry ceremonies, and appears to be the same kind of stone in use among the 
Turcomans as related by Ibn Mohalhal, an early Arab traveller.</P>
<P>The celebrated conqueror. Timur, in his Memoirs, records that the Jets 
resorted to incantations to produce heavy rains which hindered his cavalry from 
acting against them. A Yadachi, or weather-conjuror, was taken prisoner, and 
after lie had been beheaded the storm ceased.</P>
<P>Babu refers to one of his early friends, Khwaja ka Mulai, as conspicuous for 
his skill in falconry and his knowledge of <I>Yadageri, </I>or the science of 
inducing rain and snow by means of enchantment. The Russians were much 
distressed by heavy rains in <B>1552</B>, when besieging Kazan, and universally 
ascribed the unfavourable weather to the arts of the Tatar queen, who was an 
enchantress.</P>
<P>Early in the <B>18</B>th century, the Chinese Emperor Shitsung issued a 
proclamation against rain-conjuring, addressed to the Eight Banners of Mongolia. 
If,&quot; indignantly observes the Emperor, if I, offering prayers in sincerity, 
have yet cause to fear that it may please heaven to leave <I>my </I>prayer 
unanswered, it is truly intolerable that mere common people wishing for rain 
should of their own fancy set up altars of earth; and bring together a rabble of 
Hoshang (Buddhist Bonzes) and Taossi to conjure the spirits to gratify their 
wishes.&rsquo;&rsquo;</P>

<P>Sibylline Books :</B> The manuscripts which embodied the secrets of human 
destiny, the work of the sibyls (q.v.) or prophetesses of the ancient world. 
According to Tacitus, these books were first preserved in the Capitol. When it 
was burnt down, the precious leaves of Fate were preserved, and removed to the 
temple of Apollo Palatinus. Their after-fate is enshrouded in mystery, but it 
would seem that the Cumean books existed until <B>339</B> A.D., when they were 
destroyed by Stilikon. Augustus sent three ambassadors-Paulus Gabinus, Marcus 
Otacillius, and Lucius Valerius-into Asia, Africa, and Italy, but especially to 
the Erythraean Sibyl, to collect&rsquo; whatever could be discovered of the 
Sibylline Oracles, to replace those which had been lost or burnt. The books are 
of two kinds namely, the books of the elder Sibyls, that is, of the earlier 
Greek and Roman times; and the later, which were much falsified, and disfigured 
with numerous interpolations. Of the latter, eight books in Greek and Latin are 
still said to be extant. Those which are preserved in Rome had been collected 
from various places, at various times, and contained predictions of future 
events couched in the most mysterious of symbolic languages. At first they were 
permitted only to be read by descendants of Apollo, but later by the priests, 
until their care was entrusted to certain officials, who only replied to 
inquiries at the command of the Senate, in cases of extraordinary emergency. 
They were two at first, and named <I>duumviri </I>these were appointed by 
Tarquinius Superbus. Two hundred and thirteen years afterwards, ten more were 
appointed to their guardianship <I>(decemviri), </I>and Sulla increased the 
number to fifteen <I>(quindecemviri.)</I></P>

<P>Silvester II., Pope, (Gerbert, died 1003) :</B> One of a number of popes who 
from the tenth century onwards were regarded as sorcerers. It was said-and the 
story probably emanated from the Gnostics who had been proscribed by the 
Church-that Gerbert had evoked a demon who obtained for him the papacy, and who 
further promised him that he should die only after he had celebrated High Mass 
in Jerusalem. One day, while he was saying mass in a Church in Rome, he felt 
suddenly ill, and remembering that he was in the Church of the Holy Cross in 
Jerusalem, he knew that the demon had played him a trick. Before he died, the 
chronicler continues, he confessed to his cardinals his compact with the devil. 
However, as Gerbert had been preceptor of two monarchs, and a friend of others, 
it is more likely that he owed his preference to one of these. He was one of the 
most learned men of his day, a proficient in mathematics, astronomy, and 
mechanics. He it was who introduced clocks, and some writers credit him with the 
invention of arithmetic as we now have it. It is not at all improbable that his 
scientific pursuits seemed to the ignorant to savour of magic. The technical 
language employed in his various studies might well have a sinister significance 
to the ignorant. The brazen head which William of Malmesbury speaks of as 
belonging to <I>Silvester, </I>and which answered questions in an oracular 
manner probably had its origin in a similar misinterpretation of scientific 
apparatus. But however that may be, there is no lack of picturesque detail in 
some of the stories told of him. By the aid of sorcery he is said to have 
discovered buried treasure and to have visited a marvellous underground palace, 
whose riches and splendour vanished at a touch. His very tomb was believed to 
possess the powers of sorcery, and to shed tears when one of the succeeding 
popes was about to die.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Simon Ben Yohai :</B> <I>(See </I><B>Kabala.</B>)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Simon Magus :</B> The sorcerer mentioned in the New Testament (Acts viii.) 
who bewitched the people of Samaria, and led them to believe that he was 
possessed of divine power. He was born in Samaria or Cyprus and was among the 
number of Samaritans who, moved by the preaching of Philip, came to him for 
baptism. Later, when Peter and John laid their hands on the new converts, so 
that they received the Holy Ghost, Simon offered the disciples money to procure 
a similar power. But Peter sternly rebuked him for seeking to buy the gift of 
God with money, and bade him pray that his evil thought might be forgiven, 
whereupon the already repentant <I>Simon </I>said, &quot; Pray ye to the Lord 
for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.</P>
<P>Though we are not told in detail what the sorceries were with which <I>Simon 
</I>bewitched the people of Samaria, certain early ecclesiastical writers have 
left a record of his doings. He could, they averred, make himself invisible when 
he pleased, assume the appearance of another person, or of the lower animals, 
pass unharmed through fire, cause statues to become alive, make furniture move 
without any visible means of imparting motion, and go through a long list of 
equally miraculous performances. In explanation of his desire to possess the 
apostles&rsquo; power of working miracle she is said to have affirmed that his 
sorceries took a great deal of time and trouble to perform, owing to the 
necessity for a multitude of magical rites and incantations, while the miracles 
of the apostles were accomplished easily, and successfully, by the mere 
utterance of a few words.</P>
<P>The adept from whom <I>Simon </I>learned the art of magic was one Dositheus, 
who pretended to be the Messiah foretold by the prophets, and who was 
contemporary with Christ. From this person he appears to have acquired a great 
store of occult erudition, and owed his power chiefly to the hysterical 
conditions into which he was capable of throwing himself. Through these he was 
enabled to make himself look either old or young, returning at will to childhood 
or old age. It is evident that he had not been initiated into Transcendental 
Magic, but was merely consumed by a thirst for power over humanity and the 
mysteries of nature. Repulsed by the Apostles, he is said to have under-taken 
pilgrimages, like them, in which he permitted himself to be worshipped by the 
mob. He declared that he himself was the manifestation of the Splendour of God, 
and that Helena, a Greek slave of his, was its reflection. Thus he imitated 
Christianity in the reverse sense, affirmed the eternal reign of evil and 
revolt, and was, in fact, an antichrist.</P>
<P>After a while he went to Rome, where he appeared before the Emperor Nero. He 
is said to have been decapitated by him, but his head was restored to his 
shoulders, and he was instituted by the tyrant as court sorcerer. Legend states 
that St. Peter, alarmed at the spread of the doctrine of <I>Simon </I>in Rome, 
repaired thither to combat it, that Nero was made aware of his arrival, and 
imagining Peter to be a rival sorcerer resolved to bring them together for his 
amusement. An account ascribed to St. Clement states that on the arrival of 
Peter, <I>Simon </I>flew gracefully through a window into the outside air. The 
Apostle gave vent to a vehement prayer, whereupon the magician, with a loud cry, 
crashed to the earth, and broke both his legs. Nero, greatly annoyed, 
immediately imprisoned the saint, and it is related that <I>Simon </I>died of 
his fall. He had, however, founded a distinct school headed by Merrander, which 
promised immortality of soul and body to its followers. As late as <B>1858</B> 
there existed in France and America a sect which credited the principles of this 
magician.</P>

<P>Sixth Sense :</B> A term used to denote the faculty of spiritual perception. 
which is distinct from, and higher than, the five physical senses. It is the 
possession of the medium, the psychic or sensitive, and in some measure of all 
hypnotic subjects. It is not properly a separate sense at all, but is compounded 
from the spiritual correlates of the physical senses.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Slade, Henry :</B> An American medium, principally known in connection with 
his slate-writing exploits. He came to Britain in July, <B>1876</B>, and was 
cordially received by the leading spiritualists. Very many people were impressed 
and completely mystified by the phenomena they witnessed at his seances, and 
Lord Rayleigh, at a meeting of the British Association in September. 
<B>1876</B>, stated that he had attended a seance of <I>Slade&rsquo;s </I>in the 
company of a professional conjurer, and that the latter had failed entirely to 
find an explanation of the facts. A few days after this emphatic testimony was 
given, however, Professor Ray Lankester published in a letter to the Times the 
result of a seance at which he and Dr. Donkin were present. He had, he said, 
snatched the slate prematurely from Dr. <I>Slade&rsquo;s </I>hand, and had found 
a message written thereon, though the sound of writing had not then been heard. 
The spiritualists maintained that the &quot; exposure&quot; was no exposure at 
all, since <I>Slade </I>declared that he had heard the spirits writing, and had 
mentioned the fact, but that his voice had been lost in the confusion. However, 
the medium&rsquo;s career in Britain was at an end. At the instance of Professor 
Lankester he was tried in a court of law, and sentenced to three months 
imprisonment with hard labour. He appealed, and the conviction was quashed 
because of a slight omission in the charge. A fresh summons was issued on the 
following day, but <I>Slade </I>had left the country, and did not thereafter 
return. In the years <B>1877</B>-<B>88</B> Professor Zollner of Leipsic 
investigated the slate-writing and other phenomena occurring in the presence of 
<I>Slade, </I>mainly in the hope of establishing his theory of four-dimensional 
space. Knots were tied in endless cords, coins extracted from sealed boxes but 
Professor Zollner did not succeed in his attempt to have knots tied in a piece 
of bladder, or to have two rings of solid wood interlaced. In short, no really 
<I>conclusive </I>proof was obtained. In <B>1884</B> <I>Slade&rsquo;s 
</I>phenomena was investigated by a committee appointed by the University of 
Pennsylvania. The results of the latter investigation were, at the best, of a 
negative description. <I>(See also </I><B>Slate-writing.</B>)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Slate-writing :</B> A form of the so-called &quot; direct&quot; spirit 
writing, or autography, which has always been one of the most popular phenomena 
of the <I>seance. </I>The <I>modus operandi </I>is the same in the majority of 
cases. The medium and the sitter take their seats at opposite ends of a small 
table, each grasping a corner of an ordinary school slate, which they thus hold 
firmly pressed against the underside of the table. A small fragment of 
slate-pencil is first enclosed between slate and table, for the use of the 
supposed spirit-writer. Should the <I>seance </I>be successful, a scratching 
sound, as of someone writing on a slate, is heard at the end of a few moments, 
three loud raps indicate the conclusion of the message, and on the withdrawal of 
the slate, it is found to be partly covered with writing-either a general 
message from the spirit-world, or an answer to some question previously written 
down by the sitter.</P>
<P>Among the mediums who were most successful in obtaining spirit writing in 
this manner were Dr. Slade and Air. Eglinton. The former, an American medium, 
came to England in <B>1876</B>, and succeeded in mystifying not a few men of 
education and of scientific attainments. His critics have attributed his 
success, in part at least, to his frank and engaging manner, which did much to 
disarm suspicious sitters. However, ere long Professor Ray Lankester exposed his 
trickery, though the exposure was regarded by many as inconclusive, and &quot; 
Dr.&quot; Henry Slade was prosecuted. Though sentenced to three months&rsquo; 
hard labour, the omission of certain words in the accusation made the conviction 
of no effect. But Dr. Slade found that England had become too hot for him, and 
speedily retired whence he had come. Many of the accounts of his <I>seances 
</I>in different countries are of interest, chiefly because of the discrepancy 
which exists between those of credulous spiritualists and those of trained 
investigations. Dr. Richard Hodgson, however, has pointed out that even in the 
latter class instances of mal-observation are the rule rather than the 
exception, particularly where sleight of hand plays a prominent part in the 
exhibition. A worthy successor to Slade was William Eglinton, who acted as 
medium for <I>slate-writing </I>manifestations, and attained to an extraordinary 
popularity, upwards of a hundred people testifying to his mediumistic powers in 
the spiritualist journal <I>Light. </I>Speaking of his performances, Mr. C. C. 
Massey said, &quot;Many, of whom I am one, are of the opinion that the case for 
these phenomena generally, and for autography, in particular, is already 
complete.&quot; Eglinton&rsquo;s manifestations were produced in full light, and 
his seances were seldom blank, so it is hardly surprising that very many 
persons, ignorant of the lengths to which conjuring can be carried, and 
over-confident in their own ability to observe correctly, should see in 
<I>slate-writing a </I>phenomenon explicable only by a spiritualistic theory. 
But there was definite proof of fraud in several cases. Muslin and a false 
beard, part of the make-up of a &quot;spirit&quot; had been found in 
Eglinton&rsquo;s portmanteau, various persons averred that they had seen his 
messages written on prepared slates previous to the <I>seance, </I>and he had 
been concerned in other matters of an equally doubtful character. And though 
these detections also were disputed they left in the unbiassed mind but little 
doubt of the fraudulent nature of Eglinton&rsquo;s mediumship. </P>
<P>Spiritualists themselves admitted that fraud might occasionally be practised 
by genuine mediums, owing to the uncertainty of the &quot;power.&quot; 
Particularly was this so in the case of professional mediums, who were obliged 
to produce <I>some </I>results, and who had to resort to trickery when other 
means failed them. Mr. S. J. Davey, an associate of the Society for Psychical 
Research who, having discovered the tricks of <I>slate-writing, </I>practised 
them himself, was claimed by certain spiritualists as a medium as well as a 
conjurer, and that notwithstanding his protestations to the contrary. This is 
undoubtedly a powerful argument against the good faith of <I>slate-writing.. 
</I>If his sitters could mistake these sleight-of-hand tricks-which Mr. Davey 
practised with the express purpose of discrediting their professional 
mediums-for genuine spirit manifestations, might they not also be misled by the 
<I>legerdemain </I>of Slade and Eglinton, and other well-known mediums ? It has 
been objected that even skilled conjurers such as &quot; Professor&quot; 
Hoffmann and Houdin professed themselves mystified <I>by slate-writing 
</I>performances, but the answer is fairly obvious, that quite a clever conjurer 
may be baffled by the performances of a brother-expert. The methods adopted by 
Mr. Davey were of a simple nature, requiring little or no apparatus. In the case 
of a long, general message, he would prepare a slate beforehand, and substitute 
it for the test slate. A shorter message, or a reply to a question, he would 
write on the reverse side of the slate, with a scrap of pencil fastened in a 
thimble, and so withdraw the slate that the side written on would be uppermost. 
There is reason to believe that like simple devices were used in other 
<I>seances, </I>for their very simplicity, and the absence of all apparatus, 
rendered them particularly difficult of detection. But where the sitters were 
more credulous, intricate furniture and appliances were used, and the most 
elaborate preparations made for the 
<I>seance.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<P>Slavs :</B> The Slavonic races have an extensive demonology, and in some 
measure their religious pantheon appears to have been in a stage between animism 
(q.v.) and polytheism, that is between god, and spirit-worship. Among them all 
witchcraft, fairy and folk-lore rest mainly in a belief in certain spirits of 
nature, which in some measure recall the pneumatology of Paracelsus and the 
Comte de Gabalis. In the <I>vile,&quot; </I>says Dr. Krauss, &quot; also known 
as <I>Samovile, Samodivi, </I>and <I>Vilivrjaci, </I>we have near relations to 
the forest and field spirits or the wood and moss-folk of Middle Germany, France 
and Bavaria the &quot; wild people of Hesse, Eifel, Salzburg and the Tyrol, the 
wood-women and wood-men of Bohemia, the Tyrolese Fanggen, Fanken, Norkel and 
Happy Ladies, the Roumanish Orken, Euguane, and Dialen, the Danish Ellekoner, 
the Swedish </P>
<P>Skogsnufvaz, and the Russian Ljesje, while in certain respects they have 
affinity with the Teutonic Valkyries.&quot; They are, however, more like divine 
beings, constantly watching over and controlling the destinies of men. They are 
prayed to or exorcised on all occasions. In short their origin is certainly 
Shamanistic. Says Leland : We can still find the <I>vila </I>as set forth in old 
ballads, the incarnation of beauty and power, the benevolent friend of 
sufferers, the geniuses of heroes, the dwellers by rock and river and greenwood 
tree. But they are implacable in their wrath to all who deceive them, or who 
break a promise. Nay, they inflict terrible punishment even on those who disturb 
their rings, or the dances which they make by midsummer moonlight. Hence the 
proverb applied to any man who suddenly fell ill, &lsquo; he stepped on a fairy 
ring.&rsquo; &quot; <I>(See </I><STRONG>Circles.</STRONG>)</P>
<P>There are three varieties of witches or spirits among the southern <I>Slavs, 
</I>the <I>Zracne vile, </I>or aerial spirits, evilly disposed to human beings, 
and inflicting serious injuries upon them, Will-&rsquo;o-the-wisps, who lead 
people astray by nights; the <I>Pozemne vile, </I>companionable spirits, who 
give sage counsel to mankind, and dwell in the earth; and the <I>Podovne vile, 
</I>or water sprites, kindly to man on shore. but treacherous to a degree on 
their own element. Another water-spirit is the <I>Likho, </I>the Slavonic 
Polyphemus, a dread and terrible monster, the <I>Leshy </I>is a wood-demon, 
<I>Norka </I>is the frightful Lord of the Lower World, and <I>Koschei </I>is a 
description of ogre whose province is the abduction of princesses. </P>
<P><I>Witchcraft.-The </I>witch is very frequently mentioned in Slavonic 
folk-tales, especially among the southern <I>Slavs. </I>She is called 
<I>vjestica, </I>(masculine <I>viestac) </I>meaning originally &quot;the 
knowing&quot; or &quot;well-informed one,&quot; <I>Viedma </I>(Russian). In 
Dalmatia and elsewhere among the Southern <I>Slavs </I>the witch is called 
<I>Krstaca, </I>&quot; the crossed &quot;in allusion to the idea that she is of 
the horned race of Hell. It enrages the witches so much to be called by this 
word that when they hear that any one has used it they come to his house by 
night and tear him in four pieces, which they cast to the four winds of heaven, 
and drive away all his cattle and stock. Therefore the shrewd farmers of the 
country call the witch <I>hmana zena, </I>or &quot; Common woman.&quot; There 
are many forms of Slavonic witch, however, and the <I>vjestica </I>differs from 
the <I>macionica </I>and the latter from the <I>Zlokobnica, </I>or &quot; 
evil-meeter,&rsquo; one whom it is unlucky to encounter in the morning, or 
possesses the evil eye. A Serbian authority says: &quot; I have often heard from 
old Hodzas and Kadijas that every female Wallach as soon as she is forty years 
old, abandons the&quot; God be with us,&quot; and becomes a witch <I>(vjestica) 
</I>or at least a <I>zlokobnica </I>or <I>macionic</I>a. A real witch has the 
mark of a cross under her nose, a <I>zlokobnica </I>has some hairs of a beard, 
and a <I>macionica </I>may be known by a forehead full of dark folds with 
blood-spots in her face.&quot;</P>
<P>In South Slavonian countries the peasants on St. George&rsquo;s Day adorn the 
horns of the cattle with garlands to protect them from witches. They attach 
great importance to a seventh or a twelfth child, who, they believe, are the 
great protectors of the world against witchcraft. But these are in great danger 
on St. John&rsquo;s Eve, for then the witches, having the most power, attack 
them with stakes or the stumps of saplings, for which reason the peasantry 
carefully remove everything of the kind from the ground in the autumn season. 
The <I>Krstnik, </I>or wizards, notoriously attract the <I>vila </I>ladies, who 
in most instances are desirous of becoming their mistresses, just as the 
women-kind of the salamanders desire to mate with men. <I>(See </I>the 
<I>Curiosa </I>of Heinrich Kornmann, <B>1666</B>.) The man who gains the love of 
a <I>vila </I>is supposed to be extremely lucky. The <I>Slavs </I>believe that 
on St. George&rsquo;s Day the witches climb into the steeples of churches with 
the object of getting the grease from the axle of the bell, which, for some 
reason, they prize exceedingly. Transformation stories are fairly common, too, 
in Slavonic folklore, which proves that this was a form of magic employed by the 
witches of these countries. The belief in vampires is an outstanding 
superstition in Slavonic countries, and its connections are fully discussed in 
the article Vampire.</P>

<P>Slawensik Poltergeist :</B> In the winter of <B>1806</B>-<B>7</B> Councillor 
Hahn and an officer named Charles Kern, living for the time in the Castle of 
Salwensik, Silesia, were disturbed by curious happenings which suggested that 
the Castle was haunted. Strange noises were heard, small objects were seen to 
rise from the table and fly through the room. The only account is by Councillor 
Hahn, and, as is generally the case in such circumstances, the most surprising 
occurrences were not witnessed by the recorder, but were told him by his 
friends. Thus Kern is said to have seen in the glass the apparition of a woman 
in white; while Hahn was not present when a jug of beer was raised from the 
table by invisible hands, tilted, and its contents poured down an invisible 
throat.</P>

<P>Sleeping Preacher :</B> Rachel Baker, known as the <I>Sleeping Preacher, 
</I>was born at Pelham, Massachusetts, in <B>1794. </B>When she was nine years 
old her parents removed to Marcellus, N.Y. As a child she had a religious 
training, her parents being devout people, and she early manifested a strong 
conviction of her sinfulness. In <B>1811</B> she showed symptoms of 
somnambulism, in which she seemed stricken with horror and despondency. But 
gradually her mind became calmer, and delivered discourses of singular 
clearness, marked by a devout and solemn tone. These fits of somnambulism, or 
trance - speaking, seized her regularly every day, and soon became habitual. She 
began and concluded her devotional exercises with prayer, between which came the 
discourse. Then a state of apparent physical distress supervened, and sobs and 
groans shook her frame. At length the paroxysm passed, and she subsided into a 
natural sleep. Change of scene did not affect these exercises, but the 
administration of opium would interrupt them. Her trance discourses were 
afterwards published.</P>

the observation of Professor Flournoy. Born about <B>1863</B>, at the age of 
twenty-nine she joined a spiritualist circle and soon developed powerful 
mediumistic faculties. In <B>1894</B> M. Flournoy was admitted to the circle and 
thence-forward examined with much interest the clairvoyance and trance 
impersonations of <I>Helene. </I>In the winter of <B>1894</B> she purported to 
have visited, during trance, the planet Mars, and many of her trance discourses 
after that date contain descriptions of Martian life-manners, dress, scenery. At 
length she claimed to have learned the language of the sister-planet, and this 
language she spoke with fluency and consistency. <I>(See </I>Martian Language.) 
Professor Flournoy however, found no evidence sufficient to justify any belief 
in a supernormal faculty, unless it be telepathy.</P>

<P>Sneezing, Superstitions Relating to :</B> It is said that the custom of 
blessing one who sneezes originated in Italy in the time of Gregory the Great, 
during a pestilence which proved mortal to those who sneezed. A still older date 
is given to this custom by some writers, who state that <I>sneezing </I>was 
fatal from the time of Adam to that of Jacob, when the latter begged that its 
fatal effects might be removed. On his request being granted, the people 
gratefully instituted the custom of saluting the sneezer. In some diseases 
<I>sneezing </I>was a bad, in others a good omen. <I>Sneezing </I>to the right 
was lucky, to the left, unlucky; from noon to midnight good, from night to noon, 
bad. St. Austin says that the ancients would return to bed if they sneezed while 
putting on a shoe.</P>

<P>Solar Deity <I>:</B> (See </I><B>Theosophy.</B>)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Solar System :</B> Theosophists have special doctrines as to the formation of 
<I>solar systems. </I>They start by postulating the existence of all pervading 
ether, or, as it is termed in occult chemistry (q.v.) <I>koilon </I>an ether 
which is quite imperceptible to ordinary senses and indeed even to clairvoyants 
except the most highly-developed. It is, despite its diffusion, of extreme 
density. The Deity intending to create a universe invests this ether with his 
divine force, whereupon it becomes the constituent of matter in the shape of 
minute drops or bubbles, and of this the universe with its <I>solar systems 
</I>is formed. First a mass is aggregated by the appropriate agitation of these 
drops, and to this mass is imparted a rotatory motion. The mass thus formed, of 
course, contains the matter from which will be formed all the seven worlds, the 
existence of which Theosophy teaches, and it may be well here to observe that 
these worlds are not separate in the manner we usually conceive separate worlds 
to be, but inter-penetrate each other. The substance in its original form is of 
the texture of the first world, and in order to create the texture of the 
second-and lower-world the Deity sets up a vast number of rotatory agitations 
into each of which is collected <B>49</B> atoms arranged in a certain way, 
sufficient of the first atom having been left to form the first world. This 
process continues six times, the atoms of the succeeding lower worlds being 
formed from those of the world immediately higher and each time of a multiple of 
<B>49</B> atoms. Gradually and with the passing of long ages, the aggregation, 
which contains the atoms of all seven worlds completely intermingled, contracts 
and becomes more closely knit until it forms a nebula which eventually attains 
the fiat, circular form familiar to students of astronomy. Towards the centre it 
is much more dense than at the fringes, and in the process of flattering and 
because of the initial revolving motion, rings &lsquo;are formed encircling the 
centre. From these rings the planets are formed, and after the further passing 
of ages, it is possible for human life to exist on them. The various worlds as 
has been said, penetrate each other substantially within the same bounds, the 
exceptions being the worlds of finer texture which extend beyond those 
relatively more dense. The names of the worlds are: the first which has not as 
yet been experienced by man-the Divine; the second, the Monadic whence come the 
impulses that form man; the third, the Spiritual, the highest world which man 
has as yet been able to experience ; the fourth, the Intuitional, the fifth, the 
Mental; the sixth, the Emotional (Astral) world ; and the seventh is the world 
of matter as matter is familiar to us. Reference is made to the various articles 
dealing more fully with these worlds as follows :-</P>

<P>Solomon :</B> The connection of <I>Solomon, </I>son of David, the King of 
Israel, with magical practice, although it does not possess any Biblical 
authority, has yet a very considerable body of oriental tradition behind it. It 
is supposed, however, that the Jewish Solomon has in many cases been confounded 
with a still older and mythical figure. Then the Arabs and Persians have legends 
of a prehistoric race who were ruled by seventy-two monarchs of the name of 
Suleiman, of whom the last reigned one thousand years. It does not seem,&quot; 
says Yarker, &quot; that these Suleimans who are par excellence the rulers of 
all Djinn, Afreets and other elemental spirits, bear any relationship to the 
Israelite King.&quot; The name, he says, is found in that of a god of the 
Babylonians and the late Dr. Kenealy, the translator of Hafiz, says that the 
earliest Aryan teachers were named Mohn, Bodles or Solymi, and that Suleiman was 
an ancient title of royal power, synonymous with Sultan&quot; or &quot; 
Pharaoh.&quot; A Persian legend states that in the mountains of Kaf, which can 
only be reached by the magic ring of <I>Solomon, </I>there is a gallery built by 
the giant Arzeak, where one kept the statues of a race who were ruled by the 
Suleiman or wise Kings of the East. There is a great chair or throne of 
<I>Solomon </I>hewn out of the solid rock, on the confines of the Afghanistan 
and India called the </P>
<P>Takht-i-Suleiman or throne of <I>Solomon, </I>its ancient Aryan name being 
Shanker Acharga. It is to these older Suleiman&rsquo;s then, that we must 
probably look for a connection with the tradition of occultism, and it is not 
unlikely that the legend relating to <I>Solomon </I>and his temple have been 
confused with these, and that the protagonists of the antiquity of Freemasonry, 
who date their cult from the building of <I>Solomon&rsquo;s </I>Temple, have 
confounded some still older rite or mystery relating to the ancient dynasty of 
Suleiman with the circumstances of the masonic activities of the Hebrew 
monarch.</P>
<P>&quot;God,&quot; says Josephus, &quot; enabled <I>Solomon </I>to learn that 
skill which expels daemons, which is a science useful and sanative to men. He 
composed such incantations, also, by which distempers are alleviated, and he 
left behind him the manner of using exorcisms, by which they drive away daemons, 
so that they never return. And this method of cure is of great force unto this 
day; for I have seen a certain man of my own country, whose name was Eleazar, 
releasing people that were daemoniacal, in the presence of Vespasian and his 
sons, and his captains, and the whole multitude of his soldiers. The manner of 
the cure was this. He put a ring that had a root of one of these sorts mentioned 
by <I>Solomon </I>to the nostrils ; and when the man fell down immediately, he 
adjured him to return unto him no more, making still mention of <I>Solomon, 
</I>and reciting the incantations which he composed. And when Eleazar would 
persuade and demonstrate to the spectators that he had such a power, he set, a 
little way off, a cup, or basin full of water, and commanded the daemon as he 
went out of the man, to overturn it, and thereby to let the spectators know that 
he had left the man.&quot; Some pretended fragments of these conjuring books of 
<I>Solomon </I>are noticed in the&quot; Codex Pseudepigraphus&quot; of 
Fabricius, and Josephus himself has described one of the anti-daemoniacal roots, 
which must remind the reader of the perils attendant on gathering the &quot; 
mandrake.&quot;</P>
<P>The Koran alleges that <I>Solomon </I>had power over the winds, and that he 
rode on his throne throughout the world during the day, and the wind brought it 
back every night to Jerusalem. This throne was placed on a carpet of green silk, 
of a prodigious length and breadth, and sufficient to afford standing-room to 
all <I>Solomon&rsquo;s </I>army, the men on his right hand and the Jinn on his 
left. An army of the most beautiful birds hovered near the throne, forming a 
kind of canopy over it, and the attendants, to screen the king and his soldiers 
from the sun. A certain number of evil spirits were also made subject to him, 
whose business <I>it </I>was to dive for pearls, and perform other work. We are 
also informed, on the same authority, that the devils, having received 
permission to tempt <I>Solomon, </I>in which they were not successful, conspired 
to ruin his character. They wrote several books of magic, and hid them under his 
throne; and when he died they told the chief men among the Jews that if they 
wished to ascertain the manner in which <I>Solomon </I>obtained his absolute 
power over men, Genii, and the winds, they should dig under his throne. They did 
so and found the books, abounding with the most impious superstitions. The more 
learned and enlightened refused to participate in the practices described in 
those books, but they were willingly adopted by the common people. The 
Mahomedans assert that the Jewish priests published this scandalous story 
concerning <I>Solomon, </I>which was believed till Mahomet, by God&rsquo;s 
command, declared him to have been no idolater.</P><I>
<P>Solomon, </I>it is further maintained by the Mahomedans, brought a thousand 
horses from Damascus and other cities he conquered, though some say they were 
left to him by his father David, who seized them from the Amalekites; and others 
pretend that they came out of the Red Sea, and were provided with wings. The 
King wished to inspect his horses, and ordered them to be paraded before him; 
and their symmetry and beauty so much occupied his attention that he gazed on 
them after sunset, and thus neglected evening prayers till it was too late. When 
sensible of his omission, he was so greatly concerned at it that he ordered all 
the horses to be killed as an offering to God, except a hundred of the best of 
them. This, we are informed, procured for him an ample recompense, as he 
received for the loss of his horses dominion over the winds.</P>
<P>The following tradition is narrated by the Mahomedan commentators relative to 
the building of the temple of Jerusalem. According to them, David laid the 
foundations of it, and when he died he left it to be finished by <I>Solomon. 
</I>That prince employed Jinn, and not men, in the work; and this idea might 
probably originate from what is said in the First Book of Kings (vi., <B>7</B>) 
that the Temple was &quot; built of stone, made ready before it was brought 
thither, so that there was neither hammer, nor axe, nor any tool of iron, heard 
in the house while it was building&quot; ; and the Rabbins notice a worm which, 
they pretend, assisted the workmen, the power of which was such as to cause the 
rocks and stones to separate in chiselled blocks. <I>Solomon, </I>while engaged 
in the erection of the Temple, found his end approaching, and he prayed that his 
death might be concealed from the Jinn till the building was finished. His 
request was granted. He died while in the act of praying, and leaning on his 
staff, which supported his body in that posture for a whole year, and the Jinn, 
who supposed him to be still alive, continued their work. At the expiration of 
the year the edifice was completed, when a worm which had entered the staff, ate 
it through. and to the amazement even of the Jinn the body fell to the ground, 
and the King was discovered to be dead.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of the valley of Lebanon believe that the celebrated city and 
temple of Baalbec were erected by the Jinn under <I>Solomon&rsquo;s 
</I>direction. The object of the erection of baalbec is variously stated, one 
tradition affirming that it was intended to be a residence for the Egyptian 
princess whom <I>Solomon </I>married, and another that it was built for the 
Queen of Sheba.</P>

<P>Solomon Ibn Gabirol (1021-1055) :</B> Spanish-Hebrew poet and mystic 
philosopher. He was a Neoplatonist, but at the same time subscribed to the 
mystical doctrine which states that the Deity can only be regarded as a negation 
of all attributes. This he considered essential to the preservation of the 
Jewish monotheism.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Solomon, Mirror of :</B> The method of making the <I>Mirror of Solomon, 
</I>which is used for purposes of divination, is as follows: Take a shining and 
well-polished plate of fine steel, slightly concave, and with the blood of a 
white pigeon inscribe at the four corners the names-Jehovah, Eloym, Metatron, 
Adonay. Place the <I>mirror </I>in a clean and white cloth, and when you behold 
a new moon during the first hour after sunset, repeat a prayer that the angel 
Anael may command and ordain his companions to act as they are instructed ; that 
is, to assist the operator in divining from the <I>mirror. </I>Then cast upon 
burning coals a suitable perfume, at the same time uttering a prayer. Repeat 
this thrice, then breathe upon the <I>mirror </I>and evoke the angel Anael. The 
sign of the cross is then made upon the operator and upon the <I>mirror </I>for 
forty-five days in succession-at the end of which period Anael appears in the 
form of a beautiful child to accomplish the operator&rsquo;s wishes. Sometimes 
he appears on the fourteenth day, according to the devotion and fervour of the 
operator. The perfume used in evoking him is saffron.</P>

<P>Somnambulism :</B> (Latin, <I>somnus, </I>sleep, and <I>ambulare, </I>to 
walk.) The condition in which walking, talking, and actions of a more 
complicated character are performed during sleep, without the agent&rsquo;s 
consciousness or after recollection. The somnambulist may have his eyes closed, 
and ears deaf to auditory impressions or sense impressions. without waking in 
him any gleam of consciousness. This may have some effect in rousing new trains 
of association and suggesting a new line of action. It is suggested that the 
sleep-walker may see only a mental picture of what he is doing-that is, a 
dream-and not the objective reality, and certain experimental tests have proved 
that this occurs in some cases at least. <I>Somnambulism </I>admits of many 
varying degrees. Its mildest form is typified in the inarticulate murmurings or 
vague gestures of a dreaming child, while in the most extreme cases where all 
the senses are active, and the actions apparently as purposive as in the normal 
waking state, it borders on the condition of spontaneous hypnotism. Indeed its 
affinity with hypnosis was early recognised, when the hypnotic subjects of the 
magnetists were designated <I>somnambules. </I>It is remarkable that 
somnambulists may walk in dangerous paths with perfect safety, but if they are 
suddenly awakened they are liable to fall. Spontaneous <I>somnambulism 
</I>generally indicates some morbid tendency of the nervous system, since, as a 
rule, only in some abnormal state could the dream ideas exercise so exciting an 
influence on the brain as to rouse to activity centres normally controlling

<P>Sorcery :</B> (From Latin <I>sortiarius, </I>one who practices divination by 
lots.) The use of supposed supernatural power by the agency of evil spirits 
called forth by spells by a witch or black magician. <I>(See 
</I><STRONG>Magic.</STRONG>)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Sorrel-leaf :</B> A <I>sorrel-leaf </I>was sometimes used to bewitch people, 
as in the case of the Irish Witch mentioned in George Sinclair&rsquo;s 
<I>Satan&rsquo;s Invisible World Displayed, </I>who gave to a girl a leaf of 
<I>sorrel, </I>which the child put into her mouth. Great torture ensued for the 
child, such tortures being increased on the approach of the witch.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Sortilege :</B> or divination by lots, is one of the most ancient and common 
superstitions. We find it used among the Oriental nations to detect a guilty 
person, as when Saul by this means discovered that Jonathan had disobeyed his 
command by taking food, and when the sailors by a similar process found Jonah to 
be the cause of the tempest by which they were overtaken. The methods of using 
the lot have been very numerous, such as Rhabdomancy, Clidomancy, the Sortes 
Sagittariae, otherwise Belomancy, and the common casting of dice. The following 
are the more classical:-&nbsp; </P>
<P>Sortes Thriaecae, or Thriaean lots, were chiefly used in Greece ; they were 
pebbles or counters distinguished by certain characters which were cast into an 
urn, and the first that came out was supposed to contain the right direction. 
This form of divination received its name from the Thrise, three nymphs supposed 
to have nursed Apollo, and to have invented this mode of predicting 
futurity.</P>
<P>Sortes Viales, or street and road lots, were used both in Greece and Rome, 
The person that was desirous to learn his fortune carried with him a certain 
number of lots, distinguished by several characters or inscriptions, and walking 
to and fro in the public ways desired the first boy whom he met to draw, and the 
inscription on the lot thus drawn was received as an infallible prophecy. 
Plutarch declares that this form of divination was derived from the Egyptians, 
by whom the actions and words of boys were carefully observed as containing in 
them something prophetical. Another form of the Sortes Viales was exhibited by a 
boy, but sometimes by a man, who posted himself in a public place to give 
responses to all comers. He was provided with a tablet, on which certain 
fatidical verses were written when consulted, he cast dice on the tablet, and 
the verses on which they fell were supposed to contain the proper direction. 
Sometimes instead of tablets they had urns, in which the fatidical verses were 
thrown, written upon slips of parchment. The verse drawn out was received as a 
sure guide and direction. To this custom Tibullus alludes:-</P>
<P>&quot;Thrice in the streets the sacred lots she threw, And thrice the boy a 
happy omen drew.&quot;</P>
<P>This form of divining was often practised with the Sibylline oracles, and was 
hence named Sortes Sibyllina.</P>
<P>Sortes Prenestinae, or the Prenestine lots, were used in Italy; the letters 
of the alphabet were placed in an urn and shaken; they were then turned Out upon 
the floor, and the words which they accidentally formed were received as omens. 
This superstitious use of letters is still common in Eastern nations. The 
Mussulmans have a divining table, which they say was invented by the prophet 
Edris or Enoch. It is divided into a hundred little squares, each of which 
contains a letter of the Arabic alphabet. The person who consults it repeats 
three times the opening chapter of the <I>Koran, </I>and the <B>57</B>th verse 
of the <B>6</B>th chapter:</P>
<P>&quot;With Him are the keys of the secret things ; none knoweth them but Him 
; He knoweth whatever is on the dry ground, or in the sea: there falleth no leaf 
but He knoweth it ; neither is there a single grain in the dark parts of the 
earth, nor a green thing, nor a dry thing, but it is written in a perspicuous 
book.&quot; Having concluded this recitation, he averts his head from the table 
and places his finger upon it ; lie then looks to see upon what letter his 
finger is placed, writes that letter ; the fifth following it; the fifth 
following that again; and so on until he comes back to the first he had touched: 
the letters thus collected form the answer.</P>
<P>Sortes Homericae and Sortes Virgilianae, divination by opening some poem at 
hazard, and accepting the passage which first turns up as an answer. This 
practice probably arose from the esteem which poets had among the ancients, by 
whom they were reputed divine and inspired persons. Homer&rsquo;s works among 
the Greeks had the most credit, but the tragedies of Euripides and other 
celebrated poems were occasionally used for the same purpose. The Latins chiefly 
consulted Virgil, and many curious coincidences are related by grave historians, 
between the prediction and the event; thus, the elevation of Severus to the 
empire is supposed to have been foretold by his opening at this verse:-</P>
<P>&quot;Remember, Roman, with imperial sway </P>
<P>to rule the nations.&quot;</P>
<P>It is said that Charles I. and Lord Falkland made trial of the Virgilian lots 
a little before the commencement of the great civil war. The former opened at 
that passage in the fourth book of the AEneid where Dido predicts the violent 
death of her faithless lover ; the latter at the lamentation of Evander over his 
son in the eleventh book; if the story be true, the coincidences between the 
responses and events are among the most remarkable recorded.</P>
<P>Sortes Biblicae, divination by the Bible, which the early Christians used 
instead of the profane poets. Nicephorus Gregoras recommends the Psalter as the 
fittest book for the purpose, but Cedrenus informs us that the New Testament was 
more commonly used. St. Augustine denounces this practice in temporal affairs, 
but declares in one of his letters that he had recourse to it in all cases of 
spiritual difficulty. Another form of the Biblical lots is to go to a place of 
worship, and take as an omen the first passage of Scripture read by the 
minister, or the text from which he preaches. This is no uncommon practice in 
modern times, and it is frequently vindicated by persons who ought to know 
better,</P>
<P>The Mussulmans consult the <I>Koran </I>in a similar manner, but they deduce 
their answer from the seventh line of the right-hand page. Others count how 
often the letters <I>kha </I>and <I>shin </I>occur in the page; if <I>kha 
</I>(the first letter of <I>kheyr, </I>&quot;good&quot;) predominate, the answer 
is deemed favourable; but if<B> </B><I>shin </I>(the first letter of <I>shin 
&quot; </I>evil&quot;) <I>be </I>more frequent, the inference is that the 
projects of the inquirer are forbidden or dangerous.</P>
<P>It would be easy to multiply examples of these efforts to obtain guidance 
from blind chance; they were once so frequent, that it was deemed necessary to 
denounce them from the pulpit as being clearly forbidden by the divine precept, 
&quot;Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.&quot;</P>

<P>Spain :</B> <I>Witchcraft.-From </I>early times <I>Spain </I>was regarded as 
the special abode of superstition, and in the middle ages as the home of sorcery 
and magic, probably because of the immense notoriety given to the discoveries of 
the Moorish alchemists. <I>(See </I>Moors.) The Inquisition quickly took root in 
the country, and reaped a rich harvest among Jews, Moriscos, and superstitious 
Christians.</P>
<P>Alfonso de Spina. a Franciscan of Castille, where the Inquisition was not 
then established, wrote, about the year <B>1458</B> or <B>1460</B>, a work 
especially directed against heretics and unbelievers, in which he gives a 
chapter on these articles of popular belief which were derived from the ancient 
heathendom of the people. Among these, witches, under the name of Xurguine 
(jurgina) or bruxe, held a prominent place.</P>
<P>He tells us that in his time these offenders abounded in Dauphiny and 
Gascony, where they assembled in great numbers by night on a wild table land, 
carrying candles with them, to worship Satan, who appeared in the form of a boar 
on a certain rock, popularly known by the name Elboch de Biterne, and that many 
of them had been taken by the inquisition of Toulouse and burnt. From that time 
we find, in Spanish history, the charge of witchcraft and sorcery not 
infrequently brought forward under different forms and circumstances, of which 
several remarkable examples are given by Llorente in his Hi<I>story of the 
Inquisition in Spain.</I></P>
<P>The first auto-da-fi against sorcery appears to have been that of Calahorra, 
in <B>1507</B>, when thirty women, charged before the inquisition as witches, 
were burnt. In <B>1527</B>. a great number of women were accused in Navarre of 
the practice of sorcery, through the information of two girls, one of eleven, 
the other only of nine years old, who confessed before the royal council of 
Navarre that they had been received into the sect of the jurginas, and promised 
on condition of being pardoned, to discover all the women who were implicated in 
these practices.</P>
<P>The moment the attention of the inquisition was thus drawn to the crime of 
sorcery, the prevalence of this superstition in the Basque provinces became 
notorious ; and Charles V., rightly judging that it was to be attributed more to 
the ignorance of the population of those districts than to any other cause, 
directed that preachers should be sent to instruct them.</P>
<P>The first treatise in the Spanish language on the subject of sorcery, by a 
Franciscan monk named Martin de Castanaga, was printed under approbation of the 
bishop of Calahorra in <B>1529. </B>About this time the zeal of the inquisitors 
of Saragossa was excited by the appearance of many witches who were said to have 
come from Navarre, and to have been sent by their sect as missionaries to make 
disciples of the women of Arragon. This sudden witch-persecution in <I>Spain 
</I>appears to have had an influence on the fate of the witches of Italy. Pope 
Adrian IV., who was raised to the papal chair in <B>1522, </B>was a Spanish 
bishop, and had held the office of inquisitor-general in <I>Spain. </I>In the 
time of Julius II., who ruled the papal world from <B>1503 </B>to <B>1513, </B>a 
sect of witches and sorcerers had been discovered in Lombardy, who were 
extremely numerous, and had their Sabbaths and all the other abominations of the 
continental witches. The proceedings against them appear to have been hindered 
by a dispute between the inquisitors and the ecclesiastical judges who claimed 
the jurisdiction in such cases. On the <B>20th </B>July, <B>1523, </B>pope 
Adrian issued a bull against the crime of sorcery, placing it in the sole 
jurisdiction of the inquisitors. This bull perhaps gave the new impulse to the 
prosecution of the witches in <I>Spain.</I></P>
<P>Of the cases which followed during more than a century, the most remarkable 
was that of the auto-da-fe at Logrono on the <B>7</B>th and <B>8</B>th of 
November, <B>1610</B>, which arose in some measure from the visitation of the 
French Basque province in the preceding year. The valley of Bastan is situated 
at the foot of the Pyrenees, on the French Frontier, and at no great distance 
from Labourd. It was within the jurisdiction of the inquisition established at 
Logrono in Castille. The mass of the population of this valley appear to have 
been sorcerers, and they held their meetings or Sabbaths at a place called 
Zugarramurdi.</P>
<P>A woman who was condemned implicated a number of other persons. All the 
persons arrested on this occasion agreed in their description of the Sabbath, 
and of the practices of the witches, which in their general features bore a 
close resemblance to those of the witches of Labourd. The usual place of meeting 
was known here, as in Labourd, by the popular name of Aquelarre, a Gascon word, 
signifying the meadow of the goat. Their ordinary meetings were held on the 
nights of Monday, Wednesday and Friday, every week, but they had grand feasts on 
the principal holidays of the church, such as Easter, Pentecost, Christmas, 
etc., All these feasts appear to have been fixed by the Christian teachers at 
the period of older pagan festivals.</P>
<P>The accounts of their Sabbaths are entirely similar to those given of such 
meetings elsewhere. They danced, sang took part in the most horrible orgies, and 
came into personal contact with Satan.</P>
<P>The auto-da-fe of Logrono, as far as it related to the sect of the sorcerers 
of Zugarramurdi, caused a great sensation, and brought the subject of witchcraft 
under the consideration of the Spanish theologians. These were so <I>far 
</I>more enlightened than the body of their contemporaries in other countries, 
that they generally leant to the opinion that witchcraft was a mere delusion, 
and that the details of the confessions of the miserable creatures who were its 
victims were all creations of the imagination. They were punished because their 
belief was a heresy, contrary to the doctrines of the church. Llorente gives the 
abstract of a treatise on this subject by a Spanish ecclesiastic named Pedro de 
Valentia, addressed to the grand inquisitor in consequence of the trial at 
Logrono in <B>1610</B>, and which remained in manuscript among the archives of 
the inquisition.</P>
<P>This writer adopts entirely the opinion that the acts confessed by the 
witches were imaginary he attributed them partly to the methods in which the 
examinations were carried on, and to the desire of the ignorant people examined 
to escape by saying what seemed to please their persecutors, and partly to the 
effects of the ointments and draughts which they had been taught to use, and 
which were composed of ingredients that produced sleep, and acted upon the 
imagination and the mental faculties.</P><I>
<P>Spiritualism.-A </I>writer in the <I>Religious Philosophical Journal says 
</I>The language that furnishes the largest number of periodicals devoted to the 
dissemination of the doctrine and philosophy of modern Spiritualism, is the 
Spanish. This statement will be somewhat surprising to many of our readers, for 
we have been accustomed to look upon the Spaniards as non-progressive and 
conservative in the extreme. <I>Spain, </I>until a few years, has always been 
intolerant of any religions except the Roman Catholic, and was the latest of 
European nations to yield to the spirit of religious progress. Protestantism has 
with the greatest difficulty obtained a foothold in that country within the last 
few years, but it has been attended with annoying restrictions and persecutions, 
while its progress has been exceedingly slow and discouraging.</P>
<P>Spiritualism in <I>Spain </I>commenced, as in many other lands, with a series 
of disturbances, which took place in a family residing in the outskirts of 
Cadiz. Stone-throwing, bell-ringing, and other preternatural annoyances were the 
first means of awakening attention to the subject, and as they occurred at the 
house of a Spanish gentleman who had just returned from the United States, full 
of the marvels of the Rochester knocking&rsquo;s,&quot; circles were at once 
formed, intelligent responses by rappings obtained, and a foot-hold gained, upon 
which the edifice of Spiritual progress was upreared. So rapidly did the 
interest thus awakened spread, that the first promulgators were soon lost sight 
of, and as early as <B>1854</B>, a society was formed at Cadiz, which was 
organised for the sole purpose of publishing the communications received from 
the Spirits&quot; during two preceding years. From <B>1854</B> to <B>1860</B>, 
Spiritualism spread through the principal towns and villages of <I>Spain in 
</I>the usual fashion. Circles were held in private families, and an endless 
number of societies&quot; were formed and dissolved, according to the exigencies 
of the time. One of the first public events of note in connection with Spanish 
Spiritualism, was of so remarkable a character, that it deserves special 
mention. This was no other than an Auto-da-fe, the only difference between the 
occasion under consideration and the fiery executions of olden times being, that 
the victims were formerly human beings, whereas in the present instance, they 
were all the books, pamphlets, and works of a Spiritualistic character that 
could be procured at that period of the movement. Amongst the pile thus offered 
up on the altar of religious enlightenment - were the writings of Kardec Dufau, 
Grand, and Guldenstubbe; some copies of English and American Spiritual papers, 
and a large collection of tracts issued by the Spiritualists of <I>Spain. 
</I>This memorable scene occurred on the morning of the <B>9</B>th of October, 
<B>1861</B>, at the Esplanade Barcelona.</P>
<P>Among the well-know residents of Barcelona, was a Senor Navarez, whose 
daughter, Rosa, had for many years been the subject of spasmodic attacks, called 
by the Catholic clergy the obsession of demons &quot;-by the medical faculty, an 
aggravated condition of epilepsy. Within two years after the Auto-da-fi, Rosa 
was pronounced entirely cured, by the magnetic passes of a gentleman who was the 
medium of the private circle held in the city, Shortly after this, Barcelona 
could boast of its well-approved Spiritual organs, numerous societies for 
investigation, and several mediums, who from their exclusive positions in 
private life, would object to their names being mentioned, The journal was 
published by Senior Alcantara, and was warmly supported by the Viscount de 
Torres Solanot, and numbers of other leaders of science and literature in 
<I>Spain. </I>By this publication the opponents of Spiritualism were amazed to 
learn of the immense progress the cause was making, and the number of 
distinguished persons who assembled nightly in circles to promote investigation. 
A circular calling the attention of the Spanish public to the phenomena of 
Spiritualism was published in <B>1875</B> by Viscount Solanot, The authors of 
this circular, met with no response worthy of their fraternal intentions. It 
might have been difficult to define exactly what the Spanish brethren proposed 
to do or wished others to unite with them in doing; certain it is, that no 
tangible results could be expected to follow from a very transcendental address 
to the scattered ranks of a movement, whose motto might well be Liberty, 
Inequality, and Disintegration: Our Spanish friends mean well, but is it 
possible there can be unity enough amongst them to send a delegation to America 
? &quot; asked one of the shrewdest on perusing this grandiloquent circular. 
Nothing daunted by the impossibility of getting an international representation 
worthy of the cause at Philadelphia, the energetic Viscount Solanot again 
agitated the subject previous to the Paris Exposition of <B>1878</B>. In the 
articles written for <I>El Criteno </I>on this proposition, the Viscount names 
amongst those societies of Spiritualists prepared to promote an International 
representation, &quot;La Federation Espirita,&quot; of Belgium; The British 
National Association of Spiritualists,&quot; England; &quot; La Sociedad Central 
Espirita,&quot; of the Republic of Mexico; and &quot; El Central General del 
Espiritismo.&quot; Notice is also taken, and with a hope of its ultimate 
success, of the attempt to form a national association and unite all the 
discordant elements under the one broad banner of simple Spiritualism.</P><I>
<P>Magnetism and Mediumistic Science.-In Spain </I>as in Italy, a considerable 
amount of attention has been directed towards the unfoldment of Mediumistic 
power by means of Magnetism. Magnetic Societies abounded in <I>Spain </I>up to 
within the last few years, when many elements of internal discord prevailed in 
the ranks, and succeeded in dissolving the bonds which had united flourishing 
associations. Amongst the amateur mesmerists of <I>Spain </I>may be mentioned 
Don Juan Escudero, of Madrid, a gentleman who having witnessed some experiments 
in &quot;animal magnetism &quot; in California, tried its effect in his own 
family with success.</P>
<P>Among the numerous circles or &quot; groups&quot; formed in the different 
parts of <I>Spain </I>for the study of Spiritualism and its phenomena, was one 
of long standing at Tarragona called &lsquo; The Christian Circle,&quot; Quite 
recently the President of this circle sent the following communication to the 
<I>Revue Spirite </I>of Paris :-&quot; The convict prison here in Tarragona has 
<B>800</B> inmates sentenced to forced labour By some means, Spiritualistic 
books have been introduced among the prisoners. The circulation of these books 
among them has been the means of bringing seventy or eighty of them to be 
believers in our doctrine. These converts have ceased to regard their miserable 
position from their old point of view; they no longer entertain schemes of 
revolt against the authorities. They endure their lot with resignation under the 
influence of the teaching that this world is hut a preliminary stage to another, 
where, if repentant of the ill they have done, and seeking the good of others, 
they will be better off than here. &quot; Not long since one of these men died; 
at his death he declined the established offices of the prison priest, on the 
ground that he was a Spiritualist and did not need them. The priest then 
discovered that Spiritualism was a subject of discussion with many of the 
prisoners. He made a representation of the matter to his bishop, who made formal 
complaint of it to the commandant of the prison, and the commandant made an 
investigation. In the end a particular prisoner was selected for punishment in 
the form of an additional weight of fetters. This coming to the know-ledge of 
the Spiritualists of Tarragona, Barcelona, and Lerida, they had a meeting upon 
the subject and delegated one of their number, a man of position, to interview 
the commandant. The representations which he made, led the commandant to cancel 
his order as to the additional fetters. The bishop&rsquo;s censure against 
spiritualist books placed them under prohibition, which was maintained. It is 
known, however, that although never found by gaolers, the books are still 
there.&quot;</P>
<P>In April, <B>1881</B>, the editor of the Madrid <I>El Criteno </I>says :-that 
great progress has been made in the cause of Spiritualism; that the hall of 
meeting of the Spiritual Society is completely full every Thursday 
evening,&rsquo; and is not now large enough &lsquo; to hold the public who come 
to the sessions,&rsquo; that Dr. Merschejewski has called the attention of the 
University of St. Petersburg to a psychometric phenomena of much importance; to 
wit: A young man deemed from childhood to be an idiot, who will in some seconds 
solve any mathematical problem, while if a poem be read to him, even of many 
hundred verses, he will repeat the whole of it without failing in a single 
word.&quot; Senor Manuel Lopez in the same issue of <I>El Criteno </I>says, 
speaking of the progress of a society of Spiritualists in Madrid :-&quot; We 
have received a mediumistic work of extraordinary merit, executed by a medium of 
the &lsquo;Society of Spiritualists&rsquo; of Zaragoza. It consists of a 
portrait of Isabel the Catholic, made with a pencil, and is a work truly 
admirable. It is said by intelligent persons who have examined it to be an exact 
copy of one preserved in the Royal Museum of Painters of this court. Many thanks 
are tendered to the Zaragozan Society for this highly appreciated present. It 
was about the end of the year <B>1880</B>, that the Spiritualists of <I>Spain 
</I>sustained another series of attacks from the Church. The first of these was 
the refusal of the clergy to accord the customary rites of interment to the 
remains of two ladies, both of irreproachable character, and good standing in 
society, but both &lsquo; guilty&quot; of having believed in Spiritual 
manifestations. The second raid which the Church in <I>Spain </I>perpetrated 
about this time to the prejudice of the Spiritualists, was the suppression of a 
well-written Spiritual paper published at Lerida, entitled <I>El Buen Sentido. 
</I>The Bishop of Lerida had long threatened this step, and warned the editor to 
beware how he presumed to allow any writings reflecting upon clerical doings to 
appear in his columns. As some of the principal contributors were Madame Soler, 
Mdlle. Sans, Don Murillo, and others equally capable of arraigning the 
intolerant acts which Church policy seemed determined to push against the 
Spiritualists, it was scarcely likely that the Bishop&rsquo;s threats would 
produce much effect. The last article which seemed to inflame the clergy to 
retaliate was an indignant protest which appeared in the columns of this paper 
on the condemnation of a working man to three years imprisonment, leaving a 
family of children destitute and all for speaking in public against the 
intolerance of the Church. </P>
<P>In a number of El <I>Criterio, </I>dated <B>1881</B>, is a letter from Don 
Migueles, in which he gives a somewhat discouraging account of the cause &quot; 
as it recently existed in <I>Spain. </I>The editor says :- &quot;Don Migueles 
visited many cities to examine into the state of affairs of a spiritual nature, 
hut found many who were only to be enticed by physical phenomena. caring nothing 
for the esoteric beauties of our faith many who were convinced that they knew 
all there was to be known concerning it, and others who were timid fearing the 
disapproval of neighbours. In some places, however, excellent mediums were 
discovered. In Santiago, in Oviedo, in Corunna and Valladolid, an exceptional 
interest was manifest. Near Santiago, there was a young girl possessed of 
wonderful faculties. Two bars of magnetized iron held over her horizontally, 
half a metre distant, were sufficient to suspend her body in the air. &quot; The 
proceedings of the Spanish Society, under the name of the <I>Sesiones le 
Controvesio, </I>in the month of April last, are spoken of in the Critic as 
markedly impressive on account of the lofty sentiments maintained throughout the 
discussions, by the various speakers. - In the past month were given also very 
interesting conferencias by our illustrious brothers, the Sres. Rebolledo and 
Huelbes. The able engineer and inventor, belonging to the Society of Santiago de 
Chili and founder of that of Lima, D. R. Caruana y Berard, has just arrived in 
Madrid. Tne <I>Revista Espiritista </I>of Barcelona mentions the visit which its 
editor has made to the central societies of Spiritualists of Sabodell and 
Tarrasa, where a great number of brethren were assembled on the occasion, and 
which will result in great good to the doctrine.&quot; The Barcelona <I>Lux, 
</I>of date <B>1881</B>, gives encouraging accounts of seances held at Cordova, 
Tarragona, Seville, and many other places. The editor, Madame Soler, also refers 
to the prohibition to Catholics, by an archbishop to have or to read the 
Spiritualistic work of Niram Aliv : of the&quot; Society of Spiritualists &quot; 
of Tarrasa of the circle of Santa Cruz of Tenerif; of that of &quot; Faith, 
Hope, and Charity,&quot; of Andujar, and of St. Vincent de Bogota.</P>

<P>Speal Bone, Divination by</B> : A form of divination used in Scotland. A 
<I>speal bone, </I>or blade bone of a shoulder of mutton is used, but details of 
the method are wanting. A common soldier, accompanying Lord Loudon on his 
retreat to Skye, told the issue of the battle of Culloden at the very moment it 
was decided, pretending to have seen the event by looking through the 
<I>bone.</P>

<P>Speers, Dr. :</B> <I>(See </I><B>Moses, William Stainton.</B>)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Spells :</B> <I>Spells, </I>incantations, a written or spoken formula of 
words supposed to be capable of magical effects. </P>
<P>Anglo-Saxon <I>spel, </I>a saying or story, hence a form of words Icelandic, 
<I>spjall, </I>a saying ; Gothic, <I>spilt, </I>a fable.</P>
<P>The conception of <I>spells </I>appears to have arisen in the idea that there 
is some natural and intimate connection between words and the things signified 
by them. Thus if one repeats the name of a supernatural being the effect will be 
analogous to that produced by the being itself. It is assumed that all things 
are in sympathy, and act and react upon one another, things that have once been 
in contact continue to act on each other even after the contact has been 
removed. That certain names unknown to man, of gods, demi-gods. and demons, if 
discovered can be used against them by the discoverer, was believed in Ancient 
Egypt. <I>Spells </I>or enchantments can be divided into several classes as 
follows : (<B>1</B>) Protective <I>spells </I>(<B>2</B>) the curse or taboo; 
(<B>3</B>) <I>Spells </I>by which a person, animal or object is to be injured or 
transformed ; (<B>4</B>) <I>Spells </I>to procure some minor end, or 
love-spells, the curing of persons and cattle, etc.</P>
<P>The power of the spoken word is implicitly believed in by all primitive 
peoples, especially if it emanates from a known professor of the art of magic, 
and if it be in a language or dialect unknown. Thus the magicians of Ancient 
Egypt employed foreign words for their incantations, such as Tharthar, thamara, 
thatha. mommon, thanabotha, opranu, brokhrex, abranazukhel,&quot; which occurs 
at the end of a <I>spell </I>the purpose of which is to bring dreams. The 
magicians and sorcerers of the middle ages likewise employed gibberish of a 
similar kind, as do the medicine men of the North American Indians at the 
present day. The reason for the <I>spell </I>being usually couched in a 
well-known formula, is probably because experience found that that and no other 
formula was efficacious. Thus in Ancient Egypt not only were the formulae of 
<I>spells </I>well fixed, but <B>1</B> he exact tone of voice in which they were 
to be pronounced was specially taught. The power of a <I>spell </I>remains until 
such time as it is broken by an antidote or exorcism. Therefore it is not a 
passing thing.</P>
<P>(<B>1</B>) The protective spell.-The commonest form of this is an 
incantation, usually rhymed, imploring the protection of certain gods, saints, 
or beneficent beings, who in waking or sleeping hours will guard the speaker 
from maleficent powers, such as</P>
<P>&quot;Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, </P>
<P>Bless the bed that I lie on.&quot;</P>
<P>Of a deeper significance are these supposed to be spoken by the dead Egyptian 
on his journey through Amenti by which he wards off the evil beings who would 
hinder his way, and so the serpent who would bite the dead is addressed thus: 
&quot; O serpent come not! Geb and Shu stand against thee. Thou hast eaten mice. 
That is loathsome to the Gods. Thou hast gnawed the bones of a putrid cat.&quot; 
The Book of the Dead says, &quot; Whoever readeth the <I>spells </I>daily over 
himself, he is whole- upon earth, he escapes from death, and never doth anything 
evil meet him,&quot; says Budge in <I>Egyptian Magic, </I>p.<B>128</B>. &quot;We 
learn how great was the confidence which the deceased placed in his words of 
power, and also that the sources from which they sprang were the gods of Thoth 
and Isis. It will be remembered the Thoth is called the &quot; scribe of the 
gods,&quot; the &quot; lord of writing,&quot; the &quot;master of papyrus,&quot; 
the &quot; maker of the palette and the ink-jar,&quot; the &quot;lord of divine 
words,&quot; <I>i.e., </I>the holy writings or scriptures, and as he was the 
lord of books and master of the power of speech, he was considered to be the 
possessor of all knowledge both human and divine. At the creation of the world 
it was he who reduced to words the will of the unseen and unknown creative 
Power, and who uttered them in such wise that the universe came into being and 
it was he who proved himself by the exercise of his knowledge to be the 
protector and the friend of Osiris, and of Isis, and of their son Horus. From 
the evidence of the texts we know that it was not by physical might that Thoth 
helped these three gods, but by giving them words of power and instructing them 
how to use them. We know that Osiris vanquished his foes, and that he 
re-constituted his body and became the king of the underworld and god of the 
dead, but he was only able to do these things by means of the words of power 
which Thoth had given to him, and which he had taught him to pronounce properly 
and in a proper tone of voice. It is this belief which makes the deceased cry 
out, &quot; Hail, Thoth, who madest Osiris victorious over his enemies, make 
thou Ani to be victorious over his enemies in the presence of the great and 
sovereign princes who are in Tattu, or in any other place.&quot; Without the 
words of power given to him by Thoth, Osiris would have been powerless under the 
attacks of his foes, and similarly the dead man, who was always identified with 
Osiris, would have passed out of existence at his death but for the words of 
power provided by the writings that were buried with him. In the Judgment Scene 
it is Thoth who reports to the gods the result of the weighing of the heart in 
the balance, and who has supplied its owner with the words which he has uttered 
in his supplications, and whatever can be said in favour of the deceased he says 
to the gods, and whatever can be done for him he does, But apart from being the 
protector and friend of Osiris, Thoth was the refuge to which Isis fled in her 
trouble. The words of a hymn declare that she knew &ndash;&quot;how to turn 
aside evil hap,&quot; and that she was -, strong of tongue and uttered the words 
of power which she knew with correct pronunciation, and halted not in her 
speech, and was perfect both in giving the command, and in saying the 
word,&quot; but this description only proves that she had been instructed by 
Thoth in the art of uttering words of power with effect, and to him, indeed, she 
owed more than this. <I>Spells </I>to keep away disease are of this class.</P>
<P>The amulets found upon Egyptian mummies, and the inscriptions on Gnostic gems 
are for the most part of a protective nature. <I>(See </I><B>Egypt </B>and 
<B>Gnostics.</B>) The protective <I>spell </I>may be said to be an amulet ill 
words, and is often found in connection with the amulet, on which it is 
inscribed.</P>
<P>(<B>2</B>) <I>The curse or taboo.-(a) </I>The word of blighting, the damaging 
word. (b) The word of prohibition or restriction.</P>
<P>(a) The curse is of the nature of a <I>spell, </I>even if it be not in the 
shape of a definite formula. Thus we have the Highland curses: -&quot; A bad 
meeting to you.&quot; &quot;Bad understanding to you.&quot; -&quot; A down mouth 
be yours&quot; which are certainly popular as formulae.</P>
<P>Those who had seen old women, of the Madge Wildfire School, cursing and 
banning, say their manner is well-calculated to inspire terror. Some fifteen or 
twenty years ago, a party of tinkers quarrelled and fought, first among 
themselves, and then with some Tiree villagers. In the excitement a tinker wife 
threw off her cap and allowed her hair to fall over her shoulders in wild 
disorder. She then bared her knees, and falling on them to the ground, in a 
praying attitude, poured forth a torrent of wishes that struck awe into all who 
heard her. She imprecated &quot;Drowning by sea and conflagration by land; may 
you never see a son to follow your body to the graveyard, or a daughter to mourn 
your death. I have made my wish before this, and I will make it now, and there 
was not yet a day I did not see my wish fulfilled.&quot; Curses employed by 
witches usually inferred a blight upon the person cursed, their flocks, their 
herds and crops. Barrenness, too, was frequently called down upon women. A 
person under a curse or <I>spell </I>is believed in the Scottish Highlands 
&quot; to become powerless over his own volition, is alive and awake but moves 
and acts as if asleep.&quot; Curses or <I>spells </I>which inferred death were 
frequently mentioned in works which deal with Medieval Magic. <I>(See 
</I>Summons by accused.)</P>
<P>(b) The Taboo, the word of prohibition or restriction. This is found in the 
mystic expression &quot; thou shalt not.&quot; Thus a number of the commandments 
are taboos, and the Book of Leviticus teems with them. The taboo is the 
&quot;don&rsquo;t&quot; applied to children-a curb on primitive desire. To break 
a taboo was to bring dire misfortune upon oneself, and often upon ones 
family.</P>
<P>Of injuring or transformation of a person, animal or object there are copious 
examples. These were nearly affected by a spell of a given formula. Thus no less 
than twelve chapters of the <I>Book of the Dead </I>(chapters LXXVII. to 
LXXXVIII) are devoted to providing the deceased with words of power, the recital 
of which was necessary to enable him to transform himself into various animal 
and human forms. The Rev. S. Baring Gould in his <I>Book of Folklore, </I>page 
<B>57</B>, says, that in such cases the consequence of a <I>spell </I>being cast 
on an individual requiring him or her to become a beast or a monster with no 
escape except under conditions difficult of execution or of obtaining. To this 
category belong a number of so-called fairy tales, that actually are folk-tales. 
And these do not all pertain to Aryan peoples for wherever magical arts are 
believed to be all-powerful, there one of it&rsquo;s greatest achievements is 
the casting of a <I>spell </I>so as to alter completely the appearance of the 
person on whom it is cast, so that this individual becomes an animal. One need 
only recall the story in the <I>Arabian Nights </I>of the Calenders and the 
three noble ladies of Bagdad, in which the wicked sisters are transformed into 
bitches that have to be thrashed every day. Of this class are the stories of 
&quot; Beauty and the Beast&quot; and &quot;The Frog Prince.&quot;</P>
<P>(<B>4</B>) <I>Spells </I>to procure some minor end, love-spells, etc., 
Love-spells were engraved on metal tables by the Gnostics, and the magicians of 
the middle ages. Instances of these are to be found in <I>The Book of the Sacred 
Magic </I>of Abraham the Jew (q.v.) <I>Spells </I>were often employed to 
imprison evil spirits.</P>
<P>The later Jews have many extravagant opinions and legends relating to this 
subject, which they appear to have derived in a great measure from the 
Babylonians. Josephus affirms that it was generally believed by his country-men 
that Solomon left behind him many <I>spells, </I>which had the power of 
terrifying and expelling evil spirits. The Rabbins also almost uniformly 
describe Solomon. as an accomplished magician. It is probable that the belief in 
the power of <I>spells </I>and incantations became general among the Jews during 
the captivity, and that the invention of them is attributed to Solomon, as a 
more creditable personage than the deities of the Assyrians. Those fictions 
acquired currency, not only among the Arabs, Persians, and other Mohammedan 
nations, but, in process of time, also in many Christian communities. They were 
first adopted by the Gnostics and similar sects, in whose creed heathenism 
preponderated over Christianity; and, in the dark ages, they found their way 
among the Catholics; principally by means of the Pseudo-gospels and fabulous 
legends of saints. An incident in the life of St. Margaret will suffice as a 
specimen. This holy virgin, having vanquished an evil spirit who assaulted her, 
demanded his name, &quot;My name,&quot; replied the demon, &quot;is Veltis, and 
I am one of those whom Solomon, by virtue of his spells, confined in a copper 
caldron at Babylon; but when the Babylonians, in the hope of finding treasures, 
dug up the caldron and opened it, we all made our escape. Since that time, our 
efforts have been directed to the destruction of righteous persons; and I have 
long been striving to turn thee from the course which thou hast embraced.&quot; 
The reader of the &quot;Arabian Nights Entertainments</FONT><FONT color=#ffffff 
size=2> </FONT><FONT size=2>will be immediately reminded of the story of the 
&quot;Fisherman.&quot; The Oriental origin of many similar legends, e.g., of St. 
George of Cappadocia, is equally obvious.</P><I>

<P>Spider :</B> As an amulet. This insect, baked, was sometimes worn round the 
neck as a charm. Ellas Ashmole in his <I>Diary </I>says: &quot;I took early in 
the morning a good dose of elixir, and hung three <I>spiders </I>about my neck, 
and they drove my ague away. Deo Gratias! <I>&quot; Spiders </I>and their webs 
were often recommended as a cure for this malady. Burton gives us the following 
tale: &quot;Being in the country in the vacation time, not many years since, at 
Lindly in Leicestershire, my father&rsquo;s house, I first observed this amulet 
of a <I>spider </I>in a nut-shell, wrapped in silk, so applied for an ague by my 
mother. This I thought most absurd and ridiculous, and I could see no warrant in 
it till at length, rambling amongst authors, I found this very medicine in 
Dioscorides, approved by Matthiolus, repeated by Aldrovandus I began to have a 
better opinion of it, and to give more credit to amulets, when I saw it in some 
parties answer to experience.&quot;</P>

<P>Spirit Photography :</B> The production of photographs on which alleged 
spirit-forms are visible. When the plate is developed there appears, in addition 
to the likeness of the sitter, a shape resembling more or less distinctly the 
human form, which at the moment of exposure was imperceptible to the normal 
vision. Spiritualists assert that there are photo-graphs of spirits-the spirits 
of departed friends and relatives of the sitters-and that the presence of a 
medium is required to facilitate their production. Notwithstanding that on the 
recognition of the supposed spirit by the sitter and others rests the main 
evidence in favour of <I>spirit photography, </I>the &quot;astral figure&quot; 
is generally very vague and indistinct, with the head and shoulders enveloped in 
close-clinging draperies. The practice of <I>spirit photography </I>originated 
in America some fifty years ago, and has enjoyed a fitful existence to the 
present day. It was first introduced by Mumler, a Boston photographer, in 
<B>1862</B>. Dr. Gardner, of the same city, was photographed by Mumler, and on 
the plate appeared an image which the sitter identified as his cousin, who had 
died twelve years before. Dr. Gardner published abroad his experience, and the 
new <I>photography </I>was at once adopted by spiritualists, who saw in it a 
means of proving their beliefs. In <B>1863</B>, however, Dr. Gardner discovered 
that in at least two instances a living model had sat for Mumler&rsquo;s 
&quot;spirit&quot; pictures. Though he continued to believe that some of the 
photographs might be genuine, his exposure of Mumler&rsquo;s fraud effectively 
checked the movement for a time. After the lapse of six years Mumler appeared in 
New York, where the authorities endeavoured to prosecute him, but the evidence 
against him was insufficient to prove fraud, and he was acquitted. <I>Spirit 
photography </I>had flourished in America for some ten years before it became 
known in Britain. Mr. and Mrs. Guppy, the well-known spiritualistic mediums, 
endeavoured without success to produce spirit photographs in private, and at 
length called in the aid of a professional photographer, Mr. Hudson. A 
photograph of Mr. Guppy now revealed a dim, draped &quot;spirit&quot; form. 
Hudson speedily became popular, and his studio was as largely patronized as 
Mumler&rsquo;s had been. Mr. Thomas Slater, a London optician, made careful 
observations of his process without being able to detect any fraud. Mr. Beattie, 
a professional photographer, and something of a sceptic, made the following 
statement concerning Hudsons performances: &quot;They were not made by double 
exposure, nor by figures projected in space in any way; they were not the result 
of mirrors they were not produced by any machinery in the background, behind it, 
above it, or below it, nor by any contrivance connected with the bath, the 
camera, or the camera-slide.&quot; Mr. Traill Taylor, editor of the British 
Journal of Photography said that &quot;at no time during the preparation, 
exposure, or development of the pictures was Mr. Hudson within ten feet of the 
camera or dark room. Appearances of an abnormal kind did certainly appear on 
several plates.&quot; Such testimonies as the above, from the lips of skilled 
and disinterested witnesses, would naturally seem to raise <I>spins photography 
</I>to the level of a genuine psychic phenomenon. But a careful analysis of the 
evidence, such as is given by Mrs. Sidgwick in her article on <I>Spirit 
Photography </I>in the Psychical Research Society&rsquo;s Proceedings, vol. 
VII., will serve to show how even a trained investigator may be deceived by 
sleight-of-hand. And it is notable that Mr. Beattie himself afterwards pointed 
out instances of double exposure in Hudson&rsquo;s productions. In spite of 
this, Hudson continued to practise, and the various spiritualist magazines 
continued to lend him their support, with the exception of the <I>Spiritualist, 
</I>whose editor, himself a practical photographer, had aided Mr. Beattie in the 
denunciation of <I>spirit photography. </I>Another enthusiastic spiritualist, 
Mr. Enmore Jones, who at first professed to recognise a dead daughter in one of 
the pictured &quot;spirits,&quot; afterwards admitted that he had been mistaken. 
Those who had pinned their faith to the genuineness of the photographic 
manifestations were naturally unwilling to relinquish their belief in what they 
considered a sure proof of the reality of the spirit-world, and ingenious 
explanations were offered to cover the circumstance of the apparent double 
exposure. The spirit aura, they said, differed from the natural atmosphere in 
its refracting power, and it was not to be wondered at that objects were 
sometimes duplicated. And so Hudson retained a considerable measure of 
popularity. Mr. Beattie himself afterwards attempted to produce spirit 
photographs, and succeeded in obtaining vague blotches and flaws on his 
pictures, some of them bearing a dim resemblance to a human figure. But there is 
reason to believe that a hired assistant, who provided studio and apparatus, was 
not entirely above suspicion. In <B>1874</B> Buguet (q.v.), a Paris photographer 
crossed over to London where he commenced the practice of <I>spirit photography. 
</I>Many of his pictures were recognized by his clients, and even when he had 
been tried by the French Government, and had admitted deception, there were 
those who refused to regard his confession as spontaneous, and inclined to the 
opinion that he had been bribed by the Jesuits to confess to fraud of which he 
was innocent I Other spirit photographers were Parkes, a contemporary of Hudson, 
and Boursnell, who produced spirit pictures in London in more recent years. The 
principal evidence in favour of <I>spirit photography </I>is undoubtedly the 
recognition of the spirits by their friends and relatives, but the unreliable 
nature of such a test can be seen when we remember that time and again a single 
&quot;spirit&quot; has been claimed by several persons as a near relative -the 
sister of one, the grandfather of another, and so on. One of the most prominent 
defenders of the mediumistic photographers was the Rev. Stainton Moses 
(q.v.)-&quot; M. A. Oxon &quot;-who saw in them the best proof of the reality of 
spiritualism. The same view was shared by Mr. Alfred Russel Wallace (q.v.), who 
said in the <I>Arena, </I>January, <B>1891</B> : &quot; It is that which 
furnishes, perhaps, the most unassailable demonstration it is possible to obtain 
of the objective reality of spiritual forms.&quot;</P>

<P>Spiritism :</B> The name bestowed upon the French form of spiritualism, which 
was in the main founded on the doctrines of &quot; Allan Kardec&quot; (M. 
Rivail), (q.v.) <I>Spiritism </I>differed from spiritualism as expounded in 
Britain, America and elsewhere, chiefly in that it included among its tenets the 
doctrine of reincarnation. Allan Kardec, who prior to his adoption of 
spiritualistic creeds, about <B>1862</B> had been an exponent of animal 
magnetism and phrenology, based his new teachings on spirit revelations received 
through clairvoyants, and so popular were these teachings that they rapidly 
spread over the Continent. In Britain, however, spiritism obtained but little 
hold, its only exponent being Miss Anna Blackwell, who endeavoured without 
success to establish the doctrine of reincarnation in this country. <I>Spiritism 
</I>and spiritualism must not be confused. since the adherents of each section 
were opposed to the tenets of the other, and even in France, where <I>spiritism 
</I>obtained the most footing, there was a distinct spiritualistic party who 
looked askance at the doctrine of reincarnation. The word spiritist is sometimes 
applied to one who seeks only the physical phenomena, and neglects the religious 
and philosophic aspect of spiritualism.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Spiritualism :</B> <I>Spiritualism </I>in its modern aspect has for 
it&rsquo;s basic principles the belief in the continuance of life after death, 
and the possibility of communication between the dead and the living, through 
the agency of a <I>medium </I>or psychic, a person qualified in some unknown 
manner to be the mouthpiece of supernatural beings. On this foundation has been 
raised the belief known as <I>spiritualism, </I>variously regarded as a religion 
or a philosophy. Besides the speaking (or writing, drawing, etc.) indirectly 
through the agency of the medium, there are also <I>physical manifestations, 
</I>such as the materialisation of &lsquo;spirit forms, and apports,&quot; 
(q.v.) the so-called direct&quot; writing, moving of inanimate object&rsquo;s 
without contact, and other phenomena of a like nature. The word 
&quot;spiritism&quot; used in France to denote <I>spiritualism, </I>is in this 
country only applied to the theories of Allen Kardec (q.v.) a well-known 
spiritualist who believed in re-incarnation, or to an inferior phase of 
<I>spiritualism, </I>in which only physical manifestation&rsquo;s are sought, 
and the religious and ethical &lsquo;significance of the subject ignored.</P>
<P>Though the movement in it&rsquo;s present form date&rsquo;s no further back 
than <B>1848</B>, it is possible to trace it&rsquo;s ancestry to witchcraft, 
demoniac possession, poltergeistic disturbances, and animal magnetism. In these 
all the phenomena of <I>spiritualism </I>may be found, though the disturbing 
influences were not in the earlier instance&rsquo;s identified with the 
&lsquo;spirits of the deceased. Many famous outbreak&rsquo;s of an epidemic 
nature, such as that among the Trembler&rsquo;s of the Cevennes (q.v.) and the 
Convulsionarie&rsquo;s of St. Medard (q.v.), which to the beholders 
&lsquo;showed clear indications of demonic possession, had in their 
&lsquo;symptom&rsquo;s considerable analogy with modern <I>spiritualism. 
</I>They were accompanied by spontaneous trance or ecstasy, utterance of 
long-winded discourses, and speaking in unknown tongue&rsquo;s, all of which are 
to be found in the &lsquo;stance-room. The fluency of speech, especially of 
these ignorant peasant&rsquo;s, has been equalled, if not surpassed, by the 
outpouring&rsquo;s of the unlearned medium under the influence of her &quot; 
control.&quot; In &lsquo;such case&rsquo;s the symptom&rsquo;s were generally 
referred either to angelic or diabolic possession, and most frequently to the 
latter. Witches also were supposed to hold converse with the Devil, and many 
aspect&rsquo;s of witchcraft - and notably the part played in the persecution of 
suspects by young women and children-show an obvious relationship to those 
poltergeistic disturbances which were the connecting link between early 
form&rsquo;s of possession and modern <I>spiritualism. </I>Cases in which 
children of morbid tendencies pretend to be the victims of a witch are to be 
found in every record of witch-craft. It was the poltergeist (q.v.). however, 
who showed most affinity to the control &quot; of the mediumistic circle. For at 
least the past few centuries poltergeist disturbance&rsquo;s have occurred from 
time to time, and the mischievous spirit&rsquo;s favourite modes of manifesting 
itself have been singularly akin to those adopted by the spirit control of our 
days. Again, both spirit&rsquo;s require the agency of a medium for the 
production of their phenomena, and it is in the immediate presence of the medium 
that the phenomena generally make their appearance.</P><I>
<P>Magnetism </I>-Partly evolving from these phases of spirit-manifestation, and 
partly running parallel with them. was an extensive movement whose significance, 
from the &lsquo;spiritualist point of view, is very considerable. The doctrine 
of <I>animal magnetism </I>was, &lsquo;said to have originated with Paracelsus, 
and was much in favour with the old alchemist&rsquo;s. The actual magnet was not 
greatly used, but was regarded as a &lsquo;symbol of the magnetic philosophy, 
which rested on the idea of a force or fluid radiating from the heavenly bodies, 
human beings, and indeed, from every &lsquo;substance, animate or intimate, by 
means of which all things interacted upon one another. While the mystic&rsquo;s 
were engaged in formulating a magnetic philosophy, there were others, such as 
Valentine Greatrakes, who cured disease&rsquo;s, claiming their power as a 
divine gift, and not connecting it with the rationalist ideas of the alchemists. 
These two phase&rsquo;s of magnetism united and came to a height in the work of 
Franz Antoine Mesmer, who in <B>1766</B> published his </P><I>
<P>De plane farem influxu, </I>a treatise on the influence of the planets on the 
human body. His ideas were essentially those of the magnetic philosophers, and 
his cures probably on a level with those of Valentine Greatrakes, but into both 
theory and practice he infused new life and won for himself the recognition, if 
not of the learned &lsquo;societies, at least of the general public. To him is 
due that application of the magnetic system which resulted in the discovery of 
the induced hypnotic trance, whose bearing on <I>spiritualism </I>is obvious and 
important. In <B>1784</B> a commission was appointed by the French Government to 
consider magnetism as practised by Mesmer and his followers but it&rsquo;s 
report only served to cast discredit on the &lsquo;science, and exclude it from 
scientific discussion. Until the third decade of the nineteenth century the 
rationalist explanations of Mesmerism concerned themselves entirely with a fluid 
or force emanating from the person of the operator, and even visible to the 
clairvoyant eye, but in <B>1823</B> Alex-andre Bertrand, a Paris physician, 
published a <I>Traiti du Somnambulisme, </I>and in <B>1826</B> a treatise <I>Du 
Magnetisme Animal en France, </I>in which he established the relationship 
between ordinary sleep-walking, &lsquo;somnambulism associated with disease, and 
epidemic ecstasy, and advanced the doctrine now generally accepted-that of 
suggestion. Magnetism was by this time receiving a good deal of attention all 
over Europe. A second French Commission appointed in <B>1825</B> presented in 
<B>1831</B> a report which, though of no great value, contained a unanimous 
testimony to the actuality of the phenomena. In Germany also magnetism was 
practised to a considerable extent, and rationalist explanations found some 
acceptance. There was a class however, more numerous in Germany than elsewhere, 
who inclined towards a spiritualistic explanation of Mesmeric phenomena. Indeed, 
the belief in spirit-intercourse had grown up beside magnetism from its earliest 
conception, in opposition to the theory of a magnetic fluid. In the earlier 
phases of miraculous &quot; healing the cure&rsquo;s were, as has been said, 
ascribed to the divine gift of the operator, who expelled the evil spirits from 
the patient. In epidemic case&rsquo;s in religious communities, ,as well as in 
individual instance&rsquo;s, the spirits were questioned both on personal 
matters and on abstract theological questions. A detailed account of the trance 
utterances of an hypnotic &lsquo;subject was given in <B>1787</B> in the 
journals of the Swedish <I>Exegetical and Philanthropic Society. </I>The society 
naturally inclined to the doctrines of their countryman, Emanuel Swedenborg, who 
was the first to identify the spirits &quot; with the &lsquo;soul&rsquo;s of 
deceased men and women. In Germany Dr. Kerner experimented with Frederica 
Hauffe, the Seeress of Prevorst &quot; (q.v.), in whose presence physical 
manifestations took place, and who described the conditions of the &lsquo;soul 
after death and the constitution of man - the physical body, the &lsquo;soul, 
spirit, and <I>nervengeist, </I>an ethereal body which clothes the soul after 
death-theories afterwards elaborated by spiritualists. Other German 
investigators, J. H. Jung (Jung-Stilling), Dr. C. Romer, and Dr. Heinreich 
Werner recorded the phenomenon of clairvoyance in their somnambules. A French 
spiritualist, Alphonse Cahagnet, produced some of the best evidence which 
<I>spiritualism </I>can show, his accounts being as remarkable for their 
sincerity and good-faith as for the intelligence they display.</P>
<P>Magnetism received but little attention in England, till the third decade of 
the nineteenth century. Towards the end of the eighteenth century Dr. Bell, 
Loutherbourg, and others, practised the science in this country, but for about 
thirty years-from <B>1798</B> to <B>1828</B> &ndash; it was quite neglected. In 
the latter year Richard Chenevix, an Irishman, gave mesmeric demonstrations. Dr. 
Elliotson, of University College Hospital, practised mesmerism with his 
somnambules, the sisters Okey, and though he first believed in the magnetic 
fluid, he afterwards became a spiritualist. In <STRONG>1</STRONG><B>843</B> two 
journals dealing with the subject were founded the <I>Zoist </I>and the 
<I>Phreno-magnet. </I>Most of the English magnetists of the time believed in a 
physical explanation of the phenomena. In <B>1845</B> Dr. Reichenbach published 
his researches, claiming to demonstrate the existence of an emanation (q.v.) 
which he called odylic or odic force, radiating from every substance. This 
effluence could be seen by clairvoyants, and had definite colours, and produced 
a feeling of heat or cold. Working on individual lines, Braid arrived at the 
same conclusions as Bertrand had done, and demonstrated the power of suggestion 
in magnetic&quot; experiments, but his theories were neglected as 
Bertrand&rsquo;s had been. By the medical profession, especially, the whole 
matter was freely ridiculed, and declared to be fraudulent. There is no doubt 
that their attitude would have changed-it had, indeed, already begun to do so - 
but for the wave of <I>spiritualism </I>that swept over America and Europe, and 
magnified the extravagant attendant phenomena of the trance state, and so 
obscured its true significance and scientific value.</P>
<P>It will thus be seen not only that magnetism contained the germs of 
spiritualistic phenomena, but that in many cases the phenomena were identical 
with those of <I>spiritualism </I>in its present stage of development. 
Trance-speaking was well-known, physical manifestations, though less frequently 
met with, were also witnessed, as in the case of Frau Hauffe; and clairvoyance 
was regarded as a common adjunct of the trance. In later years, as has been 
seen, the so-called &quot;magnetic&quot; phenomena were largely attributed to 
the agency of the spirits of the deceased. For such an obviously supernormal 
faculty as clairvoyance - by means of which the subject professed himself able 
to see what was going on at a distance, or to distinguish objects carefully 
concealed from his normal sight - even such men as Bertrand and Braid do not 
seem to have offered an adequate explanation, nor have they refuted the evidence 
for it, though it was extensively practised both in France and England. Indeed, 
there sprang up in these countries a class who specialised in clairvoyance, and 
still further prepared the way for spiritualism.</P><I>
<P>Early American Spiritualism. </I>- What is generally regarded as the birth of 
modern <I>spiritualism </I>took place in America in <B>1848</B>. In that year an 
outbreak by rapping occurred in the home of the Fox family, at Hydesville, in 
Arcadia, Wayne County, N.Y. The household comprised John Fox, his wife, and 
their two young daughters, Margaretta and Kate, aged fifteen and twelve years 
respectively, and the house itself was a small wooden erection. On the 
<B>31</B>st March, <B>1848</B>, Mrs. Fox summoned her neighbours to hear the 
knockings, which had disturbed the family for a few days past. On being 
questioned the raps manifested signs of intelligence, and it was finally 
elicited that the disturbing influence was the spirit of a pedlar, done to death 
by a former resident of the house at Hydesville for the sake of his money. It 
was afterwards said that in April of the same year the Foxes, while digging in 
their cellar at the instigation of the spirits, had discovered therein fragments 
of hair, teeth, and bones, supposed to be those of a human being, but the 
statement was not properly verified, and the evidence for the murder was but 
small. The neighbours of the Fox family, however, were deeply impressed by the 
&quot;revelations,&quot; and, by way of a test, questioned the spirits on such 
matters as the ages of their acquaintances, questions which were answered, 
apparently, with some correctness. Soon afterwards Margaretta Fox visited her 
married sister, Mrs. Fish, at Rochester, New York, there the knockings broke out 
as vigorously as they had done at Hydesville. Her sister Catherine visited some 
friends at Auburn, and here, too, the rappings were heard. Many persons found 
themselves possessed of mediumistic powers, and the manifestations spread like 
an epidemic, till in a few years they were witnessed in most of the eastern 
states. Numerous circles were formed by private individuals, and professional 
mediums became ever more abundant. Mrs. Fox and her three daughters continued to 
hold the place of honour in the spiritualistic world, and gave exhibitions in 
many large towns. In <B>1850</B>, while they were at Buffalo, some professors of 
the Buffalo University showed that the raps could be produced by the 
medium&rsquo;s joints, and shortly afterwards Mrs. Norman Culver, a relative by 
marriage of the Fox family, declared that Margaretta Fox had shown her how the 
rappings were obtained by means of the joints. She also alleged that Catherine 
Fox had told her that in a seance at Rochester where the medium&rsquo;s ankles 
were held to prevent fraud, a Dutch servant maid had rapped in the cellar on a 
signal from the medium. This latter statement was hotly denied by the 
spiritualists, but no refutation was attempted with regard to the other 
allegations. Many mediums confessed that they had resorted to trickery, but the 
tide of popular favour in America held to the actuality of the manifestations. 
These, as time went on, became more varied and complex. Table-turning and 
tilting (q.v.) in part replaced the simpler phenomena of raps. Playing on 
musical instruments by invisible hands, &quot;direct&quot; spirit writing, 
bell-ringing, levitation, and materialisation of spirit hands, are some of the 
phenomena which were witnessed and vouched for by such distinguished sitters as 
Judge Edmonds, the Hon N. P. Tallmadge, Governor of Wisconsin,&rsquo; and 
William Lloyd Garrison. We find the levitation of the medium Daniel D. Home 
(q.v.) recorded at an early stage in his career. Slate-writing (q.v.) and 
playing on musical instruments were also feats practised by the spirits who 
frequented Koon&rsquo;s &quot;spirit-room&quot; (q.v.) in Dover, Athens County, 
Ohio. At Keokuk, in Iowa, in <B>1854</B>, two mediums spoke in tongues 
identified on somewhat insufficient data, as &quot;Swiss,&quot; Latin, and 
Indian languages, and henceforward trance-speaking in their native language and 
in foreign tongues was much practised by mediums. The recognised foreign tongues 
included Latin and Greek; French, German, Spanish, Italian, Chinese and Gaelic, 
but generally the trance utterances, when they were not in English, were not 
recognised definitely as any known language, and frequently the &quot; 
spirits&quot; themselves interpreted the &quot; tongue.&quot; The latter 
phenomena are evidently akin to the early outpourings of the 
&quot;possessed&quot; or the articulate but meaningless fluency of ecstatics 
during a religious epidemic. There have been cases, however, where persons in a 
state of exaltation have spoken fluently in a language of which they know but 
little in their normal state. Many of the &quot; spirit &quot; writings were 
signed with the names of great people-particularly Franklin, Swedenborg, Plato, 
Aristotle, St. John and St. Paul. Trance - lecturing before audiences was also 
practised, books of inspirational utterances were published, and poetry and 
drawings produced in abundance. These automatic productions had a character of 
their own-they were vague, high-sounding, incoherent, and distinctly 
reminiscent. In cases where they displayed even a fair amount of merit, as in 
the poems of T. L. Harris, it was pointed out that they were not beyond the 
capacity of the medium in his normal state. As a rule they had a superficial 
appearance of intelligence, but on analysis were found to be devoid of meaning. 
During the early years of spiritualism in America the movement was largely 
noticed by the press, and many periodicals devoted exclusively to 
<I>spiritualism </I>made their appearance. The <I>Spirit Messenger </I>was first 
published in <B>1849</B>, <I>Heat and Light </I>in <B>1851</B>, the <I>Shekinah 
</I>in <B>1852</B>, <I>Spiritual Telegraph </I>in <B>1853</B>, <I>Spirit World, 
</I>under the title of the <I>Spiritual Philosopher, </I>in <B>1850</B>, under 
the editorship of Laroy Sunderland. From the beginning of the movement those who 
accepted the actuality of the phenomena ranged themselves into two separate 
schools, each represented by a considerable body of opinion. The theory of the 
first was frankly spiritualistic, the explanation of the second was that of 
Mesmer, now appearing under various guises, with a more or less definite flavour 
of contemporary scientific thought. These two schools, as we have seen, had 
their foundation in the early days of animal magnetism, when the rationalist 
ideas of the magnetists were ranged against the theories of angelic or diabolic 
possession. In America the suppositions &quot; force &quot; of the rationalists 
went by the name of&quot; odylic force,&quot; &quot;electro-magnetism,&quot; and 
so forth, and to it was attributed not only the subjective phenomena, but the 
physical manifestations as well. And poltergeistic disturbances occurring from 
time to time were ascribed either to spirits or odylic force, as in the case of 
the Ashtabula Poltergeist (q.v.). The Rev. Asa Mahan, one of the 
&quot;rationalists,&quot; suggested that the medium read the thoughts of the 
sitter by means of odylic force. The protagonists of a magnetic theory 
attributed trance-speaking to the subject&rsquo;s own intelligence, but after 
the birth of American <I>spiritualism </I>in <B>1848</B> a spiritualistic 
interpretation was more commonly accepted. Notwithstanding these conflicting 
theories, of which some were certainly physical, practically nothing was done in 
the way of scientific investigation, with the exception of the experiments 
conducted by Dr. Hare, Professor of Chemistry in the University of Pennsylvania, 
though they hardly deserved the name of &quot; scientific investigation.&quot; 
In <B>1857</B>, when the experiments were made, Hare was already advanced in 
years, and seems to have been easily imposed upon. Very few exposures of fraud 
were made, partly because the majority of the sitters accepted the phenomena 
with unquestioning faith, and partly because the machinery with which such 
detection might be made was not forthcoming. The collaboration of skilful, 
trained, and disinterested investigators, such as have recently applied 
themselves to the elucidation of psychic problems, was entirely lacking in those 
days, and the public was left to form its own conclusions. <I>Spiritualism 
</I>in America was from the first intimately bound up with socialism. The cult 
of <I>spiritualism </I>was, in fact, the out-growth of the same state of things 
which produced socialistic communities, and occasioned the rise and fall of so 
many strange religions. Warren Chase, Horace Greeley, T. L. Harris, and other 
prominent spiritualists founded such communities, and the so-called &quot; 
inspirational&quot; writings frequently gave directions for their construction. 
It was characteristic of the nation and the time that the general trend of 
religious and philosophic speculation should run on democratic lines. The fixed 
standards of thought which obtained in Europe were not recognised in America; 
everyone thought for himself, with but little educational training on which to 
base his ideas, and the result was that the vigour of his speculation frequently 
outran its discretion. As for the causes which made <I>spiritualism </I>more 
popular and more lasting than other strange doctrines of the time, they are 
probably to be found in the special conditions which prepared the way for 
<I>spiritualism. </I>Clairvoyants had made use of rapping prior to the 
mediumship of the Fox girls, the induced trance had only recently been brought 
to the notice of the American people by lecturers, the clergy and others, 
accustomed to departures from orthodoxy in every direction, found no difficulty 
in admitting the intervention of good or evil spirits in human affairs, while 
for those who refused to accept the spirit hypothesis a satisfactory explanation 
of the phenomena was found in electricity, electro-magnetism, or &quot; odic 
force.&quot;</P><I>
<P>Spiritualism in England.-Though, </I>as has been said, clairvoyants and 
somnambules were sufficiently common in England prior to the importation of 
<I>spiritualism </I>in its American form, the phenomena were, nevertheless, 
interpreted mainly on rationalist lines, and even when the spirit doctrine-which 
in those days had but a small following-became wide-spread and important, the 
theory of any rational explanation was still represented. In <B>1852</B>, four 
years after the &quot; Rochester Rappings,&quot; a medium named Mrs. Hayden was 
brought from America by a lecturer on &quot;electro-biology.&quot; Soon 
afterwards another professional medium, Mrs. Roberts, crossed the Atlantic, and 
both ladies had a distinguished clientele, and received substantial remuneration 
in the way of fees. Many of the most influential Journals published scornful 
comments on these performances, hut a belief in the genuineness of the phenomena 
was expressed by one at least, <I>Chambers Journal, </I>in an article by Robert 
Chambers himself. Professor de Morgan was another distinguished witness who 
testified to the actuality of the phenomena, and its supernormal character, and 
yet others were disposed to investigate. In <B>1853</B> an epidemic of 
table-turning (q.v.) spread from the Continent to Britain, and attained to 
immense popularity among all classes. So wide-spread did it become that such men 
as Braid, Faraday and Carpenter turned their attention to it, and showed it to 
result from unconscious muscular action. The &quot;rationalist&quot; 
explanation, be it said, was still well to the fore, with talk of odylic force, 
electricity, or magnetism. Faraday&rsquo;s experiments were ridiculed, and a 
pamphlet entitled <I>Table-turning by Animal Magnetism demonstrated </I>ran 
through more than a hundred editions in one year. Elliotson and the other 
protagonists of mesmerism found an illustration of their own views in 
table-turning. Those who inclined to a spiritualistic belief found a spirit 
agency at work in the same phenomena; while a band of clergymen, confessedly 
awaiting similar manifestations in fulfillment of Scriptural prophecy, concluded 
that Satanic agency was at the root of the matter, and had their conclusions 
supported by the &quot;spirits&quot; themselves, who confessed that they were 
fallen angels, or the spirits of evil-doers. Among the earliest converts to 
<I>spiritualism </I>were Sir Charles Isham, Dr. Ashburner, and the socialist 
Robert Owen, at that time already over eighty years of age, who published in 
<B>1854</B> the first number of <I>The New Existence of Alan upon the Earth, 
</I>intended as the organ of a sort of millenium to be brought about by the 
spirits. Automatic writing is recorded at this period, one medium being a child 
of four, who wrote in Latin. In the autumn of <B>1853</B> Mrs. Hayden returned 
to America, and the practice of table-turning speedily declined. Until 
<B>1860</B> little more is heard of <I>spiritualism, </I>though a few journals 
were published in the interval. Owen continued to issue his <I>New Existence, 
</I>in which, however, <I>spiritualism </I>was only a secondary consideration. 
The <I>Yorkshire Spiritual Telegraph </I>published at Keighley in <B>1815</B>, 
ran till the end of <B>1859</B> (from <B>1857</B> under the name of the 
<I>British Spiritual Telegraph). </I>There were also a few other periodicals 
which did not enjoy so long a lease of life. But though the British books and 
papers dealing with the subject were but few, the lack was supplied by American 
productions, which were largely read in this country. Mediums, as well as 
literature, were imported from America, notable among them being Daniel Dunglas 
Home (q.v.) who crossed over to Britain in <B>1855</B> at the age of 
twenty-three, and who had already acted as a medium in America for some four 
years. Many of those who afterwards became prominent mediums were first 
converted to <I>spiritualism </I>at Home&rsquo;s seances. In the autumn of 
<B>1855</B> Home returned to America, and in <B>1856</B> his place was taken by 
P. B. Randolph, who attended the meetings of the Charing Cross Circle. In 
<B>1859</B> came the Rev. T. L. Harris, deputed by the spirits to visit England. 
An English medium, named Mrs. Marshall, gave seances professionally, but much 
less successfully than did Home and the American mediums, though the phenomena 
were of a similar kind. English spiritualists, however, did not court publicity, 
but practised for the most part anonymously. The phenomena at these seances 
resemble those in America - playing of instruments without visible agency, 
materialisation of hands, table-turning, and so on-but on a much smaller scale. 
It was not so much these physical manifestations, however, which inspired the 
confidence or excited the credulity of early spiritualists, but rather the 
automatic writing and speaking which, rare at first, afterwards became a feature 
of mediumistic seances. So early as </P><B>
<P>1854</B> the trance utterances of a medium named Annie were recorded by a 
circle of Swedenborgians presided over by Elihu Rich. The importance given at 
this stage of the movement to subjective phenomena must be attributed to an 
imperfect understanding of unconscious cerebration. Such men as Mr. Thomas 
Shorter, editor of the <I>Spiritual Magazine, </I>failed to comprehend how the 
medium was able to reason while in the trance state, and to perform intelligent 
acts of which the normal consciousness knew nothing. Therefore they adopted the 
spirit hypothesis. Mrs. de Morgan and Mrs. Newton Crosland gave a ready credence 
to the automatic utterances of their friends. Symbolic drawings were a feature 
of Mrs. Crosland&rsquo;s circle, as was also the speaking in unknown tongues, 
which were translated by the spirit through another medium.</P>
<P>In <B>1860</B> a new spiritual era opened, and the whole subject came into 
more prominence than it had done heretofore. This was due to the increase in the 
number of British mediums and the emigration to Britain of many American 
mediums, including the Davenport Brothers (q.v.) and D. D. Home, who once more 
visited England in <B>1859</B>. Home was treated respectfully, not to say 
generously. by the bulk of the press and by the public, and admitted to the 
highest grades of society. Another American medium who practised about the same 
time was J. R. M. Squire, whose manifestations were vouched for by Dr. Lockhart 
Robertson. Other mediums there were, however, such as Colchestar and Foster, who 
practised trickery so openly that the spiritualists themselves exposed their 
fraud, though maintaining that at times the manifestations even of these mediums 
were genuine. After Home, the most famous American mediums were the brothers 
Davenport, who practised various forms of physical mediumship. They took their 
places in a small cabinet, bound band and foot to the satisfaction of the 
sitters. When the lights were lowered, musical instruments were thrown about the 
room and played upon and other physical phenomena were apparent. When the seance 
was over and the lights once more raised, the brothers Davenport were found 
securely fastened in their cabinet, The manifestations were so skillfully 
produced that many people hesitated whether to regard them as clever conjuring 
or spirit phenomena. At length, however, the Davenports were exposed through the 
agency of a secret knot called the &quot;Tom Fool&rsquo;s knot,&quot; which they 
were unable to untie, and which rendered the necessary escape from their bonds 
impossible. Their career in Britain was at an end. Shortly afterwards the 
conjuring performances of Maskelyne and Cook, in emulation of the Davenport 
Brothers, drove the spiritualists to conclude that they also must be renegade 
mediums. Native medium-ship developed much more slowly in England than that of 
the American spiritualists. Mrs. Marshall was for a time practically the only 
professional medium of standing in the country, though private mediums were less 
rare. Notable among the latter were Mrs. Everitt, Mr. Edward Child, and Miss 
Nichol, afterwards the second wife of Mr. Guppy, who became a famous medium. 
During this period poltergeistic disturbances were still recorded in which all 
the familiar phenomena reappeared, but they were explained on spiritualist 
lines. Crystal vision was practised and auras were commonly seen by the medium 
round the heads of his friends. Automatic writing, speaking, and drawing 
continued, and inspirational addresses, etc., were published. In <B>1869</B> a 
new impulse was given to <I>spiritualism </I>by the appearance of several public 
mediums, chief among them being F. Herne, who devoted his talents to the 
production of physical manifestations, and in connection with whom we first see 
the phenomenon of &quot; elongation&quot; (q.v.). Within a few years a number of 
other English mediums sprang up - Eglinton, Monck, Rita, and many more, while 
Dr. Slade, Annie Eva Pay, and Kate Fox (who afterwards married an English 
barrister named Jencken) came over from America. In <B>1870</B> the Rev. W. 
Stainton Moses (&quot;M. A. Oxon,&quot;) destined to be one of the greatest of 
English mediums, devoted himself to private mediumship. In <B>1872</B> there was 
introduced into England, through the agency of the Guppys, the practice of 
Spirit Photography (q.v.), which had originated ten years earlier in America. To 
very many people a photograph containing, in addition to the sitter&rsquo;s 
portrait, a vague splotch of white, was conclusive evidence of the 
materialisation of spirits. After numerous exposures the craze for spirit 
photography declined and of late years little has been heard of it, though in 
spasmodic fashion it sometimes shows evidence of life. Slate-writing (q.v.) was 
a favourite mode of &quot;direct&quot; writing and one extensively practised. 
Sittings were generally held in the dark, and the sitters were enjoined to talk 
or sing, or perhaps a musical box was played. Most of the records of these 
earlier seances are singularly suggestive of fraud. In <B>1874</B> Mrs. Jencken 
(Kate Fox) was staying at Brighton with her baby, aged about six months, and it 
is related that the baby became a writing medium. A facsimile of its writing was 
published in the <I>Medium and Daybreak </I>of May <B>8</B>th, <B>1874</B>. In 
the same year came Mrs. Annie Eva Pay whose feats resembled those of the 
Davenports. Another celebrated medium was David Duguid, of Glasgow, who painted 
&quot;under control.&quot; In <B>1876</B> Henry Slade came from America, and 
turned his attention chiefly to slate-writing. A few months after his appearance 
in Britain Professor Ray Lankester detected him in fraud, prosecuted him, and 
finally obliged him to leave the country. But the crowning manifestation, the 
climax of spiritual phenomena and apparently the most difficult of achievement, 
was materialisation (q.v.) It began with the materialisation of heads, hands, 
and arms, and proceeded to full materialisation. In <B>1872</B> Mrs. Guppy 
attempted this form of manifestation, but with no conspicuous success. The 
mediums Herne and Williams also included it in their repertory, but a new and 
successful medium made her appearance-Florence Cook, who materialised the 
spirits of &quot;John&quot; and &quot;Katie King.&quot; When, during a seance, 
Miss Cook was seized by Mr. Volckman while impersonating a spirit, the exposure 
drew from Sir William Crookes several letters testifying to the honesty of the 
medium, with whom he had experimented, and rather helped the cause of 
<I>spiritualism </I>than otherwise. Other private mediums also gave 
materialisation seances, and from them the contagion spread to their 
professional brethren, among whom the most successful was undoubtedly William 
Eglinton. Miss Lottie Fowler also attained to fame as a medium about the same 
time - the decade <B>1870</B>-So. These open seances offered a better 
opportunity to the investigator, and though even in them some care was doubtless 
exercised to prevent the intrusion of &quot; adverse influences,&quot; there 
were a good many instances where a sceptic ventured to grasp the spirit, and 
when this occurred spirit and medium were always found to be one and the same. 
By way of apology for these untoward happenings the <I>Spiritualist 
</I>suggested that the spirit was composed of emanations from the medium, and 
that when it was grasped by the sitter spirit and medium would unite, the form 
possessing most of the medium&rsquo;s force rejoining the other. Another 
explanation, especially applicable to physical manifestations, was that genuine 
mediums, giving professional seances, and forced to produce the phenomena on all 
occasions, would sometimes resort to fraud when their mediumistic powers 
temporarily failed them. This perfectly plausible excuse was always ready to 
meet a charge of fraud. The subjective phenomena, as time advanced became less 
in favour with investigators, who began really to understand its subjective 
nature, but with spiritualists it remained the most important form of 
manifestation The trance utterances of Home (q.v.), Stainton Moses, and Miss 
Lottie Fowler were highly valued. David Duguid, the celebrated painting medium, 
was controlled by a new spirit, Hafed, Prince of Persia, whose life and 
adventures were delivered through the medium. Prominent inspirational speakers 
were Mrs. Emma Hardinge Britten, J. J. Morse, and Mrs. Cora L. V. 
Tappan-Richmond. Among English periodicals devoted to <I>spiritualism </I>were 
<I>Human Nature, </I>first issued in <B>1867</B> ; the <I>Medium and Daybreak, 
</I>founded a few years later; the <I>Spiritual Magazine; </I>and the 
<I>Spiritualist </I>(<B>1867</B>), edited by Mr. W. H. Harrison, and treating 
the subject in a scientific manner. A still more recent paper, <I>Light, 
</I>dates from <B>1881</B>, and still remains one of the principal organs of the 
movement. One of the earliest investigators was Sir William Crookes, whose 
experiences with D. D. Home are not to be lightly passed by. In <B>1863</B> 
Professor de Morgan, in a preface to Mrs. de Morgan&rsquo;s book, <I>From Matter 
to Spirit, </I>suggests the agency of some mysterious force, though be did not 
become a spiritualist until afterwards. In <B>1868</B> Cromwell Varley, the 
electrician, testified to the phenomena of Home. In the following year the 
London Dialectical Society appointed a Committee to enquire into the matter, 
whose members included Alfred Russel Wallace (q.v.), Charles Bradlaugh, and 
Sergeant Cox. The report of the committee stated that the subject was 
&quot;worthy of more serious and careful investigation than it has hitherto 
received.&quot; Cromwell Varley, and the Research Committee of the British 
National Association of Spiritualists carried out various electrical and other 
tests, but as these have since been proved to be inadequate, it is not necessary 
to consider them in detail. On the other hand Faraday and Tyndall, Huxley and 
Carpenter, refused to have anything to do with the psychic phenomena, and 
opposed the spiritualistic movement in a spirit of intolerance which contrasted 
unfavourably with the attitude of its scientific protagonists. Meanwhile the old 
rationalist school of believers in magnetic or odylic emanations still lingered 
and were represented by the Psychological Society (founded in <B>1875</B>, and 
came to an end in <B>1879</B>), the writings of its president, Sergeant Cox, and 
those of the well-known spiritualist, Mr. Samuel Guppy. One other scientific man 
of the period is deserving of mention in this connection. In <B>1876</B> 
Professor Barrett (now Sir William), lecturing before the British Association, 
declared that hyperaesthesia and suggestion were not alone capable of explaining 
the phenomena, and urged the necessity for appointing a committee to 
investigate. However, his suggestion was not acted upon, and in <B>1882</B> he 
called a conference to consider the question. The direct result of this 
conference was the founding of the Society for Psychical Research. Up to this 
point the English movement differed from the American less in kind than in 
degree, for it was altogether weaker and more restricted. Indeed, the difference 
in the traditions of the two countries. and in the general temper of their 
people, rendered it impossible that the movement should spread here as rapidly 
as it had done in America, or that it should be embraced with such fervour, It 
was not-probably for the same reason-inimical to Christianity in England, but 
rather supplementary to it, and there were those who claimed to be converted to 
Christianity through its means.</P><I>
<P>The Society for Psychical Research. </I>-The history of the criticism of 
occult phenomena in Great Britain from <B>1882</B> to the present time is 
intimately connected with the <I>Society for Psychical Research, </I>and there 
is no development worthy of record which its members have not investigated. It 
was the first body to make a united and organised attempt to deal with what was 
called, for want of a better name, psychic phenomena, in a purely scientific and 
impartial spirit, free from the bias of pre-conceived ideas on the subject. It 
was, indeed, expressly stated in their prospectus that the members in no wise 
bound themselves to accept any one explanation, or to recognise in the phenomena 
the working of any non-physical agency. The first president of the Society was 
Professor Henry Sidgwick, and the Council numbered among its members Edmund 
Gurney, Frank Podmore, Frederic W. H. Myers, and Professor Barrett; and the Rev. 
W. Stainton Moses, Morell Theobald, Dr. George Wild, and Dawson Rogers, the 
latter four being spiritualists. It may be mentioned, however, that the avowedly 
spiritualistic members of the Society gradually dropped off. Other presidents of 
the Society were, Professor Balfour Stewart, the Rt. Hon. A. J. Balfour, 
Professor William James, Sir William Crookes, Sir Oliver Lodge, and Professor 
Barrett, several of these being among the original members. The scope of the 
<I>Psychical Research Society </I>was defined by the appointment of six 
committees, as follows :-(<B>1</B>) Committee on Thought Transference; 
(<B>2</B>) Committee on Hypnotism; (<B>3</B>) Committee on Reichenbach&rsquo;s 
Experiments ; (<B>4</B>) Committee on Apparitions; (<B>5</B>) Committee on 
Physical (spiritualistic) Phenomena; and (<B>6</B>) a Committee to consider the 
history and existing literature of the subject. The field of the Society was 
thus a wide one, and it was still further enlarged in later years, when a 
committee, headed by Dr. Richard Hodgson, conducted an enquiry into Theosophy 
(q.v.). And the methods of psychic research were applied to other matters also, 
which ware outside of the Society&rsquo;s original scope. In order to find an 
explanation for the spiritualistic phenomena, its members journeyed into the 
domain of psychology, and studied automatism, hallucinations, and thought 
transference, one or other of which has been proved to have an important bearing 
on much of the spiritualistic phenomena, if not on all. They were also 
instrumental in detecting a great deal of fraud in connection with mediumistic 
performances, especially in such phenomena as slate-writing (q.v.) and other 
&quot; physical&quot; manifestations. The explanation of these, in fact, formed 
one of the chief aim&rsquo;s of the <I>Society. </I>Though at the time of its 
founding public mediumship seemed to have declined; there was still more than 
enough phenomena for the Society to investigate, and the testimony of Sir 
William Crookes and other&rsquo;s of standing and intellectual strength 
indicated that the matter was at least a fit &lsquo;subject for investigation. 
In connection with &lsquo;slate-writing, which many person&rsquo;s declared to 
be genuine and so &lsquo;simple that fraud was impossible, Mr. S. J. Davey, a 
member of the Society, gave a number of pseudo-seances. Having been himself 
deceived for a time by the performances in that line of the well-known medium, 
William Eglinton, and having at length discovered the <I>modus </I>of his 
slate-writing feats, Mr. Davey set himself to emulate the medium&rsquo;s 
manifestations.&quot; In the interests of psychic research he undertook to give 
sittings, which were carefully recorded by Dr. Hodgson. So well were the devices 
of the professional mediums reproduced that none of the sitter&rsquo;s were able 
to detect the <I>modus operandi </I>of Davey&rsquo;s performances, even though 
they were assured beforehand that it was simply a conjuring trick. Such a 
demonstration could not fail to do more than any amount of argument to expose 
the &quot;phenomenon&quot; of slate-writing. <I>(See </I>article on 
<B>Slate-writing.</B>) Excellent work was done by the Society in the collection 
of evidence relating to apparition&rsquo;s of the dead and the living, many of 
which are embodied in <I>Phantasms of the living, </I>by Messrs. Myers, Podmore 
and Gurney. A statistical enquiry on a large scale was undertaken by a Committee 
of the <I>Society </I>in <B>1889</B>. Some <B>17</B>,<B>000</B> cases of 
apparitions were collected by the committee and it&rsquo;s assistants. The main 
object in taking such a census was to obtain evidence for the working of 
telepathy in veridical or coincidental apparitions, and in order to make 
&lsquo;such evidence of scientific value, the utmost care was taken to insure 
the impartiality and responsible character of all who took part in the enquiry. 
The result was, that after every precaution had been taken the apparitions 
coinciding with a death or other crisis were found greatly to exceed the number 
which could be ascribed to chance alone. <I>(See also </I><B>Psychical 
Research.</B>) But the most fruitful of the <I>Society&rsquo;s </I>researches 
were those concerning telepathy (q.v.). or thought-transference, and it was 
through the influence of its members that the doctrine of thought-transference, 
so long known to the vague speculation&rsquo;s of the old magnetists and 
mesmerist&rsquo;s, was first placed on a definite basis as a problem worthy of 
scientific enquiry. Investigations into this matter are still progressing, and 
trustworthy proof of &lsquo;such a mode of communication would affect the 
scientific view of spiritualism to a remarkable degree. Among the individual 
efforts of members of the <I>Society for&rsquo; Psychical Research </I>the most 
complete and the most successful were those conducted by Professor and Mrs. 
Sidgwick in 
<B>1889</B>-<B>91</B>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<I>(See </I><B>Telepathy.</B>) At the same time there was much to encourage the 
belief in some &quot;supernormal&quot; agency, especially in the last decade of 
the nineteenth century. The two mediums whose manifestation&rsquo;s led many 
able men in this country, in America, and on the Continent, to conclude that the 
spirits of the dead were concerned in their phenomena were the Italian medium 
Eusapia Palladino (q.v.) and the American Mrs. Piper. In <B>1885</B> Professor 
James, of Harvard, studied the case of Mrs. Piper (q.v.), and a few years later 
Dr. Richard Hodgson of the American <I>Society for Psychical Research </I>also 
investigated her case, the latter commencing his investigations in an entirely 
sceptical spirit. Of all the trance mediums she offers the best evidence for a 
supernatural agency. Dr. Hodgson himself declared his belief that the spirits of 
the dead spoke through the lips of the medium, and among other&rsquo;s who held 
that fraud alone would not account for the revelations given by Mrs. Piper in 
the trance state were Professor James, Sir Oliver Lodge, Mr. Myers and Professor 
J. H. Hyslop. On the other hand, Mr. Podmore, while not admitting any 
&lsquo;supernormal agency, suggests that telepathy may help to explain the 
matter, probably aided by skilful observation and carefully-conducted enquiries 
concerning the affair&rsquo;s of prospective sitters. Mrs. Sidgwick, again, 
suggested that probably Mrs. Piper received telepathic communications from the 
spirits of the dead, which she reproduced in her automatic speaking and writing. 
The other medium was Eusapia Palladino, who, after attracting considerable 
attention from Professor&rsquo;s Lombroso, Richet, Flammarion, and other&rsquo;s 
on the Continent, came to Britain in <B>1895</B>. Several English scientific men 
had already witnessed her telergic powers on the Continent, at the invitation of 
Professor Charles Richet-Sir Oliver Lodge, Mr. Myers, and others -and of these 
Sir Oliver Lodge, at least, had expressed himself as satisfied that no known 
agency was responsible for her remarkable manifestations. The English 
sitting&rsquo;s were held at Cambridge, and as it was proved conclusively that 
the medium made use of fraud, the majority of the investigators ascribed her 
&quot; manifestations&quot; entirely to that. Later, however, in <B>1898</B>, a 
further &lsquo;series of &lsquo;seances were held at Paris, and so successfully 
that Richet, Myers, and Sir O. Lodge once more declared themselves satisfied of 
the genuineness of the phenomena. A further account of this medium will be found 
under a separate heading. Perhaps the most convincing evidence for the working 
of &lsquo;some supernormal agency, however, is to be found in the famous 
cross-correspondence experiments conducted in recent years. Mr. Myers had 
&lsquo;suggested before he died that if a control were to give the &lsquo;same 
message to two or more mediums, it would go far to establish the independent 
existence of &lsquo;such control. On the death of Professor Sidgwick (in August, 
<B>1900</B>) and of Mr. Myers (in January, <B>1901</B>) it was thought that if 
mediums were controlled by these, some agreement might be looked for in the 
scripts. The first correspondences were found in the &lsquo;script of Mrs. 
Thomson and Miss Rawson, the former in London, the latter in the &lsquo;south of 
France. The Sidgwick control appeared for the first time to these ladies on the 
same day, January <B>11</B>th, <B>1901</B>. On the <B>8</B>th of May, 
<B>1901</B> the Myers control appeared in the script of Mrs. Thompson and Mrs. 
Verrall, and later in that of Mrs. Piper and other&rsquo;s. So remarkable were 
the correspondences obtained in some cases where there could not possibly be 
collusion between the mediums, that it is difficult to believe that some 
discarnate intelligence was not responsible for &lsquo;some, at least of the 
scripts. <I>(See also </I><B>Cross-Correspondences.</B>)</P><I>

<P>By far the most extraordinary experiments in connection with psychic 
phenomena were those undertaken by Sir William Crookes. Working under the most 
stringent conditions he and his fellow experimenters assured themselves that 
entrance or exit to the room in which their seances were held was impossible. 
Yet he succeeded by the aid of a medium in obtaining the best possible evidence 
of the presence of spirits or other entities in the apartment. These were of a 
tangible nature and were actually weighed by Sir William, who on one occasion 
even succeeded in obtaining a portion of the protoplasmic matter from which 
these entities were built up, which he kept in a box for &lsquo;several days. 
These entities emerged from the body of the medium or from that of one of the 
sitter&rsquo;s, walked about, spoke, and even debated loudly and noisily with 
Sir William and the other &lsquo;sitter&rsquo;s on many different topic&rsquo;s 
over a prolonged &lsquo;space of time. They frequently vanished through the 
floor. Sir William found their average weight to he about one-third of that of a 
human being. These phenomena were witnessed by numerous persons of the highest 
intelligence and probity, among them, it is under-&rsquo;stood. &lsquo;some of 
exalted rank. A full statement regarding the phenomena in all their details may 
be found in Mr. Gambier Bolton&rsquo;s interesting little volume <I>Ghosts in 
Solid Form.</I></P>
<P>No work of recent times furnishes the student of psychic research with such a 
masterly conspectus of the subject as Sir William F. Barrett&rsquo;s <I>On the 
Threshold of the Unseen </I>(<B>1917</B>). Expanded from an address on the 
phenomena of <I>spiritualism </I>delivered some twenty years ago, it covers the 
whole history of psychical research during that period and a notice of it may 
well &lsquo;serve to complete this article and furnish the reader with data 
concerning psychical research during the present century. The introductory 
chapter briefly reviews the work of eminent &lsquo;scientists and provides a 
frank &lsquo;statement of the present position of psychical research. Public 
opinion regarding the quest, and the conflicting objection&rsquo;s of 
&lsquo;science and religion are briefly reviewed in chapters II. and III., and 
are followed by an essay on the physical phenomena of <I>spiritualism, </I>which 
contains little that is not noticed in the present article. Chapter VII., 
&quot;On Certain more Disputable Phenomena of <I>Spiritualism,&quot; 
</I>deal&rsquo;s with examples of the direct voice and direct writing, 
materialization and spirit photography, all of which phenomena have been termed 
<I>ectoplasms </I>by Professor Ochorowicz of Warsaw. &quot;By Ectoplasy,&quot; 
say&rsquo;s Sir William, &quot; is meant the power of forming outside the body 
of the medium a concentration of vital energy or vitalized matter which operates 
temporarily in the same way as the body from which it is drawn, &lsquo;so that 
visible, audible or tangible human-like phenomena are produced. This is very 
much like the &lsquo;psychic force&rsquo; hypothesis under a new name. The 
chapter &lsquo; On the Canons of Evidence in Psychical Research&quot; includes a 
sentence which might well be taken to heart by the too sceptical : &quot; It is 
utterly unphilosophical to ridicule or deny well-attested phenomena because they 
are inexplicable.&quot; Sir William &lsquo;show&rsquo;s how the critical 
examination of psychic phenomena has languished because of the lack of trained 
scientific observers, those devoting themselves to the subject being for the 
most part person&rsquo;s of more enthusiasm than judgment. The chapter on 
theories is eminently useful. &quot; I have never yet,&quot; says the author, 
&quot;met with anyone who has seriously studied the evidence or engaged in 
prolonged investigation of this subject who holds &lsquo; that all mediums are 
impostors.&rsquo;&quot; The theories examined to account for Supernormal 
phenomena include those of hallucination, which is only partially admitted as a 
cause. Exo-neural action of the brain which is, however, a sub-conscious action, 
an effect of the subliminal self, but perhaps the most interesting of the 
hypotheses which account for these miraculous happenings is described as 
follows: &quot; It may be that the intelligence operating at a &lsquo;seance is 
a thought-projection of ourselves-that each one of us has his simulacrum in the 
unseen; that with the growth of our life and character here a ghostly image of 
oneself is growing up in the invisible world.&quot; <I>The Problem of Mediumship 
</I>is the subject of the tenth chapter. Objection is taken to the word 
&quot;medium,&quot; not only because of its associations, but for more 
scientific reason&rsquo;s. A separate division of the book is occupied with the 
phenomenal evidence afforded by apparitions, automatic writing, 
&lsquo;supernormal message&rsquo;s, and the evidence of identity in the 
discarnate condition and of &lsquo;survival after death. The last portion of the 
volume brings the question of human personality up to date, especially as 
regards its higher aspect&rsquo;s, the conclusion being that only the barrier of 
our &lsquo;sense perceptions, a&quot; threshold of &lsquo;sensibility,&quot; 
divide&rsquo;s us from the world beyond our normal consciousness, just as 
&quot;the organism of an oyster constitutes a threshold which shuts it out from 
the greater part of our &lsquo;sensible world.&quot; As regards the question of 
immortality it is concluded that &quot; Life can exist in the unseen,&quot; but 
it does not follow that spirit communications teach us the necessary and 
inherent immortality of the &lsquo;soul. &quot; If we accept the evidence for 
&lsquo;identity, that some we have known on earth are still living and near 
us,&quot; we have &lsquo;still to remember that &quot;entrance on a life after 
death does not necessarily mean immortality, that is eternal persistence of our 
personality, nor doe&rsquo;s it prove that survival after death extends to all. 
Obviously no experimental evidence can ever demonstrate either of these beliefs, 
though it may and does remove the objection&rsquo;s raised as to the possibility 
of &lsquo;survival.&quot;</P>
<P>Towards the end of <B>1916</B> a great &lsquo;sensation was made not only in 
occult but in general circles by the publication by Sir Oliver Lodge of a memoir 
upon his &lsquo;son, the late Lieutenant Raymond Lodge, who was killed near 
Ypres in September, <B>1915</B>. The book is divided into three parts, the first 
of which contains a history of the brief life of the subject of the memoir. The 
second part details numerous records of sittings both in the company of mediums 
and at the table by Sir Oliver Lodge and members of his family, and it is 
claimed that in these many evidence&rsquo;s of the personal survival of his son 
were obtained, that the whole trend of the message&rsquo;s was eloquent of his 
personality and that although if the evidential matter were taken apart for 
examination single isolated proofs would not be deemed conclusive, yet when 
taken in a body it provides evidential material of an important nature. There is 
certainly ground for this contention and it must be admitted that proofs of 
identity are more valuable when experienced by those who were familiar with the 
subject during his earthly career. But to those who have not had this 
opportunity the balance of the evidence seems meagre and it is notable that in 
this especial case most of the tests of real value broke down when put into 
practice. The third part of the book deals with the scientific material relating 
to the life after death which is reviewed and &lsquo;summarized in a 
&lsquo;spirit of great fairness, although a natural bias towards belief in 
immortality is not a little obvious. In this the work differs from that by Sir 
William Barrett, with its wholly scientific attitude and it&rsquo;s greater 
natural ability to discern dialectical weaknesses, but it is far from being 
unscientific in character. On the other hand Sir Oliver-Lodge&rsquo;s work is 
inspired throughout by an enthusiasm which if not entirely absent in that of Sir 
William Barrett, is certainly not conspicuous in that writer&rsquo;s treatise. 
Sir Oliver&rsquo;s enthusiasm is, indeed, that of a Columbus or a Galileo. 
Throughout the centuries the pioneer and discoverer have been uplifted and 
assisted more by faith than by reason, and it is probably because of his 
abounding faith in human immortality that Sir Oliver Lodge will in future be 
regarded as perhaps the greatest pioneer in psychic science, not only of his own 
generation but of many 
generation&rsquo;s.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
L. S.</P><I>
<P>Spiritualism </I>as <I>a Religion.-Spiritualism </I>was, and is, regarded by 
its adherent&rsquo;s as a religion, or a supplement to an existing religion, 
imposing certain moral obligations and offering new and far-reaching revelations 
on the condition&rsquo;s of existence beyond the grave. The continuity of life 
after death is, of course, one of its most important tenets, though not a 
distinctive one; since on it depend most of the world&rsquo;s creed&rsquo;s and 
religions. But the &lsquo;spiritualist&rsquo;s ideas concerning the <I>nature 
</I>of the life of the freed &lsquo;soul are peculiar to his creed. The soul, or 
spirit, is composed of a sort of attenuated matter, inhabiting the body and 
resembling it in form. On the death of the body the soul withdraws itself, 
without however, undergoing any direct change, and for a longer or shorter 
period remains on the&quot; earth plane.&quot; But the keynote of the 
spirit-world is <I>progress </I>so after a time the spirit proceeds to the 
lowest&quot; discarnate plane,&quot; and from that to a higher and a higher, 
gradually evolving into a purer and nobler type, until at length it reaches the 
sphere of pure spirit. Another central belief of <I>spiritualism </I>is that the 
so-called &quot;dead&quot; can, and do, communicate with the living, through the 
agency of <I>mediums, </I>and can produce in the physical world certain 
phenomena depending for their operation on no known physical laws. To the 
earnest spiritualist, requiring no further proof of the reality of his creed, 
the subjective phenomena, as they are called, comprising trance-speaking, 
writing, etc., are of vastly greater importance than the physical 
manifestations, just as the latter are more in favour with psychical 
researchers, because of the better opportunities they offer for investigation. 
From the trance-speaking of the medium are gathered those particulars of the 
spirit world which to the outsider present one of the most unattractive pictures 
extant of that domain. The spirit life is, in fact, represented as a pale and 
attenuated reproduction of earthly life, conducted in a highly rarified 
atmosphere. Trance drawings, purporting to depict spirit scenes, afford a 
description no less flattering than the written picture. From their exalted 
spheres the spirits are cognisant of the doings of their fellow-men still on 
earth, and are at all times ready to aid and counsel the latter. This they can 
do only through the medium, who is a link between the seen and the unseen, 
perhaps through some quality of supernormal sensitiveness. There are those who 
maintain that those mediums who hold seances and become the direct mouthpieces 
of the spirits are only supereminently endowed with a faculty common to all 
humanity-that all men are mediums in a greater or less degree, and that all 
inspiration, whether good or bad, comes from the spirits. It is in connection 
with this idea of the universality of mediumship that the effect of 
<I>spiritualism </I>on the morals and daily life of its adherents is most 
clearly seen. For the spirits are naturally attracted to those mediums whose 
qualities resemble their own. Enlightened spirits from the highest spheres seek 
high-souled and earnest mediums through whom to express themselves, while 
mediums who use their divine gifts for a base end are sought by the lowest and 
wickedest human spirits, or by beings termed&quot; elementals,&quot; who do not 
even reach the human standard of goodness. Indeed, it is stated that the lower 
spirits communicate with the living much more readily than do the higher, by 
reason of a certain gross or material quality which binds them to earth. The 
path of the medium is thus beset with many difficulties, and it is essential 
that he should be principled and sincere, a creature of pure life and high 
ideals, so that the circle of his &quot; controls&quot; be select. For not only 
do the tricky &quot; elementals &quot; deceive the sitters and the investigators 
with their lying ways, but they oft-times drive the medium himself to fraud, so 
that under their control he secretes &quot; apports&quot; about his person, and 
materialises false beards and dirty muslin. And as it is with the full-fledged 
medium, so with the normal individual. If be is to insure that the source of his 
inspiration be a high one he must live in such a way that only the best spirits 
will control him, and so his impulses shall be for his own good and the 
betterment of the race. It will thus be seen that <I>spiritualism </I>is in 
itself a complete religion ; but it also combines well with other religions and 
creeds. In America the spiritualistic and the socialistic elements mingled 
harmoniously and many of the socialistic communities were founded by 
spiritualists. Other sects there were which associated themselves with 
<I>spiritualism </I>during the early history of the movement in America, and 
rumour - somewhat unfairly, it must be admitted-would have associated with it 
some less creditable ones, such as that which advocated free Love. But the many 
forms which <I>spiritualism </I>took in America were, as has been said, the 
product of the country and the time. In other lands the forms were different. In 
England, for instance, where wont and tradition were more happily settled, 
<I>spiritualism </I>was regarded as by no means incompatible with Christianity 
but rather as affording a fuller revelation of the Christian religion, a view 
which the trance utterances of the medium confirmed. In France, again, Allan 
Kardec&rsquo;s doctrine of re-incarnation blended happily with the doctrines of 
<I>spiritualism </I>to produce <I>spiritism. </I>Then we have the more modern 
example of theosophy (q.v.), a blending of <I>spiritualism </I>with oriental 
religions. But all these varied forms contain the central creed of 
<I>spiritualism; </I>the belief in the continuance of life after the &quot;great 
dissolution,&quot; or death of the body, and in continual progress; and in the 
fact of communication between the freed spirit and living human beings. On the 
whole spiritualists have shown themselves rather tolerant than otherwise to 
those who were not of their band: On the one hand their mediums did not hesitate 
to claim kinship with the wizards, shamans and witch-doctors of savage lands, 
whom they hailed as natural mediums; and on the other, there were many able and 
sincere spiritualists who joined forces with the Psychical Researcher, in the 
unflinching endeavour to expose fraud and get at the truth. M. J.</P>

<P>Staus Poltergeist :</B> The village of Staus, on the shores of Lake Lucerne, 
was in the years <B>1860</B>-<B>62</B> the scene of the most remarkable case of 
poltergeist-haunting to be found in modern records. The outbreak occurred in the 
house of M. Joller, a distinguished lawyer and a member of the Swiss national 
council, a man, moreover, whose character both in public and private life was 
beyond reproach. The household comprised M. Joller himself, his wife, seven 
children (four boys and three girls), and a servant-maid. One night in the 
autumn of <B>1860</B> the latter was disturbed by a loud rapping on her 
bedstead, which she regarded as a presage of death. M. Joller ascribed the 
sounds to the girls imagination, and forbade her to speak of them. A few weeks 
later, returning after a short absence, he found his family much alarmed. The 
knocks had been repeated in the presence of his wife and daughter, and had even 
manifested &lsquo;sign&rsquo;s of intelligence. When, a few day&rsquo;s 
afterwards, they had news of the death of a friend, they imagined that this must 
have been what the raps portended. But again in June, <B>1861</B> the outbreak 
was renewed. This time it was one of the boys who fainted at the apparition of a 
white, indistinct figure. Other strange things began to be seen and heard by the 
children, and a few months later the maid complained that the kitchen was 
haunted by dim, grey shapes who followed her to her chamber, and &lsquo;sobbed 
all night in the lumber-room. In October of the same year the maid was replaced 
by another, the rapping&rsquo;s ceased, and the disturbances seemed to be at an 
end. They were renewed, however, and with tenfold vigour, in August, 
<B>1862</B>, during the absence on business of M. Joller, his wife, and their 
eldest son. So great was the annoyance that the children fled from the house 
into the garden, in spite of their father&rsquo;s threat to punish their 
credulity. But at length the <I>poltergeist </I>began to persecute M. Joller 
himself, pursuing him from room to room with loud knocks, and not all his 
efforts sufficed to elucidate the mystery. Things began to be thrown about by 
invisible hands, locked doors and fastened window&rsquo;s were flung wide, 
strange music and voices and the humming of spinning-wheels were heard. In spite 
of M. Joller&rsquo;s attempts to conceal these happenings, the news spread 
abroad, and hundred&rsquo;s, even thousands, of persons flocked to witness the 
phenomena. Finding no rational hypothesis to fit the circumstances M. Joller 
begged the Commissary Niederberger to come and investigate, but in the 
latter&rsquo;s absence Father Guardian visited the haunted house, blessed it, 
though without alleviating the disturbances, and suggested that an enquiry be 
made by men of authority M. Joller privately called in several scientific men of 
his acquaintance, but they also were unable to find a solution, though various 
theories of electricity, galvanism, and magnetism were advanced. Other 
person&rsquo;s of authority, Land-Captain Zelger, the Director of Police Jann, 
Dr. Christen, the President of the Court of Justice, were present while 
Commissary Niederberger and Father Guardian made a careful examination of the 
house, without discovering any cause for the disturbances, which &lsquo;still 
continued unabated. At length M. Joller demanded of the police a formal 
examination, and three of the head&rsquo;s of the police were chosen to 
investigate. The Joller family were bidden to withdraw, and for six days the 
police remained in undisturbed possession. At the end of that period, having 
neither heard nor seen any &lsquo;sign of the <I>poltergeist, </I>they drew up a 
report to that effect, and took their departure. Immediately on the Jollers 
re-entering the house the phenomena began afresh. Ridicule was heaped upon the 
unfortunate member of council, even by those of his own party, and his house was 
in &lsquo;such an uproar that he found it impossible to go on with his business. 
Add to this the unwelcome curiosity of the crowd&rsquo;s who flocked to witness 
the marvels, and it is not surprising that at length, in October, <B>1862</B>, 
M. Joller left for ever his ancestral home. In the following spring he 
&lsquo;succeeded in finding a tenant for the house in <I>Staus, </I>but the 
<I>poltergeistic </I>outbreak was not renewed. It has been thought necessary to 
relate the above events somewhat fully, since they afford perhaps the best 
evidence extant for the hypothesis of discarnate intelligence operating in 
poltergeistic case&rsquo;s. The Joller case is exceedingly well-attested, not 
only by the curious crowds who saw the opening and shutting of window&rsquo;s, 
and so on, but also by men of responsibility, members of the national council, 
court of justice, and other institutions.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Stead, William Thomas :</B> Journalist and Spiritualist, was born at 
Embleton, Northumberland, in <B>1849</B>. On leaving &lsquo;school he was 
apprenticed in the office of a merchant, but soon drifted into journalism. In 
<B>1871</B> he was editor of the Darlington <I>Northern Echo, </I>and in 
<B>1883</B> of the <I>Pall Mall Gazette. </I>In <B>1890</B> he founded the 
<I>Review of Reviews, </I>finding therein an outlet for his remarkable energy. 
His journalistic zeal led him to espouse many causes-he conducted a propaganda 
in favour of the peace movement, devoted himself to the interests of the 
Boar&rsquo;s during the South African War, and issued cheap reprints of 
classical work&rsquo;s. But not the latest of his activities was concerned with 
his advocacy of spiritualism. For four years-<B>1893</B>-<B>97</B>-he conducted 
a spiritualistic organ, the <I>Borderland, </I>and till his death gave the 
weight of his journalistic and personal influence to the movement. 
Notwithstanding that there was &lsquo;something of fanaticism in his zeal, and 
that his ardour sometimes carried him beyond prescribed limits, he was still a 
force to be reckoned with in the sphere of politics, and Cecil Rhodes,

<P>Stomach, Seeing with the :</B> A phenomenon frequently observed by the 
followers of Mesmer in their somnambules. The subject, in a cataleptic 
&lsquo;state closely resembling death, would &lsquo;show no sign&rsquo;s of 
intelligence when questions were directed to his ear&rsquo;s, but if the 
question&rsquo;s were addressed to the pit of the <I>stomach, </I>or sometimes 
to the finger-tip&rsquo;s or toe&rsquo;s, an answer would be immediately 
forthcoming. Several &lsquo;such case&rsquo;s are recorded by Dr. Petetin, of 
Lyon&rsquo;s. who in <B>1808</B> published his <I>Electricite Animale, </I>and 
by other mesmerist&rsquo;s. Not only hearing, but seeing, tasting and 
&lsquo;smelling were performed by the <I>stomach, </I>independent of the sensory 
organs. Petetin attribute&rsquo;s the phenomenon to animal electricity and 
&lsquo;state&rsquo;s that objects placed on the patient&rsquo;s <I>stomach 
</I>were not seen when they were wrapped in wax or silk-that is, 
non-conductor&rsquo;s. The best way to communicate with a patient in the 
cataleptic state was for the operator to place his hand on the <I>stomach </I>of 
the subject, and address his question to the finger-tip&rsquo;s of his own free 
hand. This trance phenomenon, as well as other&rsquo;s, may now be referred to 
suggestion and hyperaesthesia.</P>

<P>Subliminal Self :</B> A term much used in psychical research to denote that 
part of the personality which is normally beneath the &quot;threshold&quot; 
<I>(limen) </I>separating consciousness from unconsciousness. The phrase owed 
it&rsquo;s popularity largely to the late Mr. Myers, who made use of it to 
explain the psychic phenomena which he had observed. Mr. Myer&rsquo;s view was 
that only a fraction of the human personality, or &lsquo;soul, find&rsquo;s 
adequate expression through the ordinary cerebral processes, because of the fact 
that the brain and physical organism have not yet reached a very advanced stage 
of evolution. The &lsquo;soul, in &lsquo;short, is like an iceberg, with a 
fraction of its bulk above water, but having much the greater part 
&lsquo;submerged. The <I>subliminal self, </I>again according to Mr. Myers, was 
in touch with a reservoir of psychical energy, from which it drew forces which 
influenced the physical organism. Thus the inspiration of genius, the exaltation 
of the perceptive and intellectual faculties in hypnosis, and &lsquo;such 
exercises as automatic writing and talking and table-tilting, were referred to 
great influxes of these psychical force&rsquo;s rather than to any morbid 
tendencies in the agent. Indeed, abnormal manifestations were, and still are, 
regarded by some authorities as foreshadowing a new type in the progress of 
evolution whose faculties shall transcend those of man just as our human 
faculties transcend those of the lower animals. The &lsquo;soul, thus dependent 
for a very inadequate expression on a nervous system of limited &lsquo;scope, is 
at death freed from its limitations and comes into its heritage of full 
consciousness. These hypotheses have been pressed into service to explain 
telepathy and communication between the living and the dead, as well as 
hallucination, automatism, and all the hypnotic phenomena. But the two former, 
even if they could be demonstrated, would require to be explained on other 
grounds, while the other&rsquo;s, whose existence is undisputed, are more 
generally regarded as resultant from cerebral dissociation-i.e., the temporary 
dislocation of the connecting link&rsquo;s between the various neural 
systems.</P>

<P>Subterranean Crypts and Temples <I>:</B> Subterranean </I>resorts, crypts and 
places of worship, have ever exercised a deep fascination upon the mind of man. 
The mysteries of the Egyptian, and of other peoples were held in underground 
<I>crypts </I>possibly for the purposes of rendering these ceremonies still more 
secret and mysterious to the mob. But also, perhaps, because it was essential to 
the privacy they necessitated. The caves of Elephanta, the Catacombs and 
&lsquo;similar <I>subterranean </I>edifices will also recur to the mind of the 
reader. But the purpose of this article is to refer to several lesser and 
perhaps more interesting underground meeting-places and <I>temples </I>in 
various parts of the world.</P>
<P>Mr. Hargreave Jennings quoting Dr. Plot in his <I>History </I>of 
<I>Staffordshire, </I>written in the third quarter of the seventeenth century, 
gives an interesting account of a &lsquo;supposed Rosicrucian crypt in that 
county, which, however, cannot be found in the work alluded to. It is, however, 
given as an interesting imaginative effort. A countryman was employed, at the 
close of a certain dull summer&rsquo;s day, in digging a trench in a field in a 
valley, round which the country rose into sombre, silent woods, vocal. only with 
the quaint cries of the infrequent magpies. It was &lsquo;some little time after 
the sun had sunk, and the countryman was just about giving over his labour for 
the day. In one or two of the last languid strokes of his pick, the rustic came 
upon something stony and hard, which struck a spark, clearly visible in the 
increasing gloom. At this &lsquo;surprise, he resumed his labour, and, curiously 
enough, found a large. flat &lsquo;stone in the centre of the field. This field 
was far away from any of the farm&rsquo;s or &quot; cotes,&quot; as they were 
called, with which the now almost twilight country was sparingly dotted. In a 
short time, he cleared the stone free of the grass and weeds which had grown 
over it ; and it proved to be a large, oblong slab, with an immense iron ring 
fixed at one end in a socket. For half an hour the countryman essayed to stir 
this stone in vain. At last he bethought himself of some yards of rope which he 
had lying near amongst his tools ; and these he converted, being an ingenious, 
inquisitive, inventive man, into a tackle-by means of which, and by passing the 
sling round a bent tree in a line with the axis of the stone. he contrived, in 
the last of the light, and with much expenditure of toil to raise it. And then, 
greatly to his &lsquo;surprise, he saw a large, deep, hollow place, buried in 
the darkness, which, when his eyes grew accustomed a little to it, he discovered 
was the top-story to a stone staircase, seemingly of extraordinary depth, for he 
&lsquo;saw nothing below. The country-fellow had not the &lsquo;slightest idea 
of where this could lend to; but being a man, though a rustic and a clown, of 
courage, and most probably urged by his idea that the stair-case led to 
&lsquo;some secret repository where treasure lay buried, he descended the first 
few &lsquo;step&rsquo;s cautiously, and tried to peer in vain down into the 
darkness. This seemed impenetrable, but there was one object at a vast, cold 
distance below. Looking up to the fresh air, and seeing the &lsquo;star 
Venus-the evening star-shining suddenly like a planet, in encouraging, 
unexpected brilliancy, although the sky had &lsquo;still some sunset-light in 
it, the puzzled man left the upper ground and descended silently a fair, though 
a &lsquo;somewhat broken stair-case. Here, at an angle, as near as he could 
judge, of a hundred feet underground, he came upon a &lsquo;square 
landing-place, with a niche in the wall; and then he saw a further long 
stair-case, descending at right angle&rsquo;s to the first stair-case, and still 
going down into deep, cold, darkness. The man cast a glance upwards, as if 
questioning the small &lsquo;segment of light from the upper world which 
&lsquo;shot down whether he &lsquo;should continue his &lsquo;search, or desist 
and return. All was stillest of the &lsquo;still about him but he &lsquo;saw no 
reason particularly to fear. So, imagining that he would in some way soon 
penetrate the mystery, and feeling in the darkness by his hands upon the wall, 
and by his toe&rsquo;s first on each step, he resolutely descended, and he 
deliberately counted two hundred and twenty steps. He felt no difficulty in his 
breathing, except a certain &lsquo;sort of aromatic smell of distant incense, 
that he thought Egyptian, coming up now and then from below, as if from another 
though a subterranean world. &quot; Possibly,&quot; thought he - for he had 
heard of them-&quot; the world of the mining gnome&rsquo;s; and I am breaking in 
upon their secret&rsquo;s, which is forbidden for man. The rustic, though 
courageous, was superstitious.</P>
<P>But, notwithstanding some fits of fear, the countryman went on, and at a much 
lower angle he met a wall in his face; but, making a turn to the right, with a 
singular credit to his nerves, the explorer went down again. And now he saw at a 
vast distance below, at the foot of a deeper &lsquo;staircase of &lsquo;stone, a 
steady though a pale light. This was shining up as if from a star, or coming 
from the centre of the earth. Cheered by this light, though absolutely 
astounded-nay, frightened-at thus discovering light, whether natural or 
artificial, in the deep bowels of the earth, the man again descended, meeting a 
thin. humid trail of light, as it looked. mounting up the centre line of the 
shining though mouldering old stairs, which apparently had not been pressed by a 
human foot for very many ages. He thought now, although it was probable only the 
wind in some hidden recess, or creeping down some gallery, that he heard a 
murmur overhead, as if of the uncertain rumble of horses and of heavy wagons, or 
lumbering wains. Next moment, all subsided into total stillness ; but the 
distant light seemed to flicker, as if in answer to the strange sound. Half a 
dozen times he paused and turned as if he would remount-almost flee for his life 
upwards, as he thought; for this might be the secret haunt of robbers, or the 
dreadful abode of evil spirits. What if, in a few moments, he should come upon 
&lsquo;some scene to affright, or alight in the midst of desperate ruffians, or 
be caught by murderer&rsquo;s. He listened eagerly. He now almost bitterly 
repented his descent. Still the light streamed at a distance, but &lsquo;still 
there was no sound to interpret the meaning of the light, or to display the 
character of this mysterious place, in which the countryman himself was 
entangled hopelessly.</P>
<P>The discoverer by this time stood &lsquo;still in fear. But at last, 
summoning courage, and recommending himself devoutly to God, he determined to 
complete his discovery. Above, he bad been working in no strange place the field 
he knew well, the woods were very familiar to him, and his own hamlet and his 
family were only a few mile&rsquo;s distant He now hastily, and more in fear 
than through courage, noisily with his feet descended the remainder of the 
&lsquo;stair&rsquo;s and the light grew brighter as he approached, until at 
last, at another turn, he came upon a square chamber built up of large hewn 
stones. He stopped, silent and awestruck. Here was a flagged pavement and a 
somewhat lofty roof, gathering up into a centre in the groins of which was a 
rose, carved exquisitely in some dark stone, or in marble. But what was this 
poor man&rsquo;s fright when, making another sudden turn, from between the 
jamb&rsquo;s, and from under the large archivolt of a Gothic stone portal, light 
streamed out over him with inexpressible brilliancy, shining over every thing, 
and lighting up the place with brilliant radiance, like an intense golden 
&lsquo;sunset. He &lsquo;started back. Then his limbs shook and bent under him 
as he gazed with terror at the figure of a man, whose face was hidden, as he 
&lsquo;sat in a studious attitude in a stone chair, reading in a great book, 
with his elbow resting on a table like a rectangular altar, in the light of a 
large, ancient iron lamp, &lsquo;suspended by a thick chain to the middle of the 
roof. A cry of alarm, which he could not suppress, escaped from the scared 
discoverer, who involuntarily advanced one pace, beside himself with terror. He 
was now. within the illuminated chamber. As his feet fell on the stone, the 
figure &lsquo;started bolt upright from his seated position as if in awful 
astonishment. He erected his hooded head, and showed himself as if in anger 
about to question the intruder. Doubtful if what he saw were a reality, or 
whether he was not in some terrific dream, the countryman advanced, without 
being aware of it, another audacious step. The hooded man now thrust out a long 
arm, as if in warning, and in a moment the discoverer perceived that his hand 
was armed with an iron baton, and that he pointed it as if tremendously to 
forbid further approach. Now, however, the poor man, not being in a condition 
either to reason or to restrain himself, with a cry, and in a passion of fear, 
took a third fatal step; and as his foot descended on the groaning &lsquo;stone, 
which seemed to give way for a moment under him, the dreadful man, or image, 
raised his arm high like a machine, and with his truncheon struck a prodigious 
blow upon the lamp, shattering it into a thousand pieces, and leaving the place 
in utter darkness.</P>
<P>This was the end of this terrifying adventure. There was total silence now, 
far and near. Only a long, low roll of thunder, or a noise similar to thunder, 
&lsquo;seemed to begin from a distance, and then to move with snatches, as if 
making turns; and it then rumbled sullenly to &lsquo;sleep as if through 
unknown, inaccessible passages. What these were - if any passages - nobody ever 
found out. It was only suspected that this hidden place referred in some way to 
the Rosicrucians, and that the mysterious people of that famous order had there 
concealed some of their scientific secrets. The place in Staffordshire became 
afterwards famed as the sepulchre of one of the brotherhood, whom, for want of a 
more distinct recognition or name, the people chose to call </P>
<P>&quot;Rosicrucius,&quot; in general reference to his order ; and from the 
circumstances of the lamp, and its &lsquo;sudden extinguishment by the figure 
that started up, it was supposed that some Rosicrucian had determined to inform 
posterity that he had penetrated to the secret of the making of the ever-burning 
lamps of the ancients,-though, at the moment that he displayed his knowledge, he 
took effectual mean&rsquo;s that no one &lsquo;should reap any advantage from 
it.</P>
<P>The Jesuit priests of the early eighteenth century have left 
description&rsquo;s of the well-known palace of Mitla in Central America, which 
leave no doubt that in their time it contained many subterranean chambers and 
one especially which appears to have surpassed all other&rsquo;s in the dreadful 
use&rsquo;s to which it was put. Father Torquemada says of the place. &lsquo;: 
When some monks of my order, the Franciscan, passed, preaching and shriving 
through the province of Zapoteca. whose capital city is Tehuantepec, they came 
to a village which was called Mictlan, that is, underworld (hell). Besides 
mentioning the large number of people in the village they told of buildings 
which were prouder and more magnificent than any which they had hitherto 
&lsquo;seen in New Spain. Among them was the temple of the evil &lsquo;spirit 
and living rooms for his demoniacal &lsquo;servants, and among other fine things 
there was a hall with ornamented panels, which were constructed of stone in a 
variety of arabesque&rsquo;s and other very remarkable designs. There were 
doorways there, each one of which was built of but three &lsquo;stones, two 
upright at the &lsquo;sides and one across them, in such a manner that, although 
these doorways were very high and broad, the stone sufficed for their entire 
construction. They were so thick and broad that we were assured there were few 
like them. There was another hall in these buildings, or rectangular temples, 
which. was erected entirely on round stone pillars very high and very thick that 
two grown men could scarcely encircle them with their arms, nor could one of 
them reach the finger-tips of the other. These pillars were all in one piece 
and, it was said, the whole shaft of the pillar measured five ells from top to 
bottom, and they were very much like those of the church of Santa Maria Maggiore 
in Rome, very skillfully made and polished.&quot;</P>
<P>Father Burgoa is more explicit with regard to these <I>subterranean 
</I>chambers, He says, &quot;There were four chambers above ground and four 
below. The latter were arranged according to their purpose in such a way that 
one front chamber &lsquo;served as chapel and sanctuary for the idols, which 
were placed on a great stone which served as an altar. And for the most 
important feasts which they celebrated with sacrifices, or at the burial of a 
king or great lord, the high priest instructed the lesser priests or the 
subordinate temple official&rsquo;s who served him to prepare the chapel and his 
vestments and a large. quantity of the incense used by them. And then he 
descended with a great retinue, which none of the common people saw him or dared 
to look in his face, convinced that if they did so they would fall dead to the 
earth as a punishment for their boldness, And when he entered the chapel they 
put on him a long white cotton garment made like an alb, and over that a garment 
shaped like a dalmatic, which was embroidered with pictures of wild beasts and 
birds ; and they put a cap on his head, and on his feet a kind of shoe woven of 
many-colored feathers. And when he had put on these garments he walked with 
solemn mien and measured step to the altar, bowed low before the idols, renewed 
the incense, and then in quite unintelligible murmurs (muy entre dientes) he 
began to converse with these images, these depositories of infernal spirits, and 
continued in this sort of prayer with hideous grimaces and writhings, uttering 
inarticulate sounds, which filled all present with fear and terror, till he came 
out of that diabolical trance and told those standing around the lie&rsquo;s and 
fabrications which the spirit had imparted to him or which he had invented 
himself. When human beings were sacrificed the ceremonies were multiplied, and 
the assistants of the high priest stretched the victim out upon a large stone, 
baring his breast, which they tore open with a great stone knife, while the body 
writhed in fearful convulsion&rsquo;s and they laid the heart bare, ripping it 
out, and with it the soul, which the devil took, while they carried the heart to 
the high priest that he might offer it to the idol&rsquo;s by holding it to 
their mouth&rsquo;s, among other ceremonies; and the body was thrown into the 
burial-place of their &quot; blessed,&quot; as they called them. And if after 
the sacrifice he felt inclined to detain those who begged any favor he sent them 
word by the subordinate priests not to leave their houses till their god&rsquo;s 
were appeased, and he commanded them to do penance meanwhile, to fast and to 
speak with no woman, so that, until this father of sin had interceded for the 
absolution of the penitent&rsquo;s and had declared the gods appeased they did 
not dare to cross their threshold.</P>
<P>&quot;The second (underground) chamber was the burial place of these high 
priest&rsquo;s, and third that of the king&rsquo;s of Theozapotlan, whom they 
brought thither richly dressed in their best attire, feathers, jewel&rsquo;s, 
golden necklaces, and precious stones, placing a shield in their left hand and a 
javelin in the right, just as they used them in war. And at their burial rites 
great mourning prevailed ; the instrument&rsquo;s which were played made 
mournful sounds ; and with loud wailing and continuous sobbing they chanted the 
life and exploits of their lord until they laid him on the sructure which they 
had prepared for this purpose.</P>
<P>&quot;The last (underground) chamber had a second door at the rear, which led 
to a dark and gruesome room. This was closed with a stone slab, which occupied 
the whole entrance. Through this door they threw the bodies of the victims and 
of the great lords and chieftains who had fallen in battle, and they brought 
them from the spot where they fell, even when it was very far off, to this 
burial place; and so great was the barbarous infatuation of these Indians that, 
in the belief of the happy life which awaited them, many who were oppressed by 
disease&rsquo;s or hardships begged this infamous priest to accept them as 
living sacrifice&rsquo;s and allow them to enter through that portal and roam 
about in the dark interior of the mountain&rsquo;s, to &lsquo;seek the great 
feasting-places of their forefather&rsquo;s. And when anyone obtained this 
favour the servant&rsquo;s of the high priest led him thither with special 
ceremonies, and after they had allowed him to enter through the small door they 
rolled the stone before it again took leave of him, and the unhappy man, 
wandering in that abyss of darkness, died of hunger and thirst, beginning 
already in life the pain of his damnation; and on account of this horrible abyss 
they called this village Liyobaa, The Cavern of Death.</P>
<P>&quot;When later there fell upon these people the light of the Gospel, 
it&rsquo;s &lsquo;servants took much trouble to instruct them to find out 
whether this error, common to all these nations, still prevailed, and they 
learned from the stories which had been handed down that all were convinced that 
this damp cavern extended more than <B>30</B> leagues underground, and that its 
roof was supported by pillars. And there were people, zealous prelates anxious 
for knowledge, who, in order to convince these ignorant people of their terror, 
went into this cave accompanied by a large number of people bearing lighted 
torches and firebrand&rsquo;s, and descended several large steps. And they soon 
came upon many buttresses which formed a kind of street. They had prudently 
brought a quantity of rope with them to use as a guiding line, that they might 
not lose themselves in this confusing labyrinth. And the putrefaction and the 
bad odour and the dampness- of the earth were very great and there was also a 
cold wind which blew out their torches And after they had gone a short distance, 
fearing to be overpowered by the stench or to step on poisonous reptiles, of 
which some had been seen, they resolved to go out again and to completely wall 
up this back door of hell. The four buildings above ground were the only ones 
which &lsquo;still remained open, and they had a court and chamber&rsquo;s like 
those underground; and the ruins of these have lasted even to the present 
day.&quot;</P>
<P>The vast <I>subterranean </I>vaults under the temple hill at Jerusalem were 
probably used as a secret meeting-place by the Templars during their occupation 
of the Holy City, and it was perhaps there that the strange Eastern rites of 
Baphomet (q.v.) which they later affected were first celebrated. In his 
<I>Recent Discoveries on the Temple Hill </I>the Rev. James King says, &quot; On 
the occasion of a visit to the Noble Sanctuary, the author had an opportunity of 
examining the ancient masonry inside the wall at the south-east corner, as well 
as the vast <I>subterranean </I>vaults popularly known as Solomon&rsquo;s 
stables. A small doorway, under a little dome at the south-east corner, admits 
by a flight of steps to a small chamber known as the Mosque of the Cradle of our 
Lord, from the existence of a hollowed &lsquo;stone which &lsquo;somewhat 
resembles a cradle, and a tradition that the Virgin Mary remained in this 
chamber for some time after her purification in the Temple. Passing through the 
chamber, the spacious vault&rsquo;s, which extend over an acre of ground, are 
reached. These <I>subterranean </I>substructures consist of one hundred square 
piers arranged in fifteen rows, each pier being five feet wide and composed of 
large marginal drafted stones, placed singly over each other. The rows are 
connected by semi-circular arches, the intercolumniations of which range from 
ten to twenty-three feet. The floor of these vaults is about forty-feet below 
the Haram Area, and more than a hundred feet above the great foundation 
corner-stone. They are called Solomon&rsquo;s Stables by the Franks. But the 
Moslem&rsquo;s call the place, Al Masjed al Kadim, that is, The Old Mosque. 
These vault&rsquo;s were used as stables by the Frank kings and the Knights 
Templar, and holes in which rings were fastened can &lsquo;still be traced on 
some of the piers.</P>
<P>Since the floor of Solomon&rsquo;s Stables is upwards of a hundred feet above 
the foundation &lsquo;stone, it seems highly probable that there exists another 
system of vaults below, for the vast space from the rock upwards is not likely 
to be filled with &lsquo;solid earth.</P>
<P>Some allusion seems to be made to these vault&rsquo;s in the writing&rsquo;s 
of Procopius, a Greek historian of the sixth century. He was born at Caesarea, 
in Palestine, about <B>500</B> A.D., and as a young man went to Constantinople, 
where his eminent talents brought him under the notice of the Emperor Justinian. 
In <B>529</B> A.D. Justinian built a &lsquo;splendid church on the Temple Hill, 
in honour of the Virgin Mary, and in the writings of Procopius there is a full 
and detailed account of the edifice. The historian relates that the fourth part 
of the ground required for the building was wanting towards the south-east; the 
builders therefore laid their foundations on the sloping ground, and constructed 
a &lsquo;series of arched vault&rsquo;s, in order to raise the ground to the 
level of the other part&rsquo;s of the enclosure. This account is eminently 
descriptive of the <I>subterranean </I>vaults at the south-east portion of the 
Haram, and, according to Mr. Fergusson, the stone-work of these vaults certainly 
belongs to the age of Justinian.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Succubus :</B> A demon who takes the shape of a woman. The Rabbi Ellas says 
that it is mentioned in certain writings that Adam was visited during a hundred 
and thirty years by female demon&rsquo;s, and had intercourse with 
demon&rsquo;s, spirit&rsquo;s, spectres, lemur&rsquo;s, and phantoms. Under the 
reign of Roger, king of Sicily, a young man, bathing by moonlight, with several 
other&rsquo;s, thought he &lsquo;saw &lsquo;someone drowning, and hastened to 
the rescue. Having drawn from the water a beautiful woman, he became enamoured 
of her, married her, and had by her a child. Afterwards she disappeared 
mysteriously with her child, which made everyone believe that &lsquo;she was a 
<I>succubus. </I>Hector Boece, in his history of Scotland, relates that a very 
handsome young man was pursued by a female demon, who would pass through his 
closed door, and offer to marry him. He complained to his bishop, who enjoined 
him to fast, pray, and confess himself, when the infernal visitor ceased to 
trouble him. Delancre says that in Egypt, an honest marechal-ferrant being 
occupied in forging during the night there appeared to him a demon under the 
shape of a beautiful woman. He threw a hot iron in the face of the demon, which 
at once took to flight.</P>

<P>Suggestion :</B> The sensitiveness to <I>suggestion </I>of the entranced 
subject is the characteristic and invariable accompaniment of the hypnotic 
state, and is also a distinctive feature of hysteria. Indeed, many modern 
scientists give to hypnotism the name &lsquo;&quot;Suggestion.&quot; An abnormal 
suggestibility implies some measure of cerebral dissociation. <I>(See 
</I>Hypnotism.) In this state every <I>suggestion </I>advanced by the operator, 
whether conveyed by word, gesture, or even unconscious glance, operates with 
abnormal force in the brain of the subject, as being relieved from the 
counter-excitement of other ideas. In the view of Professor Pierre Janet all 
&lsquo;suggestibility implies a departure from perfect sanity, but this, though 
perhaps true in the strictest sense, is somewhat misleading, since all are more 
or less amenable to <I>suggestion. </I>In hypnotism and hysteria, however, the 
normal &lsquo;suggestibility is greatly exaggerated, and the <I>suggestion, 
</I>meeting with no opposition from the recipient&rsquo;s critical or judicial 
faculties (because there are no other ideas with which to compare it) becomes 
for the time his dominant idea. The <I>suggestion </I>thus accepted has a 
powerful effect on both mind and body, hence the value of <I>suggestion </I>in 
certain complaint&rsquo;s is incalculable. The miracles&quot; wrought by 
Christian Scientists, the efficacy of a pilgrimage to Lourdes, the feat&rsquo;s 
of&quot; healing mediums&quot; all testify to it&rsquo;s powerful effect. 
<I>Post-hypnotic suggestion </I>is the term applied to a <I>suggestion </I>made 
while the subject is entranced, but which is to be carried out after he awakes. 
Sometimes an interval of month&rsquo;s may elapse between the utterance of a 
command and its fulfillment, but almost invariably at the stated time the 
<I>suggestion </I>is obeyed, the recipient is perhaps unaware of the source of 
his impulse, not finding adequate logical grounds for the action he performs, or 
perhaps automatically lapses into the hypnotic state. <I>Auto-suggestion 
</I>does not proceed from any extraneous source, but arises in one&rsquo;s own 
mind, either spontaneously or from a misconception of existing circumstances, as 
in the case of a person who drinks coloured water under the impression that it 
is poison, and exhibits every symptom of poisoning. Auto-suggestion may arise 
spontaneously in dream, the automatic obedience to such <I>suggestion </I>often 
giving rise to &lsquo;stories of veridical&quot; dreams, The outbreaks of 
religious frenzy or ecstasy which &lsquo;swept Europe in the Middle Ages were 
examples of the results of <I>mass-suggestion - i.e., suggestion </I>made by a 
crowd, and much more potent than that made by an individual. Cases of so-called 
collective hallucination may be referred to the same cause. <I>Suggestion </I>is 
doubtless responsible to &lsquo;some extent for clairvoyant and mediumistic 
faculties, and on the whole enters largely into the study of psychic 
&lsquo;science.</P>

<P>Summons by the Dying :</B> It was formerly maintained by the theologians that 
if anyone who was unjustly accused or persecuted &lsquo;should summon, with his 
dying breath, his oppressor to appear before the supreme tribunal, a miracle 
would take place, and the person thus summoned would die on the day fixed by his 
innocent victim. Thus the (Grand Master of the Templars) cited the pope and the 
king of France to appear before God on a certain date not very far ahead, and 
the story goes on to relate that both died at the appointed time. Francis I., 
Duke of Brittany, hired assassin&rsquo;s to murder his brother, in <B>1450</B>. 
The dying prince summoned his murderer before the highest of all court&rsquo;s, 
and Francois &lsquo;shortly expired. Yet another instance is that of Ferdinand 
IV., of Spain, who was summoned by two noble&rsquo;s whom he had condemned 
unjustly, and he also responded reluctantly at the end of thirty days.</P>
<P>Many more example&rsquo;s could be quoted to &lsquo;show how firmly-rooted 
was this belief in the power of the <I>dying </I>to avenge their death by 
supernatural means. Indeed, it would be safe to say that, by an inversion, of 
the usual order of cause and effect, the popular faith in the &lsquo;efficacy of 
the <I>summons </I>was responsible for &lsquo;such evidence as was forthcoming 
on it&rsquo;s behalf. Fear, and possibly remorse, acting on the imagination of 
the guilty judge, might well cause him to expire at the &lsquo;stated time, and 
authenticated account&rsquo;s of death caused by these agents are not unknown. 
This is further borne out by the fact that if the condemned man was guilty-that 
is, if the judge&rsquo;s conscience was clear-the &lsquo;summons had no effect. 
Sorcerers, especially, summoned their judges, but in vain. A story, is told of 
Gonzalvo of Cordova, who sentenced a soldier to death for sorcery. The soldier 
exclaimed that he was innocent, and summoned Gonzalvo to appear before God. 
&quot; Go, then,&quot; said the judge, &quot; and hasten the proceedings. My 
brother who is in heaven, will appear for me.&quot; Needless to say, Gonzalvo 
did not die, as he believed he had dealt justly and had no fear of the 
consequences of the <I>summons.</I></P>

<P>Swedenborg, Emanuel, (1688-1772</B>) <B>:</B> One of the greatest mystics of 
all time, was born at Stockholm in Sweden on the <B>29</B>th January. His father 
was a professor of theology at Upsala, and afterwards Bishop of Scara, and in 
his time was charged with possessing heterodox opinions. <I>Swedenborg 
</I>completed his education at the university of Upsala in <B>1710</B>, after 
which he visited England, Holland, France and Germany. Five years later he 
returned to his native town, and devoted much time to the study of natural 
science and engineering, editing a paper entitled <I>Daedalus hyperboreus 
</I>which dealt chiefly with mechanical inventions. About <B>1716</B>, Charles 
XII. appointed him to the Swedish Board of Mine&rsquo;s. He appears at this time 
to have had many activities. He published various mathematical and mechanical 
work&rsquo;s, and even took part in the siege of Friederickshall in an 
engineering capacity. Originally known as Swedberg, he was elevated to the rank 
of the nobility by Queen Ulrica and changed his name to <I>Swedenborg. 
</I>Sitting in the House of Nobles, his political utterances had great weight, 
but his tendencies were distinctly democratic. He busied himself privately in 
scientific gropings for the explanation of the universe, and published at least 
two work&rsquo;s dealing with the origin of things which are of no great 
account, unless as foreshadow mg many scientific facts and ventures of the 
future. Thus his theories regarding light, cosmic atoms, geology and 
physic&rsquo;s, were distinctly in advance of his time, and had they been 
suitably disseminated could not but have influenced scientific Europe. He even 
sketched a flying-machine, and felt confident that although it was unsuitable to 
aerial navigation, if men of science applied themselves to the problem, it would 
speedily be solved. It was in <B>1734</B> that he published his <I>Prodomus 
Philosophiae Ratiocinantrio de Infinite </I>which treats of the relation of the 
finite to the infinite and of the soul to the body. In this work he seeks to 
establish a definite connection between the two as a means of overcoming the 
difficulty of their relationship. The spiritual and the divine appear to him as 
the supreme study of man. He ransacked the countries of Europe in quest of the 
most eminent teachers and the best books dealing with anatomy, for he considered 
that in that science lay the germ of the knowledge of soul and spirit. Through 
his anatomical studies he anticipated certain modern views dealing with the 
functions of the brain, which are most remarkable.</P>
<P>About the age of fifty-five a profound change overtook the character of 
<I>Swedenborg. </I>Up to this time he had been a scientist, legislator, and man 
of affairs ; but now his enquiries into the region of spiritual things were to 
divorce him entirely from practical matters. His introduction into the spiritual 
world, his illumination, was commenced by dreams and extraordinary visions. He 
heard wonderful conversations and felt impelled to found a new church. He says 
that the eyes of his spirit were so opened that he could see heavens and hells, 
and converse with angels and spirits : but all his doctrines relating to the New 
Church came directly from God alone, while he was reading the gospels. He 
claimed that God revealed Himself to him and told him that He had chosen him to 
unveil the spiritual sense of the whole scriptures to man. From that moment 
worldly knowledge was eschewed by <I>Swedenborg </I>and he worked for spiritual 
ends alone. He resigned his several appointments and retired upon half pay. 
Refreshing his knowledge of the Hebrew tongue, he commenced his great works on 
the interpretation of the scriptures. After the year <B>1747</B> he lived in 
Sweden, Holland and London, in which city he died on the <B>20</B>th of March 
<B>1772</B>. He was buried in the Swedish Church in Prince&rsquo;s Square, in 
the parish of St. George&rsquo;s in the East, and in April, <B>1908</B> his 
bones were removed, at the request of the Swedish government, to Stockholm.</P>
<P>There can be no question as to the intrinsic honesty of <I>Swedenborg&rsquo;s 
</I>mind and character. He was neither presumptuous nor overbearing as regards 
his doctrines, but gentle and reasonable. A man of few wants, his life was 
simplicity itself-his food consisting for the most part of bread, milk and 
coffee. He was in the habit of lying in a trance for days together, and day and 
night had no distinctions for him. His mighty wrestlings with evil spirits at 
times so terrified his servants, that they would seek the most distant part of 
the house in refuge. But again he would converse with benignant angels in broad 
daylight. We are badly hampered regarding first-hand evidence of his spiritual 
life and adventures-most of our knowledge being gleaned from other than original 
sources.</P>
<P>So far from attempting to found a new church, or otherwise tamper or 
interfere with existing religious systems, <I>Swedenborg </I>was of the opinion 
that the members of all churches could belong to his New Church in a spiritual 
sense. His works may be divided into : expository volumes, notably <I>The 
Apocalypse Revealed, The Apocalypse Explained, </I>and <I>Arcana Celestia; 
</I>books of spiritual philosophy. such as <I>Intercourse between the Soul and 
the Body Divine Providence, </I>and <I>Divine Love and Wisdom </I>books dealing 
with the hierarchy of supernatural spheres such as <I>Heaven and Hell </I>and 
<I>The Last Judgment; </I>and those which are purely doctrinal, such as <I>The 
New Jerusalem, The Trite Christian Religion, </I>and <I>Canons of the New 
Church. </I>Of these his <I>Divine Love and Wisdom </I>is the volume which most 
succinctly presents his entire religious systems. God he regards as the Divine 
Man. Spiritually He consists of infinite love, and corporeally of infinite 
wisdom. From the divine love all things draw nourishment. The sun, as we know 
it, is merely a microcosm of a spiritual sun which emanates from the Creator. 
This spiritual sun is the source of love and knowledge, and the natural sun is 
the source of nature ; but whereas the first is alive, the second is inanimate. 
There is no connection between the two worlds of nature and spirit unless in 
similarity of construction. Love, wisdom, use or end, cause and effect, are the 
three infinite and uncreated degrees of being in God and man respectively. The 
causes of all things exist in the spiritual sphere and their effects in the 
natural sphere, and the end of all creation is that man may become the image of 
his Creator, and of the cosmos as a whole. This is to be effected by a love of 
the degrees above enumerated. Man possesses two vessels or receptacles for the 
containment of God-the Will for divine love, and the Understanding for divine 
wisdom. Before the Fall, the flow of these virtues into the human spirit was 
perfect, but through the intervention of the forces of evil, and the sins of man 
himself, it was much interrupted. Seeking to restore the connection between 
Himself and man, God came into the world as Man; for if He had ventured on earth 
in His unveiled splendour, he would have destroyed the hells through which he 
must proceed to redeem man, and this He did not wish to do, merely to conquer 
them. The unity of God is an essential of the Swedenborgian theology, and he 
thoroughly believes that God did not return to His own place without leaving 
behind Him a visible representative of Himself in the word of scripture, which 
is an eternal incarnation, in a three-fold sense-natural, spiritual and 
celestial. Of this <I>Swedenborg </I>is the apostle; nothing was hidden from 
him; he was aware of the appearance and conditions of other worlds, good and 
evil, heaven and hell, and of the planets. &quot; The life of religion,&quot; he 
says, &quot; is to accomplish good.&quot; &quot;The kingdom of heaven is a 
kingdom of uses.&quot; One of the central ideas of his system is known as the 
Doctrine of Correspondences. Everything visible has belonging to it an 
appropriate spiritual reality. Regarding this Vaughan says &quot; The history of 
man is an acted parable; the universe, a temple covered with hieroglyphics. 
Behmen, from the light which flashes on certain exalted moments, imagines that 
he receives the key to these hidden significances-that he can interpret the 
<I>Signature Rerum. </I>But he does not see spirits, or talk with angels. 
According to him, such communications would be less reliable than the intuition 
he enjoyed. <I>Swedenborg </I>takes opposite ground. &lsquo; What I 
relate,&rsquo; he would say, &lsquo; comes from no such mere inward persuasion. 
I recount the things I have seen. I do not labour to recall and to express the 
manifestation made me in some moment of ecstatic exaltation. I write you down a 
plain statement of journeys and conversations in the spiritual world, which have 
made the greater part of my daily history for many years together. I take my 
stand upon experience. I have proceeded by observation and induction as strict 
as that of any man of science among you. Only it has been given me to enjoy an 
experience reaching into two worlds-that of spirit, as well as that of 
matter.&rsquo; </P>
<P>&quot;According to <I>Swedenborg, </I>all the mythology and the symbolisms of 
ancient times were so many refracted or fragmentary correspondences-relics of 
that better day when every outward object suggested to man&rsquo;s mind its 
appropriate divine truth. Such desultory and uncertain links between the seen 
and the unseen are so many imperfect attempts toward that harmony of the two 
worlds which he believed himself commissioned to reveal. The happy thoughts of 
the artist, the imaginative analogies of the poet, are exchanged with 
<I>Swedenborg </I>for an elaborate system. All the terms and objects in the 
natural and spiritual worlds are catalogued in pairs. This method appears so 
much formal pedantry. Our fancies will not work to order. The meaning and the 
life with which we continually inform outward object&rsquo;s-those 
suggestion&rsquo;s from sight and sound, which make almost every man at 
time&rsquo;s a poet-are our own creations, are determined by the mood of the 
hour, cannot be imposed from without, cannot be arranged like the nomenclature 
of a science. As regard&rsquo;s the inner &lsquo;sense of scripture, at all 
events, <I>Swedenborg </I>introduces some such yoke. In that province, how-ever, 
it is perhaps as well that those who are not satisfied with the obvious sense 
&lsquo;should find some restraint for their imagination, some method for their 
ingenuity, some guidance in a curiosity irresistible to a certain class of 
minds. If an objector &lsquo;say, &lsquo; I do not &lsquo;see why the ass 
&lsquo;should correspond to &lsquo;scientific truth, and the horse to 
intellectual truth,&rsquo; <I>Swedenborg </I>will reply, &lsquo;This analogy 
rests on no fancy of mine, but on actual experience and observation in the 
spiritual world. I have always seen horses and asses present and circumstanced, 
when, and according as, those inward qualities were central.&rsquo; But I do not 
believe that it was the design of <I>Swedenborg </I>rigidly to determine the 
relationships by which men are continually uniting the seen and unseen worlds. 
He probably conceived it his mission to disclose to men the divinely-ordered 
correspondences of scripture, the close relationship of man&rsquo;s several 
states of being, and to make mankind more fully aware that matter and spirit 
were associated, not only in the varying analogies of imagination, but by the 
deeper affinity of eternal law. In this way, he &lsquo;sought to impart an 
impulse rather than to prescribe a scheme. His consistent follower&rsquo;s will 
acknowledge that had he lived to another age, and occupied a different social 
position, the forms under which the spiritual world presented itself in him 
would have been different. To a large extent, therefore, his <I>Memorable 
Relations </I>must be regarded as true for him only-for such a character, in 
&lsquo;such a day, though containing principles independent of personal 
peculiarity and local colouring. It would have been indeed inconsistent, had the 
Protestant who (as himself a Reformer) essayed to supply the defects and correct 
the error&rsquo;s of the Reformation-had he designed to prohibit all advance 
beyond his own position.&quot;</P>
<P>The style of <I>Swedenborg </I>is clear-cut and incisive. He is never 
overpowered by manifestations from the unseen. Whereas other mystics are seized 
by fear or joy by these and become incomprehensible, he is in his element, and 
when on the very pinnacles of ecstasy can observe the &lsquo;smallest details 
with a scientific eye. We know nowadays that a great many of his visions do not 
&lsquo;square with &lsquo;scientific probabilities. Thus those which detail his 
journeys among the planets and describe the flora and fauna, let us &lsquo;say, 
of Mars, can be totally disproved, as we are aware that such form&rsquo;s of 
life as he claim&rsquo;s to have seen could not possibly exist upon that planet. 
The question arises Did the vast amount of work accomplished by <I>Swedenborg 
</I>sn the first half of his life lead to more or less serious mental 
derangement ? There have been numerous cases of &lsquo;similar injury through 
similar causes. But the scientific exactness and clarity of his mind survived to 
the last. So far as he knew science he applied it admirably and with minute 
exactness to his &lsquo;system ; but just as the science of Dante raises a 
&lsquo;smile, so we feel slightly intolerant of <I>Swedenborg&rsquo;s 
</I>&lsquo;scientific application to things &lsquo;spiritual. He was probably 
the only mystic with a real scientific training; others had been adept&rsquo;s 
in chemistry and kindred studies, but no mystic ever experienced &lsquo;such a 
long and arduous scientific apprenticeship as <I>Swedenborg. </I>It colours the 
whole of his system. It would be exceedingly difficult to say whether he was 
more naturally a mystic or a &lsquo;scientist. In the first part of his life we 
do not find him greatly exercised by &lsquo;spiritual affair&rsquo;s; and it is 
only when he had passed the meridian of human days that he &lsquo;seriously 
began to consider matters &lsquo;supernatural. The change to the life of a 
mystic, if not rapid was certainly not prolonged: what then caused it ? We can 
only suspect that his whole tendency was essentially mystical from the first, 
and that he was a scientist by force of circumstance rather than because of any 
other reason. The spiritual was constantly simmering within his brain, but, as 
the world is ever with us, he found it difficult to throw off the superincumbent 
mass of affair&rsquo;s, which probably trammelled him for year&rsquo;s. At 
length the fountains of his &lsquo;spirit welled up &lsquo;so fiercely that they 
could no longer be kept back; and throwing aside his scientific oars, he leaped 
into the spiritual ocean which afterwards speedily engulfed him. There is 
perhaps no analogy to be found to his case in the biography of &lsquo;science. 
We cannot altogether unveil the spring&rsquo;s of the man&rsquo;s spirituality, 
but we know that they existed deep down in him. It has often been said that he 
was a mere visionary, and not a mystic, in the proper sense of the word; but the 
term&rsquo;s of his philosophy dispose of this contention; although in many ways 
it does not square with the generally-accepted doctrine&rsquo;s of mysticism, it 
is undoubtedly one of the most striking and pregnant contribution&rsquo;s to it. 
He is the apostle of the divine humanity, and the &quot;&lsquo;Grand Man&quot; 
is with him the beginning and end of the creative purpose. The originality of 
his system is marked, and the detail with which he surrounded it provides his 
followers of the present day with a greater body of teaching than that of 
probably any other mystical master.</P>
<P>The following extracts from <I>Swedenborg&rsquo;s </I>works will assist the 
reader in gaining some idea of his eschatology and general doctrine:-</P>
<P>&quot;The universe is an image of God, and was made for use. Providence is 
the government of the Lord in heaven and on earth. It extends itself over all 
things, because there is only one fountain of life, namely, the Lord, whose 
power &lsquo;supports all that exists.</P>
<P>&quot;The influence of the Lord is according to a plan, and is invisible, as 
is Providence, by which men are not constrained to believe, and thus to lose 
their freedom. The influence of the Lord passes over from the spiritual to the 
natural, and from the inward to the outward. The Lord confers his influence on 
the good and the bad, but the latter convert&rsquo;s the good into evil, and the 
true into the false; for &lsquo;so is the creature of its will fashioned.</P>
<P>&quot;In order to comprehend the origin and progress of this influence, we 
must first know that that which proceeds from the Lord is the divine sphere 
which surrounds us, and fills the spiritual and natural world. All that proceeds 
from an object, and surrounds and clothes it, is called its sphere.</P>
<P>&quot;As all that is spiritual knows neither time nor &lsquo;space, it 
therefore follows that the general sphere or the divine one has extended itself 
from the first moment of creation to the last. This divine emanation, which 
passed over from the spiritual to the natural, penetrates actively and rapidly 
through the whole created world, to the last grade of it, where it is yet to be 
found, and produce&rsquo;s and maintains all that is animal, vegetable, and 
mineral. Man is continually surrounded by a sphere of his favourite propensities 
; these unite themselves to the natural sphere of his body, so that together 
they form one. The natural sphere surrounds every body of nature, and all the 
objects of the three kingdoms. Thus it allies itself to the spiritual world. 
This is the foundation of sympathy and antipathy, of union and separation, 
according to which there are amongst spirits presence and absence.</P>
<P>&quot;The angel said to me that the sphere surrounded men more lightly on the 
back than on the breast, where it was thicker and &lsquo;stronger. This 
&lsquo;sphere of influence, peculiar to man, operates also in general and in 
particular around him by means of the will, the understanding, and the 
practice,</P>
<P>&quot;The sphere proceeding from God, which &lsquo;surround&rsquo;s man and 
constitutes his strength, while it thereby operates on his neighbour and on the 
whole creation, is a &lsquo;sphere of peace and innocence; for the Lord is peace 
and innocence. Then only is man consequently able to make his influence 
effectual on his fellow man, when peace and innocence rule in his heart, and he 
himself is in union with heaven. This spiritual union is connected with the 
natural by a benevolent man through the touch and the laying on of hands, by 
which the influence of the inner man is quickened, prepared, and imparted. The 
body communicates with others which are about it through the body, and the 
spiritual influence diffuses itself chiefly through the hands, because these are 
the most outward or <I>ultimum </I>of man; and through him, as in the whole of 
nature, the first is contained in the last, as the cause in the effect. The 
whole &lsquo;soul and the whole body are contained in the hands as a medium of 
influence. Thus our Lord healed the sick by laying on of hand&rsquo;s, on which 
account so many were healed by the touch; and thence from the remotest times the 
consecration of priests and of all holy thing&rsquo;s was effected by laying on 
of hand. According to the etymology of the word, hands denote power. Man 
believes that his thoughts and his will proceed from within him, whereas all 
this flows into him. If be considered thing&rsquo;s in their true form, he would 
ascribe evil to hell, and good to the Lord; he would by the Lord&rsquo;s grace 
recognise good and evil within himself, and be happy. Pride alone has denied the 
influence of God, and destroyed the human race.&quot;</P>
<P>In his work <I>Heaven and Hell, Swedenborg </I>speaks of influence and 
reciprocities - Correspondences. The action of correspondence is perceptible in 
a man&rsquo;s countenance. In a countenance that has not learned hypocrisy, all 
emotion&rsquo;s are represented naturally according to their true form ; whence 
the face is called the mirror of the &lsquo;soul. In the same way, what belongs 
to the understanding is represented in the &lsquo;speech, and what belongs to 
the will in the movements. Every expression in the face, in the &lsquo;speech, 
in the movements, is called correspondence. By correspondence man communicates 
with heaven, and he can thus communicate with the angels if he possess the 
&lsquo;science of correspondence by means of thought. In order that 
communication may exist between heaven and man, the word is composed of nothing 
but correspondences, for everything in the word is correspondent, the whole and 
the part&rsquo;s ; therefore he can learn secrets, of which he perceives nothing 
in the literal sense; for in the word, there <B>is, </B>besides the literal 
meaning, a spiritual meaning - one of the world, the other of heaven. 
<I>Swedenborg </I>had his visions and communication&rsquo;s with the angels and 
spirits by mean&rsquo;s of correspondence in the spiritual sense. &quot; Angels 
speak from the spiritual world, according to inward thought; from wisdom, their 
speech flow&rsquo;s in a tranquil stream, gently and uninterruptedly,-they speak 
only in vowels the heavenly angels in A and O, the spiritual ones in E and I, 
for the vowels give tone to the speech. and by the tone the emotion is expressed 
; the interruptions, on the other hand, corresponds with creations of the mind ; 
therefore we prefer, if the subject is lofty, for instance of heaven or God, 
even in human &lsquo;speech, the vowels U and <B>0</B>, etc. Man, however, is 
united with heaven by mean&rsquo;s of the word, and form&rsquo;s thus the link 
between heaven and earth, between the divine and the natural.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But when angel&rsquo;s speak spiritually with me from heaven, they 
speak just as intelligently as the man by my side. But if they turn away from 
man, he hears nothing more whatever, even if they speak close to his ear. It is 
also remarkable that several angel&rsquo;s can speak to a man; they send down a 
spirit inclined to man, and he thus hears them united.&quot;</P>
<P>In another place he says :-</P>
<P>&quot;There are also spirits called natural or corporeal &lsquo;spirits; 
these have no connection with thought, like the other&rsquo;s, but they enter 
the body, possess all the senses, speak with the mouth, and act with the limbs, 
for they know not but that everything in that man is their own. These are the 
spirits by which men are possessed. They were, however, &lsquo;sent by the Lord 
to hell; whence in our days there are no more such possessed ones in 
existence.&quot;</P><I>
<P>Swedenborg&rsquo;s </I>further doctrines and visions of Harmonies, that is to 
say, of heaven with men, and with all objects of nature; Of the harmony and 
correspondence of all thing with each other; of Heaven, of Hell, and of the 
world of spirits ; of the various states of man after death, etc.-are very 
characteristic, important, and powerful. &quot;His contemplations of the 
enlightened inward eye refer less to everyday associations and objects of life 
(although he not unfrequently predicted future occurrences), because his mind 
was only directed to the highest &lsquo;spiritual subjects, in which indeed he 
had attained an uncommon degree of inward wakefulness, but is therefore not 
understood or known, because he described his sights so spiritually and 
unusually by language. His chapter on the immensity of heaven attracts more 
especially because it contains a conversation of spirits and angels about the 
planetary system. The planets are naturally inhabited as well as the planet 
Earth, but the inhabitant&rsquo;s differ according to the various individual 
formation of the planets. These vision&rsquo;s on the inhabitants of the planets 
agree most remarkably, and almost without exception with the indications of a 
clairvoyant whom I treated magnetically. I do not think that she knew 
<I>Swedenborg; </I>to which, however, I attach little importance. The two 
&lsquo;seer&rsquo;s perceived Mars in quite a different manner. The magnetic 
seer only found images of fright and horror. <I>Swedenborg, </I>on the other 
hand, describes them as the best of all &lsquo;spirits of the planetary system. 
Their gentle, tender, zephyr-like language, is more perfect, purer and richer in 
thought, and nearer to the language of the angels, than other&rsquo;s. These 
people associate together. and judge each other by the physiognomy, which 
amongst them is always the expression of the thoughts. They honour the Lord as 
sole God, who appears &lsquo;sometimes on their earth.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Of the inhabitants of Venus he says :-&rsquo; They are of two kinds; 
some are gentle and benevolent, others wild, cruel and of gigantic stature. The 
latter rob and plunder, and live by this means; the former have &lsquo;so great 
a degree of gentleness and kindness that they are always beloved by the good ; 
thus they often see the Lord appear in their own form on their earth.&rsquo; It 
is remarkable that this description of Venus agrees so well with the old fable, 
and with the opinions and experience we have of Venus.</P>
<P>&quot;The inhabitants of the Moon are small, like children of six or seven 
years old; at the &lsquo;same time they have the strength of men like ourselves. 
Their voice roll&rsquo;s like thunder, and the sound proceeds from the belly, 
because the moon is in quite a different atmosphere from the other 
planets.&quot;</P>

<P>Spiritualism.-Two </I>cases of spiritual visitation occurred in the Swiss 
Cantons during last century, of so startling a nature, as to attract the 
eye&rsquo;s of all Europe. The following brief &lsquo;summary of the Morzine 
epidemic is collated from the pages of the <I>Cornhill Magazine, </I>two or 
three of the London daily journals, the <I>Reveu Spirite, </I>and Mr. William 
Howitt&rsquo;s magazine article entitled, &quot;The Devil&rsquo;s of 
Morzine.&quot; The period of the occurrence was about <B>1860</B> ; the 
&lsquo;scene, the parish of Morzine, a beautiful valley of the Savoy, not more 
than half a day&rsquo;s journey from the Lake of Geneva. The place is quite, 
remote, and had been seldom visited by tourists before the period named above. 
Being moreover shut in by high mountains, and inhabited by a simple, 
industrious, and pious class of peasantry, Morzine might have appeared to a 
casual visitor the very centre of health, peace, and good order. The first 
appearance of an abnormal visitation was the conduct of a young girl, who, from 
being quiet, modest, and well-conducted, suddenly began to exhibit what her 
distressed family and friends supposed to be the &lsquo;symptoms of insanity. 
She ran about in the most singular and aimless way; climbed high trees, scaled 
walls, and was found perched on roofs and cornices, which it &lsquo;seemed 
impossible for any creature but a squirrel to reach. She soon became wholly 
intractable; was given to fits of hysteria, violent laughter, passionate 
weeping, and general aberration from her customary modest behaviour. Whilst her 
parents were anxiously seeking advice in this dilemma, another and still another 
of the young girl&rsquo;s ordinary companions were seized with the same malady. 
In the course of ten days the report prevailed, that over fifty females-ranging 
from seven years of age to fifty-had been seized, and were exhibiting 
&lsquo;symptoms of the most bewildering mental aberration. The crawling, 
climbing, leaping, wild singing, furious &lsquo;swearing, and frantic behaviour 
of these unfortunates, &lsquo;soon found crowds of imitators. Before the tidings 
of this frightful affliction, had passed beyond the district in which it 
originated several hundreds of women and children, and scores of young men, were 
writhing under the contagion. The &lsquo;seizure&rsquo;s were sudden, like the 
attacks; they &lsquo;seldom lasted long, yet they never seemed to yield to any 
form of treatment, whether harsh or kind, medical, religious or persuasive. The 
first &lsquo;symptoms of this malady do not seem to have been noted with 
&lsquo;sufficient attention to justify one in giving details which could be 
considered accurate. It was only when the number of the possessed exceeded two 
thousand persons, and the case was attracting multitudes of curious enquirers 
from all parts of the Continent, that the medical men, priest&rsquo;s, and 
journalists of the day, began to keep and publish constant records of the 
progress of the epidemic One of the &lsquo;strangest feature&rsquo;s of the 
case, and one which most constantly baffled the faculty, was the appearance of 
rugged health, and freedom from all physical disease, which distinguished this 
malady. As a general rule, the victims spoke in hoarse, rough tone&rsquo;s 
unlike their own, used profane language, such as few of them could ever have 
heard, and imitated the actions of crawling, leaping, climbing animal&rsquo;s 
with ghastly fidelity. Sometimes they would roll their bodies up into balls and 
distort their limb&rsquo;s beyond the power of the attendant physician&rsquo;s 
to account for, or disentangle. Many amongst them. were levitated in the air, 
and in a few instances, the women spoke in foreign tongues, manifested high 
conditions of exaltation, described glorious vision&rsquo;s, prophesied, gave 
clairvoyant description&rsquo;s of absent persons and distant places, sang 
hymns, and preached in strains of sublime inspiration. It must be added, that 
these instances were very rare, and were only noticeable in the earlier stages 
of the obsession. It is almost needless to say that the tidings of this horrible 
obsession attracted immense multitudes of witnesses, no less than the attention 
of the learned and philosophic. When the attempts of the medical faculty, the 
church, and the law. had been tried again and again, and all had utterly failed 
to modify the ever-increasing horrors of this malady, the Emperor of the French, 
the late Louis Napoleon, under whose protectorate Morzine was then governed, 
yielding to the representation&rsquo;s of his advisers, actually &lsquo;sent out 
three military companies to Morzine, charged with strict orders to quell the 
disturbance&rsquo;s&quot; on the authority of the Emperor, or by force if 
necessary. The result of this high-handed policy was to increase tenfold the 
violence of the disease, and to augment the number of the afflicted, in the 
person&rsquo;s of many of the very soldiers who sank under the contagion which 
they were expected to quench. The next move of the baffled French Government, 
was a &lsquo;spiritual one; an army of priest&rsquo;s, headed by a venerable 
Bishop, much beloved in his diocese, being despatched in the quality of 
exorcist&rsquo;s, at the &lsquo;suggestion of the Archbishop of Paris. Unhappily 
this second experiment worked no better than the first. Respectable looking 
group&rsquo;s of well-dressed men, women, and children, would pass into the 
churches in reverent silence, and with all the appearance of health and 
piety-but no &lsquo;sooner was the &lsquo;sound of the priest&rsquo;s voice, or 
the notes of the organ heard, than shrieks, execration&rsquo;s, sobbings, and 
frenzied cries, resounded from different parts of the assembly. Anxious 
father&rsquo;s and husbands were busy in carrying their distracted relatives 
into the open air, and whether in the church or the home, every attempt of a 
sacerdotal character, was sure to arouse the mania to heights of fury unknown 
before. The time came at length, when the good old Bishop thought of a coup de 
grace to achieve a general victory over the adversary. He commanded that as many 
as possible of the afflicted &lsquo;should be gathered together to hear high 
mass, when he trusted that the &lsquo;solemnity of the occasion would be 
&lsquo;sufficient to defeat what he evidently believed to be the combined 
force&rsquo;s of Satan.</P>
<P>According to the description cited by William Howitt in his paper on&quot; 
The Devil&rsquo;s of Morzine,&quot; the assemblage in question, including at 
least two thousand of the possessed, and a number of &lsquo;spectator&rsquo;s, 
must have far more faithfully illustrated Milton&rsquo;s description of 
Pandemonium than any mortal scene before enacted. Children and women were 
leaping over the seats and benches; clambering up the pillars, and 
&lsquo;shrieking defiance from pinnacles which &lsquo;scarcely admitted of a 
foothold for a bird. The Bishop&rsquo;s letter contains but one remark which 
seems to offer a clue to these &lsquo;scenes of horror and madness. He says, 
&quot;When in my distress and confusion I accidentally laid my hand on the heads 
of these unfortunates, I found that the paroxysm instantly subsided, and that 
however wild and clamorous they may have been before, the parties so touched 
generally &lsquo;sunk down as it were into a swoon, or deep sleep, and woke up 
most commonly restored to sanity, and a sense of propriety.&quot; The complete 
failure of episcopal influence threw the Government back on the help of medical 
&lsquo;science. Dr. Constans had, &lsquo;since his first visit, published a 
report, in which he held out hopes of cure if his advice were strictly followed. 
He was again commissioned to do what he could for Morzine. Armed with the powers 
of a dictator he returned there, and backed by a fresh detachment of sixty 
soldiers, a brigade of gendarme&rsquo;s and a fresh cure&rsquo;, he issued 
despotic decrees, and threatened lunatic asylums, and in any case deportation 
for the convulsed. He fined any person who accused other&rsquo;s of magic, or in 
any way encouraged the prevalent idea of supernatural evil. He desired the 
cure&rsquo; to preach sermons against the possibility of demoniacal possession, 
but this order could not be carried out by even the most obedient priest. The 
persons affected with fits were dispersed in every direction. Some were 
&lsquo;sent to asylums and hospitals, and many were simply exiled from Chablais. 
They were not allowed to revisit except by very special favour. Mr. William 
Howitt, writing in the <I>London Spiritual Magazine </I>says &quot; We need not 
point to the salient fact&rsquo;s of our narrative, or discuss the Various 
theories that have been invented to account for them It is impossible not to see 
the resemblance of the Morzine epidemic with the demonopathy of the sixteenth 
century, and the history of the Jansenist and Cevenne&rsquo;s convulsionnaires 
Some of the facts we have related were often observed in the state of hypnotism, 
or nervous sleep, with which physicians are familiar. The hallucination&rsquo;s 
of which we have given instance&rsquo;s are too common to astonish us. But the 
likeness of this epidemic to others that have been observed does not account for 
its symptoms.&quot;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Symbolism In Art :</B> &quot; It is in and through symbols,&quot; says 
Carlyle, &quot;that man, consciously or unconsciously lives, works, and has his 
being&quot; ; and his word&rsquo;s apply very pertinently to art in all its 
branches, for every one of these represents, in the first place, an attempt to 
reincarnate &lsquo;something in nature, and this attempt cannot be made save 
with the assistance of some manner of symbolism. The author uses the arbitrary 
and sadly restricted symbol of language whereby to state his conception of life, 
the composer employs note&rsquo;s wherewith to body forth his impression&rsquo;s 
and emotions ; while the painter must needs be still more symbolical, his art 
consisting as it does in expressing distance on a flat surface, and in 
suggesting bulk by the practice known technically as modelling. the sculptor is 
also a symbolist, for, while he has at his disposal a third dimension not 
vouchsafed to the painter, he tries to delineate coloured things in a 
mono-chromatic material; while again, it is impossible for him to convey motion 
or action as the writer can, and he can only &lsquo;suggest this by moulding a 
figure wherein an ephemeral gesture is perpetrated. Some kind of symbolism, 
then, is the technical basis of all the arts ; yet another kind of symbolic 
significance, a deeper and more mysterious one, transpires in them in many 
cases. As Coleridge observes, &quot; An idea in the highest sense of the word, 
cannot be expressed but by a symbol&quot; ; and from time immemorial 
painter&rsquo;s and &lsquo;sculptor&rsquo;s have realised this, and have tried 
to crystalise abstract ideas by the aid of certain &lsquo;sign&rsquo;s, some of 
them having quite an obvious meaning, but other&rsquo;s being cryptic. Among the 
Japanese master&rsquo;s of the Akiyoe school, Fuji-no Yama was a favourite 
topic, one which many of them figured score&rsquo;s of times ; and to Occidental 
eyes a picture of this sort is just a picture of a mountain, but to the Japanese 
it meant &lsquo;something deeper, Fuji being almost sacred to them, and its 
representation in line and colour being a sort of symbol of patriotic devotion. 
Then Hokusai, commonly accounted the greatest master of the school aforesaid, 
loved to draw a pot-bellied man reclining at his ease against cushion&rsquo;s 
and this too mean&rsquo;s little in the East but much in the West, for in 
reality it is more than a study in voluptuousness, it represents Hotei, the god 
of peace and plenty. And poor people in the Land of the Rising Sun would buy a 
copy of this picture-for those woodcut&rsquo;s which are &lsquo;so priceless now 
were mostly &lsquo;sold for a few pence originally, and were within the reach of 
the humblest. And they would hang it on the wall, trusting thus to win the 
favour of the deity it personified. Other Japanese, more religiously minded, 
preferred a picture of a curious male figure emanating from a plant, and this 
&lsquo;symbolised the legend that Buddha rose originally from a lotus; while 
further, in many Japanese draperies and the like we find a &lsquo;strange 
decoration not unlike a <I>fleur-de-lys, </I>and this was originally a drawing 
of the foot of Buddha, a drawing which evolved throughout the centuries into the 
form above-named. </P>
<P>The art of the Hindoos is likewise permeated with symbolism, much of it quite 
incomprehensible to Europeans while the ancient Greek masters also traded in 
symbols, one which occurs repeatedly in their output being the fig-leaf, which 
represented simply amorousness, and was a direct reference to the story of the 
fall of man as detailed in the book of Genesis. This same &lsquo;symbol is found 
occasionally in early Italian work&rsquo;s of art and it is in these, really, 
that we find &lsquo;symbolism at it&rsquo;s apogee; for in Italy, more 
essentially than in any other country, art was long the handmaiden of the 
Church, and thus early Italian painting and &lsquo;sculpture is replete with 
emblems referring to the Christian faith. The frequent allusion&rsquo;s in the 
Old Testament to the hand of God, as the instrument of his sovereign power, 
naturally inspired pristine artists to symbolise the deity&rsquo;s omnipotence 
by drawing a hand, sometimes with a cross behind it, sometimes emerging from 
clouds ; while equally common among the primitives was the practice of 
expressing the name of Christ by the first two letters of his name in Greek, and 
this emblem evolved betimes, assuming divine and intricate form&rsquo;s. Another 
familiar Christian symbol, figuring in numerous &lsquo;sarcophagi and mosaics, 
is a small picture of a fish; and this refers indirectly to baptism but most 
directly to Christ, for those who first used this &lsquo;sign observed that the 
letter&rsquo;s forming the word fish in Greek, IXOYE, when &lsquo;separated 
supplied the initials for the five words, Jesus Christ, Son of God, Saviour. 
Christ is also represented sometimes by a picture of a lion, this referring to 
the phrase in the Scripture&rsquo;s, &quot;The lion of the tribe of Judah&quot; 
; while the Passion is frequently &lsquo;symbolised by a drawing of a pelican, 
tearing open her breast to feed her young. Then the Holy Ghost is invariably 
suggested by a presentment of a dove, while the phoenix and the peacock were 
both employed as symbols of the Resurrection; nor doe&rsquo;s the 
&lsquo;symbolism in the art of Italy end here, for an early artist of that 
country, doing a picture of a saint, would usually add some &lsquo;sign having 
reference to an event in the subject&rsquo;s career, or to some particular 
predilection on his part. Thus, if the saint was famous as a devotee of 
pilgrimage, a shell was drawn at his feet; or, if the doing of penance was his 
particular virtue, a skull was figured on some part of the picture ; while 
finally, if his life culminated in the glory of martyrdom, this was hinted at by 
a sketch of an axe, a lance or a club.</P>
<P>Mystic symbolism waned in Italy before the eleventh century was over. Some of 
the anonymous early Florentine&rsquo;s had symbolised love by a great, flaring 
lamp ; but with the advent of Titian and Veronese all this sort of thing was 
discontinued, and amorous scenes were painted in realistic fashion. The great 
medieval masters of religious art, moreover-men like Ghibert and Raphael, 
Pintunichio and Michelangelo-scorned to deal in mere emblems, and strove to 
depict biblical scenes with a ruthless veracity to nature, Ghibert going 
&lsquo;so far as to try and introduce a &lsquo;specie&rsquo;s of perspective 
into bas-relief. But meanwhile the practice of the fathers of Italian art had 
been taken up in France and in Spain, and more especially in Germany by 
Altdorfer and Albrecht Durer; while in England, too, symbolism of various kinds 
began to become very manifest in ecclesiastical architecture and craftsmanship. 
The beautiful Norman Church with its &lsquo;square tower gave place to a Gothic 
one with a &lsquo;spire, symbol of aspiration; while the wood-work was garnished 
at places with emblems of the passion-three nails and a hammer, pincers, ladder, 
&lsquo;sponge, reed and &lsquo;spear. Besides, gargoyles commenced to appear on 
the outside&rsquo;s of Churches, the idea being that, when the building was 
consecrated, the devil&rsquo;s took flight from the interior, and perched 
themselves on the roof, and this species of symbolism did not pass away with the 
middle ages, but was carried on for long afterwards, as also was the &quot; rose 
window,&quot; symbol of the crown of thorns.</P>
<P>The churches&rsquo; suzerainty over art was virtually dead by the end of the 
fifteenth century, and thenceforth, during fully a hundred years, painting found 
its chief patrons in various enlightened kings and noblemen. But symbolism was 
not altogether ousted accordingly, for the new patrons were hardly collectors in 
the usual sense of the term, they did not buy landscapes to decorate their 
dwellings-very few <I>bona fide </I>landscapes were done before the time of 
Claude, born in <B>1600</B> - and it was mainly portraits- of themselves and 
their families which they sought. So now, in consequence of this, a new form of 
symbolism became very manifest in painting, the artist being almost invariably 
charged to introduce his patron&rsquo;s coat-of-arms into some part of the 
canvas or panel; and, though this practice began to wane with the advent of the 
seventeenth century - when collecting in the real sense began painters still 
continued to trade in emblems of one kind and another. Even Antoine Watteau 
(born in <B>1684</B>), doing a portrait of the divine Venetian pastellist, 
Rosalba Canicra, showed her with white roses in her lap l and anon this rather 
obvious symbolism was deepened by the engraver Liotard, for beneath his print 
after Watteau he inscribed the beautiful if sentimental phrase, &quot; La plus 
belle des fleurs ne dure qu&rsquo;un matin.&quot; A practice akin to this 
lingered till the close of the eighteenth century in engraving, the engraver of 
a portrait almost always thinking it necessary to surround his sitter with 
allegorical accessories ; and to choose a good example, in many prints of La 
Fontaine we find a scene from one of his fables introduced beneath the 
subject&rsquo;s visage. A few modern engravers have essayed something analogous, 
Mr. William Strange, for example, engraving a tiny portrait of a soldier in the 
corner of his familiar plate of Mr. Rudyard Kipling; while reverting to painting 
many of the great English masters of portraiture saw fit to figure, almost in 
juxtaposition to the sitter, various items symbolising his tastes or action. 
Raeburn was among the last to do this, several of his pictures of great lawyers 
being only embellished with bundles of briefs tied up with red tape; and, though 
this form of symbolism is practically dead now, the fact remains that most good 
portrait-painters still choose their <I>repoussoir </I>with a view to its aiding 
them in adumbrating more completely the sentiment of the subject in hand. Thus, 
doing a picture of a child, an artist will usually employ a high-pitched 
background, this being in some degree emblematic of youth while delineating an 
old man, he will almost certainly place him in sombre surroundings. And so we 
see again, as we saw at the outset, that all art is in a sense-symbolical; and 
that it is through symbols that it&quot; Lives, works, and has its being.&quot;
