Abadie <B>(Jeannette) :</B> A young sorceress of the village of Sibourre,
in Gascony. She was sleeping One day in her father's house while high mass
was being said. A demon, profiting by the opportunity, carried her off to
the Devil's Sabbath, where she soon awoke to find herself in the midst of
a large company. She observed that the principal demon had on his head two
faces, like Janus. She did not participate in the revelry, and was transported
to her home by the same means as she had been conveyed thence. On the threshold
she found her amulet, which the demon had taken the precaution to remove
from her bosom before carrying her off. She made a confession of all that
had happened, renounced her sorcery, and thus saved herself from the common
fate of witches and sorcerer - the stake.

Abaris : A Scythian, high priest of Apollo, and renowned magician. In so
flattering a manner did he chant the praises of Apollo, his master, that
the god gave him a golden arrow, on which he could ride through the air like
a bird, so that the Greeks called him the Aerobate. Pythagoras, his pupil,
stole this arrow from him, and accomplished many wonderful feats by its aid.
<I>Abaris </I>foretold the future, pacified storms, banished disease, and
lived without eating or drinking. He made with the bones of Pelops, a statue
of Minerva, which he sold to the Trojans as a talisman descended from heaven.
This was the famous Palladium, which protected and rendered impregnable the
town wherein it was lodged.

Abraham, <B>The</B> <B>Jew</B> <B>:</B> (Alchemist and magician, circa,
<B>1400</B>). Comparatively few biographical facts are forthcoming concerning
this German Jew, who was at once alchemist, magician and philosopher; and
these few facts are mostly derived from a very curious manuscript, now domiciled
in the Archives of the Bibliotheque de l'Arsenal, Paris, an institution rich
in occult documents. This manuscript is couched throughout in French, but
purports to be literally translated from Hebrew, and the style of the handwriting
indicates that the scribe lived at the beginning of the eighteenth century,
or possibly somewhat earlier. A distinct illiteracy characterises the French
script, the punctuation being inaccurate, indeed frequently conspicuous by
its absence, but an actual description of the document must be waived till
later. <I>Abraham </I>was probably a native of Mayence, and appears to have
been born in <B>1362</B>. We find that his father, Simon by name, was something
of a seer and magician, and that the boy accordingly commenced his occult
studies under the parental guidance, while at a later date he studied under
one, Moses, whom he himself describes as, "indeed a good man, but entirely
ignorant of The True Mystery, and of The Veritable Magic." Leaving this
preceptor, <I>Abraham </I>decided to glean knowledge by travelling, and along
with a friend called Samuel, a Bohemian by birth, he wandered through Austria
and Hungary into Greece, and thence penetrated to Constantinople, where he
remained fully two years. He is found next in Arabia, in those days a veritable
centre of mystic learning; and from Arabia he went to Palestine, whence betimes
he proceeded to Egypt. Here he had the good fortune to make the acquaintance
of Abra-Melin, the famous Egyptian philosopher, who, besides entrusting to
him certain documents, confided in him by word of mouth a number of invaluable
secrets; and armed thus, <I>Abraham </I>left Egypt for Europe, where eventually
he settled at Wurzburg in Germany. Soon he was deep in alchemistic researches,
but these did not prevent him from espousing a wife, who appears to have
been his cousin; and by her he had three daughters and also two sons, the
elder named Joseph and the younger Lamech. He took great pains to instruct
both of them in occult affairs, while, on each of his three daughters, he
settled a dowry of a hundred thousand golden florins. This considerable sum,
together with other vast wealth, he claims to have gained by travelling as
an alchemist; and whatever the truth of this statement, he certainly won
great fame, being summoned to perform acts of magic before many rich and
influential people, notably the Emperor Sigismund of Germany, the Bishop
of Wurzburg, King Henry VI. of England, the Duke of Bavaria, and Pope John
XXIII. The remainder of <I>Abraham's </I>career is shrouded in mystery, while
even the date of his death is uncertain, but it is commonly supposed to have
occurred about <B>1460</B>.
<P>
The curious manuscript cited above, and from which the foregoing facts have
been culled, is entitled <I>The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abra-Melin, </I>as
<I>delivered by Abraham the Jew unto his son Lamech. </I>This title, however,
is rather misleading, and not strictly accurate, for Abra-Melin had absolutely
no hand in the opening part of the work, this consisting of some account
of <I>Abraham's </I>own youth and early travels in search of wisdom, along
with advice to the young man aspiring to become skilled in occult arts. The
second part, on the other hand, is based on the documents which the Egyptian
sage handed to the Jew, or at least on the confidences wherewith the former
favoured the latter; and it may be fairly accurately defined as dealing with
the first principles of magic in general, the titles of some of the more
important chapters being as follows<B>:</B> "How Many, and what are the Classes
of Veritable Magic?" "What we Ought to Take into Consideration before the
Undertaking of the Operation," Concerning the Convocation of the Spirits,"
and "In what Manner we ought to Carry out the Operations." Passing to the
third and last part, this likewise is mostly derived straight from Abra-Melin;
and here the author, eschewing theoretical matter as far as possible, gives
information about the actual practice of magic. In the first place he tells
how "To procure divers Visions," How one may retain the Familiar Spirits,
bound or free, in whatsoever form," and how "To excite Tempests," while in
one chapter he treats of raising the dead, another he devotes to the topic
of transforming oneself into" divers shapes and forms," and in further pages
he descants on flying in the air, on demolishing buildings, on discovering
thefts, and on walking under the water. Then he dilates on the Thaumaturgic
healing of leprosy, dropsy, paralysis, and various more common ailments such
as fever and seasickness, while he offers intelligence on " How to be be-loved
by a Woman," and this he supplements by directions for commanding the favour
of popes, emperors, and other influential people. Finally, he reverts to
the question of summoning visions, and his penultimate chapter is entitled,
"How to cause Armed Men to Appear," while his concluding pages treat of evoking
"Comedies, Operas, and all kinds of Music and Dances."
<P>
It is by employing Kabalistic squares of letters that all these things are
to be achieved, or at least, almost all of them, and lack of space makes
it impossible to deal with the many different signs of this sort, whose use
the seer counsels. But it behoves to ask what manner of personality exhales
from these curious pages? What kind of temperament? And the answer is that
<I>Abraham </I>is shown as a man of singularly narrow mind, heaping scorn
on most other magicians, and speaking with great derision of nearly all mystical
writings save his own and those of his hero, Abra-Melin. Moreover, he inveighs
fiercely against all those who recant the religion in which they were bred,
and contends that no one guilty of this will ever attain skill in magic;
yet it should be said, in justice to the seer, that he manifests little
selfishness, and seems to have striven after success in his craft with a
view to using it for the benefit of mankind in general. His writings reflect
besides, a firm belief in that higher self existing in every man, and a keen
desire to develop it. <I>(See </I><STRONG>Flamel.</STRONG>)

Abraxas <B>:</B> (or Abracax). The Basilidian (q.v.) sect of Gnostics, of
the second century, claimed <I>Abraxas </I>as their supreme god, and said
that Jesus Christ was only a phantom sent to earth by him. They believed
that his name contained great mysteries, as it was composed of the seven
Greek letters which form the number <B>365</B>, which is also the number
of days in a year. <I>Abraxas, </I>they thought, had under his command
<B>365</B> gods, to whom they attributed <B>365</B> virtues, one for each
day. The older Mythologists placed him among the number of Egyptian gods,
and demonologists have described him as a demon, with the head of a king
and with serpents forming his feet. He is represented on ancient amulets,
with a whip in his hand. It is from his name that the mystic word, Abracadabra
(q.v.) is taken. Many stones and gems cut in various symbolic forms, such
as the head of a fowl, a serpent, and so forth, were worn by the Basilidians
as amulets.

" I know what you have done," he would say to the people, "there is no need
for confession. Go in peace, your sins are forgiven." His so-called "miracles"
gained for him the awe of the multitude, and he was in the habit of giving
away parings of his nails and locks of his hair as powerful amulets. He is
even said to have set up an altar in his own name. In his history of his
life, of which only a fragment remains, he tells us of miraculous powers
bestowed by an angel at his birth. He showed to his disciples a letter which
he declared had been brought to him from Jesus Christ by the hand of St.
Michael. These, and similar blasphemies were put an end to by his being cast
into prison, where he died.

Adam, Book of the Penitence of <B>:</B> A manuscript in the Library of the
Arsenal at Paris, which deals with Kabalistic tradition. It recounts how
the sons of Adam, Cain and Abel, typifying brute force and intelligence,
slew each other, and that <I>A dam's </I>inheritance passed to his third
son. Seth. Seth, it is stated, was permitted to advance as far as the gate
of the Earthly Paradise without being threatened by the guardian angel with
his flaming sword, which is to say that he was an initiate of occult science.
He beheld the Tree of Life and the Tree of Knowledge, which had become grafted
upon each other so that they formed one tree. This is supposed by some to
have symbolised the harmony of science and religion in the Kabala. The guardian
angel presented Seth with three seeds from this tree, directing him to place
them within the mouth of his father, <I>Adam, </I>when he expired. From this
planting arose the burning bush out of which God communicated to Moses his
holy name, and from a part of which Moses made his magic wand. This was placed
in the Ark of the Covenant, and was planted by King David on Mount Zion,
grew into a triple tree and was cut down by Solomon to form the pillars,
Jachin and Boaz, which were placed at the entrance to the Temple. A third
portion was inserted in the threshold of the great gate, and acted as a talisman,
permitting no unclean thing to enter the sanctuary. Certain wicked priests
removed it however for purposes of their own, weighted it with stones, and
cast it into the Temple reservoir, where it was guarded by an angel, who
kept it from the sight of men. During the lifetime of Christ the reservoir
was drained and the beam of wood discovered and thrown across the brook Kedron,
over which our Saviour passed after his apprehension in the Garden of Olives.
It was taken by his executioners and made into the cross. In this legend
we can see a marked similarity to those from which the conception of the
Holy Grail arose. Man is restored by the wood through the instrumentality
of which <I>Adam, </I>the first man, fell. The idea that the Cross was a
cutting of the Tree of Knowledge was widespread in the middle ages, and may
be found in the twelfth century <I>Quete del St. Graal, </I>ascribed to Walter
Map, but probably only redacted by him. All the Kabalistic traditions are
embodied in the allegory contained in the <I>Book of the Penitence of Adam,
</I>and it undoubtedly supplements and throws considerable light on the entire
Kabalistic literature.

Adam, (L'Abbe) <B>:</B> About the time that the Templars were being driven
from France, the Devil appeared, under various guises, to the <I>Abbe Adam,
</I>who was journeying, attended by one of the servants from his convent,
to a certain part of his abbacy of the Vaux de Cernay. The evil spirit first
opposed the progress of the worthy Abbe under the form of a tree white with
frost, which rushed towards him with inconceivable swiftness. The Abbe's
horse trembled with fear, as did the servant, but the Abbe himself made the
sign of the Cross, and the tree disappeared. The good man concluded that
he had seen the Devil, and called upon the Virgin to protect him. Nevertheless,
the fiend shortly reappeared in the shape of a furious black knight. "Be-gone,"
said the Abbe. "Why do you attack me far from my brothers? " The Devil once
more left him, only to return in the shape of a tall man, with a long, thin
neck. <I>Adam, </I>to get rid of him, struck him a blow with his fist. The
evil spirit shrank and took the stature and countenance of a little cloaked
monk, with a glittering weapon under his dress. His little eyes could be
seen darting and glancing under his cowl. He tried hard to strike the Abbe
with the sword he held, but the latter repulsed the strokes with the sign
of the Cross. The demon became in turn a pig and a long-eared ass. The Abbe,
impatient to be gone, made a circle on the ground with a cross in the centre.
The fiend was then obliged to withdraw to a little distance. He changed his
long ears into horns, which did not hinder the Abbe from boldly addressing
him. Offended by his plain-speaking, the Devil changed himself into a barrel
and rolled into an adjoining field. In a short time he returned in the form
of a cart-wheel, and, without giving the brother time to put himself on the
defensive, rolled heavily over his body, without, however, doing him any
injury. After that he left him to pursue his journey in peace. <I>(See

Adepts : are men who after stern self-denial and by means of consistent
self-development, have fitted themselves to assist in the ruling of the world.
The means by which this position is attained is said to be long and arduous,
but in the end the successful one has fulfilled the purpose for which he
was created and transcends his fellows. The activities of <I>Adepts </I>are
multifarious, being concerned with the direction and guidance of the activities
of the rest of mankind. Their knowledge, like their powers, say Theosophists,
far exceeds that of man, and they can control forces both in the spiritual
and the physical realm, and are said to be able to prolong their lives for
centuries. They are also known as the Great White Brotherhood, Rishis, Rahats,
or Mahatmas. Those who earnestly desire to work for the betterment of the
world may become apprentices or <I>chelas </I>to <I>Adepts, </I>in which
case the latter are known as "masters," but the apprentice must first have
practised self-denial and self-development in order to become sufficiently
worthy. The master imparts teaching and wisdom otherwise unattainable, and
helps the apprentice by communion and inspiration. Madame Blavatsky (q.v.)
alleged that she was the apprentice of these masters, and claimed that they
dwelt in the Tibetan Mountains. The term <I>Adept </I>was also employed by
mediaeval magicians and alchemists to denote a master of their sciences.

to the substitution of the word <I>Adonai </I>for " Jehovah" in their sacred
text. This custom still prevails among the Jews, who attribute to the
pronouncement of the Holy Name the power of working miracles. The Jehovah
of the Israelites was their invisible protector and king, and no image of
him was made. He was worshipped according to his commandments, with an observance
of the ritual instituted through Moses. The term "Jehovah" means the revealed
Absolute Deity, the Manifest, Only, Personal, Holy Creator and Redeemer.

Adoptive <B>Masonry :</B> Masonic societies which adopt women as members.
Early in the eighteenth century such societies were established in France,
and speedily spread to other countries. One of the first to "adopt" women
were the Mopses. The Felicitaries existed in <B>1742</B>. The Fendeurs or
Woodcutters were instituted in <B>1763</B> by Bauchaine, Master of a Parisian
Lodge. It was modelled on the Carbonari, and its popularity led to the
establishment of other lodges, notably the Fidelity, the Hatchet, etc. In
<B>1774</B> the Grand Orient Lodge of France established a system of three
degrees called the Rite of Adoption, and elected the Duchess of Bourbon as
Grand Mistress of France. The rite has been generally adopted into Freemasonry,
and various degrees added from time to time, to the number of about twelve
in all. Latin and Greek mysteries were added to the rite by the Ladies'
Hospitallers of Mount Tabor. The greatest ladies in France joined the French
lodges of adoption. The Rite of Mizraim created lodges for both sexes in
<B>1819</B>, <B>1821</B>, <B>1838</B> and <B>1853</B>, and the Rite of Memphis
in <B>1839</B>. America founded the Rite of the Eastern Star in five points.
In these systems admission is generally confined to the female relations
of Masons. The Order of the Eastern Star and that of <I>Adoptive Masonry

<P>
Bantu Tribes. Among the Zulu and other Bantu tribes the cult of witchcraft
was practised, but in secret. for the results of detection were terrible.
For the tracking of the witch, a caste of witch-finders was instituted, called
"witch-doctors," whose duty it was to " smell out" the offenders. These were
nearly all women.
<P>
"It is not difficult to understand," says Lady Barker, "bearing in mind the
superstition and cruelty which existed in remote parts of England not so
very long ago; how powerful such women become among a savage people, or how
tempting an opportunity they could furnish of getting rid of an enemy. Of
course they are exceptional individuals; more observant, more shrewd, and
more dauntless than the average fat, hard-working Kaffir women, besides
possessing the contradictory mixture of great physical powers and strong
hysterical tendencies. They work themselves up to a pitch of frenzy, and
get to believe as firmly in their own supernatural discernment as any individual
among the trembling circle of Zulus to whom a touch from the whisk they carry
is a sentence of instant death."
<P>
The Zulu witch-finders are attended by a circle of black girls and women,
who, like a Greek chorus, clap their hands together, and drone through a
low monotonous chant, the measure and rhythm of which change at times with
a stamp and a swing. Not less necessary is a ceremonial dress for such things
appeal directly to the imagination of the crowd, and prepare them to be readily
influenced by the necromancers devices. The " Isinyanga," "Abangoma" or
"witch-finders," whom Lady Barker describes for us, were attired with an
eye for effect which would have done credit to a London theatre. It will
suffice to depict one of them, by name Nozinyanga. Her fierce face, spotted
with gouts of red paint on cheek and brow, was partly overshadowed by a
helmet-like plume of the tall feathers of the sakabula bird. In her right
hand she carried a light sheaf of assegais or lances, and on her left arm
was slung a small and pretty shield of dappled ox-hide. Her petticoat, made
of a couple of large gay handkerchiefs, was worn kilt-wise. But if there
were little decoration in her skirts, the deficiency was more than compensated
by the bravery of the bead-necklaces, the goat's-hair fringes, and the scarlet
tassels which covered her from coat to waist. Her ample chest rose and fell
beneath the baldric of leopard skin, fastened across it with huge brazen
knobs, while down her back hung a beautifully dried and flattened skin of
an enormous boa-constrictor.
<P>
When the community had resolved that a certain misfortune was due to the
witches, the next step obviously would be to detect and punish them. For
this purpose the king would summon a great meeting, and cause his subjects
to sit on the ground in a ring or circle for four or five days. The witch-finders
took their places in the centre, and as they gradually worked themselves
up to a frantic state of frenzy, resembling demoniacal possession, they lightly
switched with their quagga-tail one or other of the trembling spectators,
who was immediately dragged away and butchered on the spot. And not only
he, but all the living things in his hut-wives and children, dogs and cats-not
one was left alive, nor was a stick left standing. Sometimes a whole kraal
would be exterminated in this way, and the reader will perceive how terrible
the cruel custom could be made to gratify private revenge or to work the
king's tyrannical inclinations.
<P>
A terrible little sorceress is described by Lady Barker under the name of
Nozilwane, whose weird wistful glance had in it something uncanny and
uncomfortable. She was dressed beautifully for her part, in lynx skins folded
over and over from waist to knee, the upper part of her body being covered
by strings of wild beasts' teeth and fangs, beads, skeins of gaily-coloured
yarn, strips of snake's skin, and fringes of Angora goat fleece. This, as
a decoration, was both graceful and effective; it was worn round the body
and above each elbow, and fell in soft white flakes among the brilliant colouring
and against the dusky skin. Lynx-tails depended like lappets on each side
of her face, which was over-shadowed and almost hidden by a profusion of
sakabula feathers. "This bird," says Lady Barker, "has a very beautiful plumage,
and is sufficiently rare for the natives to attach a peculiar value and charm
to the tail-feathers; they are like those of a young cock, curved and slender,
and of a dark chesnut colour, with a white eye at the extreme tip of each
feather." Among all this thick, floating plumage were interspersed small
bladders, and skewers or pins wrought out of tusks. Each witch-finder wore
her own hair, or rather wool, highly greased and twisted up with twine until
it ceases to wear the appearance of hair, and hangs around the face like
a thick fringe, dyed deep red.
<P>
Bent double, and with a creeping, cat-like gait, as if seeking a trail, out
stepped Nozilwane. Every movement of her undulating body kept time to the
beat of the girls' hands and their low crooning chant. Presently she pretended
to find the thing she sought, and with a series of wild pirouettes, leaped
into the air, shaking her spears and brandishing her little shield like a
Bacchante. Nowamso, another of the party, was determined that her companion
should not carry off all the applause, and she too, with a yell and a leap,
sprang into the dance to the sound of louder grunts and harder hand-claps.
Nowamso showed much anxiety to display her back, where a magnificent snake
skin, studded in a regular pattern with brass-headed nails, floated like
a stream. She was attired also in a splendid kilt of leopard skins, decorated
with red rosettes, and her toilet was considered more careful and artistic
than any of the others. Brighter her bangles, whiter her goat-fringes, and
more elaborately painted her face. Nozilwane, however, had youth and a wonderful
self-reliance on her side. The others, though they all joined in and hunted
out an imaginary enemy, and in turn exulted over his discovery, soon became
breathless and spent, and were glad when their attendants led them away to
be anointed and to drink water.

Central Africa. The magical beliefs of Central and Eastern Africa are but
little known. They are for the most part connected with the cult of the dead
and that of the fetish. As regards the first
<P>
When the dead are weary of staying in the bush, they come for one of their
people whom they most affect. And the spirit will say to the man "I am tired
of dwelling in the bush, please to build for me in the town a little house
as close as possible to your own." And he tells him to dance and sing too,
and accordingly the man assembles the women at night to join in dance and
song.
<P>
Then, next day, the people repair to the grave of the <I>Obambo, </I>or ghost,
and make a rude idol, after which the bamboo bier, on which the body is conveyed
to the grave, and some of the dust of the ground. are carried into a little
hut erected near the house of the visited, and a white cloth is draped over
the door.
<P>
It is a curious fact, which 'seems to show that these people have a legend
something like the old Greek myth of Charon and the Styx, that in one of
the songs chanted during this ceremony occurs the following line "You are
well dressed, but you have no canoe to carry you across to the other side."
<P>
<I></I>
<P>
Possession. Epileptic diseases, in almost all uncivilised countries, are
assumed to be the result of demoniac possession. In Central Africa the sufferer
is supposed to be possessed by Mbwiri, and he can be relieved only by the
intervention of the medicine-man or fetish. In the middle of the street a
hut is built for his accommodation, and there he resides until cured, or
maddened, along with the priest and his disciples. There for ten days or
a fortnight a continuous revel is held; much eating and drinking at the expense
of the patient's relatives, and unending dances to the sound of flute and
drum. For obvious reasons the fetish gives out that Mbwiri regards good living
with aversion. The patient dances, usually shamming madness, until the epileptic
attack comes on, with all its dreadful concomitants-the frenzied stare, the
convulsed limbs, the gnashing teeth, and the foam-flecked lips. The man's
actions at this period are not ascribed to himself, but to the demon which
has control of him. When a cure has been effected, real or pretended, the
patient builds a little fetish-house, avoids certain kinds of food, and performs
certain duties. Sometimes the process terminates in the patient's insanity;
he has been known to run away to the bush, hide from all human beings, and
live on the roots and berries of the forest.
<P>
"These fetish-men," says Read, "are priest doctors, like those of the ancient
Germans. They have a profound knowledge of herbs, and also of human nature,
for they always monopolise the real power in the state. But it is very doubtful
whether they possess any secrets save that of extracting virtue and poison
from plants. During the first trip which I made into the bush I sent for
one of these doctors. At that time I was staying among the Shekani, who are
celebrated for their fetish, He came attended by half-a-dozen disciples.
He was a tall man dressed in white, with a girdle of leopard's skin, from
which hung an iron bell, of the same shape as our sheep bells. He had two
chalk marks over his eyes. I took some of my own hair, frizzled it with a
burning glass, and gave it to him. He popped it with alacrity into his little
grass bag; for white man's hair is fetish of the first order. Then I poured
out some raspberry vinegar into a glass, drank a little of it first, country
fashion, and offered it to him. telling him that it was blood from the brains
of great doctors. Upon this he received it with great reverence, and dipping
his fingers into it as if it was snap-dragon, sprinkled with it his forehead,
both feet between the two first toes, and the ground behind his back. He
then handed his glass to a disciple, who emptied it, and smacked his lips
afterwards in a very secular manner. I then desired to see a little of his
fetish. He drew on the ground with red chalk some hieroglyphics, among which
I distinguished the circle, the cross, and the crescent. He said that if
I would give him a fine' dush,' he would tell me all about it. But as he
would not take anything in reason, and as I knew that he would tell me nothing
of very great importance in public, negotiations were suspended."
<P>
The fetish-man seldom finds a native disposed to question his claim of
supernatural powers. He is not only a doctor and a priest-two capacities
in which his influence is necessarily very powerful-he is also a witch-finder,
and this is an office which invests him with a truly formidable authority.
When a man of worth dies, his death is in-variably ascribed to witchcraft,
and the aid of the fetish-man is invoked to discover the witch.
<P>
When a man is sick a long time, they call <I>Ngembi, </I>and if she cannot
make him well, the fetish-man. He comes at night, in a white dress, with
cock's feathers on his head, and having his bell and little glass. He calls
two or three relations together into a room. He does not speak, but always
looks in his glass. Then he tells them that the sickness is not of Mbwiri,
nor of Obambo, nor of God, but that it comes from a witch. They say to him,
"What shall we do?" He goes out and says," I have told you. I have no more
to say." They give him a dollar's worth of cloth, and every night they gather
together in the street, and they cry," I know that man who bewitched my brother-.
It is good for you to make him well." Then the witch makes him well. But
if the man do not recover they call the bush doctor from the Shekani country.
He sings in the language of the bush. At night he goes into the street; all
the people flock about him. With a tiger-cat skin in his hand, he walks to
and fro, until, singing all the while, he lays the tiger-skin at the feet
of the witch. At the conclusion of his song the people seize the witch, and
put him or her in chains, saying, "If you don't restore our brother to health,
we will kill you."

She was a powerful enchantress, and was rarely seen in her true shape. Sometimes
she would take the form of an old woman, wrinkled and bent, and hardly able
to move about. At one time she would appear weak and ill, and at another
tall and strong. so that her head seemed to touch the clouds. These
transformations she effected without the smallest effort or trouble. People
were so struck with her marvels that they believed her capable of overthrowing
the mountains, tearing up the trees, drying up the rivers with the greatest
of ease. They held that nothing less than a legion of demons must be at her
command for the accomplishment of her magic feats. She seems to be like the

Agrippa von Nettesheim, Henry Cornelius (1486-1535) <B>:</B> A German soldier
and physician, and an adept in alchemy, astrology and magic. He was born
at Cologne on the <B>14</B>th of September, <B>1486</B>, and educated at
the University of Cologne. While still a youth he served under Maximilian
I. of Germany. In <B>1509</B> he lectured at the University of Dole, but
a charge of heresy brought against him by a monk named Catilinet compelled
him to leave Dole, and he resumed his former occupation of soldier. In the
following year he was sent on a diplomatic mission to England, and on his
return followed Maximilian to Italy, where he passed seven years, now serving
one noble patron, now another. Thereafter he held a post at Metz, returned
to Cologne, practised medicine at Geneva, and was appointed physician to
Louise of Savoy, mother of Francis I.; but, on being given some task which
he found irksome, he left the service of his patroness and denounced her
bitterly. He then accepted a post offered him by Margaret, Duchess of Savoy,
Regent of the Netherlands. On her death in <B>1830</B>, he repaired to Cologne
and Bonn, and thence to France, where he was arrested for some slighting
mention of the Queen. Mother, Louise of Savoy. He was soon released, however,
and died at Grenoble in <B>1535</B>. <I>Agrippa </I>was a man of great talent
and varied attainments. He was acquainted with eight languages, and was evidently
a physician of no mean ability, as well as a soldier and a theologian. He
had, moreover, many noble patrons. Yet, notwithstanding these advantages,
he never 'seemed to be free from misfortune; persecution and financial
difficulties dogged his footsteps, and in Brussels he suffered imprisonment
for debt He himself was in a measure responsible for his troubles. He was,
in fact, an adept in the gentle art of making enemies, and the persecution
of the monks with whom he frequently came into conflict was bitter and
increasing. His principal works were a defence of magic, entitled <I>De occulta
philosophia, </I>which was not published until <B>1531</B>, though it was
written some twenty years earlier, and a satirical attack on the scientific
pretensions of his day, <I>De incertitudine et Vanitate Scientiarum et Artium
atque Excellentia Verbi Dei Declamatio, </I>also published at Antwerp in
<B>1531</B>. His other works included a treatise <I>Dei Nobilitate et
Praecellentia Feminu Sexus, </I>dedicated to Margaret of Burgundy out of
gratitude for her patronage.
<P>
His interest in alchemy and magic dated from an early period of his life,
and gave rise to many tales of his occult powers. It was said that he was
always accompanied by a familiar in the shape of a large black dog. On his
death he renounced his magical works and addressed his familiar thus<B>:</B>
Begone, wretched animal, the entire cause of my destruction!" The animal
fled from the room and straightway plunged into the Saom, where it perished.
At the inns where he stayed, <I>Agrippa </I>paid his bills with money that
appeared genuine enough at the time, but which afterwards turned to worthless
horn or shell, like the fairy money which turned to earth after sunset. He
is said to have summoned Tully to pronounce his oration for Roscius, in the
presence of John George, elector of Saxony, the Earl of Surrey, Erasmus,
and other eminent people. Tully duly appeared, delivered his famous oration,
and left his audience deeply moved. <I>Agrippa </I>had a magic glass, wherein
it was possible to see objects distant in time or place. On one occasion
Surrey saw therein his mistress, the beautiful Geraldine, lamenting the absence
of her noble lover.
<P>
One other story concerning the magician is worthy of record. Once when about
to leave home for a short time, he entrusted to his wife the key of his museum,
warning her on no account to permit anyone to enter. But the curiosity of
a boarder in their house prompted him to beg for the key, till at length
the harrassed hostess gave it to him. The first thing that caught the student's
attention was a book of spells, from which he began to read. A knock sounded
on the door. The student took no notice, but went on reading, and the knock
was repeated. A moment later a demon entered, demanding to know why he had
been summoned. The student was too terrified to make reply, and the angry
demon seized him by the threat and strangled him. At the same moment <I>Agrippa
</I>entered, having returned unexpectedly from his journey. Fearing that
he would be charged with the murder of the youth, he persuaded the demon
to restore him to life for a little while, and walk him up and down the market
place. The demon consented<B>:</B> the people saw the student apparently
alive and in good health, and when the demon allowed the semblance of life
to leave the body, they thought the young man had died a natural death. However,
an examination dearly showed that he had been strangled. The true state of
affairs leaked out, and <I>Agrippa </I>was forced to flee for his life.
<P>
These fabrications of the popular imagination were probably encouraged rather
than suppressed by <I>Agrippa, </I>who loved to surround his comparatively
harmless pursuits of alchemy and astrology with an air of mystery calculated
to inspire awe and terror in the minds of the ignorant. It is known that
he had correspondents in all parts of the world, and that from their letters,
which he received in his retirement, he gleaned the knowledge which he was
popularly believed to obtain from his familiars.

Alain of Lisle : It has been Said by some writers that there were two men
to whom was given the name of Alanus Insulensis, one of whom was Bernardine,
Bishop of Auxerre, and author of a <I>Commentary on the Prophecies of Merlin;
</I>the other, that "Universal Doctor<B>:</B>' whose brilliant career at
the Paris University was followed by his withdrawal to a cloister, where
he devoted himself entirely to the study of philosophy. Others again maintain
that the Bishop of Auxerre and the "Universal Doctor" were one and the same.
Even the date when they lived is very uncertain, being variously placed in
the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. In the year <B>1600</B> a treatise
on alchemy, entitled <I>Dicta de Lapide Phitosophico </I>was published at
Leyden, bearing on its title-page the name of Alanus Insulensis. It was thus
ascribed to Bernardine, to the
<P>
"Universal Doctor," and, by still others, to a German <I>named </I>Alanus.
Supposing the two first-mentioned to be separate and distinct persons. we
have nevertheless no proof that either was interested in alchemy and as for
the third, there is no proof that he existed at all. On the other hand, we
know that it was customary at that time to ascribe works of a very inferior
nature to illustrious persons who had died, and were thus unable to deny
them. The <I>Dicta de Lapide Philosophico, </I>a work of no great alchemistical
value, on account of its vague and indefinite nature, may be, and probably
is, a spurious work, wrongly ascribed to <I>Alain.</I>

Albertus <B>Magnus</B> <B>:</B> No fewer than twenty-one folio volumes are
attributed to this alchemist, and though it is highly improbable that all
of them are really his, the ascription in several cases resting on but slender
evidence, those others which are incontestably from his pen, are sufficiently
numerous to constitute him a surprisingly voluminous writer. It is noteworthy,
moreover, that according to tradition, he was the inventor of the pistol
and the cannon; but, while it is unlikely that the credit is due to him for
this, the mere fact that he was thus acknowledged indicates that his scientific
skill was recognised by a few, if only a few, of the men of his own time.
<P>
<I></I>
<P>
Albertus was born at Larvingen, on the Danube, in the year <B>1205</B>, and
the term <I>Magnus, </I>which is usually applied to him, is not the result
of his reputation, but is the Latin equivalent of his family name, de Groot.
Like many another man destined to become famous, he was distinctly stupid
as a boy, but from the outset be showed a predilection for religion, and
so it came about that one night the blessed Virgin appeared to him, whereupon
his intellect suddenly became metamorphosed, acquiring extraordinary vitality.
<I>Albertus </I>therefore decided that he must show his gratitude to the
Madonna by espousing holy orders, and eventually he won eminence in the clerical
profession, and was made Bishop of Ratisbon; but he held this office for
only a little while, resigning it that he might give his entire time to
scientific researches. Thenceforth, until his death, the exact date whereof
is uncertain, he lived chiefly at a pleasant retreat in Cologne; and it is
reported that here his mental vigour gradually forsook him, being replaced
by the dullness which characterised him as a youth.
<P>
<I></I>
<P>
Albertus was repeatedly charged by some of his unfriendly contemporaries
with holding communications with the devil, and practising the craft of magic;
while <I>apropos </I>of his reputed leanings in this particular, a curious
story is recounted in an early history of the University of Paris. The alchemist,
it seems, had invited some friends to his house at Cologne, among them being
William, Count of Holland, and when the guests arrived they were amazed to
find that, though the season was mid-winter and the ground was covered with
snow, they were expected to partake of a repast outside in the garden. Great
chagrin was manifested by everybody, while some even declared themselves
insulted; but their host bade them be seated, assuring them that all would
be well. They continued to be dubious withal, yet they took their places,
and hardly had they began to eat and drink ere their annoyance vanished,
for lo! the snow around them melted away, the sun shone brightly, the birds
sang, and summer appeared to be reigning indeed.
<P>
Michael Maier, the author of <I>Museum Chimicum </I>and numerous other
alchemistic works, declares that <I>Albertus </I>succeeded in evolving the
philosopher's stone, and that ere his death he handed it over to his
distinguished pupil, St. Thomas Aquinas, who subsequently destroyed the precious
article, suspecting it to be a contrivance of the devil. The alleged discoverer
himself says nothing on this subject, but, in his <I>De Rebus Metallisis
et Mineralibus, </I>he tells how he had personally tested some gold which
had been manufactured by an alchemist, and which resisted many searching
fusions. And, be this story true or not, <I>Albertus </I>was certainly an
able scientist, while it is clear that his learning ultimately gained wide
recognition, for a collected edition of his vast writings was issued at Leyden
so late as <B>1653</B>.

Albigenses : A sect which originated in the south of France in the twelfth
century. They were so called from one of their territorial centres, that
of Albi. It is probable that their heresy came originally from Eastern Europe,
and they were often designated Bulgarians, and undoubtedly kept up intercourse
with certain secretaries of Thrace, the Bogomils; and they are sometimes
connected with the Paulicians. It is difficult to form any exact idea of
their doctrines, as Albigensian texts are rare, and contain little concerning
their ethics, but we know that they were strongly opposed to the Roman Catholic
Church, and protested against the corruption of its clergy. But it is not
as a religious body that we have to deal with the <I>Albigenses </I>here,
but to consider whether or not their cult possessed any occult significance.
It has been claimed by their opponents that they admitted two fundamental
principles, good and bad, saying that God had produced Lucifer from Himself;
that indeed Lucifer was the son of God who revolted against Him; that he
had carried with him a rebellious party of angels, who were driven from Heaven
along with him; that Lucifer in. his exile had created this world with its
inhabitants, where he reigned, and where all was evil. It is alleged that
they further believed that God for the re-establishment of order had produced
a second son, who was Jesus Christ. Further-more the Catholic writers on
the <I>Albigenses </I>charged them with believing that the souls of men were
demons lodged in mortal bodies in punishment of their crimes.
<P>
All this is, of course, mere tradition, and we may be sure that tile dislike
of the <I>Albigenses </I>for the irregularities then current in the Roman
Church, brought such charges on their heads. They were indeed the lineal
ancestors of Protestantism. A crusade was brought against them by Pope Innocent
III., and wholesale massacres took place. The Inquisition was also let loose
upon them, and they were driven to hide in the forests and among the mountains,
where, like the Covenanters of Scotland, they held surreptitious meetings.
The Inquisition terrorised the district in which they had dwelt so thoroughly
that the very name of <I>Albigenses </I>was practically blotted out, and
by the year <B>1330</B>, the records of the Holy Office show no further writs
issued against the heretics,

Alchemist, A Modern Egyptian <B>:</B> A correspondent writing to the
<I>Liverpool Post </I>of Saturday, November <B>28</B>th, <B>1907</B>, gives
an interesting description of a veritable Egyptian alchemist whom he had
encountered in Cairo not long before, as follows<B>:</B> ' I was not slow
in seizing an opportunity of making the acquaintance of the real alchemist
living in Cairo, which the winds of chance had blown in my direction. He
received me in his private house in the native quarter, and I was delighted
to observe that the appearance of the man was in every way in keeping with
my notions of what an alchemist should be. Clad in the flowing robes of a
graduate of Al Azhar, his long grey beard giving him a truly venerable aspect,
the sage by the eager, far-away expression of his eyes, betrayed the mind
of the dreamer, of the man lost to the meaner comforts of the world in his
devotion to the secret mysteries of the universe. After the customary salaams,
the learned man informed me that he was seeking three things-the philosopher's
stone, at whose touch all metal should become gold-the elixir of life, and
the universal solvent which would dissolve all substances as water dissolves
sugar; the last, he assured me, he had indeed discovered a short time since.
I was well aware of the reluctance of the mediaeval alchemists to divulge
their secrets, believing as they did that the possession of them by the vulgar
would bring about ruin of states and the fall of divinely constituted princes;
and I feared that the reluctance of the modern alchemist to divulge any secrets
to a stranger and a foreigner would be no less. However, I drew from my pocket
Sir William Crookes's spinthariscope -a small box containing a particle of
radium highly magnified-and showed it to the sheikh. When he applied it to
his eye and beheld the wonderful phenomenon of this dark speck flashing out
its fiery needles on all sides, he was lost in wonder, and when I assured
him that it would retain this property for a thousand years, he hailed me
<B>55</B> a fellow-worker, and as one who had indeed penetrated into the
secrets of the world. His reticence disappeared at once, and he began to
tell me the aims and methods of alchemical research, which were indeed the
same as those of the ancient alchemists of yore. His universal solvent he
would not show me, but assured me of its efficacy. I asked him in what he
kept it if it dissolved all things. He replied ' In wax,' this being the
one exception. I suspected that he had found some hydrofluoric acid, which
dissolves glass, and so has to be kept in wax bottles, but said nothing to
dispel his illusion.
<P>
"The next day I was granted the unusual privilege of inspecting the sheikh's
laboratory, and duly presented myself at the appointed time. My highest
expectations were fulfilled; everything was exactly what an alchemist's
laboratory should be. Yes, there was the sage, surrounded by his retorts,
alembics, crucibles, furnace, and bellows, and, best of all, supported by
familiars of gnome-like appearance, squatting on the ground, one blowing
the fire (a task to be performed daily for six hours continuously), one pounding
substances in a mortar, and another seemingly engaged in doing odd jobs.
Involuntarily my eyes sought the pentacle inscribed with the mystic word
' Abracadabra,' but here I was disappointed, for the black arts had no place
in this laboratory. One of the familiars had been on a voyage of discovery
to London, where he bought a few alchemical materials; another had explored
Spain and Morocco, without finding any alchemists, and the third had indeed
found alchemists in Algeria, though they had steadily guarded their secrets.
After satisfying my curiosity in a general way, I asked the sage to explain
the principles of his researches and to tell me on what his theories were
based. I was delighted to find that his ideas were precisely those of the
medieval alchemists namely, that all metals are debased forms of the original
gold, which is the only pure, non-composite metal; all nature strives to
return to its original purity, and all metals would return to gold if they
could ; nature is simple and not complex, and works upon one principle, namely,
that of sexual reproduction. It was not easy, as will readily be believed,
to follow the mystical explanations of the sheikh. Air was referred to by
him as the 'vulture,' fire as the 'scorpion,' water as the
<P>
'serpent,' and earth as 'calacant'; and only after considerable cross-questioning
and confusion of mind was I able to disentangle his arguments. Finding his
notions so entirely medieval, I was anxious to discover whether he was familiar
with the phlogistic theory of the seventeenth century. The alchemists of
old had noticed that the earthy matter which remains when a metal is calcined
is heavier than the metal itself, and they explained this by the hypothesis,
that the metal contained a spirit known as 'phlogiston,' which becomes visible
when it escapes from the metal or combustible substance in the form of flame;
thus the presence of the phlogiston lightened the body just as gas does,
and on its being expelled, the body gained weight. I accordingly asked the
chemist whether he had found that iron gains weight when it rusts, an experiment
lie had ample means of making. But no, he had not yet reached the seventeenth
century; he had not observed the fact, but was none the less ready with his
answer; the rust of iron was an impurity proceeding from within, and which
did not effect the weight of the body in that way. He declared that a few
days would bring the realisation of his hopes, and that he would shortly
send me a sample of the philosopher's stone and of the divine elixir; but
although his promise was made some weeks since, I have not yet scene the
fateful discoveries."

Alchemy <B>:</B> The science by aid of which the chemical philosophers of
medieval times attempted to transmute the baser metals into gold and silver.
There is considerable divergence of opinion as to the etymology of the word,
but it would seem to be derived from the Arabic al=the, and kimya=chemistry,
which in turn derives from late Greek chemeia=chemistry, from <I>chumeia
</I>a mingling, or <I>cheein </I>"to pour out," or "mix," Aryan root <I>ghu,
</I>to pour, whence the word "gush." Mr. A. Wallis Budge in his <I>Egyptian
Magic, </I>however, states that it is possible that it may be derived from
the Egyptian word <I>khemeia, </I>that is to say " the preparation of the
black ore," or "powder," which was regarded as the active principle in the
transmutation of metals. To this name the Arabs affixed the article al, thus
giving <I>al-khemeia, </I>or alchemy.
<P>
<I>History of Alchemy.-From </I>an early period the Egyptians possessed the
reputation of being skilful workers in metals, and, according to Greek writers,
they were conversant with their transmutation, employing quicksilver in the
process of separating gold and silver from the native matrix. The resulting
oxide was supposed to possess marvellous powers, and it was thought that
there resided within it the individualities of the various metals-that in
it their various substances were incorporated. This black powder was mystically
identified with the underworld form of the god Osiris, and consequently was
credited with magical properties. Thus there grew up in Egypt the belief
that magical powers existed in fluxes and alloys. Probably such a belief
existed throughout Europe in connection with the bronze-working castes of
its several races. <I>(See </I>Shelta Thari.) It was probably in the Byzantium
of the fourth century, however, that alchemical science received embryonic
form. There is little doubt that Egyptian tradition, filtering through
Alexandrian Hellenic sources was the foundation upon which the infant science
was built, and this is borne out by the circumstance that the art was attributed
to Hermes Trismegistus (q.v.) and supposed to be contained in its entirety
in his works. The Arabs, after their conquest of Egypt in the seventh century,
carried on the researches of the Alexandrian school, and through their
instrumentality the art was brought to Morocco and thus in the eighth century
to Spain, where it flourished exceedingly. Indeed, Spain from the ninth to
the eleventh century became the repository of alchemical science, and the
colleges of Seville, Cordova, and Granada were the centres from which this
science radiated throughout Europe. The first practical alchemist may be
said to have been the Arabian Geber (q.v.), who flourished
<B>720</B>-<B>750</B>. From his <I>Summa Perfectionis, </I>we may be justified
in assuming that alchemical science was already matured in his day, and that
he drew his inspiration from a still older unbroken line of adepts. He was
followed by Avicenna, Mesna and Rhasis (q.v.), and in France by Alain of
Lisle, Arnold de Villanova and Jean de Meung (q.v.) the troubadour; in England
by Roger Bacon and in Spain itself by Raymond Lully. Later, in French alchemy
the most illustrious names are those of Flamel (b. ca. <B>1330</B>), and
Bernard Trevisan (li. Ca. <B>1406</B>) after which the centre of interest
changes to Germany and in some measure to England, ii, which countries
Paracelsus, Khunrath (ca. <B>1560</B>), Maier (ca. <B>1568</B>), Bohme, Van
Helmont, the Brabanter (<B>1553</B>), Ripley, Norton, Dalton, Charnock, and
Fludd kept the alchemical flame burning brightly. It is surprising how little
alteration we find throughout the period between the seventh and the seventeenth
centuries, the heyday of alchemy, in the theory and practice of the art.
The same sentiments and processes are found expressed in the later alchemical
authorities as in the earliest, and a wonderful unanimity as regards the
basic canons of the great art is evinced by the hermetic students of all
time. On the introduction of chemistry as a practical art, alchemical science
fell into desuetude and disrepute, owing chiefly to the number of charlatans
practising it, and by the beginning of the eighteenth century, as a school,
it may be said to have become defunct. Here and there, however, a solitary
student of the art lingered,. and the department of this article on " Modern
Alchemy" will demonstrate that the science has to a great extent revived
during modern times, although it has never been quite extinct.

The Quests <I>of Alchemy. </I>The grand objects of alchemy were (i) the discovery
of a process by which the baser metals might be transmuted into gold and
silver; (<B>2</B>), the discovery of an elixir by which life might be prolonged
indefinitely; and there may perhaps be added (<B>3</B>), the manufacture
of an artificial process of human life. <I>(For the latter see
</I>"Homunculus.")
<P>
<I></I>
<P>
The Theory and Philosophy of Alchemy. The first objects were to be achieved
as follows<B>:</B> The transmutation of metals was to be accomplished by
a powder, stone, or elixir often called the Philosopher's Stone, the application
of which would effect the transmutation of the baser metals into gold or
silver, depending upon the length of time of its application. Basing their
conclusions on a profound examination of natural processes and research into
the secrets of nature, the alchemists arrived at the axiom that nature was
divided philosophically into four principal regions, the dry, the moist,
the warm, the cold, whence all that exists must be derived. Nature is also
divisible into the male and the female. She is the divine breath, the central
fire, invisible yet ever active, and is typified by sulphur. which is the
mercury of the sages, which slowly fructifies under the genial warmth of
nature. The alchemist must be ingenuous, of a truthful disposition, and gifted
with patience and prudence, following nature in every alchemical performance.
He must recollect that like draws to like, and must know how to obtain the
seed of metals, which is produced by the four elements through the will of
the Supreme Being and the Imagination of Nature. We are told that the original
matter of metals is double in its essence, being a dry heat combined with
a warm moisture, and that air is water coagulated by fire, capable of producing
a universal dissolvent. These terms the neophyte must be cautious of interpreting
in their literal sense. Great confusion exists iii alchemical nomenclature,
and the gibberish employed by the scores of charlatans who in later times
pretended to a knowledge of alchemical matters did not tend to make things
any more clear. The beginner must also acquire a thorough knowledge of the
manner in which metals grow in the bowels of the earth. These are engendered
by sulphur, which is male, and mercury, which is female, and the crux of
alchemy is to obtain their seed-a process which the alchemistical philosophers
have nut described with any degree of clarity. The physical theory of
transmutation is based on the composite character of metals, and on the presumed
existence of a substance which, applied to matter, exalts and perfects it.
This, Eugenius Philalethes and others call " The Light." The elements of
all metals are similar, differing only in purity and proportion. The entire
trend of the metallic kingdom is towards the natural manufacture of gold,
and the production of the baser metals is only accidental as the result of
an unfavourable environment. The Philosopher's Stone is the combination of
the male and female seeds which beget gold. The composition of these is so
veiled by symbolism as to make their identification a matter of impossibility.
Waite, summarizing the alchemical process once the secret of the stone is
unveiled, says
<P>
Given the matter of the stone and also the necessary. vessel, the processes
which must be then undertaken to accomplish the <I>magnum opus </I>are described
with moderate perspicuity. There is the calcination or purgation of the stone,
in which kind is worked with kind for the space of a philosophical year.
There is dissolution which prepares the way for congelation, and which is
performed during the black state of the mysterious matter. it is accomplished
by water which does not wet the hand. There is the separation of the subtle
and the gross. which is to be performed by means of heat. In the conjunction
which follows, the elements are duly and scrupulously combined. Putrefaction
afterwards takes place,
<P>
'Without which pole no seed may multiply.'
<P>
"Then, in the subsequent congelation the white colour appears, which is one
of the signs of success. It becomes more pronounced in cibation. In sublimation
the body is spiritualised, the spirit made corporeal. and again a more glittering
whiteness is apparent. Fermentation afterwards fixes together the alchemical
earth and water, and causes the mystic medicine to flow like wax. The matter
is then augmented with the alchemical spirit of life, and the exaltation
of the philosophic earth is accomplished by the natural rectification of
its elements. When these processes have been successfully completed, the
mystic stone will have passed through three chief stages characterised by
different colours, black, white, and red, after which it is capable of infinite
multication, and when projected on mercury, it will absolutely transmute
it, the resulting gold bearing every test. The base metals made use of must
be purified to insure the success of the operation. The process for the
manufacture of silver is essentially similar, but the resources of the matter
are not carried to so high a degree.
<P>
"According to the <I>Commentary on the Ancient War of the Knights </I>the
transmutations performed by the perfect stone are so absolute that no trace
remains of the original metal. It cannot, however, destroy gold, nor exalt
it into a more perfect metallic substance; it, therefore, transmutes it into
a medicine a thousand times superior to any virtues which can be extracted
from it in its vulgar state. This medicine becomes a most potent agent in
the exaltation of base metals."
<P>
There are not wanting authorities who deny that the transmutation of metals
was the grand object of alchemy, and who infer from the alchemistical writings
that the end of the art was the spiritual regeneration of man. Mrs. Atwood,
author of <I>A Suggestive Inquiry into the Hermetic Mystery, </I>and an American
writer named Hitchcock are perhaps the chief protagonists of the belief that
by spiritual processes akin to those' of the chemical processes of alchemy,
the soul of man may be purified and exalted. But both commit the radical
error of stating that the alchemical writers did not aver that the transmutation
of base metal into gold was their grand end. None of the passages they quote,
is inconsistent with the physical object of alchemy, and in a work, <I>The
Marrow of Alchemy, </I>stated to be by Eugenius Philalethes, it is laid down
that the real quest is for gold. It is constantly impressed upon the reader,
however, in the perusal of esteemed alchemical works, that only those who
are instructed by God can achieve the grand secret. Others, again, state
that a tyro may possibly stumble upon it, but that unless he is guided by
an adept he has small chance of achieving the grand arcanum. It will be obvious
to the tyro, however, that nothing can ever be achieved by trusting to the
allegories of the adepts or the many charlatans who crowded the ranks of
the art. Gold may have been made, or it may not, but the truth or fallacy
of the alchemical method lies with modern chemistry. The transcendental view
of alchemy, however, is rapidly gaining ground, and probably originated in
the comprehensive nature of the Hermetic theory and the consciousness in
the alchemical mind that what might with success be applied to nature could
also be applied to man with similar results. Says Mr. Waite<B>:</B> "The
gold of the philosopher is not a metal, on the other hand, man is a being
who possesses within himself the seeds of a perfection which he has never
realised, and that he therefore corresponds to those metals which the Hermetic
theory supposes to be capable of development. It has been constantly advanced
that the conversion of lead into gold was only the assumed object of alchemy,
and that it was in reality in search of a process for developing the latent
possibilities in the subject man." At the same time, it must be admitted
that tile cryptic character of alchemical language was probably occasioned
by a fear on the part of the alchemical mystic that he might lay himself
open through his magical opinions to the rigours of the law.
<P>

<P>
The Elixir of Life has been specially treated elsewhere.
<P>
<I>Records of Alleged Actual Transmutation. </I>Several records of alleged
transmutations of base metals into gold are in existence. These were achieved
by Nicholas Flamel, Van Helmont, Martini, Richthausen, and Sethon. For a
detailed account of the methods employed the reader is referred to the several
articles on these hermetists. In nearly every case the transmuting element
was a mysterious powder or the "Philosophers' Stone."
<P>
<I></I>
<P>
Modern Alchemy. That alchemy has been studied in modern times there can be
no doubt. M. Figuier in his <I>L'Alchimie et les Alchimistes, </I>dealing
with the subject of modern alchemy, <I>as </I>expressed by the initiates
of the first half of the nineteenth century, states that many French alchemists
of his time regarded the discoveries of modern science as merely so many
evidences of the truth of the doctrines they embraced. Throughout Europe,
he says, the positive alchemical doctrine had many adherents at the end of
the eighteenth century and the beginning of the nineteenth. Thus a "vast.
association of alchemists," founded in Westphalia in <B>1790</B>, continued
to flourish in thc year <B>1819</B>, under the name of the " Hermetic Society."
In <B>1837</B>, an alchemist of Thuringia presented to the Societe Industrielle
of Weimar a tincture which he averred would effect metallic transmutation.
About the same time several French journals announced a public course of
lectures on hermetic philosophy by a professor of the University of Munich.
He further states that Hanoverian and Bavarian families pursued in common
the search for the grand arcanum. Paris, however, was regarded as the
alchemistical Mecca. There dwelt many theoretical alchemists and " empirical
adepts." The first pursued the arcanum through the medium of books, the others
engaged in practical efforts to effect transmutation. M. Figuier states that
in the forties of last century he frequented the laboratory of a certain
Monsieur L., which was the rendezvous of the alchemists of Paris. When Monsieur
L's pupils left the laboratory for the day the modern adepts dropped in one
by one, and Figuier relates how deeply impressed he was by the appearance
and costumes of these strange men. In the daytime he frequently encountered
them in the public libraries, buried in gigantic folios, and in the evening
they might be seen pacing the solitary bridges with eyes fixed in vague
contemplation upon the first pale stars of night. A long cloak usually covered
their meagre limbs, and their untrimmed beards and matted locks lent them
a wild appearance. They walked with a solemn and measured gait, and used
the figures of speech employed by the medical illumines. Their expression
was generally a mixture of the most ardent hope and a - fixed despair.
<P>
Among the adepts who sought the laboratory of Monsieur L., Figuier remarked
especially a young man, in whose habits and language he could see nothing
in common with those of his strange companions. He confounded the wisdom
of the alchemical adept with the tenets of the modern scientist in the most
singular fashion, and meeting him one day at the gate of the Observatory,
M. Figuier renewed the subject of their last discussion, deploring that "a
man of his gifts could pursue the semblance of a chimera." 'Without replying,
the young adept led him into the Observatory garden, and proceeded to reveal
to him the mysteries of modern alchemical science.
<P>
The young man proceeded to fix a limit to the researches of the modern
alchemists. Gold, he said, according to the ancient authors, has three distinct
properties<B>:</B> (t) that of resolving the baser metals into itself, and
interchanging and metamorphosing all metals into one another; (<B>2</B>)
the curing of afflictions and the prolongation of life; (<B>3</B>), as a
<I>spiritus mundi </I>to bring mankind into rapport with the supermundane
spheres. Modern alchemists, he continued, reject the greater part of these
ideas, especially those connected with spiritual contact. The object of modern
alchemy might be reduced to the search for a substance having the power to
transform and transmute all other substances one into another-in short, to
discover that medium so well known to the alchemists of old and lost to us.
This was a perfectly feasible proposition. In the four principal substances
of oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, and azote, we have the <I>tetractus </I>of
Pythagoras and the <I>tetragram </I>of the Chaldeans and Egyptians. All the
sixty elements are referable to these original four. The ancient alchemical
theory established the fact that all the metals are the same in their
composition, that all are formed from sulphur and mercury, and that the
difference between them is according to the proportion of these substances
in their composition. Further, all the products of minerals present in their
composition complete identity with those substances most opposed to them.
Thus fulminating acid contains precisely the same 'quantity of carbon, oxygen,
and azote as cyanic acid, and cyanhydric" acid does not differ from formate
ammoniac. This new property of matter is known as " isomerism." M. Figuier's
friend then proceeds to quote in support of his thesis and operations and
experiments of M. Dumas, a celebrated French savant, as well as those of
Prout, and other English chemists of standing.
<P>
Passing to consider the possibility of isomerism in elementary as well as
in compound substances, he points out to M. Figuier that if the theory of
isomerism can apply to such bodies, the transmutation of metals ceases to
be a wild, unpractical dream, and becomes a scientific possibility, the
transformation being brought about by a molecular rearrangement. Isomerism
can be established in the case of compound substances by chemical analysis,
showing the identity of their constituent parts. In the case of metals it
can be proved by the comparison of the properties of isomeric bodies with
the properties of metals, in order to discover whether they have any common
characteristics. Such experiments, he continued, had been conducted by M.
Dumas, with the result that isomeric substances were found to have equal
equivalents, or equivalents which were exact multiples one of another. This
characteristic is also a feature of metals. Gold and osmium have identical
equivalents, as have platinum and iridium. The equivalent of cobalt is almost
the same as that of nickel, and the semi-equivalent of tin is equal to the
equivalent of the two preceding metals.
<P>
M. Dumas, speaking before the British Association, had shown that when three
simple bodies displayed great analogies in their properties, such as chlorine,
bromide, and iodine, barium, strontium, and calcium, the chemical equivalent
of the intermediate body is represented by the arithmetical mean between
the equivalents of the other two. Such a statement well showed the isomerism
of elementary substances, and proved that metals. however dissimilar in outward
appearance, were composed of the same matter differently arranged and
proportioned. This theory successfully demolishes the difficulties in the
way of transmutation. Again, Dr. Prout says that the chemical equivalents
of nearly all elementary substances are the multiples of one among them.
Thus, if the equivalent of hydrogen be taken for the unit, the equivalent
of every other substance will be an exact multiple of it-carbon will be
represented by six, azote by fourteen, oxygen by sixteen, zinc by thirty-two.
But, pointed out M. Figuier&amp;rsquo;s friend, if the molecular masses in
compound substances have so simple a connection, does it not go to prove
that all natural bodies are formed of one principle, differently arranged
and condensed to produce all known compounds?
<P>
If transmutation is thus theoretically possible, it only remains to show
by practical experiment that it is strictly in accordance with chemical laws,
and by no means inclines to the supernatural. At this juncture the young
alchemist proceeded to liken the action of the Philosophers' Stone on metals
to that of a ferment on organic matter. When metals are melted and brought
to red heat, a molecular change may be produced analogous to fermentation.
Just as sugar, under the influence of a ferment, may be changed into lactic
acid without altering its constituents, so metals can alter their character
under the influence of the Philosophers' Stone. The explanation of the latter
case is no more difficult than that of the former. The ferment does not take
any part in the chemical changes it brings about, and no satisfactory explanation
of its effects can be found either in the laws of affinity or in the forces
of electricity, light, or heat. As with the ferment, the required quantity
of the Philosophers' Stone is infinitesimal. Medicine, philosophy, every
modern science was at one time a source of such errors and extravagances
as are associated with medieval alchemy, but they are not therefore neglected
and despised. Wherefore, then, should we be blind to the scientific nature
of transmutation ?
<P>
One of the foundations of alchemical theories was that minerals grew and
developed in the earth, like organic things. It was always the aim of nature
to produce gold, the most precious metal, but when circumstances were not
favourable the baser metals resulted. The desire of the old alchemists was
to surprise nature's secrets, and thus attain the ability to do in a short
period what nature takes years to accomplish. Nevertheless, the medieval
alchemists appreciated the value of time in their experiments as modern
alchemists never do. M. Figuier's friend urged him not to condemn these exponents
of the hermetic philosophy for their metaphysical tendencies, for, he said,
there are facts in our sciences which can only be explained in that light.
If, for instance, copper be placed in air or water, there will be no result,
but if a touch of some acid be added, it will oxidise. The explanation is
that "the acid provokes oxidation of the metal, because it has an affinity
for' the oxide which tends to form "-a material fact almost metaphysical
in its production, and only explicable thereby.
<P>
He concluded his argument ','with an appeal for tolerance towards the medieval
alchemists, whose work is underrated because it is not properly understood.

Alchindus <B>:</B> An Arabian doctor of the eleventh century, placed by some
authorities among the number of magicians, but regarded by others as merely
a superstitious writer. He used charmed words and combinations of figures
in order to cure his patients. Demonologists maintained that the devil was
responsible for his power, and based their statements on the fact that he
had written a work entitled <I>The Theory of the Magic Arts. </I>He was probably,
however, nothing more formidable than a natural philosopher at a time when
all matter of science and philosophy were held in suspicion. Some of his
theories were of a magical nature, it is true, as when he essayed to explain
the phenomena of dreams by saying that they were the work of the elementals,
who acted their strange fantasies before the mind of the sleeper as actors
play in a theatre. But on the whole there is little to connect him with the
practice of magic.

Alectryomancy, or Alectormancy <B>:</B> An ancient method of divination with
a cock. In practising it, a circle must be made in a good close place, and
this must be divided equally into as many parts as there are letters in the
alphabet. Then a wheat-corn must be placed on every letter, beginning with
A, during which the depositor must repeat a certain verse. This must be done
when the sun or moon is in Aries or Leo. A young cock, all white, should
then be taken, his claws should be cut off, and these he should be forced
to swallow with a little scroll of parchment made of lambskin upon which
has been previously written certain words. Then the diviner holding the cock
should repeat a form of incantation. Next, on placing the cock within the
circle, he must repeat two verses of the Psalms, which are exactly the midmost
of the seventy-two verses mentioned under the head of "Onimancy," and it
is to be noted on the authority of an ancient Rabbi, that there is nothing
in these seventy-two which is not of some use in the kabalistical secret.
The cock being within the circle, it must be observed from which letters
he pecks the grains, and upon these others must be placed, because some names
and words contain the same letters twice or thrice. These letters should
be written down and put together, and they will infallibly reveal the name
of the person concerning whom inquiry has been made; it is said, though the
story is doubted, that the magician lamblicus used this art to discover the
person who should succeed Valens Caesar in the empire, but the bird picking
up but four of the grains, those which lay on the letters T h e o, left it
uncertain whether Theodosius, Theodotus, Theodorus, or Theodectes, was the
person designed. Valens, however, learning what had' been done, put to death
several individuals whose names unhappily began with those letters, and the
magician, to avoid the effects of his resentment, took a draught of poison.
A kind of <I>Alectromancy </I>was also sometimes practised upon the crowing
of the cock, and' the periods at which it was heard.
<P>
Ammianus Marcellinus describes the ritual which accompanied this act rather
differently. The sorcerers commenced by placing a basin made of different
metals on the ground and drawing around it at equal distances the letters
of the alphabet. Then he who possessed the deepest occult knowledge, advanced,
enveloped in a long veil, holding in his hand branches of vervain, and emitting
dreadful cries, accompanied by hideous convulsions. He stopped all at once
before the magic basin, and became rigid and motionless. He struck on a letter
several times with the branch in his hand, and then upon another, until he
had selected sufficient letters to form a heroic verse, which was then given
out to
<P>
the assembly. The Emperor Valens, informed of this circumstance, was ill-pleased
that the infernal powers should have been consulted regarding his destiny.
Indeed, he went further, for with unexampled severity, he proscribed not
only all the sorcerers, but all the philosophers in Rome, and punished them
so severely that many perished.

to preside over this form of divination, was surnamed Aleuromantis. So late

<I>De Rebus Admirabilibus, </I>in which he recounts prodigies which happened
in Italy, dreams which were verified, the circumstances connected with many
apparitions and phantoms, which he says that he beheld himself. He followed
this dissertation with his celebrated work <I>Genialium Dierum, </I>in which
he recounts with much credulity many prodigious happenings. He tells how
one evening he set out to join a party of several friends at a house in Rome
which had been haunted for a long time by spectres and demons. In the middle
of the night, when all of them were assembled in one chamber with many lights,
there appeared to them a dreadful spectre, who called to them in a loud voice,
and threw about the ornaments in the room. One of the most intrepid of the
company advanced in front of the spectre bearing a light, on which it
disappeared. Several times afterwards the same apparition re-entered through
the door. <I>Alexander, </I>who had been lying on a couch, found that the
demon had slid underneath it, and on rising from it, he beheld a great black
arm appear on a table in front of him. By this time several of the company
had retired to rest, and the lights were out, but torches were brought in
answer to their cries of alarm, on which the spectre opened the door, slid
past the advancing domestics, and disappeared. <I>Alexander </I>visited many
other haunted houses, but he appears to have been easily duped, and by no
means the sort of person to undertake psychical research. <I>(See

Alexander the Paphlagonian <B>:</B> The oracle of Abonotica, an obscure
Paphlagonian town, who for nearly twenty years held absolute supremacy in
the empirical art. Born about the end of the Second .century, a native of
Abonotica, he possessed but little in the way of worldly wealth. His sole
capital consisted in his good looks, fine presence, exquisite voice, and
a certain talent for fraud, which he was soon to turn to account in an
extraordinary manner. His idea was to institute a new oracle, and he fixed
upon Chalcedon as a suitable place to commence operations. Finding no great
encouragement there he made a fresh start by setting afoot a rumour to the
effect that Apollo and his son AEsculapius intended shortly to take up residence
at Abonotica. Naturally, the rumour at length reached the ears of his
fellow-townsmen, who promptly set to work on a temple meet for the reception
of the gods. The way was thus prepared for <I>Alexander, </I>who proceeded
to Abonotica, diligently advertising his skill as a prophet, so that on his
arrival people from many neighbouring towns applied to him, and ere long
his fame had spread as far as Rome. We are told that the Emperor Aurelius
himself consulted <I>Alexander </I>before undertaking an important military
enterprise.
<P>
Lucian gives a suppositions explanation of the Paphlagonian prophet's remarkable
popularity. <I>Alexander, </I>he says, came in the course of his early travels
to Pella, in Macedon, where he found a unique breed of serpents, large,
beautiful, and so tame and harmless that they were allowed by the inhabitants
to enter their houses and play with children. A plan took shape in his brain
which was to help him to attain the fame lie craved. Selecting the largest
and finest specimen of the Macedonian snakes that he could find, he carried
it secretly to his destination. The temple which the credulous natives of
Abonotica had raised to Apollo was surrounded by a moat, and <I>Alexander,
</I>ever ready to seize an opportunity wherever it presented itself, emptied
a goose-egg of its contents, placed within the. shell a newly-hatched serpent,
and sunk it in the moat. He then impressively informed the people that Apollo
had arrived. Making for the moat with all speed. followed by a curious multitude,
lie scooped up the egg, and in full vie' V of the people, broke the shell
and exposed to their admiring eyes a little, wriggling serpent. When a few
days had elapsed he judged the time ripe for a second demonstration. Gathering
together a huge crowd from every part of Paphlagonia, he emerged from the
temple with the large Macedonian snake coiled about his neck. By an ingenious
arrangement the head of the serpent was concealed under the prophet's arm,
and an artificial head, somewhat resembling that of a human being, allowed
to protrude. The assembly was much astonished to find that the tiny serpent
of a few days ago had already attained such remarkable proportions and possessed
the face of a human being, and they appeared to have little doubt that it
was indeed Apollo come to Abonotica.
<P>
By means of ingenious mechanical contrivances the serpent was apparently
made to reply to questions put to it. In other cases scaled rolls containing
the questions were handed to the oracle and returned with the seals intact
and an appropriate answer written inside.
<P>
His audacity and ready invention enabled <I>Alexander </I>to impose at will
upon the credulous people of his time, and these, combined with a strong
and attractive personality, won, and preserved for him his remarkable popularity,
as they have done for other "prophets" before and since.

Alfarabi <B>:</B> (d. <B>954</B>.) An adept of remarkable gifts and an extensive
knowledge of all the sciences; born at Othrar (or, as it was then called,
Faral), in Asia Minor. His name was
<P>
Abou-Nasr-Mohammed-Ibn-Tarkaw, but he received, from the town of his birth,
his better-known appellation of Farabi, or <I>Alfarabi. </I>Though he was
of Turkish extraction, a desire to perfect himself in Arabic, led him to
Bagdad, where he assiduously studied the Greek philosophers under Abou Bachar
Maltey. He next stayed for a time in Hanan, where he learned logic from a
Christian physician. Having far surpassed his fellow-scholars, he left Hanan
and drifted at last to Egypt. During his wanderings lie came in contact with
all the most learned philosophers of his time, and himself wrote books on
philosophy, mathematics, astronomy and other sciences, besides acquiring
proficiency in seventy languages. His treatise on music, proving the connection
of sound with atmospheric vibrations, and mocking the Pythagorean theory
of the music of the spheres, attained some celebrity.
<P>
He gained the good-will and patronage of the Sultan of Syria in a somewhat
curious fashion. While passing through Syria lie visited the court of the
Sultan, who was at that moment surrounded by grave doctors and astrologers,
who were discussing abstruse scientific points with the potentate. <I>Alfarabi
</I>entered the presence of the Sultan in his stained and dusty travelling
attire (he had been on a pilgrimage to Mecca), and when the prince bade him
be seated, he, either unaware of, or indifferent to the etiquette of court
life, sat down boldly on a corner of the royal sofa. The monarch, unused
to such an informal proceeding, spoke in a little-known tongue to a courtier,
and bade him remove the presumptuous philosopher. The latter, however, astonished
him by replying in the same language<B>:</B> Sire, he who acts hastily, in
haste repents." The Sultan, becoming interested in his unconventional guest,
questioned him curiously, and learned of the seventy languages and other
accomplishments of <I>Alfarabi. </I>The sages who were present were also
astounded at his wide learning. When the prince called at length for some
music, <I>Alfarabi </I>accompanied the musicians on a lute with such marvellous
skill and grace that the entire. company was charmed, When he struck up a
lively measure, the gravest sages could not but dance to it. When he changed
the melody to a softer lilt, tears sparkled in every eye, and at last, with
a gentle lullaby, he put the court to sleep. The Sultan wished to keep such
a valuable philosopher about his court, and some say that <I>Alfarabi
</I>accepted his patronage and died peacefully in Syria. Others, again, maintain
that he informed the Sultan that he would never rest till he had discovered
the secret of the Philosophers' stone, which he believed himself on the point
of finding. These say that he set out, but was attacked and killed by robbers
in the woods of Syria.

Alis de Telleux : In <B>1528</B>, there was published in Paris a curious
book, entitled, <I>La merveilleuse histoire de l'esprit qui, depuis naguere,
s'est apparu au monastere des religieuses de Saint Pierre de Lyon, laquelle
est pleine de grande admiration, comme on pourra vois par la lecture de ce
present livre, par Adrien de Montalemberi, aumonier du roi Francois Ier.
</I>This work dealt with the appearance in the monastery of the spirit of
<I>Alis de Telieux, </I>a nun who had lived there before the reformation
of the monastery in <B>1513</B>. <I>Alis, </I>it seems, had led rather a
worldly life, following pleasure and enjoyment in a manner unbecoming to
a nun, finally stealing the ornaments from the altar and selling them. After
this last enormity, she, of course, left the monastery, and for a time continued
her disgraceful career outside, but before she died she repented of her sins,
and through the intercession of the Virgin, received pardon. This, however,
did not gain for her Christian burial, and she was interred without the usual
prayers and funeral rites. A number of years afterwards, when the monastery
was occupied by other and better nuns, one of their number, a girl of about
eighteen years, was aroused from her sleep by the apparition of <I>Sister
Alis. </I>For some time afterwards the spirit haunted her wherever she went,
continually rapping on the ground near where she stood, and even communicating
with the interested nuns. From all indications, it was a good. and devout
spirit who thus entered the monastery, but the good sisters, well versed
in the wiles of the devil, had their doubts on the subject. The services
of the Bishop of Lyons and of the narrator, Adrien de Montalembert, were
called in to adjure the evil spirit. After many prayers and formalities,
the spirit of <I>Alis </I>was found to be an innocent one, attended by a
guardian angel. She answered a number of questions regarding her present
state and her desire for Christian burial, and confirmed the doctrines of
the Catholic Church, notably that of purgatory, which latter spirit-revelation
the author advances triumphantly for the confusion of the Lutherans. The
remains of <I>Sister Alis </I>were conveyed to consecrated ground, and prayers
made for the release of her soul from purgatory, but for some reason or other
she continued to follow the young nun for a time, teaching her, on her last
visit, five secret prayers composed by St. John the Evangelist.

All Hallow's Eve : One of the former four great Fire festivals in Britain,
is supposed to have taken place on the <B>1</B>st of November, when all fires,
save those of the Druids, were extinguished, from whose altars only the holy
fire must be purchased by the householders for a certain price. The festival
is still known in Ireland as Samhein, or La Samon, <I>i.e., </I>the Feast
of the Sun, while in Scotland, it has assumed the name of Hallowe&amp;rsquo;en.
<I>All Hallow's Eve, </I>as observed in the Church of Rome, corresponds with
the Feralia of the ancient Romans. when they sacrificed in honour of the
dead, offered up prayers for them. and made oblations to them. In ancient
times, this festival was celebrated on the twenty-first of February. but
the Roman Church transferred it in her calendar to the first of November.
It was originally designed to give rest and peace to the souls of the departed.
In some parts of Scotland, it is still customary for young people to kindle
fires on the tops of hills and rising grounds, and fire of this description
goes by the name of a" Hallowe&amp;rsquo;en bleeze." Formerly it was customary
to surround these bonfires with a circular trench symbolical of the sun.
Sheriff Barclay tells us that about seventy years ago, while travelling from
Dunkeld to Aberfeldy on Hallowe&amp;rsquo;en, he counted thirty fires blazing
on the hilltops, with the phantom figures of persons dancing round the flames.
<P>
In Perthshire, the " Hallowe'en bleeze is made in the following picturesque
fashion. Heath, broom, and dressings of flax are tied upon a pole. The faggot
is then kindled; a youth takes it upon his shoulders and carries it about.
When the faggot is burned out a second is tied to the pole and kindled in
the same manner as the former one. Several of these blazing faggots are often
carried through the villages at the same time.
<P>
Hallowe'en is believed by. the superstitious in Scotland to be a night on
which the invisible world has peculiar power. His Satanic Majesty is supposed
to have great latitude allowed him on this anniversary, in common with that
malignant class of beings known as witches, some of whom, it is said, may
be seen cleaving the air on broomsticks, in a manner wondrous to behold.
Others again, less aerially disposed, jog comfortably along over by-road
and heath, seated on the back of such sleek tabby cats as have kindly allowed
themselves to be transformed into coal-black steeds for their accommodation.
The green-robed fays are also said to hold special festive meetings at their
favourite haunts. The ignorant believe that there is no such night in all
the year for obtaining an insight into futurity. The following are the customs
pertaining to this eve of mystic ceremonies<B>:</B> The youths and maidens,
who engage in the ceremony of Pulling the Green Kail, go hand-in-hand, with
shut eyes, into a bachelor's or spinster's garden, and pull up the first
"kail stalks" which come in their way. Should the stalks thus secured prove
to be of stately growth, straight in stem, and with a goodly supply of earth
at their roots, the future husbands (or wives) will be young, good-looking
and rich in proportion. But if the stalks be stunted, crooked, and have little
or no earth at their roots, the future spouses will be found lacking in good
looks and fortune. According as the heart or stem proves sweet or sour to
the taste, so will be the temper of the future partner. the stalks thus tasted
are afterwards placed above the doors of the respective houses, and the Christian
names of those persons who first pass underneath will correspond with those
of the future husbands or wives.
<P>
There is also the custom of Eating the Apple at the Glass. Provide yourself
with an apple, and, as the clock strikes twelve, go alone into a room where
there is a looking glass. Cut the apple into small pieces, throw one of them
over your left shoulder, and advancing to the mirror without looking back,
proceed to eat the remainder, combing your hair carefully the while before
the glass. while thus engaged, it is said that the face of the person you
are to marry will be seen peeping over your left shoulder. This Hallowe'en"
game is supposed to be a relic of that form of divination with mirrors which
was condemned as sorcery by the former Popes.
<P>
<I></I>
<P>
The Burning Nuts. Take two nuts and place them in the fire, bestowing on
one of them your own name; on the other that of the object of your affections.
Should they burn quietly away, side by side, then the issue of your love
affair will be prosperous; but if one starts away from the other, the result
will be unfavourable.
<P>
And for the Sowing Hemp Seed, steal forth alone towards midnight and sow
a handful of hemp seed, repeating the following rhyme<B>:</B>
<P>
&nbsp;
<P>
"Hemp seed, I sow thee, hemp seed, I sow thee<B>:</B>
<P>
&nbsp;
<P>
And he that is my true love, come behind and harrow me." Then look over your
left shoulder and you will see the person thus adjured in the act of harrowing.
<P>
The ceremony of Winnowing Corn must also be gone through in solitude. Go
to the barn and open both doors, taking them off the hinges if possible,
lest the being you expect to appear, may close them and do you some injury.
Then take the instrument used in winnowing corn, and go through all the attitudes
of letting it down against the wind. Repeat the operation three times, and
the figure of your future partner will appear passing in at one door and
out at the other. Should those engaging in this ceremony be fated to die
young, it is believed that a coffin, followed by mourners, will enter and
pursue the too adventurous youth or maiden, who thus wishes to pry into the
hidden things of the future, round the barn.
<P>
Another is Measuring the Bean Stack. Go three times round a bean stack with
outstretched arms, as if measuring it, and the third time you will clasp
in your arms the shade of your future partner.
<P>
<I></I>
<P>
Eating the Herring. Just before retiring to rest eat a raw or roasted salt
herring, and in your dreams your husband (or wife) that is to be, will come
and offer you a drink of water to quench your thirst.

<P>
Dipping the Shirt Sleeve. Go alone, or in company with others, to a stream
where "three lairds' lands meet," and dip in the left sleeve of a shirt;
after this is done not one word must be spoken, otherwise the spell is broken.
Then put your sleeve to dry before your bedroom fire. Go to bed, but be careful
to remain awake, and you will see the form of your future helpmate enter
and turn the sleeve in order that the other side may get dried.

The Three Plates. Place three plates in a row on a table. In one of these
put clean water, in another foul, and leave the third empty. Blindfold the
person wishing to try his or her fortune, and lead them up to the table.
The left hand must be put forward. Should it come in contact with the clean
water, then the future spouse will be young, handsome, and a bachelor or
maid. The foul signifies a widower or a widow<B>:</B> and the empty dish,
single blessedness. This ceremony is repeated three times, and the plates

which was suppressed on account of some over-bold predictions, and which

Almoganenses: The name given by the Spaniards to certain people who, by the
flight and song of birds, meetings with wild animals, and various other means,
foretold coming events, whether good or evil. " They carefully preserve among
themselves," says Laurent Valla, "books which treat of this science, where
they find rules of all sorts of prognostications and predictions. The soothsayers
are divided into two classes, one, the masters or principals, the other the
disciples and aspirants."
<P>
Another kind of knowledge is also attributed to them, that of being able
to indicate not only the way taken by horses and other beasts of burden which
are lost, but even the road followed by one or more persons. They can specify
the kind and shape of the ground, whether the earth is hard or soft, covered
with sand or grass, whether it is a broad road, paved or sanded, or narrow,
twisting paths, and tell also how many passengers are on the road. They can
thus follow the track of anyone, and cause thieves to be pursued and apprehended.
Those writers who mention the <I>Almoganenses, </I>however, do not specify
either the period when they flourished, or the country or province they occupied,
but it seems possible from their name and other considerations that they
were Moorish.

Alphitomancy <B>:</B> A method of divination carried out with the help of
a loaf of barley, which has been practised since the earliest days. It was
used to prove the guilt or innocence of a suspected person. When many persons
were accused of a crime, and it was desired to find the true culprit, a loaf
of barley was made and a portion given to each of the suspected ones. The
innocent people suffered no ill-effects, while the criminal betrayed himself
by an attack of indigestion. This practice gave rise to a popular
imprecation<B>:</B>
<P>
If I am deceiving you, may this piece of bread choke me." By means of it
a lover might know if his mistress was faithful to him, or a wife, her husband.
The procedure was as follows <B>:</B> A quantity of pure barley flour was
kneaded with milk and a little salt, and without any leaven. It was then
rolled up in greased paper, and cooked among the cinders. It was afterwards
taken out and rubbed with verbena leaves, and given to the person Suspected
of deceit, who, if the suspicion was justified, would be unable to digest
it.

There was said to be near Lavinium a sacred wood, where <I>A lphitomancy

days of the year the young women were sent thither, blind-folded, and carrying
a cake made of barley flour and honey. The devil, we are told, led them by
the right road. Those who were innocent had their cakes eaten by the serpent,
while the cakes of the others were refused.

their fetishes; clothing-them richly, housing them comfortably, and serving
them with food and drink at every meal. They believed that if these little
images were neglected they would cry out, a catastrophe which was to be avoided
at all costs, as it brought dire misfortunes upon the household. They may
have been mandrakes, and it was claimed for them that they could foretell
the future, answering by means of motions of the head, or unintelligible

Alruy, David <B>:</B> A Jewish magician, mentioned in his <I>Voyages </I>by
Benjamin the Jew. <I>Alruy </I>boasted himself a descendant of King David.
He was educated in Bagdad, receiving instruction in the magic arts to such
good purpose that he came to be more proficient than his masters. His false
miracles gained so much popularity for him that some of the Jews believed
him to be that prophet who was to restore their nation to Jerusalem. The
King of Persia caused him to be cast into prison, but no bolts and bars could
hold for long so redoubtable a magician. He escaped from his prison and appeared
before the eyes of the astonished king, though the courtiers standing round
saw nothing, and only heard his voice. In vain the king called angrily for
someone to arrest the imposter. No one could see him, and while they groped
in search of him, like men blindfolded, he slipped from the palace, with
the king in pursuit, all the amazed assembly running after their prince.
At length they reached the sea shore, and <I>Alruy </I>turned and showed
himself to all the people. Then, spreading a scarf on the surface of the
water, he walked over it lightly, before the boats which were to pursue him
were ready. This adventure confirmed his reputation as the greatest magician
who had lived within the memory of man. But at last a Turkish prince, a subject
of the Persian king, bribed the father-in-law of the sorcerer to kill him,
and one night. when <I>Alruy </I>was sleeping peacefully in his bed, a dagger

Althotas <B>:</B> The presumed "master" and companion of Cagliostro. Considerable
doubt has been expressed regarding his existence. Figuier states that he
was no imaginary character; that the Roman Inquisition collected many proofs
of his existence, but none as regards his origin or end, as he vanished like
a meteor. "But," states the French author, "he was a magician and doctor
as well, possessed divinatory abilities of a high order, was in possession
of several Arabic manuscripts, and had great skill in chemistry." His connection
with Cagliostro will be found detailed in the article on that adept. Eliphas
Levi states that the name <I>Althotas </I>is composed of the word "thot"
with the syllables "al" and "as," which if read cabalistically are <I>sala,
</I>meaning messenger or envoy; the name as a whole therefore signifies "Thot,
the Messenger of the Egyptians," and such, says Levi, in effect he was.
<I>Althotas </I>has been sometimes identified with Kolmer, the instructor
of Weishaupt in magic, and at other times with the Comte de Sainte-Germain
(both of whom see). It would indeed be difficult to say with any definiteness
whether or not <I>Althotas </I>was merely a figment of Cagliostro's brain.
The accounts concerning him are certainly conflicting, for whereas Cagliostro
stated at his trial in Paris that <I>Althotas </I>had been his lifelong
preceptor, another account says that he met him first on the quay at Messina,
and the likelihood is that his character is purely fictitious, as there does
not appear to be any exact evidence that he was ever encountered in the flesh
by anyone.

America, United States of <B>:</B> Occultism amongst the aboriginal tribes
of America will be found dealt with under the article "North-American Indians."
The occult history of the European races which occupy the territory now known
as the United States of America does not commence until some little time
after their entrance into the North American continent. It is probable that
the early English and Dutch settlers carried with them the germs of the practice
of witchcraft, but it is certain that they brought with them an active belief
in witchcraft and sorcery. It is significant, however, that no outbreak of
fanaticism occurred in connection with this belief until nearly the end of
the seventeenth century, in <B>1692</B>, when an alarm of witchcraft was
raised in the family of the Minister of Salem, and several black servants
were charged with the supposed crime. It is quite likely that these negroes
practised voodoo or obeah (q.v.), but, however this may be, the charges did
not stop at them. The alarm spread rapidly, and in a brief space numerous
persons fell under suspicion on the most frivolous pretexts. The new Governor
of the Colony. Sir William Phipps, appears to have been carried away with
the excitement, and authorised judicial prosecutions. The first person tried,
a woman named Bridget Bishop, was hanged, and the Governor feeling himself
embarrassed among the extraordinary number of charges made after this, called
in the assistance of the clergy of Boston. As events proved, this was a fatal
thing to do. Boston, at this time, possessed a distinguished family of
puritanical ministers of the name of Mather. The original Mather had settled
in Dorchester in <B>1636</B>, and three years later had a son born to him,
whom he called Increase Mather. He became a clergyman, as did his son, Cotton
Mather, born in <B>1663</B>. Increase was President of Harvard College, and
his son occupied a distinguished position therein, and also preached at Boston.
The fanaticism and diabolical cruelty of these two men has probably never
been equaled in the history of human persecution. Relying implicitly upon
the scriptural injunction<B>:</B> "Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live,"
and blinded by their fanatic zeal, they cost the colony many precious lives.
Indeed, beside their regime, the rigours of Sprenger (q.v.) and Bodin (q.v.),
pale into insignificance. That ministers professing to preach a gospel of
charity and love could have so far descended as to torture and condemn thousands
of human beings to the gallows and the stake, can only be regarded as astounding.
In <B>1688</B> an Irish washer woman, named Glover, was employed by a mason
of Boston, one Goodwin, to look after his children, and these shortly afterwards
displayed symptoms which Cotton Mather, on examination, stated were those
of diabolical possession. The wretched washer-woman was brought to trial,
found guilty, and hanged; and Cotton Mather launched into print upon the
case under the title of <I>Late Memorable Providences Relating to Witchcraft
and Possession </I>which displayed an extraordinary amount of ingenuity and
an equally great lack of anything like sound judgment. As was the case with
the works of the European writers on witchcraft and sorcery, this book fanned
the flame of credulity, and thousands of the ignorant throughout the colony
began to cast about for similar examples of witchcraft. Five other persons
were brought to trial and executed, and a similar number shortly met the
same fate, among them a minister of the Gospel, by name George Borroughs,
who disbelieved in witchcraft. This was sufficient, and he was executed
forthwith. Popular sentiment was on his side, but the fiendish Cotton Mather
appeared at the place of execution on horseback, denounced Borroughs as an
impostor, and upheld the action of his judges. Another man, called Willard,
who had been employed to arrest suspected witches, refused to continue in
his office, and was himself arrested. He attempted to save himself by flight,
but was pursued and overtaken, and duly executed. Even dogs accused of witchcraft
were put to death. but the magistrates who had undertaken the proceedings,
ignorant as they were, began to have some suspicion that the course they
had adopted was a violent and dangerous one. and popular sentiment rose so
high that the Governor requested Cotton Mather to write a treatise in defence
of what had been done. The result was the famous volume, <I>Wonders of the
Invisible World, </I>in which the author gives an account of several of the
trials at Salem, compares the doings of witches in New England with those
in other parts of the world, and discourses elaborately on witchcraft generally.
The witch mania now spread throughout the whole colony. One of the first
checks it received was the accusation of the wife of Mr. Hale, a minister.
Her husband had been a zealous promotor of the prosecutions, but this accusation
altered his views, and he became convinced of the injustice of the whole
movement. But certain persons raised the question as to whether the Devil
could not assume the shape of an innocent and pious person as well as a wicked
one for his own purposes, and the assistance of Increase Mather, President
of Harvard College, was called in to decide this. He wrote a book, <I>A Further
Account of the Trials of the New England Witches, </I>and added many cases
concerning witchcraft and evil spirits personating men, in the course of
which he unhesitatingly affirmed that it was possible for the enemy of mankind
to assume the guise of a person in whom there was no guile. A new scene of
agitation was the town of Andover, where a great many persons were accused
of witchcraft and thrown into prison, until a certain justice of the peace.
named Bradstreet, who deserves special mention for his enlightened policy,
refused to grant any more warrants for arrest. The accusers immediately fastened
upon him, and declared that he had killed several people by means of sorcery,
and so alarmed was he that he fled from the town. But the fanatics who made
it their business to accuse, became bolder, and aimed at persons of rank,
until at last they had the audacity to impeach the wife of Governor Phipps
himself. This withdrew from them the countenance of the Governor, and a certain
Bostonian who was accused, brought an action of damages against his accusers
for 'defamation of character. After this, the whole agitation died down,
and scores of persons who had made confessions retracted; but the Mathers
obstinately persisted in the opinions they had published, and regarded the
reactionary feeling as a triumph of Satan. A Boston girl, named Margaret
Rule, was seized with convulsions, and when visited by Cotton Mather, was
found by him to be suffering from a diabolical attack of obsession. He did
his best to renew the agitation, but to no purpose, for a certain Robert
Calif, an influential merchant of the town, also examined the girl, and satisfied
himself that the whole thing was a delusion. He penned an account of his
examination exposing the theories of the Mathers, which is published under
the title of <I>More Wonders of the Invisible World. </I>This book was publicly
burned by the partisans of the fanatical clergy, but the eyes of the public
were now opened, and opinion generally was steadfastly against the accusation
and prosecutions of reputed witches. The people of Salem drove from their
midst the minister, Paris, with whom the prosecution had begun, and a deep
remorse settled down upon the community. Indeed, most of the persons concerned
in the judicial proceedings proclaimed their regret ; the jurors signed a
paper stating their repentance and pleading delusion. But even all this failed
to convince the Mathers, and Cotton wrote his <I>Magnolia, </I>an ecclesiastical
history of New England, published <B>1700</B>, which repeats his original
view of the power of Satan at Salem, and evinces no regret for the part he
had taken in the matter. In <B>1723</B>, he edited <I>The Remarkables </I>of
his father, in which he took occasion to repeat his theories. Increase Mather
died in <B>1723</B>, at the age of eighty-five, and Cotton lived on to
<B>1728</B>. It has been claimed that they acted according to their lights
and conscience, but there is no doubt that their vanity would not permit
them to retract what they had once set down regarding witchcraft, and their
names will go down to posterity with those of the inquisitors and torturers
of the middle ages, as men, who with less excuse than these, tormented and
bereft of life hundreds of totally innocent people.

Apart from the doings at Salem, colonial America has little to offer in the
way of occult history; but the modern United States of America is extremely
rich in occult history. This, however, is a history of outstanding
individuals-Thomas Lake Harris, Brigham Young, the Foxes, Andrew Jackson
Davis, and so on, biographies of whom will be found scattered throughout
this work. But that is not to say that various occult movements have not
from time to time either originated in, or found a home in the United States.
Indeed, the number of occult or semi-occult sects which have originated there,
is exceedingly great, and the foundation of occult communities has been frequent.
Such were the Mountain Cove community of Harris; the Society of Hopedale,
founded by Ballou; and so on. The notorious community, or rather nation of
Mormons had undoubtedly a semi-occult origin. Its founder, Joseph Smith,
and its first great prophet, Brigham Young, both had occult ideas, which
rather remind us of those of Blake (q.v.), and were decidedly of biblical
origin. Smith purported to discover tablets of brass upon which was engraved
the new law. This was the germ of the <I>Book of Mormon the Prophet, </I>and
a certain pseudo-mysticism was associated with the Mormon movement. This,
however, wore off after a while. More fresh' in the recollection are the
blasphemous absurdities of the prophet Dowie, who purported to be a prophet
of the new Christianity, and succeeded in amassing very considerable wealth.
Later, however, he became discredited, and many of his disciples seceded
from him. Sects of Adventists have also been fairly numerous. These persons
at the call of their leaders have met in cemeteries and elsewhere arrayed
in white robes, in the belief that the Last Day had arrived; but finding
themselves duped, they invariably turned upon the charlatans who had aroused
these false hopes. There is an instance on record, however, where one such
person succeeded in bringing about the repetition of such a scene.
<P>
Theosophy, as will be seen in the central article on that subject, owes much
to America, for it may be said that in the United States it received an almost
novel interpretation at the hands of William Q. Judge, and Katherine B. Tingley,
the founder of the theosophic colony at Point Loma, California.
<P>
The United States is frequently alluded to as the home and birth-place of
" queer" religions <I>par excellence. </I>If Paris be excepted this charge
holds good, for nowhere is pseudo-occultism so rife. It would indeed be difficult
to account for this state of things. Shrewd as the average American is, there
is no question that he is prone to extremes, and the temper of the nation
as a whole is not a little hysterical. Such sects are often founded by
unscrupulous foreign adventurers, and worshippers of Isis, diabolic societies
and such-like abound in the larger cities, and even in some of the lesser
communities. But on the other hand many such cults, take names of which for
obvious reasons we cannot mention here, are of native American origin. In
course of time these duly invade Europe, with varying fortunes. There exist,
however, in America, numbers of cultured persons who make a serious study
of the higher branches of mysticism and occultism, and who compare favourably
in erudition and character with advanced European mystics. It might indeed
with truth be said that America has produced the greatest occult leaders
of the last quarter of a century.

American Indians. Among the various native races of the American continent,
the supernatural has ever flourished as universally as among peoples in an
analogous condition of civilisation in other parts of the world. They will

<P>
North American Indians. The oldest writers on the North American Indians
agree that they practised sorcery and the magic arts, and often attributed
this power of the Indians to Satan. The Rev. Peter Jones, writing as late
as the first decade of the nineteenth century. says<B>:</B> " I have sometimes
been inclined to think that if witchcraft still exists in the world, it is
to be found among the aborigines of America." The early French settlers called
the Nipissing <I>Jongleurs </I>because of the surprising expertness <I>in
</I>magic of their medicine men. Carver and Fletcher observed the use of
hypnotic suggestion among the Menominee and Sioux about the middle of last
century, and it is generally admitted that this art, which is known to modern
Americanists as <I>orenda, </I>is known among most Indian tribes as Mooney
has proved in his <I>Ghost Dance Religion. </I>Brinton, alluding to Indian
medicine-men and their connection with the occult arts, says<B>:</B> "They
were also adepts in tricks of sleight of hand, and had no mean acquaintance
with what is called natural magic. They would allow themselves to be tied
hand and foot with knots innumerable, and at a sign would shake them loose
as so many wisps of straw; they would spit fire and swallow hot coals, pick
glowing stones from the flames, walk with naked feet over live ashes, and
plunge their arms to the shoulder in kettles of boiling water with apparent
impunity.
<P>
"Nor was this all. With a skill not inferior to that of the jugglers of India;
they could plunge knives into vital parts, vomit blood, or kill one another
out and out to all appearances, and yet in a few minutes be as well as ever;
they could set fire' to articles of clothing and even houses, and by a touch
of their magic restore them instantly as perfect as before. Says Father
Bautista<B>:</B> 'They can make a stick look like a serpent, a mat like a
centipede, and a piece of stone like a scorpion.' If it were not within our
power to see most of these miracles performed any night in our great cities
by a well-dressed professional, we should at once deny their possibility.
As it is they astonish us but little.
<P>
"One of the most peculiar and characteristic exhibitions of their power,
was to summon a spirit to answer inquiries concerning the future and the
absent. A great similarity marked this proceeding in all northern tribes,
from the Eskimos to the Mexicans. A circular or conical lodge of stout poles,
four or eight in number, planted firmly in the ground was covered with skins
or mats, a small aperture only being left for the seer to enter. Once in,
he carefully closed the hole and commenced his incantations. Soon the lodge
trembles, the strong poles shake and bend as with the united strength of
a dozen men, and strange, unearthly sounds, now far aloft in the air, now
deep in the ground. anon approaching near and nearer, reach the ears of the
spectators.
<P>
At length the priest announces that the spirit is present, and is prepared
to answer questions. An indispensable preliminary to any inquiry is to insert
a handful of tobacco, or a string of beads, or some such douceur under the
skins, ostensibly for the behoof of the celestial visitor, who would seem
not to be above earthly wants and vanities. The replies received, though
occasionally singularly clear and correct, are usually of that profoundly
ambiguous purport which leaves the anxious inquirer little wiser than he
was before.
<P>
"For all this, ventriloquism, trickery, and shrewd knavery are sufficient
explanations. Nor does it materially interfere with this view, that converted
Indians, on whose veracity we can implicitly rely, have repeatedly averred
that in performing this rite they themselves did not move the medicine lodge;
for nothing is easier than in the state of nervous excitement they were then
in to be self-deceived, as the now familiar phenomenon of table-turning
illustrates.
<P>
"But there is something more than these vulgar arts now and then to be perceived.
There are statements sup-ported by unquestionable testimony. which ought
not to be passed over in silence, and yet I cannot but approach them with
hesitation. They are so revolting to the laws of exact science, so alien,
I had almost said, to the experience of our lives. Yet is this true, or are
such experiences only ignored and put aside without serious consideration?
Are there not in the history of each of us passages which strike our
retrospective thought with awe, almost with terror? Are there not in nearly
every community individuals who possess a mysterious power, concerning whose
origin, mode of action, and limits, we and they are alike, in the dark?
<P>
I refer to such organic forces as are popularly summed up under the words
clairvoyance, mesmerism,
<P>
rhabdomancy, animal magnetism, physical spiritualism. Civilised thousands
stake their faith and hope here and hereafter, on the truth of these
manifestations; rational medicine recognises their existence, and while she
attributes them to morbid, and exceptional influences, confesses her want
of more exact knowledge, and refrains from barren theorising. Let us follow
her example, and hold it enough to show that such powers, whatever they are,
were known to the native priesthood as well as the modern spiritualists and
the miracle mongers of the Middle Ages.
<P>
"Their highest development is what our ancestors called 'second sight.' That
under certain conditions knowledge can pass from one mind to another otherwise
than through the ordinary channels of the senses, is shown by the examples
of persons en <I>rapport. </I>The limit to this we do not know, but it is
not unlikely that clairvoyance or second sight is based upon it."
<P>
In his autobiography, the celebrated Sac chief, Black Hawk, relates that
his great grandfather "was inspired by a belief that at the end of four years
he should see a white man, who would be to him a father." Under the direction
of this vision he travelled eastward to a certain spot, and there, as he
was forewarned, met a Frenchman, through whom the nation was brought into
alliance with France.
<P>
No one at all versed in the Indian character will doubt the implicit faith
with which ,this legend was told and heard. But we may be pardoned our
scepticism, seeing there are so many chances of error. It is not so with
an anecdote related by Captain Jonathan Carver, a coolheaded English trader,
whose little book of travels is an unquestioned authority. In <B>1767</B>
he was among the Killistenoes at a time when they were in great straits for
food, and depending upon the arrival of the traders to rescue them from
starvation. They persuaded the chief priest to consult the divinities as
to when the relief would arrive. After the usual preliminaries, their magnate
announced that the next day precisely, when the sun reached the zenith, a
canoe would arrive with further tidings. At the appointed hour, the whole
village, together with the incredulous Englishman, was on the beach, and
sure enough, at the minute specified, a canoe swung
<P>
round a distant point of land, and rapidly approaching the shore, brought
the expected news. Charlevoix is nearly as trustworthy a writer as Carver.
Yet he deliberately relates an equally singular instance.
<P>
But these examples are surpassed by one described in the <I>Atlantic Monthly,
</I>of July. <B>1866</B>, the author of which, the late Col. John Mason Brown,
has testified to its accuracy in every particular. Some years since at the
head of a party of voyageurs, he set forth in search of a band of Indians
somewhere on the vast plains along the tributaries of the Copper-mine and
Mackenzie rivers. Danger, disappointment, and the fatigues of the road, induced
one after another to turn back, until of the original ten only three remained.
They also were on the point of giving up the apparently hopeless quest, when
they were met by some warriors of the very band they were seeking. These
had been sent out by one of their medicine men to find three whites, whose
horses, arms, attire, and personal appearance he minutely described, which
description was repeated to Col. Brown by the warriors before they saw his
two companions. When afterwards, the priest, a frank and simple-minded man,
was asked to explain this extraordinary occurrence, he could offer no other
explanation than that " he saw them coming, and heard them talk on their
journey."
<P>
Many tales such as these have been recorded by travellers, and however much
they may shock our sense of probability, as well-authenticated exhibitions
of a power which sways the Indian mind, and which has ever prejudiced it
so unchangeably against Christianity and civilisation, they cannot be
disregarded. Whether they too are but specimens of refined knavery, whether
they are instigations of the devil, or whether they must be classed with
other facts as illustrating certain obscure and curious mental faculties,
each may decide as the bent of his mind inclines him, for science makes no
decision.
<P>
Those nervous conditions associated with the name of Mesmer were nothing
new to the Indian magicians. Rubbing and stroking the sick, and the laying
on of hands, were very common parts of their clinical procedures, and at
the initiations to their societies they were frequently exhibited. Observers
have related that among the Nez Perces of Oregon, the novice was put to sleep
by songs. incantations, and "certain passes of the hand," and that with the
Dakotas he would be struck lightly on the breast at a pre-concerted moment,
and instantly "would drop prostrate on his face, his muscles rigid and quivering
in every fibre."
<P>
There is no occasion to suppose deceit in this. It finds its parallel in
every race and every age, and rests on a characteristic trait of certain
epochs and certain man, which leads them to seek the divine, not in thoughtful
contemplation on the laws of the universe and the facts of self-consciousness,
but in an entire immolation of the latter, a sinking of their own individuality
in that of the spirits whose alliance they seek.
<P>
The late Washington Mathews, writing in Bulletin <B>30</B> of the Bureau
of American Ethnology, says<B>:</B>
<P>
"Sleight-of-hand was not only much employed in the treatment of disease,
but was used on many other occasions. A very common trick among Indian charlatans
was to pretend to suck foreign bodies, such as stones, out of the persons
of their patients. Records of this are found among many tribes, from the
lowest in culture to the highest, even among the Aztecs. Of course, such
trickery was not without some therapeutic efficacy, for, like many other
proceedings of the shamans, it was designed to cure disease by influence
on the imagination. A Hidatsa, residing in Dakota, in <B>1865</B>, was known
by the name of Cherry-in-the-mouth, because he had a trick of producing from
his mouth, at any season, what seemed to be fresh wild cherries. He had found
some way of preserving cherries, perhaps in whisky, and it was easy for him
to hide them in his mouth before intending to play the trick; but many of
the Indians considered it wonderful magic.
<P>
The most astonishing tricks of the Indians were displayed in their fire
ceremonies and in handling hot
<P>
substances, accounts of which performances pertain to various tribes. It
is said that Chippewa sorcerers could handle with impunity red-hot stones
and burning brands, and could bathe the hands in boiling water or syrup;
such magicians were called ' fire-dealers' and 'fire-handlers.' There are
authentic accounts from various parts of the world of fire-dancers and fire-walks
among barbarous races, and extraordinary fire acts are performed also among
widely separated Indian tribes. Among the Ankara of what is now North Dakota,
in the autumn of <B>1865</B>, when a large fire in the centre of the medicine
lodge had died down until it became a bed of glowing embers, and the light
in the lodge was dim, the performers ran with apparently bare feet among
the hot coals and threw these around in the lodge with their bare hands,
causing the spectators to flee. Among the Navaho, performers, naked except
for breechcloth and moccasins, and having their bodies daubed with a white
infusorial clay, run at high speed around a fire, holding in their hands
great faggots of flaming cedar bark, which they apply to the bare backs of
those in front of them and to their own persons. Their wild race around the
fire is continued until the faggots are nearly all consumed, but they are
never injured by the flame. This immunity may be accounted for by supposing
that the cedar bark does not make a very hot fire, and that the clay coating
protects the body. Menominee shamans are said to handle fire, as also are
the female sorcerers of Honduras.
<P>
"Indians know well how to handle venomous serpents with impunity. If they
can not avoid being bitten, as they usually can, they seem to be able to
avert the fatal consequences of the bite. The wonderful acts performed in
the Snake Dance of the Hopi have often been described.
<P>
"A trick of Navaho dancers, in the ceremony of the mountain chant, is to
pretend to thrust an arrow far down the throat. In this feat an arrow with
a telescopic shaft is used ; the point is held between the teeth; the hollow
part of the handle, covered with plumes, is forced down toward the lips,
and thus the arrow appears to be swallowed. There is an account of an arrow
of similar construction used early in the eighteenth century by Indians of
Canada, who pretended a man was wounded by it and healed instantly. The Navaho
also pretend to swallow sticks, which their neighbours of the pueblo of Zuni
actually do in sacred rites, occasionally rupturing the esophagus in the
ordeal of forcing a stick into the stomach. Special societies which practise
magic, having for their chief object rainmaking and the cure of disease,
exist among the southwestern tribes. Swallowing sticks, arrows, etc., eating
and walking on fire, and trampling on cactus, are performed by members of
the same fraternity.
<P>
"Magicians are usually men; but among the aborigines of the Mosquito Coast
in Central America, they are often women who are called <I>sukias, </I>and
are said to exercise great power. According to Hewitt, Iroquois women are
reported traditionally to have been magicians.
<P>
" A trick of the juggler among many tribes of the North was to cause himself
to be bound hand and foot and then, without visible assistance or effort
on his part to release himself from the bonds. Civilised conjurers who perform
a similar trick are hidden in a cabinet, and claim supernatural aid; but
some Indian jugglers performed this feat under observation. It was common
for Indian magicians to pretend they could bring rain, but the trick consisted
simply of keeping up ceremonies until rain fell, the
<P>
last ceremony being the one credited with success. Catlin describes this
among the Mandan, in <B>1832</B>, and the practice is still common among
the Pueblo tribes of the arid region. The rain-maker was a special functionary
among the Menominee.
<P>
"To cause a large plant to grow to maturity in a few moments and out of season
is another Indian trick. The Navaho plant the root stalk of a yucca in the
ground in the middle of the winter, and apparently cause it to grow, blossom,
and bear fruit in a few moments. This is done by the use of artificial flowers
and fruit carried under the blankets of the performers; the dimness of the
firelight and the motion of the surrounding dancers hide from the spectators
the operations of the shaman when he exchanges one artificial object for
another. In this way the Hopi grow beans, and the Zuni corn, the latter using
a large cooking pot to cover the growing plant."
<P>
<I></I>
<P>
South American Indians. Throughout South America the magician caste analogous
to the medicine men or shamans of North America are known as <I>piaies </I>or
<I>piaes. </I>Of those of British Guiana, Brett writes<B>:</B>
<P>
"They are each furnished with a large gourd or calabash, which has been emptied
of its seeds and spongy contents, and has a round stick run through the middle
of it by means of two holes. The ends of this stick project-one forms the
handle of the instrument, and the other has a long string to which beautiful
feathers are attached, wound round it in spiral circles. Within the calabash
are a few small white stones, which rattle when it is shaken or turned round.
The calabash itself is usually painted red. It is regarded with great awe
by the heathen Indians, who fear to touch it, or even to approach the place
where it is kept.
<P>
"When attacked by sickness, the Indians cause themselves to be conveyed to
some friendly sorcerer, to whom a present of more or less value must be made.
Death is sometimes occasioned by those removals, cold being taken from wet
or the damp of the river. If the patient cannot be removed, the sorcerer
is sent for to visit him. The females are all sent, away from the 'place,
and the men must keep at a respectful distance, as he does not like his
proceedings to be closely inspected. He then commences his exorcisms, turning,
and shaking his <I>marakka, </I>or rattle and chanting an address to the
<I>yauhahu. </I>This is continued for hours, until about midnight the spirit
is supposed to be present, and a conversation to take place, which is
unintelligible to the Indians, who may overhear it. These ceremonies are
kept up for successive nights.
<P>
"If the patient be strong enough to endure the disease the excitement, the
noise, and the fumes of tobacco in which he is at times enveloped, and the
sorcerer observe signs of recovery he will pretend to extract the cause of
the complaint by sucking the part affected. After many ceremonies he will
produce from his mouth some strange substance, such as a thorn or gravel-stone,
a fish-bone or bird's claw, a snake's tooth, or a piece of wire, which some
malicious <I>yauhahu </I>is supposed to have inserted in the affected part.
As soon as the patient fancies himself rid of this cause of his illness his
recovery is generally rapid, and the fame of the sorcerer greatly increased.
Should death, however, ensue, the blame is laid upon the evil spirit, whose
power and malignity have prevailed over the counteracting charms. Some rival
sorcerer will at times come in for a share of the blame, whom the sufferer
has unhappily made his enemy, and who is supposed to have employed the
<I>yauhahu </I>in destroying him. The sorcerers being supposed to have the
power of causing, as well as of curing diseases, are much dreaded by the
common people, who never willfully offend them. So deeply rooted in the Indian's
bosom is this belief concerning the origin of
<P>
diseases, that they have little idea of sickness arising from other causes.
Death may arise from a wound or a contusion, or be brought on by want of
food, but in other cases it is the work of the <I>yauhahu.</I>
<P>
"I once came upon a Warau practising his art upon a woman inflicted with
a severe internal complaint. He was, when I first saw him, blowing violently
into his hands and rubbing them upon the affected part. He very candidly
acknowledged his imposture when I taxed him with it, put up his implements,
and went away. The fate of the poor woman, as it was related to me some time
afterwards, was very sad. Though a Venezuelan half-breed, and of the Church
of Rome, she was wedded to the Indian superstitions, and after trying the
most noted sorcerers without relief, she inflicted on herself a mortal wound
with a razor in the vain attempt to cut out the imaginary cause of her internal
pain.
<P>
"Some have imagined that those men have faith in the power of their own
incantations from their performing them over their own children, and even
causing them to be acted over themselves when sick. This practice it is indeed
difficult to account for. The juggling part of their business is such a gross
imposture as could only succeed with a very ignorant and credulous people;
but it is perhaps in their case, as in some others, difficult to tell the
precise point where credulity ends and imposture begins. It is certain that
they are excited during their incantations in a most extraordinary way, and
positively affirm that they hold intercourse with spirits; nor will they
allow themselves to be laughed out of the assertion however ridiculous it
may appear to us.
<P>
"The Waraus, in many points the most degraded of the tribes, are the most
renowned as sorcerers. The huts which they set apart for the performance
of their superstitious rites are regarded with great veneration.
<P>
"Mr. Nowers, on visiting a Warau settlement, entered one of those huts, not
being aware of the offence he was committing, and found it perfectly empty,
with the exception of the gourd, or <I>mataro, </I>as it is called by the
tribe. There was, in the centre of the hut, a small raised place about eighteen
inches high, on which the fire had been made for burning tobacco. The sorcerer
being asked to give up the gourd, peremptorily refused, saying that if he
did so his two children would die the same night.'
<P>
Keller, in his <I>Amazon </I><I>and Madeira Rivers, </I>says <B>:</B> " As
with the shamans of the North Asiatic nations, the influence a Paje may secure
over his tribe depends entirely on the success of his cures and his more
or less imposing personal qualities. Woe to him if by some unlucky ministration
or fatal advice he forfeits his prestige. The hate of the whole tribe turns
against him, as if to indemnify them for the fear and awe felt by them until
then; and often he pays for his envied position with his life.
<P>
"And an influential and powerful position it is. His advice is first heard
in war and peace. He has to mark the boundaries of the hunting-grounds; and,
when quarrels arise, he has to decide in concert with the chieftain, sometimes
even against the latter's wishes. By a majestically distant demeanour, and
by the affectation of severe fasting and of nightly meetings with the spirits
of another world, these augurs have succeeded in giving such an appearance
of holiness to the whole caste, that their influence is a mighty one to the
present day, even with the Indians of the Aldeamentos, where contact with
the white race is sure by-and-by to produce a certain degree of scepticism.
<P>
When I was at the Aldeamento of San Ignacio, on the Paranapanema, Cuyaba,
chieftain and Paje' of an independent horde of Cayowa Indians made his
appearance, and I had the honour of being introduced to this magnificent
sample of a conjurer. He was a man of about fifty, with large well-cut features,
framed within a dense, streaming mane of long black hair. The long <I>xerimbita
</I>on his under lip (a long, thin, cylinder qf a resin resembling amber),
a great number of black and white beads covering his chest in regular rows
like a cuirass, and a broad girdle holding his <I>cherapi </I>(sort of apron),
which was fringed all round with rich, woven ornaments, gave him quite a
stately, majestic appearance."
<P>
Their magicians were called by the Chilians <I>gligua </I>or <I>dugol, </I>and
were subdivided into <I>guenguenu, genpugnu </I>and <I>genpiru, </I>meaning
respectively " masters of the heavens," of epidemics," and " of insects <I>or
</I>worms." There was also a sect called <I>calcu, </I>or "sorcerers," who
dwelt in caves, and who were served by <I>ivunches, </I>or " man-animals,"
to whom they taught their terrible arts. The Araucanians believed that these
wizards had the power to transform themselves at night into nocturnal birds,
to fly through the air, and to shoot invisible arrows at their enemies, besides
indulging in the malicious mischief with which folklore credits the wizards
of all countries. Their priests proper they believed to possess numerous
familiars who were attached to them after death-the belief of the magicians"
of the Middle Ages. These priests or diviners were celibate, and led an existence
apart from the tribe, in some communities being garbed as women. Many tales
are told of their magical prowess, which lead us to believe that they were
either natural epileptics or ecstatics, or that disturbing mental influences
were brought about in their case by the aid of drugs. The Araucanians also
held that to mention their real personal names gave magic power over them,
which might be turned to evil ends. Regarding the wizards of the inhabitants
of the territory around the River Chaco, in Paraguay, Mr. Barbrooke Grubb
in his book, <I>An Unknown People in an Unknown Land, </I>says<B>:</B>
<P>
"The training necessary to qualify an Indian to become a witch-doctor consists,
in the first place, in severe fastings, and especially in abstention from
fluid. They carry this fasting to such an excess as to affect the nervous
system and brain. Certain herbs are eaten to hasten this stage. They pass
days in solitude, and, when thoroughly worked up to an hysterical condition,
they see spirits and ghosts, and have strange visions. It is necessary,
furthermore, that they should eat a few live toads and some kinds of snakes.
Certain little birds are plucked alive and then devoured, their power of
whistling being supposed to be thus communicated to the witch-doctor. There
are other features in the preliminary training which need not be mentioned,
and when the initiatory stage has been satisfactorily passed, they are instructed
in the mysteries under pledge of secrecy. After that their future depends
upon themselves.
<P>
It is unquestionable that a few of these wizards understand to a slight degree
the power of hypnotism. They appear at times to throw themselves into a hypnotic
state by sitting in a strained position for hours, fixing their gaze upon
some distant object. In this condition they are believed to be able to throw
their souls out-that is, in order to make them wander. It seems that
occasionally, when in this state, they see visions which are quite the opposite
of those they had desired. At other times they content themselves with
concentrating their attention for a while upon one of their charms, and I
have no doubt that occasionally they are sincere in desiring to solve some
perplexing problems.
<P>
One of the chief duties of the wizard is to arrange the weather to suit his
clansmen. If they want rain it is to him they apply. His sorceries are of
such a kind that they may be extended over a long period. He is never lacking
in excuses, and so, while apparently busy in combating the
<P>
opposing forces which are hindering the rain, he gains time to study weather
signs. He will never or rarely venture an opinion as to the expected change
until he is nearly certain of a satisfactory result. Any other Indian could
foretell rain were he to observe signs as closely as does the wizard. The
killing of a certain kind of duck, and the sprinkling of its blood upwards,
is his chief charm. When he is able to procure this bird he is sure that
rain cannot be far off, because these ducks do not migrate southwards until
they know that there is going to be water in the swamps. These swamps are
filled by the overflowing of the rivers as much as by the local rainfalls,
and the presence of water in the rivers and swamps soon attracts rain-clouds.
<P>
"The wizards also observe plants and animals, study the sky and take note
of other phenomena, and by these means can arrive at fairly safe conclusions.
They are supposed to be able to foretell events, and to a certain extent
they succeed so far as these events concern local interests. By judicious
questioning and observation, the astute wizard is able to judge with some
amount of exactitude how certain matters are likely to turn out.
<P>
"After we had introduced bullock-carts into their country, the people were
naturally interested in the return of the carts from their periodical journeys
to the river. When the wizards had calculated carefully the watering-places,
and had taken into consideration the state of the roads, the character of
the drivers, and the condition and number of the bullocks, all that they
then required to know was the weight of the loads and the day on which it
was expected that the carts would leave the river on their return journey.
The last two items they had to obtain from us. When they had these data,
by a simple calculation they could make a very shrewd guess, not only at
the time when they might be expected to arrive at the village, but also at
what particular part of the road they might happen to be on any given day.
A great impression was made upon the simple people by this exhibition of
power, but when we discovered what they were doing, we withheld the information,
or only gave them part, with the result that their prophecies either failed
ignominiously or proved very erroneous. Their reputation accordingly began
to wane.
<P>
The wizards appear to be authorities on agricultural matters, and when
application to the garden spirit has failed, the witch-doctor is called in.
He examines the crop, and if he thinks it is likely to be a poor one, he
says it is being blighted by an evil spirit, but that he will use what sorceries
he can to preserve it. If, on the other hand, he has reason to believe that
the crop will be a good one, he spits upon it here and there, and then assures
the people that now they may expect a good harvest.
<P>
Some of the chief duties of the witch-doctor consist in laying ghosts, driving
off spirits. exorcising <I>kilyikhama </I>in cases of possession assisting
wandering souls back to their bodies, and generally in the recognising of
spirits. When a ghost is supposed to haunt a village, the wizard and his
assistants have sometimes an hour's arduous chanting, in order to induce
the restless one to leave. When he considers that he has accomplished this,
he assures the people that it is done, and this quiets their fears. Evil
spirits frequenting a neighbourhood have also to be driven off by somewhat
similar chanting."

sharpen the wit, turn away evil thoughts, and give a knowledge of the future
in dreams. Drunk in a potion, it was thought to expel poison and render the

Amulets <B>:</B> The charm, amulet, or mascot, is, of course, directly derived
from the conception of the fetish (q.v.), which was believed by savage and
semi-barbarous people to contain a spirit. Amulets may be said to be of two
classes <B>:</B> those which are worn as (<B>1</B>) fetishes, that is the
dwelling-place of spiritual entities, who are active on behalf of the wearer;
or (<B>2</B>), mascots to ward off bad luck or such influences as the evil
eye.
<P>
That charms were worn by prehistoric man there is little room for doubt,
as objects which in many cases partake of the appearance and general description
of amulets are discovered in Neolithic tombs. The ancient Egyptians possessed
a bewildering variety of amulets, which were worn both by the living and
the dead. Indeed, among the latter, every part of the body had an amulet
sacred to itself. These were, as a rule, evolved from various organs of the
gods<B>:</B> as, for example, the eye of Isis, the backbone of Osiris, and
so forth. Among the savage and semi-civilised peoples, the amulet usually
takes the form of a necklace, bracelets, or anklets, and where belief in
witchcraft and the evil eye is strong, the faith in these, and in charms,
is always most intense. Among civilised races it has been observed that it
is usually the ignorant classes who adopt the use of amulets<B>:</B> such
as sailors, miners, beggars, Gypsies, and criminals. But amulets are also
to be found in use among educated persons, although, of course, the superstitious
part of the practice has in these cases often disappeared. Universally speaking,
stones, teeth, claws, shells, coral and symbolic emblems, are favoured amulets.
The reason for the wearing of these is exceedingly difficult to arrive at,
but a kind of doctrine of correspondences may be at the root of the belief-the
idea that like produces like, or that an effect resembles its cause, or that
things which have once been in contact but have ceased to be so, continue
to act on each other by magical means. For example, the desert goat is a
sure-footed animal; accordingly, its tongue is carried as a powerful amulet
against falling by certain Malay tribes. Beads resembling teeth are often
hung round the necks of Kaffir children in Africa to assist them in teething,
and the incisor teeth of the beaver are frequently placed round the necks
of little American-Indian girls to render them industrious, like that animal.
Again, certain plants and minerals indicate by their external character the
diseases for which nature intended them as remedies. Thus the euphrasia,
or eyebright, was supposed to be good for the eyes because it contains a
black pupil-like spot; and the blood-stone was employed for stopping the
flow of blood from a wound.
<P>
It is strange that wherever prehistoric implements, such as arrowheads and
celts, are discovered, they are thought by the peasantry of the locality
in which they are found to be of great virtue as amulets. Some light is cast
on this custom by the fact that stone arrowheads were certainly in use among
mediaeval British witches. But in most countries they are thought to descend
from the sky, and are therefore kept to preserve people and cattle from
lightning. This does not, however, explain away the reason why water poured
over a prehistoric arrowhead is given to cure cows in Ireland. Certain roots,
which have the shape of snakes, are kept by the Malays to ensure them against
snake-bite; and instances of this description of correspondence, known as
the doctrine of signatures, could be multiplied <I>ad infinitum. </I>Among
the Celts a great many kinds of amulets were used<B>:</B> such as the symbolic
wheel of the sun god, found so numerously in France and Great Britain ; 'pebbles,
amulets of the teeth of the wild boar, and pieces of amber. The well-known
serpent's egg of the Druids was also in all probability an amulet of the
priestly class. Indian amulets are numerous, and in Buddhist countries their
use is universal, especially where that religion has become degraded, or
has in any way degenerated. In Northern Buddhist countries almost everyone
constantly wears an amulet round the neck. These generally represent the
leaf of the sacred fig-tree, and are made in the form of a box which contains
a scrap of sacred writing, prayer, or a little picture. Women of position
in Tibet wear a chatelaine containing a charm or charms, and the universal
amulet of the Buddhist priests in that country is the thunderbolt, supposed
to have fallen direct from Indra's heaven. This is usually imitated in bronze
or other metal, and is used for exorcising evil spirits. Amulet types are
for the most part very ancient, and present much the same characteristics
in all parts of the world.

Anathema <B>:</B> The name was given by the ancients to certain classes of
votive offerings, to the nets that the fisherman lays on the altar of the
sea-nymphs, to the mirror that Lais consecrated to Venus; to offerings of
vessels, garments, instruments, and various other articles. The word was
also applied to the victim devoted to the infernal gods, and it is in this
sense that it is found among Jews and Christians, referring either to the
curse or its object. The man who is anathematized is denied communication
with the faithful, and delivered to the demon if he dies without absolution.
The Church has often lavished <I>anathemas </I>upon its enemies, though St.
John Chrysostom has said that it is well to anathematize false doctrine,
but that men who have strayed should be pardoned and prayed for. Formerly,
magicians and sorcerers employed a sort of <I>anathema </I>to discover thieves
and witches. Some limpid water was brought, and in it were boiled as many
pebbles as there were persons suspected. The pebbles were then buried under
the door-step over which the thief or the sorcerer was to pass, and a plate
of tin attached to it, on which was written the words<B>:</B> "Christ is
conqueror; Christ is king; Christ is master." Every pebble must bear the
name of one of the suspected persons. The stones are removed at sunrise,
and that representing the guilty person is hot and glowing. But, as the devil
is malicious, that is not enough. The seven penitential psalms must then
be recited, with the Litanies of the Saints, and the prayers of exorcism
pronounced against the thief or the sorcerer. His name must be written in
a circular figure, and a triangular brass nail driven in above it with a
hammer, the handle of which is of cypress wood, the exorcist saying
meanwhile<B>:</B> "Thou art just, Lord, and just are Thy judgments." At this,
the thief would betray himself by a loud cry. If the <I>anathema </I>has
been pronounced by a sorcerer, and one wishes merely to escape the effects
of it and cause it to return to him who has cast it, one must take, on Saturday,
before sunrise, the branch of a hazel tree of one year, and recite the following
prayer<B>:</B> "I cut thee, branch of this year, in the name of him whom
I wish to wound as I wound thee." The branch is then laid on the table and
other prayers said, ending with "Holy Trinity, punish him who has done this
evil, and take him from among us by Thy great justice, that the sorcerer
or sorceress may be <I>anathema, </I>and we safe." Harrison Ainsworth's famous
novel, <I>The Lancashire Witches, </I>deals with the subject and the Pendleton
locality.

Angels <B>:</B> The word <I>angel, </I>"angelos" in Greek, "malak" in Hebrew,
literally signifies a "person sent" or a " messenger." It is a name, not
of nature but of office, and is applied also to men in the world, as ambassadors
or representatives. In a lower sense, <I>angel </I>denotes a spiritual being
employed in occasional offices; and lastly, men in office as priests or bishops.
.The <I>"angel </I>of the congregation," among the Jews, was the chief of
the synagogue. Such is the scriptural usage of a term, which, in common parlance,
is now limited to its principal meaning, and denotes only the inhabitants
of heaven.
<P>
The apostle of the Gentiles speaks of the <I>angels </I>as "ministering spirits,
sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation," in strict
keeping with the import of the term itself. In Mark i., <B>2</B>, it is applied
to John the Baptist<B>:</B> " Behold I send my messenger (' <I>angel')
</I>before my face," and the word is the same ("malak") in the corresponding
prophecy of Malachi. In Hebrews xii., <B>22</B>, <B>24</B>, we read<B>:</B>
"Ye have come to an innumerable company of <I>angels, </I>to the spirits
of the just," etc., and this idea of their great number is sustained by the
words of our Lord himself, where, for example, he declares that" twelve legions"
of them were ready upon His demand. In the Revelation of St. John, a vast
idea of their number is given. They are called the "armies" of heaven. Their
song of praise is described as "the voice of a great multitude, and as the
voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings." In fine, the
sense of number is overwhelmed in the effort to compute them.
<P>
As to their nature, it is essentially the same as that of man, for not only
are understanding and will attributed to them, but they have been mistaken
for men when they appeared, and Paul represents them as capable of disobedience
(Heb. ii., <B>7</B>, i<B>6</B>.) The latter possibility is exhibited in its
greatest extent by Jude, who speaks of the <I>"angels </I>which kept not
their first estate, but left their own habitation," and upon this belief
is founded the whole system of tradition concerning <I>angels </I>and demons.
The former term was gradually limited to mean only the obedient ministers
of the will of the Almighty, and the influence of evil <I>angels </I>was
concentrated into the office of the great adversary of all good, the devil
or Satan. These ideas were common to the whole Eastern world, and were probably
derived by the Jewish people from the Assyrians. The Pharisees charged the
Saviour with casting out devils "by Beelzebub the prince of the devils."
But that evil spirits acted in multitudes under one person, appears from
Mark v., <B>9</B>, where the evil spirit being asked his name,
answered<B>:</B>
<P>
"My name is ' Legion' for we are many."
<P>
It is generally held that two orders are mentioned in scripture, <I>"angels"
</I>and "archangels"; but the latter word only occurs twice, namely, in Jude,
where Michael is called "an archangel," and in I. Thess. iv., <B>16</B>,
where it is written<B>:</B> "the Lord shall descend from heaven with a shout,
with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God." This is a slender
foundation to build a theory upon. The prefix simply denotes rank, not another
order of intelligence. There is nothing in the whole of Scripture, therefore,
to show that intelligent beings exist who have other than human attributes.
Gabriel and Michael are certainly mentioned by name, but they appeared to
Daniel, Zacharias, and the Virgin Mary, in fulfillment of a function,
correspondent to the high purpose of which, may be the greater power, wisdom,
and goodness, we should attribute to them; and hence the fuller representation
of the angelic hosts, as chief <I>angels.</I>
<P>
The mention of Michael by name occurs five times in Scripture, and always
in the character of a chief militant
<P>
In Daniel, he is the champion of the Jewish church against Persia; in the
Revelation, he overcomes the dragon; and in Jude he is mentioned in personal
conflict with the devil about the body of Moses. He is. called by Gabriel,
"Michael, your prince," meaning of the Jewish church. In the alleged prophecy
of Enoch, he is styled<B>:</B> "Michael, one of the holy <I>angels, </I>who,
presiding over human virtue, commands the nations "; while Raphael, it says,
"presides over the spirits of men"; Uriel, "over clamour and terror"; and
Gabriel, "over Paradise, and over the cherubims." In the Catholic services,
St. Michael is invoked as a "most glorious and warlike prince," ' the receiver
of souls," and " the vanquisher of evil spirits." His design, according to
Randle Holme, is a banner hanging on a cross; and he is armed as representing
victory, with a dart in one hand and a cross on his forehead. Bishop Horsley
and others considered Michael only another designation for the Son of God.
We may add as a certain biblical truth, that the Lord Himself is always meant,
in an eminent sense, by any <I>angel </I>named as His minister; and he is
called the <I>angel </I>of the Covenant, because he em-bodied in his own
person the whole power and representation of the angelic kingdom, as the
messenger, not of separate and temporary commands, but of the whole Word
in its fullness.
<P>
Paul speaks of a "third heaven," which must be understood not as a distinct
order of created intelligences, but in the same sense as the Lord's
declaration<B>:</B> " In my Father's house are many mansions." For Jesus
Christ always speaks of His kingdom as essentially one, even in both worlds,
the spiritual and natural.
<P>
Dionysius, or St. Denis, the supposed Areopagite, describes three hierarchies
of <I>angels </I>in nine choirs, thus<B>:</B>
<P>
Seraphim, Cherubim, Thrones, Dominions, Principalities, Powers, Virtues,
<I>Angels, </I>Archangels. And Vartan, or Vertabied, the Armenian poet and
historian, who flourished in the thirteenth century, describes them under
the same terms, but expressly states <B>:</B> " these orders differ from
one another in situation and degree of glory, just as there are different
ranks among men, though they are all of one nature." He also remarks that
the first order are attracted to the Deity by love, and hardly attributes
place to them, but states of desire and love, while the heaven which contains
the whole host is above the <I>primum mobile, </I>which, again is superior
to the starry firmament. This description, and all others resembling it,
the twelve heavenly worlds of Plato, and the heaven succeeding it, the heaven
of the Chinese, for example, are but as landmarks serving to denote the heights
which the restless waves of human intelligence have reached at various times
in the attempt to represent the eternal and infinite in precise terms. Boeheme
recognises the " whole deep between the stars," as the heaven of one of.
the three hierarchies, and places the other two above it; "in the midst of
all which," he says, "is the Son of God; no part of either is farther or
nearer to him, yet are the three kingdoms circular about him." The Revelations
of Swedenborg date a century later, and begin all these subjects <I>de novo,
</I>but his works are accessible to all, and therefore we do not further
allude to them.
<P>
The Jewish rabbi's hold the doctrine of another hierarchy superior to these
three, and some of them, as Bechaliand Joshua, teach that on every day
ministering <I>angels </I>are created out of the river Diner, or fiery stream,
and they sing an anthem and cease to exist; as it is written, they are new
every morning." This, however, is only a misunderstanding, for to be "renewed"
or "created" in the scriptural sense, is to be regenerated; and to be renewed
every morning is to be kept in a regenerate state; the fiery stream is the
baptism by fire or divine love.
<P>
The following represent the angelic hierarchies answering to the ten divine
names
<P>
<B>1</B>. Jehovah, attributed to God the Father, being the pure and simple
essence of the divinity, flowing through <I>Hajoth Hakados </I>to the <I>angel
</I>Metratton and to the ministering spirit, <I>Reschith Hajalalim, </I>who
guides the <I>primum mobile, </I>and bestows the gift of being on all. These
names are to be understood as pure essences, or as spheres of <I>angels </I>and
blessed spirits, .by whose agency the divine providence extends to all his
words.
<P>
<B>2</B>. Jah, attributed to the person of the Messiah or Logos, whose power
and influence descends through the <I>angel </I>Masleh into the sphere of
the Zodiac. This is the spirit or word that actuated the chaos, and ultimately
produced the four elements, and all creatures that inherit them, by the agency
of a spirit named Raziel, who was the ruler of Adam.
<P>
<B>3</B>. Ehjeh, attributed to the Holy Spirit, whose divine light is received
by the <I>angel </I>Sabbathi, and communicated from him through the sphere
of Saturn. It denotes the beginning of the supernatural generation, and hence
of all living souls.
<P>
The ancient Jews considered the three superior names which are those above,
to be attributed to the divine essence as personal or proper names, while
the seven following denote the measures <I>(middoth) </I>or attributes which
are visible in the works of God. But the modern Jews, in opposition to the
tripersonalists, consider the whole as attributes. Maurice makes the higher
three denote the heavens, and the succeeding the seven planets or worlds,
to each of which a presiding <I>angel </I>was assigned.
<P>
<B>4</B>. El, strength, power, light, through which flow grace, goodness,
mercy, piety, and munificence to the <I>angel </I>Zadkiel, and passing through
the sphere of Jupiter
<P>
fashioneth the images of all bodies, bestowing clemency, benevolence and
justice on all.
<P>
<B>5</B>. Elohi, the upholder of the sword and left hand of God. Its influence
penetrates the <I>angel </I>Geburah (or Gamaliel) and descends through the
sphere of Mars. It imparts fortitude in times of war and affliction.
<P>
<B>6</B>. Tsebaoth, the title of God as Lord of hosts. The <I>angel </I>is
Raphael, through whom its mighty power passes into the sphere of the sun,
giving motion, heat and brightness to it.
<P>
<B>7</B>. Elba, the title of God as the highest. The <I>angel </I>is Michael.
The sphere to which he imparts its influence is Mercury, giving benignity,
motion, and intelligence, with elegance and consonance of speech.
<P>
<B>8</B>. Adonai, master or lord, governing the <I>angel </I>Haniel, and
the sphere of Venus.
<P>
<B>9</B>. Shaddai, the virtue of this name is conveyed by Cherubim to the
<I>angel </I>Gabriel, and influences the sphere of the moon. It causes increase
and decrease, and rules the jinn and protecting spirits.
<P>
<B>10</B>.Elohim, the source of knowledge, understanding and wisdom, received
by the <I>angel </I>Jesodoth, and imparted to the sphere of the earth.
<P>
The division of <I>angels </I>into nine orders or three hierarchies, as derived
from Dionysius Areopagus, was held in the Middle Ages, and gave the prevalent
character to much of their symbolism. With it was held the doctrine of their
separate creation, and the tradition of the rebellious hierarchy, headed
by Lucifer, the whole of which was rendered familiar to the popular mind
by the Epic of Milton. Another leading tradition, not so much interwoven
with the popular theology, was that of their intercourse with women, producing
the race of giants. It was supposed to be authorised by Gen. vi. <B>2</B>
in the adoption of which the Christian fathers seem to have followed the
opinion of Philo-Judaeus, and Josephus. A particular account of the circumstances
is given in the book of Enoch, already mentioned, which makes the <I>angels,
</I>Uriel, Gabriel, and Michael, the chief instruments in the subjugation
of the adulterers and their formidable off-spring. The classic writers have
perpetuated similar traditions of the "hero" race, all of them born either
from the love of the gods for women, or of the preference shown for a goddess
by some mortal man.
<P>
The Persian, Jewish, and Mohammedan accounts of <I>angels </I>all evince
a common origin, and they alike admit a difference of sex. In the latter,
the name of Azazil is given to the hierarchy nearest the throne of God, to
which the Mohammedan Satan (Eblis or Hiris) is supposed to have belonged;
also Azreal, the <I>angel </I>of death, and Asrafil (probably the same as
Israfil), the <I>angel </I>of the resurrection. The examiners, Moukir and
Nakir, are subordinate <I>angels </I>of terrible aspect, armed with whips
of iron and fire, who interrogate recently deceased souls as to their lives.
The parallel to this tradition in the Talmud is an account of seven <I>angels
</I>who beset the paths of death. The Koran also assigns two <I>angels </I>to
every man, one to record his good, and the other his evil actions; they are
so merciful that if an evil action has been done, it is not recorded till
the man has slept, and if in that interval he repents, they place on the
record that God has pardoned him. The Siamese, beside holding the difference
of sex, imagine that <I>angels </I>have offspring; but their traditions
concerning the government of the world and the guardianship of man are similar
to those of other nations.
<P>
The Christian fathers, for the most part, believed that <I>angels </I>possessed
bodies of heavenly substance (Tertullian calls it "angelified flesh"), and,
if not, that they could assume a corporeal presence at their pleasure. In
fact, all the actions recorded of them in Scripture, suppose human members
and attributes. It is not only so in the historic portions, but in the prophetic,
even in the Apocalypse, the most replete with symbolic figures. <I>(See

of more ancient origin, and prevailed in the systems of certain eastern
philosophers. By the Stoics it was believed to be the only vital force in
the universe; it has been entertained by many philosophical sects in a variety
of forms, and in more modern times by Paracelsus and others. It is also
incorporated in the philosophy of Schelling. Rich says<B>:</B>
<P>
"The <I>anima mundi, </I>or heaven of this world, in which the

Animism : The doctrine of spiritual beings, or the concept that a great part,
if not the whole, of inanimate nature, as well as of animate beings, are
endowed with reason and volition identical with that of man. It is difficult
to distinguish this conception from that of personalisation, but the difference
exists. The savage hears the wind whistle past him, and thinks that in it
he can distinguish voices. He sees movement in streams, trees, and other
objects, which he believes to be inhabited by spirits. The idea of a soul
probably arose through dreams, apparitions, or clairvoyance, hallucinations
and shadows, and perhaps through the return to life after periods of
unconsciousness. Movement, therefore, argued life. The cult of fetishism
well instances the belief in animism, for it posits the en-trance into an
inanimate body of a separate spiritual entity deliberately come to inhabit
it. There is no necessity in this place to go into the question whether or
not animism is at the basis of religious belief; but it is distinctly at
the root of magical belief and practice.

Anonymous Adept (fl. 1750) : A noted German Jesuit of the eighteenth century,
known to his clerical <I>confreres </I>and his flock as Athanasius the Churchman.
He composed two folio volumes of semi-alchemistic writing, which were published
at Amsterdam in <B>1768</B>. In the course of these voluminous works, he
alludes to an alchemist whose name he refrains from revealing, and who is
usually hailed in consequence by the elusive title heading this article.
Athanasius, we find, having long endeavoured to discover the Philosopher's
Stone, and having met with no success, chanced one day to encounter a venerable
personage, who addressed him thus<B>:</B> "I see by these glasses and this
furnace that you are engaged in search after something very great in chemistry,
but, believe me, you will never attain your object by working as you are
doing." Pondering on these words, the shrewd Jesuit suspected that his
interlocutor was truly learned in alchemy, wherefore he besought him to display
his erudition, and thereupon our <I>Anonymous Adept </I>took a quill, and
wrote down a recipe for the making of transmutatory powder, together with
specific directions for using the same. " Let us proceed together," said
the great unknown; nor were the hopes of Athanasius frustrated. for in a
little while a fragment of gold was duly made, the wise pedagogue disappearing
immediately afterwards. The Jesuit now fancied himself on the verge of a
dazzling fortune, and he proceeded straightway to try and manufacture nuggets;
but, alas ! Try as he might, his attempts all proved futile. Much enraged,
he went to the inn where the <I>Anonymous A dept </I>was staying, but it
need scarcely be said, perhaps, that the bird was flown. "We see by this
true history," remarks Athanasius, by way of pointing a moral, <I>"how </I>the
devil seeks to deceive men who are led by a lust of riches"; while he relates
further, that having been duped in this wise, he destroyed his scientific
appliances, to renounce alchemy for ever.

mysterious words, had taken the name of " Anselmites." But Naude observes
that they boasted that they had obtained their gift of. healing, not from

Anthony St.<B>:</B> A great demon of enormous stature one day approached
St. Anthony to offer his services. By way of response the saint looked at
him sideways and spat in his face. The demon took the repulse so much to
heart that he vanished without a word, and did not dare to appear on earth
for a long time afterwards. It is hardly conceivable that St. Anthony could
have treated the devil so rudely, if one did not know how many temptations
he had suffered from him, though it is difficult to admit that he was the
object of so many attacks on the part of the devil, when he himself
said<B>:</B> " I fear the demon no more than I fear a fly, and with the sign
of the cross I can at once put him to flight." St. Athanasius, who wrote
the life of <I>St. Anthony, </I>mingled with his hero's adventures with the
devil, certain incidents which contrast strangely enough with these. Some
philosophers, astonished at the great wisdom of <I>Anthony, </I>asked him
in what book he had discovered so fine a doctrine. The saint pointed with
one hand to the earth, with the other to the sky. "There are my books," said
he, "I have no others. If men will design to study as I do the marvels of
creation, they will find wisdom enough there. Their spirit will soon soar
from the creation to the Creator." And certainly these were not the words
of a man who trafficked with the devil.

Anthropomancy <B>:</B> Divination by the entrails of men or women. This horrible
usage is very ancient. Herodotus said that Menelaus, detained in Egypt by
contrary winds, sacrificed to his barbarous curiosity, two children of the
country, and sought to discover his destiny by means of <I>anthropomancy.
</I>Heliogabalus practised this means of divination. Julian the Apostate,
in his magical operations, during his nocturnal sacrifices, caused, it is
said, a large number of children to be killed, so that he might consult their
entrails. In his last expedition, being at Carra, in Mesopotamia, he shut
himself in the Temple of the Moon, and having done all manner of evil there,
he sealed the doors and posted a guard, whose duty it was to see that they
were not opened until his return. However, he was killed in battle with the
Persians, and those who entered the Temple of Carra, in the reign of Julian's
successor, found there a woman hanging by her hair, with her liver torn out.
It is probable that Gilles de Retz (q.v.) 'also practised this dreadful species
of divination.

Antichrist <B>:</B> The universal enemy of mankind, who will in the latter
days be sent to scourge the world for its wickedness. According to the Abbot
Bergier. <I>Antichrist </I>is regarded as a tyrant, impious and excessively
cruel, the arch enemy of Christ, and the last ruler of the earth. The
persecutions he will inflict on the elect will be the last and most severe
ordeal which they will have to undergo. Christ, himself, according to several
commentators, foretold that they would have succumbed to it if its duration
had not been shortened on their behalf. He will pose as the Messiah, and
will perform things wonderful enough to mislead the elect themselves. The
thunder will obey him, according to St. John, and Leloyer asserts that the
demons below watch over hidden treasures by means of which he will be able
to tempt many. It is on account of the miracles that he will perform, that
Boguet calls him the "Ape of God," and it is through this scourge that God
will proclaim the final judgment and the vengeance to be meted out to
wrong-doers.
<P>
<I></I>
<P>
Antichrist will have a great number of forerunners, and will appear just
before the end of the world. St. Jerome claims that he will be a man begotten
by a demon; others, a demon in the flesh, visible and fantastical, or an
incarnate demon. But, following St. Ireneus, St. Ambrose, St. Augustine,
and almost all the fathers, <I>Antichrist </I>will be a man similar to. and
conceived in the same way as all others, differing from them only in a malice
and an impiety more worthy of a demon than of a man. Cardinal Bellarmin,
at a later date, and contrary to their authority, asserts however, that
<I>Antichrist </I>will be the son of a demon incubus and a sorceress.
<P>
He will be a Jew of the tribe of Dan, according to Malvenda, who supports
his view by the words of the dying Jacob to his sons<B>:</B>" Dan shall be
a serpent by the way an adder in the path; "-by those of Jeremiah <B>:</B>-"
The armies of Dan will devour the earth"; and by the seventh chapter of the
Apocalypse, where St. John has omitted the tribe of Dan in his enumeration
of the other tribes.

Elijah and Enoch will come at length and convert the Jews and will meet death
at last by order of <I>Antichrist, </I>Then will Christ descend from the

from His mouth. and reign on the earth for a thousand years, according to
some; an indefinite time, according to others.
<P>
It is claimed by some that the reign of <I>Antichrist </I>will last fifty
years. The opinion of the majority is that his reign will last but three
and a-half years, after which the angels will sound the trumpets of the day
of judgment, and Christ will come and judge the world. The watchword of
<I>Antichrist, </I>says Boguet, will be<B>:</B> " I abjure baptism." Many
commentators have foreseen the return of Elijah in these words of
Malachi<B>:</B> "I will send Elijah, the prophet, before the coming of the
great and dreadful day of the Lord." But it is not certain that Malachi referred
to this ancient prophet, since Christ applied this prediction to John the
Baptist, when he said<B>:</B> "Elias is come already, and they knew him not;
" and when the angel foretold to Zacharias the birth of his son, he said
to him<B>:</B> "And he shall go forth before the Lord in the spirit and power
of Elias."

By <I>Antichrist </I>may probably be meant the persecutors of the Church.

The third treatise in the <I>Histoire Veritable et Memorable des Trois Possedees
de Flandre, </I>by Father Sebastien Michalies, dominican friar, throws much
light in the words of exorcised demons, on <I>Antichrist. </I>"Conceived
through the medium of a devil, he will be as malicious as a madman, with
such wickedness as was never seen on earth. An inhuman martyr rather than
a human one, he will treat Christians as souls are treated in hell. He will
have a multitude of synagogue names, and he will be able to fly when he wishes.
Beelzebub will be his father, Lucifer his grandfather."
<P>
The revelations of exorcised demons show that
<P>
<I></I>
<P>
Antichrist was alive in <B>1613</B>. It appears that he has not yet attained
his growth "He was baptised on the Sabbath of the sorcerers, before his mother,
a Jewess, called La Belle-Fleur. He was three years old in <B>1613</B>. Louis
Gaufridi is said to have baptised him, in a field near Paris. An exorcised
sorceress claimed to have held the little <I>Antichrist </I>on her knees.
She said that his bearing was proud. and that even then he spoke many divers
languages But he had talons in the place of feet, and he wore no slippers.
He will do much harm, but there will be comforters, for the Holy Ghost still
lives." <I>(See </I>Merlin.) His father is shown in the figure of a bird,
with four feet, a tail, a bull's head much flattened, horns and black shaggy
hair. He will mark his own with a seal representing this in miniature. Michaelis
adds that things execrable will be around him. He will destroy Rome on account
of the Pope, and the Jews will help him. He will resuscitate the dead, and,
when thirty, will reign with Lucifer, the seven-headed dragon, and, after
a reign of three years, Christ will slay him.
<P>
Many such details might be quoted of <I>Antichrist, </I>whose appearance
has long been threatened, but with as yet no fulfillment. <I>(See </I>End
of the World.) We must mention, however, a volume published many years ago
at Lyons, by Rusand, called, <I>Les Precurseurs de <B>1</B>' Antechrist.
</I>This work shows that the reign of <I>Antichrist, </I>if it has not begun,
is drawing near ; that the philosophers, encyclopedists and revolutionaries
of the eighteenth century were naught but demons incarnated to precede and
prepare the way for

Antipathy <B>:</B> The old astrologers, who wished to explain everything,
claimed that the dislike which one feels for a person or thing is caused
by the stars. Thus. two persons born under the same aspect. will be mutually
attracted one to the other, and will love without knowing why. Others, again,
born under opposite conjunctions, will feel an unreasoning hate for each
other. But how can that <I>antipathy </I>be explained which great men sometimes
have for the commonest things? There have been many such cases, and all are
inexplicable. Lamothe-Levayer could not bear to hear the sound of any instrument,
and displayed the liveliest pleasure at the noise of thunder. Caesar could
not hear the crowing of a cock without shuddering; Lord Bacon fell into
despondency during the eclipse of the moon; Marie de Medicis could not bear
to look on a rose. even in a painting, though she loved all other flowers.
Cardinal Henry of Cardonne had the same <I>antipathy, </I>and fell into a
swoon when he felt the odour of roses; Marshal d'Albret became ill at dinner
when a young wild boar or a sucking-pig was served; Henry III. of France
could not remain in a chamber where there was a cat; Marshal de Schomberg
had the same weakness; Ladislas, King of Poland, was much disturbed at the
sight of apples; Scaliger trembled in every limb at the sight of cress; Erasmus
could not taste fish without having the fever; TychoBrahe' felt his knees
give way when he met a hare or a fox; the Duke of Epernon fainted at the
sight of a leveret; Cardan could not suffer eggs; Ariosto, baths; the son
of Croesus, bread; Caesar of Lescalle, the sound of the vielle or violin.
<P>
The causes of these <I>antipathies </I>are sometimes to be found in childish
impressions. A lady who was very fond of pictures and engravings, fainted
away when she found them in a book. She explained her terror thus When she
was a child her father had one day seen her turning over the leaves of the
books in his library, in search of pictures. He had roughly taken the book
from her hand, telling her in terrible tones that there were devils in these
books, who would strangle her if she dared to touch them. These absurd threats
occasionally have baneful effects that cannot be overcome. Pliny, who was
fairly credulous, assures us that there is such an <I>antipathy </I>between
the wolf and the horse, that if a horse pass by the way a wolf has gone,
he feels his legs become so numbed that he cannot walk. But the instinct
of animals does not err. A horse in America could detect the presence of
a puma, and obstinately refused to go through a forest where his keen sense
of smell announced to him that the enemy was at hand. Dogs also can tell
when a wolf is near. Perhaps, on the whole, human beings would be wiser if
they followed the dictates of these sympathetic or antipathetic impressions.

Apepi, Book of overthrowing of <B>:</B> An Egyptian work which formed a
considerable portion of the funerary papyrus of Nesi-Amsu. It deals with
the diurnal combat between Ra, the Sun-God, and <I>Apepi, </I>the great serpent,
the impersonation of spiritual evil, and several of the chapters, notably
<B>31</B>, <B>33</B>, and <B>35</B> to <B>39</B> are obviously borrowed from
the <I>Book of the Dead </I>(q.v.). It contains fifteen chapters, in which
there is a great deal of repetition, and details the various methods for
the destruction of <I>Apepi, </I>including many magical directions. It is
set forth that the name of <I>Apepi </I>must be written in green on a papyrus
and then burnt. Wax figures of his attendant fiends were to be made, mutilated,
and burnt, in the hope that through the agency of sympathetic magic their
prototypes might be injured or destroyed. Another portion of the work details
the creative process and describes how men and women were formed from the
tears of the god Khepera. This portion is known as <I>The Book of Knowing

however, is known. The funeral papyrus in which it is contained was discovered

Apollonius of Tyana <B>:</B> A Neo-Pythagorean philosopher of Greece, who
had a great reputation for magical powers. Born at Tyana, in Asia Minor,
<I>Apollonlus </I>was contemporary with Christ. He was educated at Tarsus
and at the Temple of AEsculapius, at AEgae, where he became an adherent of
the sect of Pythagoras, to whose strict discipline he submitted himself
throughout his life. In his desire for knowledge he travelled widely in Eastern
countries, and is said to have performed miracles wherever he went. At Ephesus,
for instance, he warned the people of the approach of a terrible plague,
but they gave no heed to him until the pestilence was actually in their midst,
when they bethought them of the warning, and summoned the potent magician
who had uttered it. <I>Apollonius </I>pointed out to the people a poor, maimed
beggar, whom he denounced as the cause of the pestilence and an enemy of
the gods, bidding them stone the unfortunate wretch to death. The citizens
were at first reluctant to comply with so cruel an injunction, but something
in the expression of the beggar confirmed the prophet's accusation, and the
wretch was soon covered with a mound of stones. When the stones were removed
no man was visible, but a huge black dog, the cause of the plague, which
had come upon the Ephesians. At Rome he raised from death &amp;ndash; or
apparent death-his biographer does not seem to know which &amp;ndash; a young
lady of consular family, who had been betrothed, and was lamented by the
entire city. Yet another story relates how <I>Apollonius </I>saved a friend
of his, Menippus of Corinth, from marrying a vampire. The youth neglected
all the earlier warnings of his counsellor, and the preparations for the
wedding proceeded till finally all was in readiness for the ceremony. At
this juncture <I>Apollonius </I>appeared on the scene, caused the wedding
feast, the guests, and all the evidences of wealth, which were but illusion
to vanish, and wrung from the bride the confession that she was a vampire.
Many other similar tales are told of the philosopher's clairvoyant and magical
powers.
<P>
The manner of his death is wrapped in mystery, though be is known to have
lived to be nearly a hundred years of age. His disciples did not hesitate
to say that he had not died at all, but had been caught up to heaven, and
his biographer casts a doubt upon the matter. At all events, when he had
vanished from the terrestial sphere, the inhabitants of his native Tyana
built a temple in his honour, and statues were raised to him in various other
temples.
<P>
A life of <I>Apollonius, </I>written by Philostratus at the instance of Julia,
mother of the Emperor Severus, is the only extant source of information
concerning the sage, though other lives, now lost, are known to have existed.
The account given by Philostratus purports to have been compiled from the
memoirs of "Damis the Assyrian," a disciple of <I>Apollonius, </I>but it
has been suggested that Damis is but a literary fiction. the work is largely
a romance; fictitious stories are often introduced, and the whole account
is mystical and symbolical. Nevertheless it is possible to get a glimpse
of the real character of <I>Apollonius </I>beyond the literary artifices
<B>6</B>f the writer. The purpose of the philosopher of Tyana seems to have
been to infuse into paganism a morality more practical combined with a more
transcendental doctrine. He himself practised a very severe asceticism, and
supplemented his own knowledge by revelations from the gods. Because of his
claim to divine enlightenment, some would have refused him a place among
the philosophers but Philostratus holds that this in no wise detracts from
his philosophic reputation. Pythagoras and Plato and Democritus he points
out, were wont to visit Eastern sages, even as <I>Apollonius </I>had done,
and they were not charged with dabbling in magic. Divine revelations had
been given to earlier philosophers; why not also to the Philosopher of Tyana?
It is probable that <I>Apollonius </I>borrowed considerably from Oriental
sources, and that his doctrines were more Brahminical than magical.

Apparitions <B>:</B> An <I>apparition </I>(from Latin <I>apparere, </I>to
appear) is in its literal sense merely an appearance, that is. a sense-percept
of any kind, but in every-day usage the word has a more restricted meaning
and is used only to denote an abnormal or super-abnormal appearance or percept,
which cannot be referred to any natural objective cause. Taken in this sense
the word covers all visionary appearances, hallucinations, clairvoyance,
and similar unusual perceptions. <I>"Apparition " </I>and ' ghost" are frequently
used as synonymous terms, though the former is, of course, of much wider
significance. A ghost is a visual <I>apparition </I>of a deceased human being.
and the term implies that it is the spirit of the person it represents
<I>Apparitions </I>of animals and of inanimate objects are also sufficiently
frequent. All <I>apparitions </I>do not take the form of visual images; auditory
and tactile false perceptions, though less common, are not unknown, and there
is record of a house that was "haunted" with the perpetual odour of violets.
<P>
<I></I>
<P>
Evolution of the Belief in Apparitions -There is no doubt that the belief
which identifies an <I>apparition </I>with the spirit of the creature it
represents a belief widely current in all nations and all time - is directly
traceable to the ancient doctrine of animism, which endowed everything in
nature, from man himself to the smallest insect, from the heavenly bodies
to an insignificant plant or stone, with a separable soul. It is not difficult
to understand how the conception of souls may have arisen. Sir J. Frazer,
in his <I>Golden Bough, </I>says<B>:</B> "As the savage commonly explains
the processes of inanimate nature by supposing that they are produced by
living beings working in or behind the phenomena, so he explains the phenomena
of life itself. If an animal lives and moves, it can only be, he thinks,
because there is a little animal inside which moves it. If a man lives and
moves, it can only he because he has a little man or animal inside, who moves
him. The animal inside the animal, the man inside the man, is the soul. And
as the activity of an animal or man is explained by the presence of the soul,
so the repose of sleep or death is explained by its absence; sleep or trance
being the temporary, death being the permanent absence of the soul." Sometimes
the human soul was represented as a bird - an eagle, a dove, a raven-or as
an animal of some sort, just as the soul of a river might be in the form
of a horse or a serpent, or the soul of a tree in human shape; but among
most peoples the belief was that the soul was an exact reproduction of the
body resembling it in every feature, even to details of dress, etc. Thus,
when a man saw another in dream, it was thought either that the soul of the
dreamer had visited the person dreamed of, or that the soul of the latter
had visited the dreamer. By an easy process of reasoning, the theory was
extended to include dreams of animals and inanimate things, which also were
endowed with souls. And thus it is quite probable that the hallucinations
with which primitive peoples as well as those at a later stage of culture
were at times visited, and which they doubtless knew well how to induce,
should be regarded as the souls of the things they represent. If it be granted
that telepathy and clairvoyance operate sometimes at the present day, and
among civilised peoples, it may be conceded on still more abundant testimony
that they were known to primitive races. And it is obvious that these faculties
would have a powerful effect in the development of a belief in <I>apparitions.
</I>The <I>apparition </I>of a deceased person, again, would inevitably suggest
the continuance of the soul's existence beyond the grave, and the <I>apparition
</I>of a sick person, or one in some other grave crisis - such as might
now-a-days be accounted for telepathically-would also be regarded as the
soul, which at such times was absent from the body. There is a widely diffused
opinion that ghosts are of a filmy, unsubstantial nature, and this also would
seem to have taken its rise in the first animistic concepts of primitive
man. At a very early stage of culture we find <I>spirit </I>and <I>breath
</I>confused-they are identified in the Latin <I>spiritus </I>and the Greek
<I>pneuma. </I>as well as in other languages. How natural it is, therefore,
that the breath, condensed in the cold air to a white mist, should be regarded
as the stuff that ghosts are made of. On another hypothesis, the shadowy
nature of the ghost may have resulted from an early confusion of the soul
with the shadow. Thus animistic ideas of the soul have given rise to the
belief in <I>apparitions. </I>But animism has a further contribution to make
towards this belief in the host of spirits which have not, and never have
had, bodies, true supernatural beings, as distinct from soul-gods, elementary
spirits, and those evil spirits to which were attributed disease, disaster,
possession, and bewitchment. This class of beings has evolved into the fairies,
elves, brownies, bogies, and goblins of popular folklore, of which many
<I>apparitions </I>are recorded.
<P>
<I></I>
<P>
Savage Instances of Apparitions. In classic and medieval times the concept
of the ghost was practically identical with that of savage peoples. It is
only within the last two generations that scientific investigation was deemed
necessary, as the result of the birth of a scepticism hitherto confined to
the few, and in the general mind weak or non-existent. (For details of such
research <I>see </I>Spiritualism and Psychical Research.) One of the most
noteworthy
<P>
features of ghosts in savage lands is the fear and antagonism with which
they are regarded. Almost invariably the spirits of the deceased are thought
to be unfriendly towards the living, desirous of drawing the souls of the
latter, or their shadows, into the spirit-world. Sometimes, as with the
Australian aborigines, they are represented as malignant demons. Naturally,
everything possible is done to keep the ghost at a distance from the habitation
of the living. With some peoples thorn bushes are planted round the beds
of the surviving relatives. Persons returning from a funeral pass through
a cleft tree, or other narrow aperture, to free themselves from the ghost
of him whom they have buried. Others plunge into water to achieve the same
purpose. The custom of closing the eyes of the dead is said to have arisen
from the fear that the ghost would find its way back again, and the same
reason is given for the practice, common among Hottentots, Hindus, North
American Indians, and many other peoples, of carrying the dead out through
a hole in the wall, the aperture being immediately afterwards closed. The
Mayas of Yucatan, however, draw a line with chalk from the tomb to the hearth,
so that the soul may return if it desires to do so. Among uncultured races,
the names of the departed, in some mysterious manner bound up with the soul,
if not identified with it, are not mentioned by the survivors, and any among
them possessing the same name, changes it for another. The shape in which
<I>apparitions </I>appear among savages may be the human form, or the form
of a beast, bird, or fish. Animal ghosts are common among the Indians of
North and South America. Certain African tribes believe that the souls of
evil-doers become jackals on the death of the body. The Tapuya Indians of
Brazil think that the souls of the good enter into birds, and this belief
is of rather wide diffusion. When the <I>apparition </I>is in human shape
it is generally an exact counterpart of the person it represents, and, like
the <I>apparitions </I>of more civilised countries, its dress is that worn
by the deceased in his lifetime. This last feature, of course, implies the
doctrine of object-souls, which has its roots in animism. Though it is generally
accepted by savage peoples that the shades of the departed mingle with the
living, coming and going with no particular object in view, yet the <I>revenant
</I>may on occasion have a special purpose in visiting the scene of his earthly
life. It may be that the spirit desires that its body be buried with the
proper ceremonial rites, if these have been omitted. In savage, as in civilised
countries, it is believed that the spirits of those who have not been buried
at all, cannot have any rest till the rite has been duly performed. In China,
the commonest ghost is that of a person who has been murdered, and who seeks
to be avenged on his murderer. The spirit of one who has been murdered, or
has died a violent death, is considered in Australia also to be especially
likely to walk abroad, while in many barbarous or, semi-barbarous lands the
souls of women who have died in childbirth, are supposed to become spirits
of a particularly malignant type, dwelling in trees, tormenting and molesting
passers-by. There is another reason for which <I>apparitions </I>sometimes
appear<B>:</B> to reveal the site of hidden treasure. The guardians of buried
hoards are, however, supernatural beings rather than human souls, and the
shapes they take are often grotesque or terrible. It is customary for ghosts
to haunt certain localities. The favourite spot seems to be the burial-place,
of which there is an almost universal superstitious dread; but the Indians
of Guiana go a step farther in maintaining that every place where anyone
has died is haunted. Among the Kaffirs and the Maoris of New Zealand a hut
wherein a death has occurred is taboo, and is often burnt or deserted. Sometimes,
even a whole village is abandoned on account of a death-a practice, this,
which must be attended with some inconvenience. There is one point on which
the <I>apparitions </I>of primitive peoples differ from those of more advanced
races-the former seldom attain to the dignity of articulate human speech.
They chirp like crickets, for instance, among the Algonquin Indians, and
their', voices are only intelligible to the trained ear of the shaman. The
ghosts of the Zulus and New Zealanders, again, speak to the magicians in
thin, whistling tones. This idea of the semi-articulate nature of ghosts
is not confined to savage concepts; Shakespeare speaks of "the sheeted dead,"
who, "did squeak and gibber in the streets of Rome," and the "gibbering"
ghost appears in other connections. Naturally the articulate <I>apparition
</I>is doubly convincing, since it appeals to two separate senses. Dr. Tylor
says<B>:</B>
<P>
"Men who perceive evidently that souls do talk when they present themselves
in dream or vision, naturally take for granted at once the objective reality
of the ghostly voice, and of the ghostly form from which it proceeds." Spirits
which are generally invisible may appear to certain persons and under certain
circumstances. Thus in the Antilles, it is believed that one person travelling
alone may see a ghost which would be invisible to a number of people. The
shamans, or medicine-men, and magicians are able to perceive <I>apparitions
</I>which none but they can see. The induction of hallucinations by means
of fasts, rigid asceticism, solitude, the use of narcotics and intoxicants,
dances, and the performing of elaborate ceremonial rites is known all over
the world, and among uncultured as well as cultured peoples. Coincidental
<I>apparitions, </I>it may be remarked <I>en passant, </I>are comparatively
rare in savage countries. Naturally, a great many savage instances of
<I>apparitions </I>are concerned with supernatural beings other than human
souls. but such cases are dealt with elsewhere.

Ancient and Modern Ideas Concerning Apparitions. The belief in <I>apparitions
</I>was very vivid among ancient Oriental peoples. The early Hebrews attributed
them to angels, demons, or the souls of the dead, as is shown in the numerous
Scriptural instances of <I>apparitions. </I>Dreams were re<I>garded as
apparitions </I>if the predictions made in them were fulfilled, or if the
dream-figure revealed anything unknown to the dreamer which afterwards proved
to be true. That the Hebrews believed in the possibility of the souls of
the dead returning, is evident from the tale of the Witch of Endor. Calmet
says, in this connection "Whether Samuel was raised up or not, whether his
soul, or only a shadow, or even nothing at all appeared to the woman, it
is still certain that Saul and his attendants, with the generality of the
Hebrews, believed the thing to be possible." Similar beliefs were held by
other Eastern nations. Among the Greeks and Romans of the classic period.
<I>apparitions </I>of gods and men would seem to have been fairly common.
Calmet, in his <I>Dissertation on Apparitions, </I>says<B>:</B>
<P>
"The ancient Greeks, who had derived their religion and theology from the
Egyptians and Eastern nations, and the Latins, who had borrowed theirs from
the Greeks, were all firmly persuaded that the souls of the dead appeared
some-times to the living - that they could be called up by
<P>
necromancers, that they answered questions, and gave notice of future events;
that Apollo gave oracles, and that the priestess, filled with his spirit,
and transported with a holy enthusiasm, uttered infallible predictions of
things to come. Homer, the most ancient of all the Greek writers, and their
greatest divine, relates several <I>apparitions, </I>not only of gods, but
of dead men and heroes. In the Odyssey, he introduces Ulysses consulting
Teresias, who, having prepared a pit full of blood, in order to call up the
Manes, Ulysses draws his sword to hinder them from drinking the blood for
which they were very thirsty, till they had answered the questions proposed
to them. It was also a prevailing opinion, that the souls of men enjoyed
no repose, but wandered about near their carcasses as long as they continued
unburied. Even after they were buried, it was a custom to offer them something
to eat, especially honey, upon the supposition that after having left their
graves, they came to feed upon what was brought them. They believed also,
that the demons were fond of the smoke of sacrifices, of music, of the blood
of victims, and the commerce of women; and that they were confined for a
determinate time to certain houses or other places, which they haunted, and
in which they appeared.
<P>
"They held that souls, when separated from their gross and terrestial bodies,
still retained a finer and more subtle body, of the same form with that which
they had quitted that these bodies were luminous like the stars; that they
retained an inclination for the things which they had loved in their life-time,
and frequently appeared about their graves. When the soul of Patroclus appeared
to. Achilles, it had his voice, his shape, his eyes, and his dress, but not
the same tangible body. Ulysses relates, that when he went down into hell,
he saw the <I>divine Hercules, </I>that is, adds he, <I>his image j for he
himself is admitted to the banquets of the immortal gods. </I>Dido says,
that after death she, that is, her image bigger than the life, shall go down
to the infernal regions.
<P>
<I></I>
<P>
'Et mine magna mei sub terras ibit imago.&amp;rsquo;
<P>
"And AEneas knew his wife Creusa, who appeared to him in her usual shape,
but of a taller and nobler stature than when she was alive.
<P>
<I></I>
<P>
"Infelix simulacrum, atque ipsius umbra Creusae, Visa miki ante oculos, et
nota major imago.
<P>
"In the speech which Titus made to his soldiers, to persuade them to mount
to the assault of the Tower Antonia at Jerusalem, he uses this
argument<B>:</B> 'Who knows not that the souls of those who bravely expose
themselves to danger, and die in war, are exalted to the stars, are there
received into the highest region of heaven, and appear as good genii to their
relations; while they who die of sickness, though they have lived good lives,
are plunged into oblivion and darkness under earth, and are no more remembered
after death, than if they had never existed."
<P>
Again he says'
<P>
"We find that Origen, Tertullian, and St. Irenaus, were clearly of this opinion.
Origen, in his second book against Celsus, relates and subscribes to the
opinion of Plato, who says. that the shadows and images of the dead, which
are seen near sepulchres, are nothing but the soul disengaged from its gross
body., but not yet entirely freed from matter; that these souls become in
time luminous, transparent, and subtle, or rather are carried in luminous
and transparent bodies, as in a vehicle, in which they appeal to the living.
. . . Tertullian, in his book concerning the soul, asserts that it is corporeal,
and of a certain figure, and appeals to the experience of those who have
seen <I>apparitions </I>of departed souls. and to whom they have appeared
as corporeal and tangible, though of an aerial colour and consistence. He
defines the soul to be,' breath from God, immortal, corporeal, and of a certain
figure."
<P>
It is interesting to note that some of these classic spectres are nearly
akin to the melodramatic conceptions of more modern times. The younger Pliny
tells of haunted houses whose main features correspond with those of later
haunting-houses haunted by dismal, chained spectres, the ghosts of murdered
men who could not rest till their mortal remains had been properly buried.
<P>
In the early centuries of the Christian era there was no diminution in the
number of <I>apparitions </I>witnessed. Visions of saints were frequently
seen. and were doubtless induced by the fasts, rigid asceticism, and severe
penances practiced in the name of religion. The saints themselves saw visions,
and were attended by guardian angels, and harassed by the unwelcome attentions
of demons, or of their master, the devil. These beliefs continued into the
Middle Ages, when, without undergoing any abatement in vigour, they began
to take on a more romantic aspect. The witch and were-wolf superstitions
were responsible for many tales of animal <I>apparitions. </I>The poltergeist
flourished in a congenial atmosphere. Vampires were terribly familiar in
Slavonic lands, and nowhere in Europe were they quite unknown. The malignant
demons, known as incubi and succubi, were no less common. In the northern
countries familiar spirits or goblins, approximating to the Roman <I>lares,
</I>or the wicked and more mischievous <I>lemures, </I>haunted the domestic
hearth, and bestowed well-meant, but not always desirable, attentions on
the families to which they attached themselves. These beings were accountable
for a vast number of <I>apparitions, </I>but the spirits of the dead also
walked abroad in the Dark Ages. Generally they wished to unburden their minds
of some weighty secret which hindered them from resting in their graves.
The criminal came to confess his guilt, the miser to reveal the spot where
he had hidden his gold. The cowled monk walked the dim aisles of a monastery,
or haunted the passages of some Rhenish castle, till the prayers of the devout
had won release for his tortured soul. Perchance, a maiden in white flitted
through the corridor of some old mansion, moaning and wringing her hands,,
enacting in pantomime some long-forgotten tragedy. At the cross-roads lingered
the ghost of the poor suicide, uncertain which way to take. The old belief
in the dread potency of the unburied dead continued to exercise sway. There
is, for example, the German story of the Bleeding Nun. Many and ghastly had
been her crimes during her lifetime, and finally she was murdered by one
of her paramours, her body being left unburied. The castle wherein she was
slain became the scene of her nocturnal wanderings. It is related that a
young woman who wished to elope with her lover decided to disguise herself
as this ghostly spectre in order to facilitate their escape. But the unfortunate
lover eloped with the veritable Bleeding Nun herself, mistaking her for his
mistress. This, and other traditional <I>apparitions, </I>such as the Wild
Huntsman, the Phantom Coach. the Flying Dutchman, which were not confined
to any one locality, either originated in this period or acquired in it a
wildly romantic character which lent itself to treatment by ballad-writers,
and it is in ballad form that many of them have come down to us.
<P>
This hey-day of the <I>apparition </I>passed however, at length, and in the
eighteenth century we find among the cultured classes a scepticism as regards
the objective nature of <I>apparitions, </I>which was destined two centuries
later to become almost universal. Hallucination, though not yet very well
understood, began to be called the" power of imagination." Many <I>apparitions,
</I>too, were attributed to illusion Nevertheless, the belief in <I>apparitions
</I>was sustained and strengthened by the clairvoyant powers of magnetic
subjects and somnambules Swedenborg, who had, and still has many disciples,
did much to encourage the idea that <I>apparitions </I>were objective and
supernatural. To explain the fact that only the seer saw these beings and
heard their voices, he says<B>:</B>
<P>
"The speech of an angel or of a spirit with man is heard as sonorousiy as
the speech of one man with another<B>:</B> yet it is not heard by others
who stand near, but by the man himself alone. The reason is, the speech of
an angel or of a spirit flows in first into the man's thought, and by an
internal way into the organ of hearing. and thus actuates it from within,
whereas the speech of man flows first into the air, and by an external way
into the organ of hearing which it actuates from without. Hence, it is evident,
that the speech of an angel and of a spirit with man is heard in man, and,
since it equally affects the organ of hearing, that it is equally sonorous."
<P>
Thus it will be seen that ancient and modern ideas on <I>apparitions </I>differ
very little in essential particulars, though they take colour from the race
and time to which they belong. Now they are thin, gibbering shadows; now
they are solid, full-bodied creatures, hardly to be distinguished from real
flesh and blood; again they are rich in romantic accessories; but the laws
which govern their appearance are the same, and the beliefs concerning them
are not greatly different, in whatever race or age they may be found.

<P>
Present Day Theories Concerning Apparitions. - At the present time
<I>apparitions </I>are generally, though by no means universally, referred
to hallucination (q.v.) Even those who advance a spiritualistic theory of
<I>apparitions </I>frequently incline to this view, for it is argued that
the discarnate intelligence may, by psychical energy alone, produce in the
brain of a living person a definite hallucination, corresponding perhaps
to the agent's appearance in life. Hallucinations may be either coincidental
or non-coincidental. The former, also known as <I>telepathic hallucinations,
</I>are those which coincide with a death, or with some other crisis in the
life of the person represented by the hallucination. The Society for Psychical
Research has been instrumental in collecting numerous instances of coincidental
hallucinations, many of which are recorded in <I>Phantasms of the Living,
</I>by Messrs. Myers, Podmore and Gurney. Mr. Podmore was indeed the chief
exponent of the telepathic theory of ghosts <I>for which see also
</I>Telepathy) which he had adopted after many years of research and experiment.
He suggested that <I>apparitions r</I>esult from a telepathic impression
conveyed from the mind of one living person to that of another, an impression
which may be doubly intense in time of stress or exalted emotion, or at the
moment of dissolution. <I>Apparitions </I>of the dead he would account for
by a theory of <I>latent impressions, </I>conveyed to the mind of the percipient
during the agent's lifetime, but remaining dormant until some particular
train of thought rouses them to activity. This view is largely supported
at the present day. Hallucinations, whether coincidental or otherwise, may,
and do present themselves to persons who are perfectly sane and normal, but
they are also a feature of insanity, hypnotism and hysteria, and of certain
pathological conditions of brain, nerves, and sense organs. The late Mr.
Myers was of opinion that an <I>apparition </I>represented an actual "psychic
invasion," that it was a projection of some of the agent's psychic force,
Such a doctrine is, as Mr. Myers himself admitted, a reversion to animism.
There is another modern theory of <I>apparitions, </I>particularly applicable
to haunted houses. This is the theory of psychometry (q.v.). Sir Oliver Lodge,
in his <I>Man and the Universe, </I>says<B>:</B>
<P>
"Occasionally a person appears able to respond to stimuli embedded, as it
were among psycho-physical surroundings in a manner at present ill understood
and almost incredible <B>:</B> - as if strong emotions could be unconsciously
recorded in matter, so that the deposit shall thereafter affect a sufficiently
sensitive organism, and cause similar emotions to reproduce themselves in
its sub-consciousness, in a manner analogous to the customary conscious
interpretation of photographic or phonographic records. and indeed of pictures
or music and artistic embodiment generally."
<P>
Take, for example, a haunted house of the traditional Christmas-number type.
wherein some one room is the scene of a ghostly representation of some long
past tragedy. On a psychometric hypothesis the original tragedy has been
literally <I>photographed </I>on its material surroundings, nay, even on
the ether itself, by reason of the intensity of emotion felt by those who
enacted it; and thenceforth in certain persons an hallucinatory effect is
experienced cur-responding to such impression, It is this theory which is
made to account for the feeling one has on entering certain rooms, that there
is an alien presence therein, though it be invisible and inaudible to mortal
sense. The doctrine of psychometry in its connection with <I>apparitions
</I>is of considerable interest because of its wide possibilities, but it
belongs to the region of romance rather than to that of science, and is hardly
to be considered as a serious theory of <I>apparitions </I>at least, until
it is supported by better evidence than its protagonists can show at present.
<P>
Spiritualistic theories of <I>apparitions </I>also vary, though they agree
in referring such appearances to discarnate intelligences, generally to the
spirits of the dead. The opinion of some spiritualistic authorities is, as
has been said, that the surviving spirit produces in the mind of the percipient,
by purely psychic means, an hallucination representing his (the agent's)
former bodily appearance. Others believe that the discarnate spirit can
<I>materialize </I>by taking to itself ethereal particles from the external
world, and thus build up a temporary physical organism through which it can
communicate with the living. Still others consider that the materialised
spirit borrows such temporary physical organism from that of the medium,
and experiments have been made to prove that the medium loses weight during
the materialisation. <I>(See </I>Materialisation.) The animistic belief that
the soul itself can become visible is not now generally credited, since it
is thought that pure spirit cannot be perceptible to the physical senses.
But a compromise has been made in the' psychic body,' (q.v.), midway between
soul and body, which some spiritualists consider clothes the soul at the
dissolution of the physical body. The psychic body is composed of material
particles, very fine and subtle, and perceptible as a rule, only to the eye
of the clairvoyant. It is this, and not the spirit which is seen as an
<I>apparition. </I>We must not overlook the theory held by some Continental
investigators, that
<P>
spirit "materialisations " so-called are manifestations of psychic force
emanating from the medium.
<P>
<I>Different Classes of Apparitions.-Many </I>of the various classes of
<I>apparitions </I>having been considered above, and others being dealt with
under their separate headings, it is hardly necessary to do more than enumerate
them here. <I>Apparitions </I>may be divided broadly into two classes induced
and spontaneous. To the former class belong hypnotic and post-hypnotic
hallucinations <I>(see </I>Hypnotism) and visions (q.v.) induced by the use
of narcotics and intoxicants, fasts, ascetic practices, incense, narcotic
salves, and auto-hypnotisation. The hallucinatory appearances seen in the
mediumistic or somnambulistic trance are, of course, allied to those of
hypnotism, but usually arise spontaneously, and are often associated with
clairvoyance (q.v.). Crystallomancy (q.v.) or crystal vision is a form of
<I>apparition </I>which is stated to be frequently clairvoyant, and in this
case the theory of telepathy is especially applicable. Crystal visions fail
under the heading of induced <I>apparitions, </I>since gazing in a crystal
globe induces in some persons a species of hypnotism. a more or less slight
dissociation of consciousness, without which hallucination is impossible.
Another form of clairvoyance is sound sight (q.v.). a faculty common among
the Scottish Highlanders. Persons gifted with the second sight often see
symbolical <I>apparitions, </I>as, for instance, the vision of a funeral
or a coffin when a death is about to occur in the community. Symbolical
appearances are indeed a feature of clairvoyance and visions generally.
Clairvoyance includes retrocognition and premonition-visions of the past
and the future respectively-as well as <I>apparitions </I>of contemporary
events happening at a distance. Clairvoyant powers are often attributed to
the dying. Dreams are, strictly speaking, <I>apparitions. </I>but in ordinary
usage the term is applied only to coincidental or veridical dreams, or to
those visions of the night," which are of peculiar vividness.
<P>
From these subjective <I>apparitions </I>let us turn to the ghost proper.
The belief in ghosts has come to us, as has been indicated, from the remotest
antiquity, and innumerable theories have been formulated to account for it,
from the primitive animistic conception of the <I>apparition </I>as a" actual
soul to the modern theories enumerated above, of which the chief are telepathy
and spirit materialisation. <I>Apparitions </I>of the living also offer a
wide field for research. perhaps the most favoured hypothesis at the present
day being that of the telepathic hallucination. A peculiarly weird type of
<I>apparition </I>is the wraith (q.v.) or double, of which the Irish fetch
is a variant. The wraith is an exact facsimile of a living person, who may
himself see it; Goethe, Shelley, and other famous men are said to have seen
their own wraiths. The fetch makes its appearance shortly before the death
of the person it represents. either to himself or his friends, or both. Another
Irish spirit which foretells death is the banshee (q.v.), a being which attaches
itself to certain ancient families, and is regularly seen or heard before
the death of one of its members. To the same class belong the omens of death,
in the form of certain animals or birds, which follow some families. Hauntings
or localised <I>apparitions </I>are dealt with under the heading Haunted
Houses." The poltergeist (q.v.), whose playful manifestations must certainly
be included among <I>apparitions, </I>suggests another classification of
these as visual, auditory, tactile, etc., since poltergeist hauntings - or
indeed hauntings of any kind-are not confined to <I>apparitions </I>touching
any one sense. For <I>apparitions </I>of fairies, brownies, and others of
the creatures of folk-lore, <I>see </I>Fairies.
<P>
In this article an attempt has been made to show as briefly as possible the
universality of the belief in <I>apparitions, </I>and the varied forms under
which this belief exhibits itself in various times and countries among savage
and civilised peoples; and-to indicate the basic principles on which it rest
- namely, the existence of a spiritual world capable of manifesting itself
in the sphere of matter, and the survival of the human soul after the dissolution
of the body. While the beliefs in this connection of savage races and of
Europeans in early and medieval times may arouse interest and curiosity for
their own sakes, the scientific investigator of the present day values them
chiefly as throwing light on modern beliefs. The belief in <I>apparitions
</I>is a root principle of spiritualism. Many who are not spiritualists in
the accepted sense have had experiences which render the belief in
<I>apparitions </I>almost inevitable. A subject which touches so nearly a
considerable percentage of the community, including many people of culture
and education, and concerning which there is a vast quantity of evidence
extending back into antiquity, cannot be a matter of indifference to science,
and the investigations made by scientific men within recent years arouse
surprise that such investigation has been so long delayed. The Society for
Psychical Research has gathered many well attested instances of coincidental
<I>apparitions, </I>clairvoyance, and <I>apparitions </I>of the dead. As
yet, however, the problem remains unsolved, and the various hypotheses advanced
are conflicting and sometimes obscure. The theory of telepathic hallucination
offered by Mr. Podmore seems on the whole to be the most conformable to known
natural laws, while at the same time covering the ground with fair completeness.
But perhaps the best course to take at the present stage of our knowledge
is to suspend judgment in the meanwhile, until further light has been cast
on the subject.

Apports <B>:</B> The name given to various objects, such as flowers, jewellery,
and even live animals, materialised in the presence of a medium. The production
of these <I>apports </I>have always been, and still are, one of the most
prominent and effective features of spiritualistic seances. Sometimes they
fly through the air and strike the faces of the sitters; sometimes they appear
on the table, or in the laps of those present. A favourite form is the scattering
of perfume on the company. Recent systematic experiments conducted in a purely
scientific spirit have exposed fraud in numerous instances where ordinary
precautions would not have sufficed for its detection. Frequently it has
been found that the medium had skillfully concealed the <I>apports </I>in
the room or about her person. Nevertheless, though the result is often produced
by obviously unscrupulous means, it does not follow that all materialisations
are performed with fraudulent intent. In cases where, so far as can be judged,
the character of the medium is beyond reproach. as in the case of Helene
Smith, the idea has been advanced that any preparations made beforehand,
such as the secreting of flowers, etc., must result from a process of activity
of the subliminal consciousness. Other explanations are, that the <I>apports
</I>are actually conveyed to the seance by spirits, or that they are drawn
thither by magnetic power. Branches of trees, armfuls of fruit and flowers,
money, jewels, and live lobsters are among the more extraordinary <I>op
ports.</I>

Aquinas (Thomas) who has been under the imputation of magic, was one of the
profoundest scholars and subtlest logicians of his day. He was a youth of
illustrious birth, and received the rudiments of his education under the
monks of Monte Cassino, and in the University of Naples. But. not contented
with these advantages, he secretly entered himself in the Society of Preaching
Friars, or Dominicans, at seventeen years of age. His mother, being indignant
that he should thus take the vow of poverty, and sequester himself from the
world for life, employed every means in her power to induce him to alter
his purpose, but all in vain. The friars, to deliver him from her importunities,
removed him from Naples to Terracina, from Terracina to Anagnia, and from
Anagnia to Rome. His mother followed him in all these changes of residence,
but was not permitted so much as to see him. At length she induced his two
elder brothers to seize him by force. They waylaid him on his road to Paris,
whether he was sent to complete his course of instruction, and carried him
off to. the castle of Aquino, where he had been born. Here he was confined
for two years, but he found a way to correspond with the superiors of his
order, and finally escaped from a window in the castle. <I>St. Thomas Aquinas
</I>(for he was canonised after his death) exceeded perhaps all men that
ever existed in the severity and strictness of his metaphysical disquisitions,
and thus acquired the name of the Seraphic Doctor.
<P>
It was to be expected that a man, who thus immersed himself in the depths
of thought, should be an enemy to noise and interruption. He dashed to pieces
an artificial man of brass that Albertus Magnus, who was his tutor, had spent
thirty years in bringing to perfection, being impelled to this violence by
its perpetual and unceasing garrulity. It is further said, that his study
being placed in a great thoroughfare, where the grooms were all day long
exercising their horses, he found it necessary to apply a remedy to this
nuisance. He made by the laws of magic a small horse of brass, which he buried
two or three feet under ground in the midst of this highway, and, having
done so, no horse would any longer pass along the road. It was in vain that
the grooms with whip and spur sought to conquer the animals' repugnance.
They were finally compelled to give up the attempt, and to choose another
place for their daily exercises.
<P>
It has further been sought to fix the imputation of magic upon <I>Thomas
Aquinas by </I>referring to him certain book" written on that science; but
these are now acknowledged to be spurious.

Arabs <B>:</B> The heyday of occultism among the Arab race was reached at
the epoch when that division of them known as the Moors established their
empire in the Spanish peninsula.
<P>
We first emerge from cloud and shadow into a precise and definite region
in the eighth century, when an Arabian mystic revived the dreams and speculations
of the alchemists, and discovered some important secrets. Geber (q.v.), who
flourished about <B>720</B>-<B>750</B>, is reputed to have written upwards
of five hundred works upon the Philosophers' Stone and <I>elixir vitae. </I>His
researches after these desiderata proved fruitless, but if he did not bestow
upon mankind immortal life and boundless wealth, he gave them nitrate of
silver, corrosive sublimate, red oxide of mercury, and. nitric acid.
<P>
Among his tenets were a belief that a preparation of gold would heal all
diseases in animals and plants, as well as in human beings; that the metals
were affected with maladies, except the pure, supreme, and precious one of
gold<B>:</B> and that the Philosophers' Stone had often been discovered,.
but that its fortunate discoverers would not reveal the secret to blind,
incredulous, and unworthy man.
<P>
His <I>Summa Perfectionis-a </I>manual for the alchemical student-has been
frequently translated. A curious English version, of which there is a copy
in the British Museum, was published by an English enthusiast, one Richard
Russell, at "the Star, in New Market, in Wapping, near the Dock," in
<B>1586</B>. Geber's true name was Abon Moussah Djafar, to which was added
Al Sofi, or "The Wise," and he was a native of Houran, in Mesopotamia.
<P>
He was followed by Avicenna (q.v.), Averroes (q.v.} and others equally gifted
and fortunate.
<P>
According to Geber and his successors the metals were not only compound
creatures, but they were also all composed of the same two substances. Both
Prout and Davy lent their names to ideas not unlike this. "The improvements,"
says the latter. "taking place in the methods of examining bodies, are constantly
changing the opinions of chemists with respect to their nature, and there
is no reason to suppose that any real indestructible principle has yet been
discovered. Matter may ultimately be found to be the same in essence, differing
only in the arrangement of its particles; or two or three simple substances
may produce all the varieties of compound bodies." The ancient ideas, therefore,
of Demetrius the Greek physicist, and of Geber, the Arabian polypharmist,
are still hovering about the horizon of chemistry.
<P>
The Arabians taught, in the third place, that the metals are composed of
mercury and sulphur in different proportions. They toiled away at the art
of making many medicines out of the various mixtures and reactions of the
few chemicals at their command. They believed in transmutation, but they
did not strive to effect it. It belonged to their creed rather than to their
practice. They were a race of hard-working, scientific artisans, with their
pestles and mortars, their crucibles and furnaces, their alembics and aludels,
their vessels for infusion, for decoction, for cohobation, sublimation, fixation,
lixiviation, filtration and coagulation. They believed in transmutation,
in the first matter, and in the correspondence of the metals with the planets,
to say nothing of potable gold.
<P>
Whence the Arabians derived the sublimer articles of their scientific faith,
is not known to any European historian. Perhaps they were the conjectures
of their ancestors according to the faith. Perhaps they had them from the
Fatimites of Northern Africa, among whose local predecessors it has been
seen that it is just possible the doctrine of the four elements and their
mutual convertibility may have arisen. Perhaps they drew them from Greece,
modifying and adapting them to their own specific forms of matter, mercury,
sulphur and arsenic.

Astrology.-Astrology was also employed by the oracles of Spain<B>:</B>
<I>Albatgni </I>was celebrated for his astronomical science, as were many
others; and in geometry, arithmetic, algebraical calculations and the theory
of music, we have a long list, Asiatic and Spanish, but only known by their
lives and principal writings. The works of Ptolemy also exercised the ingenuity
of the Arabians; while Alchindi, as far. as we may be allowed to judge from
his multifarious, volumes, traversed the whole circle - of the sublimer sciences.
But judicial astrology, or the art of foretelling future events from the
position and influences of the stars, was with them a favourite pursuit;
and many of their philosophers, incited by various motives, dedicated all
their labours to this futile hut lucrative inquiry. They often speak with
high commendation of the iatro-mathematical discipline, which - could control
the disorders to which man was subject, and regulate the events of life.
<P>
The tenets of Islamism, which inculcate an unreserved submission to the
over-ruling destinies of heaven, are evidently adverse to the lessons of
astrology ; but this by no means hindered the practitioners of old <I>Spain
</I>and <I>Arabia </I>from attaining a high standard of perfection in the
art, which they perhaps first learned from the peoples of <I>Chaldaea, </I>the
past masters of the ancient world in astronomical science, in divination,
and the secrets of prophecy. But in Arab Spain, where the tenets of Islam,
were perhaps more lightly esteemed than in their original home, magic

From the Greeks. still in search of science, the <I>Arabs </I>turned their
attention to the books of the sages who are esteemed the primitive instructors
of mankind, among whom Hermes was deemed the first. They mention the works
written by him, or rather by them, as they suppose, like other authors, that
there were three of the name. To one the imposing appellation of Trismegistus
has been given; and the Arabians, from some ancient records, we may presume,
minutely describe his character and person. They also published, as illustrative
of their astrological discipline, some writings ascribed to the Persian
Zoroaster. <I>For Sorcery, etc., see </I><STRONG>Semites.</STRONG>

Arbatel <B>:</B> A magical ritual published at Basle in <B>1575</B>. The
text is in Latin, and it appears to have been influenced by Paracelsus. It
is of Christian, not Jewish origin, and although the authorship is unknown
it is probably the work of an Italian. Only one of its nine volumes has come
down to us. It deals with the institutions of magic, and is entitled
<I>Isagoge, </I>which means essential or necessary instruction. In it we
are introduced to the ritual of the Olympic spirits dwelling in the air and
among the stars, who govern the world. There are, we are told, one hundred
and ninety-six Olympic provinces in the universe<B>:</B> thus Aratron has
forty-nine, Bethor forty-two, Phaleg thirty-five, Och twenty-eight, Hagith
twenty-one, Ophiel fourteen, and Phul seven. Each of the Olympic spirits
rule alternately for four hundred and ninety years. They have natural sway
over certain departments of the material world, but outside these departments
they perform the same operations magically. Thus Och, the ruler of solar
affairs, presides over the, preparation of gold naturally in the soil. At
the same time, he presides magically over the preparation of that metal by
means of alchemy. The <I>Arbatel </I>proceeds to say that the sources of
occult wisdom are to be found in God, spiritual essences and corporeal creatures,
as well as in nature, but also in the apostate spirits and in the ministers
of punishment in Hell and the elementary spirits. The secrets of all magic
reside in these, but magicians are born, not made, although they are assisted
by contemplation and the love of God. It will be sufficient to describe the
powers and offices of one of these spirits. Aratron governs those things
which are ascribed astrologically to. Saturn. He can convert any living thing
into stone, can change coals into treasure, gives familiar spirits to men,
teaches alchemy, magic and medicine, the secret of invisibility, and long
life. He should be invoked on a Saturday in the first hour of the day. The
<I>Arbatel </I>is one of the best authorities extant on spiritual essences,
their powers and degrees.

there was a certain house which no one would inhabit, because it was haunted
by a spectre. A man named <I>Arignote, </I>well versed in the lore of the
Egyptian magical books. shut himself in the house to pass the night and began
to read peacefully in the court. Soon the spectre made its appearance, and
in order to frighten <I>Arignote, </I>it first of all took the form of a
dog, then that of a bull, and finally that of a lion. But <I>Arignote </I>was
not at all disturbed. He conjured the spectre in formulae which he found
in his books, and obliged it to retire to a corner of the court, where it
disappeared. On the following day the spot to which the spectre had retreated
was dug up, and a skeleton was found. When it was properly buried, the ghost
was not seen again. This anecdote is an adaptation of the adventure of
Athenodorus, which Lucian had read in Pliny.

Ariolists : Ancient diviners, whose special occupation was called <I>ariolatio,
</I>because they divined by means of the altars. They consulted demons on
their altars, says Dangis; they observed whether the altar trembled or performed
any marvel, and predicted what the Devil inspired them with. According to
Francois de la Tour Blanche, these people ought to have been put to death
as idolators. He based his opinion on Deuteronomy, chap. xviii., and on
Revelation, chap. xxi., where it is said that idolators and liars shall be
cast into the lake of fire and sulphur, which will be their second death.
Deuteronomy orders only the first.

Aristaeus : A charlatan who lived in the time of Croesus. He said that his

maintain that it escaped in the sight of his wife and children in the figure
of a stag. Wierius said that it took the shape of a crow. However that may
be, Herodotus relates in his fourth book that <I>Aristaeus </I>entering one
day into a fuller's shop, fell dead therein, that the fuller ran to break
the news to his parents, who came to bury him. But no corpse was to be found.
The whole town was astonished, when some men returning from a voyage assured
them that they had met <I>Aristaeus </I>on the way to Crotona. It appeared
that he was a species of vampire. Herodotus adds that he reappeared at the
end of seven years, composed a poem and died anew. Leloyer, who regarded
<I>Aristaeus </I>as a sorcerer or ecstatic, quoted a certain Apollonius,
who said that at the same hour as the vampire disappeared. for the second
time, he was transported to Sicily, where he became a schoolmaster. He is
again heard of three hundred and forty years afterwards in the town of
Metapontus, where he caused to be raised certain monuments which were to
be seen in the time of Herodotus. So many wonderful happenings inspired the.
Sicilians with awe, and they raised a temple to him and worshipped him as
a demi-god.

Arithmancy : (Sometimes called wrongly <I>Arithmomancy). </I>Divination by
means of numbers. The Greeks examined the number and value of the letters
in the names of two combatants, and predicted that he whose name contained
most letters. or letters of the greatest value. would be the victor. It was
by means of this science that some diviners foretold that Hector would be
overcome by Achilles. The Chaldeans, who also practised it, divided their
alphabet into three parts. each composed of seven letters, which they attributed
to the seven planets, in order to make predictions from them. The Platonists
and the Pythagoreans were also strongly addicted to this method of divination,

who taught his niece to become a powerful sorceress. Nature had so well endowed
her that for personal attractions she far surpassed the most beautiful women
of the East. Her uncle sent her as a worthy foe against the powerful Christian
army that Pope Urban XI. had collected under the leadership of Godfrey de
Bouillon. And there, says Delancre, she made such havoc with her beautiful
eyes, and so charmed the principal leaders of the crusaders, that she almost
ruined the hopes of the Christians. She kept the valiant knight Renaud for
a long time in an enchanted castle, and it was not without great difficulty
that he was disenchanted.

Arthur, <B>King</B> <B>:</B> The character of <I>Arthur </I>is strongly
identified with the occult. Not only do we find his Court a veritable centre
of happenings more or less supernatural, but his mysterious origin and the
subsequent events of his career have in them matter of considerable interest
from an occult standpoint. This is not the place to dispute regarding his
reality. but merely to deal with the romances which cluster around him, and
their contents from the supernatural point of view. We find him first of
all connected with one of the greatest magical names of early time - that
of Merlin the Enchanter. The possibilities are that Merlin was originally
a British deity. who in later times degenerated from his high position in
the popular imagination. We possess many accounts concerning him, one of
which states that he was the direct offspring of Satan himself, but that
a zealous priest succeeded in baptising him before his infernal parent could
carry him off. From Merlin. <I>Arthur </I>received much good advice both
magical and rational. He was present when the King was gifted with his magic
sword Excalibur, which endowed him with practical invulnerability, and all
through his career was deep in his counsels. His tragic imprisonment by the
Lady Viviana, who shut him up eternally in a rock through the agency of one
of his own spells. removed him from his sphere of activity at the Arthurian
Court, and from that time the shadows may be seen to gather swiftly around
<I>Arthur's </I>head. Innumerable are the tales concerning the Knights of
his Court who met with magical adventures, and as the stories grew older
in the popular mind, additions to these naturally became the rule. Notably
is this the case in that off-shoot of the Arthurian epic, which is known
as the Holy Grail (q.v.), in which we find the knights who go in quest of
it constantly encountered by every description of sorcery for the purpose
of retarding their progress. <I>Arthur's </I>end is as strange as his origin,
for we find him wafted away by faery hands, or at least by invisible agency,
to the Isle of Avillion, which probably is one and the same place with the
Celtic other-world across the ocean. As a legend and a tradition, that of
<I>Arthur </I>is undoubtedly the most powerful and persistent in the British
imagination. It has employed the pens and enhanced the dreams of many of
the giants in English literature from the time of Geoffrey of Monmouth, to
the present day; and with the echoes of the poetry of Tennyson and Swinburne
still ringing in their ears, the present generation is quite as justified
in regarding the history of <I>Arthur </I>as a living reality as were the
Britons of the twelfth century.

she became a medium on the death of her husband, and produced spirit-rappings

of weird manifestations occurred. Stair-rods moved after her when she went

increased in violence, and she and her roommate had a ghastly vision of a
corpse they had been dissecting in the day-time. Dr. Richmond, a sceptic

which Jesus Christ rode into Jerusalem.
<P>
Some people have found something sacred and mysterious in the innocent beast,
and there was practised formerly a species of divination in which the head
of an <I>ass </I>was employed.
<P>
At one time a special festival was held for the <I>ass, </I>during which
he was led into the church while mass was sung. This reverence in which he
was held by Christians was doubtless due to the black cross which he wears
on his back, and which, it is said, was given him because of the <I>ass </I>of
Bethphage, who carried Christ into Jerusalem. But Pliny. who was almost
contemporary with that <I>ass, </I>and who has carefully gathered all that
related to the animal, has made no mention concerning the colour of its coat
So we can only believe that the <I>ass </I>of today is as he always was.
<P>
It is not only the devout who respect the <I>ass, </I>for the wise Agrippa
offered him an apology in his book, <I>On the Vanity of the Sciences. </I>Among
the Indians of Madras, one of the principal castes, that of the Cavaravadonques,
claim to be descended from an <I>ass. </I>These Indians treat the <I>ass
</I>as a brother, take his part, and prosecute those who over-burden or ill-treat
him in any way. In rainy weather they will often give him shelter when they
deny it to his driver.
<P>
An old fable gives us but a poor idea of the <I>ass. </I>Jupiter had just
taken possession of Olympus. On his coming, men asked of him an eternal
springtime. which he accordingly granted, charging the <I>ass </I>of Silenus
to bear the precious treasure to earth. The <I>ass </I>became thirsty, and
approached a fountain guarded by a snake, who refused to let the <I>ass
</I>drink unless he parted with the treasure. The stupid animal thereupon
bartered the gift of heaven for a skin of water, and since that time snakes,
when they grow old, can change their skin and become young again, for they
have the gift of perpetual spring-time.
<P>
But all <I>asses </I>were not so stupid as that. In a village about half
a league from Cairo, there dwelt a mountebank, who possessed a highly trained
<I>ass, </I>so clever that the country people took it to be a demon in disguise.
One day the mountebank mentioned in the <I>ass's </I>hearing that the Soldan
wished to construct a beautiful building, and had resolved to employ all
the <I>asses </I>in Cairo to carry the lime, mortar and stones. The <I>ass
</I>immediately lay down and pretended to be dead. and his master begged
for money to buy another. When he had collected some he returned to his old
<I>ass. " </I>He is not dead," he said, "he only pretended to die because
he knew I had not the wherewithal to buy him food." Still the <I>ass
</I>refused to rise, and the mountebank addressed the company, telling them
that the Soldan had sent out the criers commanding the people to assemble
on the morrow outside Cairo to see the most wonderful sights in the world.
He further desired that the most gracious ladies and the most beautiful girls
should be mounted on <I>asses. </I>The <I>ass </I>raised himself and pricked
up his ears. " The governor of my quarter," added the mountebank, " has begged
me to lend my <I>ass </I>for his wife, who is old and toothless, and very
ugly." The <I>ass </I>began to limp as though he were old and lame. " Ah,
you like beautiful ladies ? " said his master. The animal bowed his head,
" Oh, well," said the man, "there are many present; show me the most beautiful."
Which command the <I>ass </I>obeyed with judgment and discretion.
<P>
These marvellous <I>asses, </I>said the demonologists, were, if not demons,
at least men metamorphosed, like Apuleius, who was, it is said, transformed
into an <I>ass. </I>Vincent de Beauvais speaks of two women who kept a little
inn near Rome, and who sold their guests at the market, after having changed
them into pigs, fowls, or sheep. One of them, he adds, changed a certain
comedian into an <I>ass, </I>and as he retained his talents under his new
skin. she led him to the fairs on the outskirts of the city. gaining much
money thereby. A neighbour bought this wise <I>ass </I>at a good price, and
in handing it over the sorcerers felt obliged to warn the purchaser not to
let the <I>ass </I>enter water. Its new master attended to the warning for
some time, but one day the poor <I>ass </I>managed to get free and cast itself
into a lake, when it regained its natural shape, to the great surprise of
its driver. The matter was brought to the ears of the Pope, who had the two
witches punished. while the comedian returned to the exercise of his profession.
<P>
Many stories are told of the <I>ass </I>which carried Jesus Christ into
Jerusalem, and which is said to have died at Verona, where its remains are
still honoured. The rabbis make quite as much ado over Balaam's <I>ass,
</I>which has already been mentioned. It is, they say, a privileged animal
whom God formed at the end of the sixth day. Abraham employed it to carry
the wood for the sacrifice of Isaac; it also carried the wife and son of
Moses in the desert. They also maintain that Balaam's <I>ass </I>is carefully
nourished and kept in a secret place until the coming of the Jewish Messiah,
who will mount it when He subdues. all the earth.

Assassins <B>:</B> <I>(Hashishin, </I>so-called from their use of the drug
<I>hashish, </I>distilled from the hemp plant). A branch of that sect of
Mahomedans known as Ismaelites, founded in the latter part of the eleventh
century by Hassan Sabah, in Syria and Persia. Driven from Cairo, Hassan spread
a modified form of the Ismaelite doctrine throughout Syria, and in
<B>1090</B> he became master of the mountain stronghold, Alamut, in Persia,
where he founded a society known as the <I>Assassins, </I>and from which
he ostensibly promulgated the principles of the Ismaelite sect. The difference,
however, between the <I>Assassins </I>and other Ismaelites, was that they
employed secret assassination against all the enemies of the sect. Their
organisation was founded upon that of the Western Lodge at Cairo, and at
the head of their sect was the Sheik-Al-Gebel, or ' Old Man of the Mountain,"
as the name has been rather absurdly translated by Europeans authors, the
more correct translation being " Chief of the mountain." The other officers
of the society were the grand priors, lesser priors. initiates, associates,
and the <I>fedavi </I>or "devoted ones," who were the <I>assassins </I>proper.
These latter were young men from whose ranks those who were selected for
the various deeds of blood for which the <I>Assassins </I>became notorious,
were chosen. They were not initiated into the secret circle of the cult,
and blind obedience was expected from them. When their services were required
they were intoxicated with hashish, and in this condition were taken into
the magnificent gardens of the Sheik, where they were surrounded by every
pleasure. This they were told was a foretaste of what they might expect in
Paradise, to which they would instantly proceed were they to lose their lives
in the Sheik's service. Consequently these young men, for the most part ignorant
peasants, displayed a degree of fanaticism which made them the fitting
instruments of Hassan's policy. But the initiated amongst the <I>Assassins
</I>were convinced of the worthlessness of religion and morality, held no
belief, and sneered covertly at the Prophet and his religion.
<P>
The early history of the society is one of romantic and absorbing interest.
Hassan had been a member of a secret Ismaelite society at Cairo, the head
of which was the Caliph, " and of which the object was the dissemination
of the doctrines of the sect of the Ismaelites.
<P>
This society, we are told, comprised both men and women, who met in separate

and not infrequently Supreme Judge <I>(Kadhi-al-Kodhat). </I>Their assemblies
called Societies of Wisdom <I>(Mejalis-al-Hiemet), </I>were held twice a
week, on Mondays and Wednesdays. All the. members appeared clad in white.
The president. having first waited on the Caliph, and read to him the intended
lecture, or, if that could not be done, having got his signature on the back
of it. proceeded to the assembly and delivered a written discourse. At the
conclusion of it, those present kissed his hand and reverently touched with
their forehead the handwriting of the Caliph. In this state the society continued
till the reign of that extraordinary madman, the Caliph
<P>
Haken-bi-emr-illah (Judge by the Command of God). who determined to place
it on a splendid footing. He erected for it a stately edifice, styled the
House of Wisdom <I>(Dar-al-hicmet), </I>abundantly furnished with books and
mathematical instruments. Its doors were open to all, and paper, pens. and
ink were profusely supplied for the use of those who chose to frequent it.
Professors of law, mathematics, logic, and medicine were appointed to give
instructions; and at +he learned disputations which were frequently held
in presence of the Caliph, these professors appeared in their state caftans
<I>(Khalaa) </I>which it is said, exactly resembled the robes worn at the
English universities. The income assigned to this establishment by the
munificence of the Caliph, was <B>257</B>,<B>000</B> ducats annually, arising
from the tenths paid to the crown.
<P>
"The course of instruction in this university proceeded, according to Macrisi,
by the following nine degrees. (I) The object of the first, which was long
and tedious, was to infuse doubts and difficulties into the mind of the aspirant,
and to lead him to repose a blind confidence in the know-ledge and wisdom
of his teacher. To this end he was perplexed with captious questions; the
absurdities of the literal sense of the Koran and its repugnance to reason,
were studiously pointed out, and dark hints were given that beneath this
shell lay a kernel sweet to the taste and nutritive to the soul. But all
further information was most rigorously withheld till he had consented to
bind himself by a most solemn oath to absolute faith and blind obedience
to his instructor. (<B>2</B>) When he had taken the oath he was admitted
to the second degree, which inculcated the acknowledgement of the imams appointed
by God as the sources of all knowledge. (<B>3</B>) The third degree informed
him what was the number of these blessed and holy imams; and this was the
mystic seven; for, as God had made seven heavens., seven earths, seas, planets,
metals, tones, and colours, so seven was the number of these noblest of God's
creatures. (<B>4</B>) In the fourth degree the pupil learned that God had
sent seven lawgivers into the world, each of whom was commissioned to alter
and improve the system of his predecessor; that each of these had seven helpers,
who appeared in the interval between him and his successor; these helpers,
as they did not appear as public teachers, were called the mute <I>(samit),
</I>in contradistinction to the speaking lawgivers. The seven lawgivers were
Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, Mohammed, and Ismael, the son of Jaaffer;
the seven principal helpers, called Seats (soos) were Seth. Shem. Ishmael
(the son of Abraham), Aaron, Simon, Ah, and Mohammed, the son of Ismael.
It is justly observed that, as this last personage was not more than a century
dead, the teacher had it in his power to fix on whom lie would as the mute
prophet of the present time, and inculcate the belief in, and obedience to,
him of all who had not got beyond this degree. (<B>5</B>) The fifth degree
taught that each of the seven mute prophets had twelve apostles for the
dissemination of his faith. The suitableness of this number was also proved
by analogy. There are twelve signs of the Zodiac, twelve month", twelve tribes
of Israel, twelve joints in the four fingers of each hand, and so
forth.(<B>6</B>) The pupil being led thus far, and having shown no symptoms
of restiveness, the precepts of the Koran were once more brought under
consideration,, and he was told that all the positive portion" of religion
must be subordinate to philosophy. He was consequently instructed in the
systems of Plato and Aristotle during the long space of time; and (<B>7</B>)
when esteemed fully qualified. he was admitted to the seventh degree, when
instruction was communicated in that mystic Pantheism, which is held and
taught by the sect of the Soofees. (<B>8</B>) The positive precepts of religion
were again considered, the veil was torn from the eyes of the aspirant, all
that had preceded was now declared to have been merely scaffolding to raise
the edifice of knowledge, and was to be flung down. Prophets and teachers,
heaven and hell. all were nothing; future bliss and misery were idle dream',.
; all actions were permitted. (<B>9</B>) The ninth degree had only to inculcate
that nought was to be believed, everything might be done."
<P>
It is worthy of mention that one of Hassan's early intimates was the famous
Omar Khayyam, with whom he and another friend contracted a bargain that the
most successful of the three would share his good fortune with the others.
It is likely that the practical mystic and the astrologer would feel drawn
to each other by many common tastes. but we do not learn that Omar profited
much from the bargain so far as Hassan was concerned. The third of the friends,
Nizam-al-Melk, achieved an exalted position as vizier to the second of the
Seljuk monarchs, and calling to mind his promise offered Omar a post under
the government, but the author of the <I>Rubaiyat </I>was too addicted to
pleasure to accept active employment, and in lieu of the dazzling position
offered him, was content with a pension of <B>1</B>,<B>200</B> ducats, with
which he went into retirement.
<P>
Hassan clearly perceived that the plan of the society at Cairo was defective
as a means of acquiring temporal power. The Dais might exert themselves and
proselytes might be gained, but till possession was obtained of some strongholds,
and a mode of striking terror into princes devised. nothing effectual could
be achieved.
<P>
With this object in view he instituted the <I>Fedavi, </I>who unhesitatingly
obeyed their chief, and, without inquiry or hesitation, plunge their daggers
into the bosom of whatever victim was pointed out to them, even though their
own lives should be the immediate sacrifice. The ordinary dress of the
<I>Fedavi </I>was (like that of all the sects opposed to the house of Abbas),
white; their caps, girdles, or boots, were red. Hence they were named the
White <I>{Mubeiyazah), </I>and the Red <I>(Muhammere); </I>but they could
with ease assume any guise, even that of the Christian monk, to accomplish
their murderous designs.
<P>
Hassan was perfectly aware that without the compressing power of positive
religion, no society can well be held together. Whatever, therefore, his
private opinions may have been, he resolved to impose on the bulk of his
followers the most rigid obedience to the positive precepts of Islam, and,
actually put his own son to death for a breach of one of them.
<P>
Hassan is said to have rejected two of the degrees of the Ismaelite society
at Cairo, and to have reduced them to seven, the original number in the plan
of Abdallah Maimoon, the first projector of this secret society Besides these
seven degrees, through which the aspirants gradually rose to knowledge, Hassan,
in what Hammer terms the breviary of the order, drew up seven regulations
or rules for the conduct of the teachers in his society. (<B>1</B>) The first
of these, named Ashinai-Risk (Knowledge of Duty), inculcated the requisite
knowledge of human nature for selecting fit persons for admission. To this
belong the proverbial expressions said to have been current among the Dais,
similar to those used by the ancient Pythagoreans, such as " Sow not on barren
ground " (that is, "Waste not your labour on incapable persons), "Speak not
in a house where there is a lamp" (that is, " Be silent in the presence of
a lawyer"). (<B>2</B>) The second rule was called Teenis (Gaining of Confidence).
and taught to win the candidates by flattering their passions and inclinations.
<P>
(<B>3</B>) The third, of which the name is not given.. taught to involve
them in doubts and difficulties by pointing out the absurdities of the Koran,
and of positive religion.
<P>
(<B>4</B>) When the aspirant had gone thus far, the 'solemn oath of silence
and obedience, and of communicating his doubts to his teacher alone was to
be imposed on the disciple; and then (<B>5</B>) he was to be informed that
the doctrines and opinions of the society were those of the greatest men
in church and state. (<B>6</B>) The Tessees (Confirmation) directed to put
the pupil again through all he had learned, and to confirm him in it. And,
(<B>7</B>) finally, the Teevil (Instruction in Allegory) gave the allegorical
mode of interpreting the Koran, and drawing whatever sense might suit their
purposes from its pages. Any one who had gone through this course of instruction,
and was thus become perfectly imbued with the spirit of the society, was
regarded as an accomplished Dai, and employed in the important office of
making proselytes and extending its influence.
<P>
Soofeism, a doctrine of this society, which is a kind of mystic Pantheism,
viewing God in all and all in God, may produce, like fatalism, piety or its
opposite. In the eyes of one who thus views God, all the distinctions between
vice and virtue become fleeting and uncertain, and crime may gradually lose
its atrocity, and be regarded as only a means for the production of a good
end. That the Ismaelite <I>Fedavi </I>murdered innocent persons without
compunction, when ordered so to do by his superiors, is an undoubted fact,
and there is no absurdity in supposing that he and they may have thought
that in so doing they were acting rightly and promoting the cause of truth.
<P>
The followers of Hassan Sabah were called the Eastern Ismaelites, to distinguish
them from those of Africa. They were also named the <I>Batinjyek </I>(Internal
or Secret), from the secret meaning which they drew from the text of the
Koran, and Moolhad, or Moolahid (Impious) on account of the imputed impiety
of their doctrine names common to them with most of the preceding sects.
It is under this last appellation that they were known to Marco Polo, the
Venetian traveller. The name, however, by which they are best known in Europe,
and which we employ. is that of <I>Assassins. </I>This name is ver,' generally
derived from that of the founder of their society; but M. De Sacy has made
it probable that the Oriental term <I>Hashishin, </I>of which the Crusaders
made <I>Assassins, </I>comes (as already noted) from Hashish, a species of
hemp, from which intoxicating opiates were made, which the <I>Fedavi </I>were
in the habit of taking previously to engaging in their daring enterprises,
or employed as a medium of procuring delicious visions of the paradise promised
to them by the Sheikh-al-Gebel.
<P>
It is a curious question how Hassan contrived to infuse into the <I>Fedavi
</I>the recklessness of life, joined with the spirit of implicit obedience
to the commands of their superiors, which they so invariably displayed. We
are told that the system adopted for this purpose was to obtain, by purchasing
or otherwise, from their parents, stout and healthy children. These were
reared up in implicit obedience to the will of the Sheik, and, to fit them
for their future office, carefully instructed in various languages.
<P>
The <I>Assassins </I>soon began to make themselves felt as a power in Persia
and Syria. Their first victim was that very Nizam with whom Hassan and Omar
had completed their youthful bargain. His son speedily followed him, as did
the Sultan of Persia. That monarch's successor made war with them, but was
so terror-stricken by their murderous tactics, that he speedily cemented
a peace. Hassan died at an advanced age in <STRONG>1</STRONG><B>124</B>,
having assassinated both his sons, and left as his successor his chief prior,
Hia-busurg-Omid, during the reign of whom the <I>Assassins </I>were far from
fortunate. The list of their victims had by this time become a long and
illustrious one. The fourth Sheik of the Mountain-another Hassan-made public
the secret doctrines of the society, announcing that the religion of Islam
was abolished and that the people might give themselves up to feasting and
pleasure. He further stated that he was the promised Caliph of God upon earth;
but some four years after this announcement he was assassinated and succeeded
by his son, Mahomed II. whose rule of forty-six years was marked by deeds
of revolting cruelty. But he had several implacable enemies, one of whom
was the famous Saladin, and the Syrian branch of the society seceded from
his sway, and became independent. This branch it was with whom the Crusaders
came so much into contact, and whose emissaries slew Raymond of Tripoli,
and Conrad of Montferrat. Mahomed&amp;rsquo;s son, Hassan III., restored
the old form of doctrine - that is, the people were strictly confined to
the practice of Islam, whilst the initiates were as before, superior and
agnostic. His was the only reign in which no assassinations occurred and
he was regarded with friendship by his neighbours. But after a reign of twelve
years, he was poisoned, and during the minority of his son assassination
was greatly in vogue. After a reign of thirty years, Mahomed III., the son
in question, was slain by his successor, Rukneddin; but vengeance quickly
followed, for only a year later the Tartars swept into Persia, took Alamut
and other <I>Assassin </I>strongholds, and captured the reigning monarch,
who was slain because of his treachery. Over <B>12</B>,<B>000</B> <I>Assassins
</I>were massacred, and their power was completely broken. The like fate
overtook the Syrian branch, which was nearly extirpated by the Egyptian
Mamelukes. But in the more isolated valleys of <I>Syria, </I>many of them
lingered on and are believed still to exist -there. At all events, doctrines
similar in character to theirs are occasionally to be met with in Northern
Syria. An account of the manner in which the <I>Assassins </I>aroused the
lust of slaughter in the <I>Fedavis </I>is given in <I>Siret-l-Haken, </I>or
<I>Memoirs of Hakin - an </I>Arabic historic romance, as follows<B>:</B>
<P>
"Our narrative now returns to Ismael the chief of the Ismaelites. He took
with him his people laden with gold, silver, pearls, and other effects, taken
away from the inhabitants of the coasts, and which he had received in the
island of Cyprus, and on the part of the King of Egypt, Dhaher, the son of
Hakem-biemr-Illah<B>:</B> Having bidden farewell to the Sultan of Egypt at
Tripolis, they proceeded to Massyat, when the inhabitants of the castles
and fortresses assembled to enjoy themselves, along with the chief Ismael
and his people. They put on the rich dresses with which the Sultan had supplied
them, and adorned the castle of Massyat with everything that was good and
fine. Ismael made his entry into Massyat with the Devoted <I>(Fedavi), </I>as
no one has ever done at Massyat before him or after him. He stopped there
some time to take into his service some more persons whom he might make devoted
both in heart and body.
<P>
"With this view he had caused to be made a vast garden, into which he had
water conducted. In the middle of this garden he built a kiosk raised to
the height of four stories. On each of the four sides were richly-ornamented
windows joined by four arches, in which were painted stars of gold and silver.
He put into it roses, porcelain. glasses., and drinking-vessels of gold and
silver. He had with him Mamlooks (i.e., slaves), ten males and ten females,
who were come with him from the region of the Nile, and who had scarcely
attained the age of puberty. He clothed them in silks and in the finest stuffs,
and be gave unto them bracelets of gold and of silver. The columns were overlaid
with musk, and with amber, and in the four arches of the windows he set four
caskets, in which was the purest musk. The columns were polished, and this
place was the retreat of the slaves. He divided the garden into four parts.
In the first of these were pear-trees, apple-trees, vines, cherries, mulberries,
plums, and other kinds of fruit-trees. In the second were oranges. lemons,
olives, pomegranates, and other fruits. In the third were cucumbers, melons,
leguminous plants, etc. In the fourth were roses, jessamine, tamarinds, narcissi,
violets, lilies, anemonies, etc., etc.
<P>
"The garden was divided by canals of water, and the kiosk was surrounded
with ponds and reservoirs. There were groves in which were seen antelopes,
ostriches, asses, and wild cows. Issuing from the ponds, one met ducks, geese,
partridges, quails, hares, foxes, and other animals. Around the kiosk the
chief Ismael planted walks of tail trees, terminating in the different parts
of the garden. He built there a great house, divided into two apartments,
the upper and the lower. From the latter covered walks led out into the garden,
which was all enclosed with walls, so that no one could see into it, for
these walks and buildings were all void of inhabitants. He made a gallery
of cool-ness, which ran from this apartment to the cellar, which was behind.
This apartment served as a place of assembly for the men. Having placed himself
on a sofa there opposite the door, the chief made his men sit down, and gave
them to eat and drink during the whole length of the day until evening. At
nightfall he looked around him, and, selecting those whose firmness pleased
him, said to them, ' Ho I such-a-one, come and seat thyself near me.' It
is thus that Ismael made those whom he bad chosen sit near him on the sofa
and drink. He then spoke to them of the great and excellent qualities of
the imam Ali, of his bravery, his nobleness, and his generosity, until they
fell asleep, overcome by the power of the <I>benjeh </I>which he had given
them, and which never failed to produce its effects in less than a quarter
of an hour, so that they fell down as if they were inanimate. Ac soon as
the man had fallen the chief Ismael arose, and, taking him up, brought him
into a dormitory, and then, shutting the door, carried him on his shoulders
into the gallery of coolness, which was in the garden, and thence into the
kiosk, where he committed him to the care of the male and female slaves,
directing them to comply with all the desires of the candidate, on whom they
flung vinegar till be awoke. When he was come to himself the youths and maidens
said to him. ' We are only waiting for thy death, for this place is destined
for thee. This is one of the pavilions of Paradise, and we are the houries
and the children of Paradise. If thou wert dead thou wouldest be for ever
with us, but thou art only dreaming, and wilt soon awake.' Mean-while, the
chief Ismael had returned to the company as. soon as be had witnessed the
awakening of the candidate, who now perceived nothing but youths and maidens
of the greatest beauty. and adorned in the most magnificent manner.
<P>
" He looked around the place, inhaled the fragrance of musk and frankincense,
and drew near to the garden. where be saw the beasts and the birds, the running
water, and the trees. He gazed on the beauty of the kiosk, and the vases
of gold and silver, while the youths and maidens kept him in converse. In
this way be remained confounded, not knowing whether he was awake or only
dreaming. When two hours of the night had gone by, the chief Ismael returned
to the dormitory, closed to the door, and thence proceeded to the garden,
where his slaves came around him and rose before. him. When the candidate
perceived him, he said unto him, ' O, chief Ismael, do I dream, or am I awake
? ' The chief Ismael then made answer to him.
<P>
O, such-a-one beware of relating this vision to any ore who is a stranger
to this place I Know that the Lord Ah has shown thee the place which is destined
for thee in Paradise. Know that at this moment the Lord Ah and I have been
sitting together in the regions of the empyrean. So do not hesitate a moment
in the service of the imam who has given thee to know his felicity.' Then
the chief Ismael ordered supper to be served. It was brought in vessels of
gold and of silver, and consisted of boiled meats and roast meats, with other
dishes. While the candidate ate, he was sprinkled with rose-water; when be
called for drink there were brought to him vessels of gold and silver filled
with delicious liquors, in which also bad been mingled some <I>benjeh. </I>When
he bad fallen asleep, Ismael carried him through the gallery back to the
dormitory, and, leaving him there, returned to his company. After a little
time he went back, threw vinegar on his face, and then, bringing him out,
ordered one of the Mamlooks to shake him. On awaking, and finding himself
in the same place among the guests, he said. 'There is no god but God, and
Mohammed is the Prophet of God The chief Ismael then drew near and caressed
him. and he remained, as it were, immersed in intoxication, wholly devoted
to the service of the chief, who then said unto him. 'O, such-a-one; know
that what thou hast seen was not a dream, but one of the miracles of the
imam Ah. Know that he has written thy name among those of his friends. If
thou keep the secret thou art certain of thy felicity, but if thou speak
of it thou wilt incur the resentment of the imam. If thou die thou art a
martyr; but beware of relating this to any person whatever. Thou hast entered
by one of the gates to the friendship of the imam, and art become one of
his family; but if thou betray the secret, thou wilt become one of his enemies,
and be driven from his house.' Thus this man became one of the servants of
the chief Ismael. who in this manner surrounded himself with trusty men,
until his reputation was established. This is what is related to the chief
Ismael and his Devoted."

<P>
Astral <B>Body</B> is in Theosophy that body which functions in the Astral
World. Like the rest of mans five bodies, it is composed of matter, relatively,
however, much finer than that which composes the ordinary physical body.
It is the instrument of passions, emotions, and desires, and, since it
interpenetrates and extends beyond the physical body, it is the medium through
which these are conveyed to the latter. When it separates from the denser
body-as it does during sleep, or by the influence of drugs, or as the result
of accidents - it takes with it the capacity for feeling, and only with its
return can pain or any other such phenomena be felt. During these periods
of separation the <I>astral body </I>is an exact replica of the physical,
and as it is extremely sensitive to thought, the apparitions of dead and
dying- of which so much is heard in the new science of the Borderland-resemble
even to the smallest details the physical bodies which they have lately left.
The Astral World is, of course, easily attainable to clairvoyants of even
moderate powers, and the appropriate body is therefore clearly visible. In
accordance with theosophic teaching on the subject of thought, the latter
is not the abstraction it is commonly considered to be, but built up of definite
forms the shape of which depends on the quality of the thought, and it also
causes definite vibrations, which are seen as colours. Hence, clairvoyants
are able to tell the state of a man&amp;rsquo;s development from the appearance
of his <I>astral body. </I>A nebulous appearance betokens imperfect development,
while an ovoid appearance betokens a more perfect development. As the colours
are indicative of the kind of thought, the variety of these in the <I>astral
body </I>indicates the possessor's character. Inferior thoughts beget loud
colours, so that rage, for instance, will be recognised by the red appearance
of the <I>astral body, </I>and on the contrary, higher thoughts will be
recognisable by the presence of delicate colours, religious thought for instance,
causing a blue colour. This teaching holds true for the bodies higher than
the <I>astral, </I>but, the coloration of the <I>astral body </I>is much
more familiar to dwellers in the physical world than is the coloration of
the higher bodies, with the feelings of which they are relatively unacquainted.
There is a definite theory underlying the emotional and other functions of
the <I>astral body. </I>The matter of which the latter is composed is not,
of course, alive with an intelligent life, but it nevertheless possesses
a kind of life sufficient to convey an understanding of its own existence
and wants. The stage of evolution of this life is that of descent, the turning
point not having yet, so far as it is concerned, been reached. He who possesses
the body has, on the other hand, commenced to ascend, and there is, therefore,
a continual opposition of forces between him and his <I>astral. body.
</I>Hence, his <I>astral body </I>accentuates in him such of grosser, retrograde
thoughts as he may nourish since the direction of these thoughts coincides
with its own direction. If, however, he resists the opposition of his <I>astral
body, </I>the craving of the latter gradually becomes weaker and weaker till
at last it disappears altogether. And the constitution of the <I>astral body
</I>is thereby altered, gross thoughts demanding for their medium gross
<I>astral </I>matter, pure thoughts demanding fine <I>astral </I>matter.
During physical life the various kinds of matter in the <I>astral body </I>are
intermingled, but at physical death the elementary life in the matter of
the <I>astral </I>body seeks instinctively after self-preservation, and it
therefore causes the matter to rearrange itself in a series of seven concentric
sheaths, the densest being outside and the finest inside. Physical vision
depends on the eyes, but <I>astral </I>vision depends on the various kinds
of <I>astral </I>matter being in a condition of receptiveness to different
undulations. To be aware of fine matter, fine matter in the <I>astral body
</I>is necessary, and so with the other kinds. Hence, when the rearrangement
takes place, vision only of the grossest kinds of matter is possible since
only that kind is represented in the thick outer sheath of the <I>astral
body. </I>Under these circumstances, the new denizen of the <I>,astral
</I>sphere sees only the worst of it, and also only the worst of his fellow
denizens, even though they are not in so low a state as himself. This state
is not, of course eternal, and in accordance with the evolutionary process,
the gross sheath of <I>astral </I>matter wears slowly away, and the man remains
clothed with the six less gross sheaths. These also, with the passage of
time, wear away, being resolved into their compound elements, and at last
when the final disintegration of the least gross sheath of all takes place,
the individual leaves the Astral World and passes into the Mental. This
rearrangement of the <I>astral body </I>is not, however, inevitable, and
those who have learned and know, are able at physical death to prevent it.
In such cases the change appears a very small one, and the so-called dead
continue to live their lives and do their work much as they did in the physical
body. <I>(See </I>Astral World, Avichi Theosophy.)

<P>
Astral World. (Plane or Sphere) <B>:</B> Kama World is, in Theosophy, the
second lowest of the seven worlds, the world of emotions, desires, and passions.
Into it man passes at physical death, and there he functions for periods
which vary with the state of his development, the primitive savage spending
a relatively short time in the <I>Astral World, </I>the civilised man spending
relatively longer. The appropriate body is the <I>astral </I>(q.v.), which
though composed of matter as is the physical body, is nevertheless of a texture
vastly finer than the latter. Though it is in its aspect of the after-death
abode that this world is of most importance and most interest, it may be
mid in passing, that even during physical life, man-not only clairvoyants
who attain it easily, but also ordinary men-may and do temporarily inhabit
it. This happens during sleep, or by reason of the action of anaesthetics
or drugs, or accidents, and the interpenetrating astral body then leaves
its denser physical neighbour, and taking with it the sense of pleasure and
pain, lives for a short time in its own world. Here again the state of the
savage differs from that of his more advanced fellows, for the former does
not travel <I>far </I>from his immediate surroundings, while the latter may
perform
<P>
useful, helpful work for the benefit of humanity. Further, it may in passing
be noted that disembodied mankind are not the only inhabitants of the <I>Astral
World, </I>for very many of its inhabitants are of an altogether non-human
nature-lower orders of the <I>devas </I>or angels, and nature-spirits or
elementals, both good and bad, such including fairies which are just beyond
the powers of human vision, and the demons present to the vision of delirium
tremens. It will however be sufficient now to turn attention to the <I>Astral
World </I>as the state immediately following physical death and containing
both heaven and hell as these are popularly conceived.
<P>
There are seven divisions which correspond to the seven divisions of matter,
the solid, liquid, gaseous, etheric, super-etheric, subatomic and atomic,
and, as mentioned in the article on the Astral Body, this plays a most important
part in the immediate destiny of man in it. If through ignorance, he has
permitted the rearrangement of the matter of his astral body into sheaths,
he is cognisant only of part of his surroundings at a time, and it is not
till after experience, much of which may be extremely painful, that he is
able to enjoy the bliss which the higher divisions of the <I>Astral World
</I>contain. The lowest of these divisions, the seventh, is the environment
of those of gross and unrestrained passions, since it and most of the matter
of their astral bodies is of the same type, and it constitutes a very hell,
and the only hell which exists. This is <I>Avichi, </I>the place of desires
which cannot be satisfied because of the absence of the physical body, which
was the means of their satisfaction. The tortures of these desires are the
analogue of the torments of hell-fire in the older Christian orthodoxy. Unlike
that orthodoxy, however, theosophy teaches that the state of torment is not
eternal, but passes away in time when the desires through long gnawing without
fulfillment, have died at last, and it is therefore more correct to look
on
<P>

<P>
Avichi as a purgatorial state. The ordinary man, however, does not experience
this seventh division of the <I>Astral World, </I>but according to his character
finds himself in one or other of the three next higher divisions. The sixth
division is very little different from his physical existence, and he continues
in his old surroundings among his old friends, who are, of course, unaware
of his presence, and indeed, often does not realise that he is dead so far
as the physical world is concerned. The fifth and fourth divisions are in
most respects quite similar to this, but their inhabitants become less and
less immersed in the activities and interests which have hitherto engrossed
them, and each sheath of their astral bodies decays in turn as did the gross
outer sheath of the sensualist's body. The three higher divisions are still
more removed from the ordinary material world, and their inhabitants enjoy
a state of bliss of which we can have no conception ; worries and cares of
earth are altogether absent, the insistence of lower desires has worn out
in the lower divisions, and it is now possible to live continually in an
environment of the loftiest thoughts and aspirations. The third division
is said to correspond to the spiritualistic "summerland," where the inhabitants
live in a world of their own creation-of the creation of their thoughts.
<P>
Its cities and all their contents, scenery of life, are all formed by the
influence of thought. The second division is what is properly looked on as
heaven, and the inhabitants of different races, creeds, and beliefs, find
it each according to his belief. Hence, instead of its being the place taught
of by any particular religion, it is the region where each and every religion
finds its own ideal. Christians, Mohammedans, Hindus, and so on, find it
to be just as they conceived it would be. Here, and in the first and highest
division, the inhabitants pursue noble aims freed from what of selfishness
was mingled with these aims on earth. The literary man, his thoughts of fame;
the artist, the scholar, the preacher, all work without incentive of personal
interest, and where their work is pursued long enough, and they are fitted
for the change, they leave the <I>Astral World </I>and enter one vastly
higher-the Mental. It was, however, mentioned that the rearrangement of the
matter of the astral body at physical death, was the result of ignorance,
and those who are sufficiently instructed do not permit this rearrangement
to take. They are not, therefore, confined to any one division, and have
not to progress from division to division, but are able to move through any
part of the <I>Astral World, </I>labouring always in their various lines
of action to assist the great evolutionary scheme. <I>(See </I><STRONG>Astral

History.-In Egyptian tradition, we find its invention attributed to Hermes
Trismegistus, or Thoth, by whom, under different names, is represented the
various revelations of truth, both theological and natural; for he is the
Mercury of the Romans, the eloquent deliverer of the messages of the gods.
The name of Ptolemy, the greatest of which <I>astrology </I>can boast, belongs
also to Egypt, but. to the comparatively recent period when Imperial Rome
flourished. In Imperial Rome <I>astrology </I>was held in great repute,
especially under the reign of Tiberius, who himself obtained that knowledge
of the science from Thrasyllus, which enabled him to foretell the destiny
of Galba, then consul. When Claudius was dying from the effects of
Locusta&amp;rsquo;s poison, Agrippina cautiously dissembled his progressive
illness; nor would she announce his decease till the very moment arrived,
which the astrologers had pronounced fortunate for the accession of Nero.
Augustus had discouraged the practice of <I>astrology </I>by banishing its
professors from Rome, but the favour of his successors recalled them, and
though occasional edicts, in subsequent reigns, restrained, and even punished
all who divined by the stars; and though Vitellius and Domitian revived the
edict of Augustus, the practices of the astrologers were secretly encouraged,
and their predictions extensively believed. Domitian himself, in spite of
his hostility, was in fear of their denouncements. They prophesied the year,
the hour, and the manner of his death, and agreed with his father in foretelling
that he should perish not by poison, but by the dagger.
<P>
After the age of the Antonines and the work of Censorinus, we hear little
of <I>astrology </I>for some generations. In the eighth century the venerable
Bede and his distinguished scholar, Alcuin, are said to have pursued this
mystic study. In that immediately following, the Arabians revived and encouraged
it. Under the patronage of Almaimon, the Mirammolin, in the year <B>827</B>,
the <I>Megale Syntaxis </I>of Ptolemy was translated under the title of "
Almagest," by Al. Hazen Ben Yusseph. Albumasar added to this work, and the
astral science continued to receive new force from the labours of Alfraganus,
Ebennozophim, Alfaragius, and Geber.
<P>
The conquest of Spain by the Moors carried this know-ledge, with all their
other treasures of learning into Spain, and before their cruel expulsion
it was naturalized among the Christian savants. Among these the wise Alonzo
(or Alphonso) of Castile, has immortalized himself by his scientific researches,
and the Jewish and Christian doctors, who arranged the tables which pass
under his name, were convened from all the accessible parts of civilized
Europe. Five years were employed in their discussion, and it has been said
that the enormous sum of <B>400</B>,<B>000</B> ducats was disbursed in the
towers of the Alcazar of Galiana, in the adjustment and correction of Ptolemy's
calculations. Nor was it only the physical motions of the stars which occupied
this grave assembly. The two kabalistic volumes, yet existing in cipher,
in the royal library of the kings of Spain, and which tradition assigns to
the hand of Alonzo himself, betoken a more visionary study. and in spite
of the denunciations against his orthodoxy, which were thundered in his ears
on the authority of Tertullian, Basil and Bonaventure, the fearless monarch
gave his sanction to such masters as practised truly the art of divination
by the stars, and in one part of his code enrolled astrology among the seven
liberal sciences.
<P>
In Germany many eminent men have been addicted to this study; and a long
catalogue might be made of those who have considered other sciences with
reference to <I>astrology, </I>and written on them as such. Faust has, of
course, the credit of being an astrologer as well as a wizard, and we find
that singular but splendid genius, Cornelius Agrippa, writing with as much
zeal against <I>astrology </I>as on behalf of other occult sciences.
<P>
To the believers in <I>astrology, </I>who flourished in the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries, must be added the name of Albert von Wallenstein,
Duke of Friedland. He was indeed an enthusiast in the cause, and many curious
anecdotes are related of this devotion. That he had himself studied
<I>astrology, </I>and under no mean instructors, is evidenced by his biography
and correspondence.
<P>
Of the early progress of <I>astrology </I>in England, little is known. Bede
and Alcuin we have already mentioned as addicted to its study. Roger Bacon
could scarcely escape the contagion of the art. But it was the period of
the Stuarts which must be considered as the acme of <I>astrology </I>among
us. Then Lilly employed the doctrine of the magical circle, and the evocation
of spirits from the <I>Ars Notoria </I>of Cornelius Agrippa, and used the
form of prayer prescribed therein to the angel Salmonoeus, and entertained
among his familiar acquaintance the guardian spirits of England, Salmael
and Malchidael. His ill success with the divining rod induced him to surrender
the pursuit of rhabdomancy, in which he first engaged, though he still preserved
in asserting that the operation demanded secrecy and intelligence in the
agents, and, above all, a strong faith, and a competent knowledge of their
work. The Dean of Westminster had given him permission to Search for treasure
in the cloisters of the abbey in the dead of the night. On the western side,
the rods turned over each other with inconceivable rapidity, yet, on digging,
nothing but a coffin could be discovered. He retired to the abbey, and then
a storm arose which nearly destroyed the west end of the church, extinguished
all the candles but one, and made the rods immovable. Lilly succeeded at
length in charming away the demon, but no persuasion could induce him to
make another experiment in that species of divination.
<P>
The successor of Lilly was Henry Coley, a tailor, who had been his amanuensis,
and traded in prophecy with success almost equal to that of his master.
<P>
While <I>astrology </I>flourished in England it was in high repute with its
kindred pursuits of magic, necromancy, and alchemy, at the court of France.
Catherine de Medici herself was an adept in the art. At the revolution, which
commenced a new era in this country, <I>astrology </I>declined, and
notwithstanding the labours of Partridge, and those of Ebenezer Sibley, it
has only in recent years recovered its importance.
<P>
Signs.-There are twelve signs of the Zodiac, divided in astrology into "Northern
and "Commanding" (the first six), and " Southern' and "Obeying" (last six).
They are as follow
<P>
Aries, the house of Mars, and exaltation of the sun, or the first sign of
the zodiac, is a vernal. dry, fiery, masculine, cardinal, equinoctial, diurnal,
movable, commanding. eastern, choleric, violent, and quadrupedian sign. These
epithets will be presently explained. The native, that is, the person born
under its influence, is tall of stature, of a strong but spare make, dry
constitution, long face and neck, thick shoulders, piercing eyes, sandy or
red hair, and brown complexion. In disposition he will be warm, hasty and
passionate. The aspects of the planets may, however, materially alter these
effects. This sign rules the head and face. Among diseases, it produces
small-pox, and epilepsy, apoplexy, headache, hypochondriasis, baldness, ringworm,
and all diseases of the head and face, paralysis, fevers, measles, and
convulsions. It presides over the following countries<B>:</B> England, France,
Germany, Syria, Switzerland, Poland and Denmark; and over the cities of Naples,
Capua, Padua, Florence, Verona, Ferrara, Brunswick, Marseilles, Caesarea,
and Utrecht, Its colours are red and white.
<P>
Now to explain this terminology, before examining another sign, there are
said to be four triplicities among the signs, viz.<B>:</B> the earthly
triplicity, including Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn; the airy, which includes
Gemini, Libra and Aquarius; the fiery, under which are reckoned Aries, Leo,
and Sagittarius; and the watery, which claims Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces.
The signs are further divided into diurnal and nocturnal<B>:</B> Aries diurnal,
Taurus nocturnal, and so on alternately, the diurnal signs being all masculine,
and the nocturnals feminine. The terms tropical, equinoctial, vernal, etc.,
need no comment. Fixed, common, movable, refer to the weather. Signs which
are named after quadrupeds are, of course, quadrupedal. Such as are called
after human states of occupations as humane. A person born under a fiery
masculine diurnal sign is hot in temper, and bold in character. If it be
a quadrupedal sign, he is somewhat like to the animal after which the 'sign
is called. Thus in Taurus, the native is bold and furious in Leo, fierce
and cruel. Cardinal signs are those occupying the four cardinal points. The
first six from Aries are termed commanding, and the latter six, obeying signs.
Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces are called fruitful or prolific; and Gemini, Lao,
and Virgo, barren. Sagittarius, because usually represented as a centaur,
is said to be humane, and productive of humane character in the former fifteen
degrees, but of a savage, brutal and intractable disposition in the latter.
<P>
We shall now proceed with the signs. Taurus is cold and dry, earthly, melancholy,
feminine, fixed and nocturnal, southern, the night-house of Venus. When
influential in a nativity, it usually produces a person with a broad forehead,
thick lips, dark curling hair, of quality rather brutal, melancholy, and
slow in anger, but when once enraged, violent, furious, and difficult to
be appeased. The diseases under this sign are all such as attack the throat,
scrofula, quinsey, imposthumes and wens. The sign rules the neck and throat.
Places subject to it are stables, cow-houses, cellars and low rooms, and
all places used for or by cattle. Of kingdoms, Russia, Ireland, Sweden, Persia
and Parthia, and of cities, Leipsic, Parma, Mantua, Novogorod, and eleven
others.
<P>
Gemini is masculine and diurnal, aerial, hot and moist, The native is tall
and straight of body, with long arms; the hands and feet well formed, the
complexion rather dark, the hair brown, the eye hazel; strong and active
in person, sound and acute in judgment; lively, playful, and generally skilful
in business. Diseases under this sign are those to which the arms, hands
and shoulders are subject, with aneurisms, frenzy and insanity. Places hilly
and high grounds, the tops of houses, wainscoted rooms, halls and theatres,
barns, storehouses and stairs; kingdoms, Armenia, Brabant, Lombardy, Sardinia
and Egypt; cities<B>:</B> London, Bruges, Cordova, Metz and seven others.
It is the day-house of Mercury, and rules the colours red and white.
<P>
Cancer is the only house of the moon, and the first sign of the watery northern
triplicity. It is a watery, cold, moist, phlegmatic, feminine, movable nocturnal,
solstitial, and exceedingly fruitful sign, more so than any other. The native
is fair and pale, short and small; the upper part of the body larger in
proportion to the lower; a round face, light hair. and blue or grey eyes;
phlegmatic, and heavy in disposition; weak in constitution, and of a small
voice. Diseases <B>:</B> All disorders of the breast and stomach over which
parts the sign rules; cancers, consumption, asthma, dropsy and surfeits.
Kingdoms<B>:</B> Scotland, Holland, Zealand, Burgundy, Numidia and Carthage;
places<B>:</B> the sea and all rivers, swamps, ponds, lakes, wells, ditches,
and watery places. Cities<B>:</B> Constantinople, Tunis, York and New York,
Genoa, Venice., Algiers, Amsterdam, Cadiz, and sixteen others, The colours
ruled by this sign are green and russet,
<P>
Leo is a sign of a very different nature, It is the only house of the
sun<B>:</B> fiery. hot, dry, masculine, choleric, commanding, eastern, and
a very barren sign. When this sign ascends in a nativity, the individual
will be of a tall and powerful frame, well-shaped, of an austere countenance,
of light, yellowish hair, large piercing eyes, commanding aspect, and ruddy
complexion. The character will be fierce and cruel, but yet open, generous
and Courteous, Such was Richard Coeur-de-Lion. But the latter part of the
sign is weaker and more brutal. This sign is even more modified by planetary
influences than any others, Among diseases it causes all affections of the
heart, over which together with the back and the vertebrae of the neck, it
rules; fevers, plague, jaundice and pleurisy. Of places, it governs woods,
forests, deserts and hunting-grounds, fire-places and furnaces; of
kingdoms<B>:</B> Italy, Chaldaea, Turkey and Bohemia; of cities<B>:</B> Bath,
Bristol, Taunton, Rome, Damascus, Prague, Philadelphia, and nineteen others.
Its colours are red and green.
<P>
Virgo is an earthy, cold, dry, barren, feminine, southern, melancholy, commanding
sign. It is the house and exaltation of Mercury. The native is handsome and
well-shaped.. slender. of middle stature, and of a clear, ruddy or brown
complexion, dark hair and eyes, the face rather round, and the voice sweet
and clear, but not strong; the character amiable and benevolent, witty and
studious, but not persevering; and if not opposed by planetary aspects, apt
to oratory. This sign rules the viscera, and is answerable for all diseases
affecting them, Of places cornfields and granaries, studies and libraries;
of kingdoms<B>:</B> Greece, Crete, Mesopotamia and Assyria ; of cities Jerusalem,
Paris, Corinth, and twelve others, Its colours are blue and black,
<P>

Frankfort, Vienna, Charlestown in America, and twenty-seven others. The colours
which it rules are crimson and tawny; and of places. mountains, saw-pits
and woods newly felled.
<P>
Scorpio, the night-house of Mars, is a cold, phlegmatic, feminine, nocturnal,
fixed, northern, and watery sign. The native is of a strong, robust, corpulent
body, of a middle stature, broad visage, dark but not clear complexion, dark
grey eyes or light brown, black hair or very dark brown, short, thick legs
and thick neck. Of places it governs swampy grounds and stagnant waters,
places which abound in venomous creatures, orchards and ruinous houses,
especially near water. Of kingdoms<B>:</B> Fez, Bavaria, Norway and Mauritania;
of cities<B>:</B> Messina, and others; of colours<B>:</B> brown.
<P>

well-formed and rather above the middle stature, with fine chestnut hair
but inclined to baldness, a visage somewhat long but ruddy and handsome;
the body strong, stout and hardy. He is inclined to horsemanship and
field-sports, careless of danger, generous and intrepid, but hasty and careless,
This sign rules the hips, and is the cause of gout, rheumatism and disorders
which affect the muscles. Accidents and disorders occasioned by intemperance
come under the government of this sign. Of kingdoms<B>:</B> Spain, Hungary,
Sclavonia and Arabia; of places<B>:</B> stables and parks; and of colours,
green. and red.
<P>
Capricornus is an earthy, cold, dry, feminine, nocturnal, movable, cardinal,

the exaltation, The native is of slender stature, long trim countenance,
small beard, dark hair and eyes, long neck, narrow chest and chin, tall usually,
though not always; in disposition, cheerful and collected; talented and upright.
Ruling the knees and hips, it governs all diseases which afflict them, and
also all contagious diseases, such as leprosy, etc., and melancholy diseases
such as hypochondriasis and hysteria. The kingdoms which it rules are India,
Thrace, Mexico and Saxony; and the cities, Oxford, Bradenburg and nineteen
others. The places over which it has power are workshops and fallow grounds,

sign, only less so than Cancer; the house of Jupiter, and the exaltation
of Venus. The native is short and ill-shaped, fleshy, if not corpulent, with
thick, round shoulders, light hair and eyes, the complexion pale, and the
head and face large; of a weak and vacillating disposition, well-meaning,
but devoid of energy. This sign rules the feet, and causes lameness and every

<P>
<I></I>
<P>
Planets. The influence and effects of the planets are still more important
than those of the signs, and they are as follow<B>:</B> We commence with
the most remote of the planets, Uranus. The days and hours are, as we have
seen divided among the planets, but as none were left vacant, the appropriation
of any to Uranus would, of course, throw out almost all the ancient calculations.
If these then are to be preserved, the newly-discovered planet has no influence;
but if this be the case, by what analogy can any be assigned to the others?
However, when this question was likely to be debated, Uranus was rolling
on in its far-off orbit, and occasioning no uneasiness whatever to astrologers
or magicians. Leaving out all mention of the astronomical elements, we proceed
to notice that Uranus is by nature extremely cold and dry, melancholy, and
one of the infortunes. The native is of small stature, dark or pale complexion,
rather light hair, of a highly. nervous temperament., sedate aspect, but
having something singular in his appearance; light grey eyes, and delicate
constitution. If the planet be well dignified, he is a searcher into science,
particularly chemistry, and remarkably attached to the wonderful He possesses
an extraordinary magnanimity and loftiness of mind, with an uncontrollable
and intense desire for pursuits and discoveries of an uncommon nature. If
<P>
ill-dignified, then the native is weak, sickly, and short-lived, treacherous,
and given to gross imposture, unfortunate in his undertakings. capricious
in his taste, and very eccentric in his conduct. No planet, save Saturn,
is so actively and powerfully malevolent as this. His effects are truly malefic.
They are, however of a totally unexpected, strange and unaccountable character.
He rules over places dedicated to unlawful arts, laboratories, etc. The regions
under his immediate governance are Lapland, Finland, and the Poles.
Professions<B>:</B>
<P>
necromancers and Gee tic magicians; cities<B>:</B> Upsala and Mexico. The
name of his angel has not been found out, but he is known to be very hostile
to the female sex, and when his aspects interfere in the period of marriage,
the result is anything but happiness.
<P>
Saturn is by nature cold and dry; is a melancholy, earthy, masculine, solitary,
diurnal, malevolent planet, and the great infortune. When he is lord of the
ascendant, the native is of a middle stature the complexion dark and swarthy,
or pale; small black eyes, broad shoulders, black hair, and ill-shaped about
the lower extremities. When well dignified, the native is grave and wise,
studious and severe, of an active and penetrating mind, reserved and patient,
constant in attachment, but implacable in resentment, upright and inflexible;
but if the planet be ill-dignified at the time of birth, then the native
will be sluggish, covetous, and distrustful<B>:</B> false, stubborn, malicious,
and ever discontented. This planet is said to be well dignified in the horoscope
of the Duke of Wellington, and to have been ill-dignified, but singularly
posited in that of Louis XI. of France. The diseases he signifies are quartan
agues, and such as proceed from' cold and melancholy; all impediments in
the sight, ear, and teeth; rheumatism, consumption, disorders affecting the
memory, the spleen, and the bones. Saturn, in general, signifies husbandmen,
day-labourers, monks, Jesuits, sectarians, sextons, and such as have to do
with the dead; gardeners, dyers of black, and thirty-three other professions,
which Lilly enumerates. He mentions also forty-eight plants, including all
anodynes and narcotic poisons, which are under the rule of this planet. Among
animals, the cat, the ass, hare, mole, mouse, wolf, bear, and crocodile;
all venomous creatures. Among fishes, the eel, tortoise and shell-fish; among
the birds, the bat, and the owl; among metals and minerals, lead, the loadstone,
and all dross of metals; over the sapphire, lapis lazuli, and all stones
that are not polishable, and of a leaden or ashy colour.
<P>
"He causeth the air to be dark and cloudy, cold and hurtful, with thick and
dense vapours. He delighteth in the eastern quarter, causing eastern winds;
and in gathering any plant belonging to him the ancients did observe to turn
their faces to the east in his hour. Those under him do rarely live beyond
fifty-seven years; and if he be well placed, seldom less than thirty. But
his nature is cold and dry, and these qualities are destructive to man. Black
is the colour which he ruleth. Of countries under his influence are Bavaria,
Saxony, and Styria; Ravenna, Constance and Ingoldstadt among cities. His
friends are Jupiter, Mars and Mercury; his enemies, the Sun and Venus. We
call Saturday his day, for then he begins to rule at sunrise, and rules the
first hour and the eighth of that day. His angel is Cassel."
<P>
The next planet is Jupiter. He is a diurnal, masculine planet, temperately
hot and moist, airy, and sanguine; the greater fortune and lord of the airy
triplicity. The native, if the. planet be well dignified, will be of an erect
carriage and tall stature; a handsome ruddy complexion, high forehead, soft.
thick brown hair; a handsome ah ape and commanding aspect; his voice will
be strong, clear and manly, and his speech grave and sober. If the planet
be ill dignified, still the native will be what is called a good-looking
person, though of smaller stature, and less noble aspect. In the former case,
the understanding and character will be of the highest possible description;
and in the latter case, though careless and improvident, immoral and irreligious;
he will never entirely lose the good opinion of his friends. Yet he will
be, as Sancho Panza expresses it<B>:</B> "Haughty to the humble, and humble
to the haughty." The diseases it rules are apoplexy and inflammation of the
lungs; disorders affecting the left ear, cramps, and palpitations of the
heart. Plants<B>:</B> the oak, spice, apples, and one hundred and seventy-two
others; gems<B>:</B> topaz, amethyst, hyacinth and bezoar; minerals<B>:</B>
tin, pewter and firestone; animals<B>:</B> the ox, horse, elephant, stag,
and all domestic animals; weather<B>:</B> pleasant, healthful, and serene
west-north and north-west winds; birds<B>:</B> the eagle, peacock, pheasant,
etc. Of fishes, he rules the whale and the dolphin; of colours<B>:</B> blue,
when well posited ; of professions<B>:</B> the clergy, the higher order of
law students, and those who deal in woollen goods; when weak, the dependents
on the above, with quacks, common cheats, and drunkards. Places<B>:</B> all
churches, palaces, courts, and places of pomp and solemnity. He rules the
lungs and blood, and is friendly with all the planets, save Mars.
Countries<B>:</B> Spain. Hungary and Babylon; his angel is Zadkiel.
<P>
The next planet is Mars; a masculine, nocturnal, hot, and dry planet; of
the fiery triplicity; the author of strife, and the lesser infortune. The
native is short, but strongly made, having large bones, ruddy complexion,
red or sandy hair and eyebrows, quick, sharp eyes, round, bold face, and
fearless aspect. If well dignified, courageous and invincible, unsusceptible
of fear, careless of life, resolute and
<P>
unsubmissive. If ill dignified, a trumpeter of his own fame, without decency
or honesty; fond of quarrels, prone to fightings, and given up to every species
of fraud, violence and oppression. Nero was an example of this planet's
influence, and the gallows is said to terminate most generally the career
of those born in low life under its government. This planet rules the head,
face, gall, left ear, and the smell. Disease<B>:</B> plague, fevers, and
all complaints arising from excessive heat; all wounds by iron or steel,
injuries by poison, and all evil effects from intemperate anger. Herbs and
plants<B>:</B> mustard, radish, with all pungent and thorny plants ; gems.
the bloodstone, jasper, ruby and garnet; of minerals. iron, arsenic, antimony,
sulphur and vermilion ; animals. the mastiff wolf, tiger and all savage beasts;
birds. the hawk, kite, raven, vulture, and generally birds of prey ;
weather<B>:</B>
<P>
thunder and lightning, fiery meteors, and all strange phenomena;
kingdoms<B>:</B> Lombardy and Bavaria; cities<B>:</B>
<P>
Jerusalem and Rome. He signifies soldiers, surgeons, barbers and butchers.
Places<B>:</B> smiths' shops, slaughterhouses, fields of battle, and brick-kilns.
His friends are all the planets, save the Moon and Jupiter. His colour is
red, and his angel is Samael.
<P>
We now come to the Sun, a masculine, hot, and dry planet. of favourable effects.
The native is very like one born under Jupiter, but the hair is lighter,
the complexion redder; the body fatter, and the eyes larger. When well dignified,
the solar man is affable, courteous, splendid and sumptuous, proud, liberal,
humane, and ambitious. When ill dignified, the native is arrogant, mean,
loquacious, and sycophantic; much resembling the native under Jupiter, ill
dignified, but still worse. Disease"<B>:</B> all those of the heart, mouth
and throat; epilepsy, scrofula, tympanitis, and brain-fevers. Herbs and
plants<B>:</B> laurel, vervain, St. John's wort, orange, hyacinth, and some
hundreds beside; gems<B>:</B> carbuncle, the diamond, the aetites;
minerals<B>:</B> gold ; animals<B>:</B> the lion, the boar, the horse;
birds<B>:</B> the lark, the swan, the nightingale, and all singing birds;
fish<B>:</B> the star-fish and all shell-fish ; countries<B>:</B> Italy,

dignified persons, braziers, goldsmiths, and persons employed in mints;
places<B>:</B> kings' courts, palaces, theatres, halls, and places of state.
His friends are all the planets, save Saturn; and his angel is Michael.
<P>
The influence of the asteroids, Juno, Pallas, Ceres, and Vesta, have never
been calculated, and they are said by modern astrologers to act beneficially,
but feebly.
<P>
The Moon is a far more important planet; feminine, nocturnal, cold, moist,
and phlegmatic. Her influence in itself is neither fortunate nor unfortunate.
She is benevolent or otherwise, according to the aspects of other planets
towards her; and under these circumstances she becomes more powerful than
any of them. The native is short and stout, with fair, pale complexion, round
face, grey eyes, short arms, thick hands and feet, very hairy, but with light
hair; phlegmatic. If the Moon be affected by the Sun at the time of birth,
the native will have a blemish of or near the eye. When the Moon is well
dignified the native is of soft, engaging manners, imaginative, and a lover
of the arts, but wandering, careless, timorous, and unstable, loving peace,
and averse from activity. When ill dignified, then the native will be of
an ill shape, indolent, worthless and disorderly. Diseases<B>:</B> palsy,
epilepsy, scrofula and lunacy, together with all diseases of the eyes; herbs
<B>:</B> lily, poppies, mushrooms, willow, and about two hundred others;
minerals and gems; pearls, selenite, silver and soft stones; colour, white;

Lubeck; places<B>:</B> fountains, baths, the sea, and in watery places;
professions<B>:</B> queens and dignified women midwives, nurses, all who
have to do with water, sailors. Her angel is Gabriel.
<P>
Venus is a feminine planet, temperately cold and moist, the author of mirth
and sport. The native is handsome. well-formed, but not tall; clear complexion,
bright hazel or black eyes, dark brown or chestnut hair, thick, soft, and
shining; the voice soft and sweet, and the aspect very prepossessing. If
well dignified, the native will be cheerful, friendly, musical, and fond
of elegant accomplishments, prone to love, but frequently jealous. If ill
dignified, the native is less handsome in person and in mind, altogether
vicious, given up to every licentiousness; dishonest and atheistical. Herbs
and plants <B>:</B> the fig-tree, myrrh, myrtle, pomegranate, and about two
hundred and twenty more; animals<B>:</B> the goat, panther, hart, etc.;
birds<B>:</B> the sparrow, the dove, the thrush, and the wren; gems<B>:</B>

as minister to pomp and pleasure; weather<B>:</B> warm, and accompanied with
showers. Her angel is Hanael.
<P>
Mercury is the last of the planets which we nave to consider. He is masculine,
melancholy, cold, and dry. The native is tall, straight, and thin, with a
narrow face and high forehead, long straight nose, eyes black or grey, thin
lips and chin, scanty beard, with brown hair; the arms, hands and fingers,
long and slender; this last is said to be a peculiar mark of a nativity under
Mercury. If the planet be oriental at the time of birth, the native will
be very likely to be of a stronger constitution, and with sandy hair. If
occidental, sallow, lank, slender, and of a dry habit. When well dignified.
he will be of an acute and penetrating mind, of a powerful imagination, and
a retentive memory; eloquent, fond of learning, and successful in scientific
investigation. If engaged in mercantile pursuits, enterprising and skilful.
If ill dignified, then the native is a mean, unprincipled character, pretending
to knowledge, but an imposter. and a slanderer, boastful. malicious, and
addicted to theft. Diseases<B>:</B> all that affect the brain. head, and
intellectual faculties; herbs and plants<B>:</B> the walnut, the valerian,
the trefoil, and about one hundred more; animals<B>:</B> the dog, the ape,
the weasel, and the fox; weather<B>:</B> rain, lime-stones, thunder and
lightning, particularly in the north; occupations<B>:</B> all literate and
learned professions; when ill dignified, all pretenders, quacks, and mountebanks.
Places<B>:</B> schools, colleges, markets, warehouses, exchanges, all places
of commerce and learning; metal, quicksilver; gems<B>:</B> cornelian, sardonyx,
opal, onyx, and chalcedony; his colour is purple. His friends are Jupiter,
Venus, and Saturn; his enemies Mars, the Sun, and the Moon. His angel is
Raphael.
<P>
The <I>Aspects </I>of the Planets are five thus distinguished<B>:</B>
<P>
1. Conjunction, when two planets are in the same degree and minute of a sign,
which may be of good or evil import, according to the nature of the planets,
and their relation to each other as friendly or the contrary.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
2. Sectile, when two planets are <B>60</B><SUP>o</SUP> distant from each
other, it is called the aspect of imperfect love or friendship, and is generally
a favourable omen. <B>3</B>. Quartile, when two planets are
<B>90<SUP>o</SUP></B>-distant from each other, making the aspect of imperfect
hatred, and inclining to enmity and misfortune. <B>4</B>. Trine, when the
distance is <B>120</B><SUP>o</SUP>, promising the most perfect unanimity
and peace. <B>5</B>. Opposition, when two planets are
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
180<SUP>o</SUP> apart, or exactly opposite each other, which is considered
an aspect of perfect hatred, and implies every kind of misfortune.
<P>
The Planets are said to be in their <I>joys </I>when situated in the houses
where they are most strong and powerful, thus<B>:</B>
<P>
Saturn in Aquarius, Jupiter in Sagittarius, Mars in Scorpio. the Sun in Leo,
Venus in Taurus, Mercury in Virgo, and the Moon in Cancer. Cogent reasons
are given why the planets should joy in these houses rather than others.
<P>
The <I>Dragon's Head </I>and <I>Dragon's Tail </I>are the points. called
nodes, in which the ecliptic is intersected by the orbits of the planets,
particularly by that of the moon. These points are, of course, shifting.
The <I>Dragon's Head </I>is the point where the moon or other planet commences
its northward latitude; it is considered masculine and benevolent in its
influence. The <I>Dragon's Tail </I>is the point where the planets' southward
progress begins; it is feminine and malevolent.
<P>
The <I>Part of Fortune </I>is the distance of the moon's place from the sun,
added to the degrees of the ascendent.
<P>
The Twelve Planetary <I>Houses </I>are determined by drawing certain great
circles through the intersection of the horizon and meridian, by which the
whole globe or sphere is apportioned into twelve equal parts. In practice
these lines are projected by a very simple method on a plane. The space in
the centre of the figure thus described may be supposed to represent the
situation of the earth, and is generally used to write down the exact time
when the figure was erected. and for whose nativity, or for what question.
Each division or house rules certain events in this order, reckoned from
the east <B>1</B>, life or person; <B>2</B>, riches; <B>3</B>, brethren or
kindred; <B>4</B>, parents; <B>5</B>, children; <B>6</B>, servants and sickness;
<B>7</B>, marriage; <B>8</B>, death; <B>9</B>, religion; <B>10</B>, magistracy;
<B>11</B>, friends; <B>12</B>, enemies. These categories are made to comprehend
all that can possibly befall any individual, and the prognostication is drawn
from the configuration of the planets in one or more of these " houses."
<P>
The <I>Horoscope </I>denotes the configuration of the planets in the twelve
houses ascertained for the moment of nativity, or the hour of the question.
The Ascendent (a term sometimes used instead of horoscope) is the planet
rising in the east or first house, which marks the general character of the
child then born. Hyleg is another term for the lord of life; Anareta for
the destroyer of life, which are considered the chief places in a horoscope.
<P>
The <I>Characters </I>used in <I>astrology, </I>to denote the twelve signs,
the planets, etc., are as follows<B>:</B>
<P>
<B></B>&nbsp;
<P>
<B>&nbsp;</B>
<P>
<IMG SRC="signs1.JPG" WIDTH="446" HEIGHT="766">

<P>
<P>
These characters represent natural object", but they have also a hieroglyphic
or esoteric meaning that ha" been lost. The figure of Aries represents the
head and horns of a ram; that of Taurus, the head and horns of a bull that
of Leo, the head and mane of a lion; that of Gemini, two persons standing
together, and so of the rest. The physical or astronomical reasons for the
adoption of these figures have been explained with great learning by the
Abbe Pluche, in his <I>Histoire du Ciel. </I>and Dupuis, in his <I>Abrege
de l'Origine de tous les Cultes, </I>has endeavoured to establish the principles
of an astro-mythology, by tracing the progress of the moon through the twelve
sign's. in a series of adventures, which he compares with the wanderings
of Isis. This kind of reasoning is suggestive, certainly, but it only establishes
analogies. and proves nothing.
<P>
<I></I>
<P>
Nativities.-The cases in which astrological predictions were chiefly sought,
were in Nativities ; that is in ascertaining the fate and fortunes of any
individual from the positions of the stars at the time of his birth; and
in questions called <I>horary, </I>which comprehended almost every matter
which might be the subject of astrological inquiry. The event of sickness,
the success of any undertaking, the reception of any suit, were all objects
of horary questions. A person was said to be born under that planet which
ruled the hour of his birth. Thus two hours every day are under the control
of Saturn. The first hour after sunrise 'in Saturday is one of them. A person
therefore born on Saturday in the first hour after sunrise, has Saturn for
the lord of his ascendant; those born in the next hour, Jupiter; and so on
in order. Venus rules the first hour on Friday; Mercury on Wednesday Jupiter
on Thursday, the sun and moon on Sunday and Monday, and Mars on Tuesday.
The next thing is to make a figure divided into twelve portions, which are
called houses. as directed above. The twelve houses are equal to the twelve
signs, and the planets, being always in the zodiac, will therefore all fall
within these twelve divisions or houses. The line, which separates any house
from the preceding, is called the cusp of the house. The first house is called
the ascendant, and the east angle; the fourth the imum coeli, or the north
angle; the seventh, the west angle; and the tenth, the medium coeli, or the
south angle. Having drawn this figure, tables and directions are given for
the placing of the signs, and as one house is equal to one sign when one
is given, the rest are given also. When the signs and planets are all placed
in the houses, the next thing is to augur, from their relative position,
what influence they will have on the life and fortunes of the native.
<P>
The House of Life implies all that affects, promotes, or endangers life.
Saturn or Mars in this house denotes a short or unfortunate life, while Jupiter
and Venus have, when free from evil aspects, an exactly contrary effect.
The sign ascending will considerably modify the person and character of the
native, so that to form an astrological judgment of this it will be necessary
to combine the indications of the sign and the planet. In what are called
horary questions, this house relates to all questions of life, health, and
appearance, such as stature, complexion, shape, accidents and sickness. It
shows the events of journeys and voyages, with respect to the life and health
of those engaged in them. When the question is of a political nature it signifies
the people in general, and being of the same nature as Aries, all that is
said of that sign may be transferred to this house.
<P>
The second house, which is of the same nature as the sign Taurus, is called
the house of riches. It signifies the advancement in the world with respect
to opulence of the querent; and here the operations of the planets are, as
in other cases, according to their own nature, Jupiter, Venus, Mercury, and
the Sun being fortunate, if well aspected, only denoting different cause"
of wealth; Saturn, Mars, the Moon, and Uranus, unfortunate. In horary questions,
it signifies the money of the querent, or the success in a pecuniary point
of view of any expedition of undertaking. It concerns loans, lawsuits, and
everything by which riches may be gained or lost. In political questions
it signifies the treasury, public loans, taxes, and subsidies; the younger
branches of the blood-royal, and the death of national enemies.
<P>
The third house is the house of kindred, particularly of brothers, and was
probably so designated on account of the third sign Gemini, of which nature
it is said to be. It denotes kindred, and the planets in this house are full
of signification. Saturn signifies coldness and distrust; Mars, sudden, violent
and hasty quarrels; Herschel, all unaccountable estrangements; Jupiter denotes
steady friendships, Venus great love between brothers and sisters, and good
fortune by means of the latter; the Sun, warm attachment<B>:</B> the Moon,
indifference. In horary questions. this house signifies the health, fortune
and happiness of the querent's parents, his own patrimony and inheritance,
and the ultimate consequences, either good or bad, of any undertaking in
which he may be engaged. In political cases it denotes the landed interest
of a nation the ancient and chartered rights of all classes, which have been
handed down to them from their ancestors; and all public advocates and defenders
of these interests and rights.
<P>
The fifth house, which has the same government, and partakes of the same
character as Leo, is called the House of Children. In nativities, therefore,
it denotes the children of the native, and their success and also his own
success by means of them. It also has some reference to women. The health
and welfare of children, whether present or absent, are determinable by the
planets in this house. It also denotes all questions relative to amusement,
simply, as it would seem, on account of the fondness of youth for such pursuits.
In political questions consequently, we find this house taken to signify
the rising generation, theatres, exhibitions, public festivals, and all national
amusements; all increase in the population; music and musical taste, sculpture,
painting, and the advancement of the fine arts in general.
<P>
The sixth house is that of servants, but it also denotes sickness and private
enemies. It is usually considered an evil house and but few configurations
of the planets which can take place in it are fortunate. It is of the nature,
and shares the government of Virgo. When the lord of the ascendant is placed
in this house, it denotes a low station, and if in addition to this he be
ill dignified. the native will not rise above menial employments. In horary
<I>astrology </I>it points out servants and cattle, dependents, and small
shopkeepers; uncles and aunts by the fathers side ; tenants, stewards, shepherds
and farmers. If, however, the question be political, then this house indicates
the under-servants of the government; the common seamen in the navy, private
soldiers in the army, and the general health of the nation. This last refers
chiefly to contagious and epidemic disorders.
<P>
The seventh house, which is of the same nature as Libra, and has the same
government. is the House of Marriage. If Saturn be found here, he denotes
unhappiness from constitutional causes; Mars from difference of temper; Herschel,
as usual. from some strange and unaccountable dislike. The other planets
are mostly causers of good, unless exception be made in the case of the Moon.
In horary questions, this house denotes love, speculations in business, partners
in trade, lawsuits, and litigation; it is the House of Thieves, and sets
forth their conduct and character. In queries of a political nature, it signifies
the event of any war, and the consequences of a treaty; it personates the
victorious nation, army, or navy, and indicates outlaws and fugitives, with
the places in which they have taken their retreat.
<P>
The eighth house is the House of Death. It denotes wills, legacies, and all
property depending upon the death of others; the power, means, and influence
of adversaries; the opposing parties in lawsuits. It is of the nature of
Scorpio, and has the same government. If Mars be unfortunately placed in
this house, it portends a violent death to the native. Saturn is often productive
of suicide, and Herschel of the mysterious disappearance of the unhappy
individual, whose horoscope is so marked. Jupiter, on the contrary, and Venus,
point out a late and quiet departure. In horary questions its significance
has been already noticed, but it also denotes the portion or dowry of women,
and seconds in duels. In political questions it has a signification of a
very different character, viz., the privy council of a king or queen, their
friends, and secrets of state. It does, however, bear some mark of its
appropriation to death, by being made to denote the rate of mortality among
the people.
<P>
The ninth house is that of religion, science, and learning. It has the same
government and nature as Sagittarius. Jupiter is the most fortunate planet
in it, and if joined with Mercury, then the native is promised a character
at once learned, estimable, and truly religious. The Sun and Venus are likewise
good significators here, but the Moon denotes a changeable mind, and frequent
alterations in religious principles. Mars is the worst planet in this house,
and portends an indifference, or even an active hostility to religion. In
horary questions the ninth house is appropriated to the church and the clergy
; all ecclesiastical matters, dissent, heresy, schism, dreams, visions, and
religious delusions. It also denotes voyages and travels to distant lands,
and in questions of a political nature, the religion of the nation, and all
the higher and more solemn courts of justice, such as Chancery, etc.
<P>
The tenth house is one of the most important of all. It is the House of Honour,
Rank, and Dignity; of the nature and rule of Capricorn. In this house the
planets are more powerful than in any other, save only the House of Life.
They point out the employment, success, preferment, and authority of the
native. Saturn is here the worst planet, but the Moon and Herschel are also
mischievous, the latter by preventing tile native from attaining that rank
to which his services, learning, or merit entitle him, and doing this by
a series of inexplicable disappointments. Jupiter and the Sun signify advancement
by the favour of distinguished men, and Venus, of distinguished women. In
horary questions, the tenth house signifies the mother of the querist; and
politically the sovereign. This is a house in which Mars is not unfortunate,
if well placed denoting war-like achievements and consequent honours.
<P>
The eleventh house is the House of Friends<B>:</B> it is of the nature of
Aquarius, and has the same rule. It denotes, of course, friends, well-wishers,
favourites, and flatterers, but is said to be a house in which evil planets
are increased in strength, and good planets diminished. The Sun is the best
planet in it, and Mars the worst. In horary question" it has the same
signification as in a nativity, and also denotes the expectations and wishes
of the querist. It is said to be much influenced by the sign which is in
it, and to signify legacies, if the sign be one of the earthy triplicity,
and honour with princes, if it be one of the fiery triplicity. In political
questions, the eleventh house signifies the allies of the public, with whom
no particular treaty is at the same time binding; and also the general council
of the nation, and newly acquired rights.
<P>
Lastly, the twelfth house, which, of course, partakes the rule and character
of Pisces, is the House of Enemies, and denotes sorrow, sickness, care, anxiety,
and all kinds. of suffering. Yet evil planets are weaker, according to some
writers, and good planets stronger than in certain other houses. Very few
configurations in this house are esteemed for the native, but its evil effects
are, of course, greatly modified by the planetary influences. In horary questions
it signifies imprisonment, treason, sedition, assassination, and suicide;
and in questions which are of a political character, it points out deceitful
treaties, unsuccessful negotiations, treachery in the offices of state, captivity
to princes, and general ill fortune. The criminal code, and the punishment
of culprits, dungeons, and circumstances connected with prison discipline
are also denoted by this house. Saturn is the worst, and Venus the best planet
to be present in it.
<P>
Having taken notice of the signs, the planets, and the houses, it is next
necessary for the astrologer to note also the aspects of the planets one
towards another, which aspects decide whether the planet is of good or evil
signification. These aspects are as follows - omitting the less
important<B>:</B>
<P>
<STRONG>1</STRONG>. The Trine, marked&nbsp;
<IMG SRC="trine.jpg" WIDTH="77" HEIGHT="47">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when two planets

<STRONG>2</STRONG>. The Sectile, marked&nbsp;&nbsp;

These are all fortunate aspects, and are here placed according to their
importance.
<P>
<STRONG>4</STRONG>. The Conjunction,&nbsp;&nbsp;
<IMG SRC="conjunction.JPG" WIDTH="62" HEIGHT="66">&nbsp;&nbsp; when two stars

here placed.

Horary questions are subjects of astrological calculations. They are so called,
because the scheme of the heavens is
<P>
erected for the hour in which the question is put. Thus, let a person be
sick, and the question be of his recovery, the Houses will now signify as
follows, says Blagrave

And according to the position of the planets the above particulars are to
be judged of. If the question be of stolen goods, a distribution of the houses
is again made according to similar rules. And here the colour denoted by
the signs is pertinent; for let Mercury signify the thief, then the sign
in which that planet is found will denote the personal appearance and complexion
of the thief. If the question be one concerning marriage, then it points
out that of the future bride or bridegroom; and so on.

Athanor This occult hill is surrounded by mist excepting the southern side,
which is clear. It has a well, which is four paces in breadth, from which
an azure vapour ascends, which is drawn up by the warm sun. The bottom of
the well is covered with red arsenic. Near it is a basin filled with fire
from which rises a livid flame odourless and smokeless, and never higher
or lower than the edge of the basin. Also there are two black stone reservoirs,
in one of which the wind is kept, and in the other the rain. In extreme drought
the rain-cistern is opened and clouds escape, which water the whole country.
The term is also employed to denote moral and philosophical alchemy.
<P>
Atlantis <B>:</B> a supposed sunken continent. which. according to some accounts,
occupied most of the area of the present Atlantic Ocean. It is dealt with
here because of late years several accounts purporting to come from certain
spirit "controls" have been published which give a more or less detailed
description of the history, life and manners of its inhabitants, and it is
of interest to Theosophists. The question regarding the existence of such
a continent is a very vexed one indeed. It appears to have originated at
an early date, for Plato in his <I>Timaeus </I>states that the Atlantians
overran Europe and were only repulsed by the Greeks. It is stated that the
Hindu priesthood believed; and still believe that it once existed; and there
are shadowy legends among the American native races which would seem to assist
these beliefs. At the same time definite proof is conspicuous by its absence.
Brasseur de Bourbourg held that <I>Atlantis </I>was an extension of America
which stretched from Central America and Mexico, far into the Atlantic, the
Canaries, Madeiras and Azores being the only remnants which were not submerged;
and many similar fantastic theories have been advanced. Donnelly undertook
to
<P>
prove the existence of such a continent by modern scientific methods, and
located the <I>Atlantis </I>of Plato as an island opposite the entrance to
the Mediterranean-a remnant of the lost continent. He thought that <I>Atlantis
</I>was the region where men first arose from barbarism to civilisation.
and that all the civilised peoples of Europe and America derived their culture
thence<B>:</B> that it was indeed the antediluvian world of the Garden of
Eden; that the Atlantians founded a colony in Egypt; and that the Phoenician
alphabet was the Atlantian alphabet <B>:</B> that not only the Aryan but
the Semitic people, and perhaps the " Turanian" races, emerged
therefrom<B>:</B> that it perished in a terrible revolution of nature in
which the whole island sank into the ocean with nearly all its inhabitants;
and that only a few persons escaped to tell the story of the catastrophe,
which has survived to our time in the flood and deluge legend.' of the Old
and New worlds. Even some serious scientist's have not disdained to examine
the question, and it is claimed that ocean deposits show remains of what
must have been at one time a land above the ocean. The theory that the Atlantians
founded the civilisations of Central America and Mexico has been fully proven
to be absurd, as that civilisation is distinctly of an aboriginal nature,
and of comparatively late origin. <I>(See </I>Spence, <I>Myths of Mexico
and Peru.) </I>The late Dr. Augustus le Plongeon and his wife spent many
years in trying to prove that a certain Queen Moo of Yucatan, founded a colony
in Egypt; but as they professed to be able to read hieroglyphs that no one
else could decipher, and many of which were not hieroglyphs at all but ornamental
designs, and as they placed side by side and compared with the Egyptian alphabet
a "Mayan "alphabet, which certainly never originated anywhere but in their
own ingenuity, we cannot have much faith in their conclusions. We do not
learn from Dr. le Plongeons's works by what course of reasoning he came to
discover that the name of his heroine was the rather uneuphonious one of
Moo, but probably he arrived at it by the same process as that by which he
discovered the "Mayan" alphabet. He further assumes that his story is taken
up where he ends it by the <I>Manuscript Troano, </I>which is, however, chiefly
calendric and not historical. Some years ago a French scientist left a large
sum of money for research in connection with the sunken continent of
<I>Atlantis, </I>and this has been fully taken advantage of by a certain
author, who is pursuing his investigations in a practical manner.
<P>
The claims of certain spiritualists and occultists to restore the history
of <I>Atlantis </I>are about as successful as those of the pseudo-scientists
who have approached the question. They claim to have reconstructed almost
the entire history, of the island-continent by means of messages from spirit
controls, which acquaint us minutely with the polity, life, religion and
magical system of the Atlantians; but in the face of scientific knowledge
and probability these accounts fail to convince, and are obviously of the
nature of imaginative fiction. There is also a certain body of occult tradition
concerning <I>Atlantis </I>which may either have originated from oriental
sources, or else have come into being in the imagination's of later occultists;
and this is to some extent crystallised in the works in question. It would
be rash to say that such a continent as <I>Atlantis </I>never existed; but
it would be equally foolish to say so dogmatically without a backing of much
greater proof than we at present possess on the subject.

Atman : translated "Soul," but better rendered "Self," and meaning in the
Hindu religion the union of the soul with God. It is believed that the soul
is neither body nor mind, nor even thought, but that these are merely conditions
by which the soul is clouded so that it loses its sense of oneness with God.
In the Upanishads it is said "The Self, smaller than small, greater than
great, is hidden in the heart of the creature,"' and " In the beginning there
was Self."

Aura : An emanation said to surround human beings, chiefly encircling the
head, and supposed to proceed from the nervous system. It is described as
a cloud of light suffused with various colours. This is seen clairvoyantly,
being imperceptible to the physical sight.
<P>
Some authorities trace the existence of the <I>aura </I>in such scriptural
instances as the bright light shining about Moses, which the children of
Israel were unable to look upon, when he descended from the mountain bearing
the stone tablets engraved with the Ten Commandments; in the exceedingly
brilliant light which shone round about St. Paul's vision at the time of
his conversion; and in the transfiguration of Jesus Christ, when his raiment
shone so brightly that no fuller on earth could whiten it. Many of the medieval
saints were said to be surrounded with a cloud of light. Of St. John of the
Cross it is told that when at the altar or kneeling in prayer, a certain
brightness darted from his face. St Philip Neri was constantly seen enveloped
in light; St. Charles Borromeo was similarly illuminated. This is said to
be due to the fact that when a person is engaged in lofty thought and spiritual
aspiration, the auric colours become for the time being, more luminous and
translucent, therefore more easily discernible. In Christian art, round the
heads of saints and the sacred characters, is to be found portrayed the halo
or nimbus which is supposed to represent the <I>aura; </I>sometimes the luminous
cloud is shown around the whole of the body as well as the head, when it
is called <I>aureola. </I>It is also thought that the colours of the body
and clothing in medieval paintings and stained glass are intended to represent
the auric colours of the person portrayed. The crowns and distinctive
head-dresses worn by the kings and priests of antiquity, are said to be symbolic
of the <I>aura. </I>In many of the sacred books of the East, representations
of the great teachers and holy men are given with the light extending round
the whole of the body. Instances of this may be found in the temple caves
of India and Ceylon, in the Japanese Buddhistic book', also in Egypt, Greece,
Mexico and Peru. In occult literature the tradition of the aura is an old
one, Paracelsus, in the <B>16</B>th century, making mention of it in the
following terms "The vital force is not enclosed in man, hut radiates round
him like a luminous sphere, and it may be made to act at a distance. In these
semi-natural rays the imagination of man may produce healthy or morbid effects.
It may poison the essence of life and cause diseases, or it may purify it
after it has been made impure, and restore the health." Again<B>:</B> Our
thoughts are simply magnetic emanations, which, in escaping from our brains,
penetrate into kindred heads and carry thither, with a reflection of our
life, the mirage of our secrets." A modern theosophical description is as
follows<B>:</B> "The aura is a highly complicated and entangled manifestation,
consisting of many influences operating within the same area. Some of the
elements composing the aura are projected from the body, others from the
astral principles, and others again from the more spiritual principles connected
with the" Higher Self," or permanent Ego; and the various auras are not lying
one around the other, but are all blended together and occupy the same place.
Guided by occult training. the clairvoyant faculty may make a complete analysis
of the various elements in the aura and can estimate the delicate tints of
which it is composed-though all blended together-as if each were seen
separately."
<P>
Classified more exactly. the divisions of the aura are stated to be<B>:</B>
I, the health aura; <B>2</B>, the vital aura; <B>3</B>, the " Karmic" aura,
that of the animal soul in man; <B>4</B>, the aura of character; <B>5</B>,
the aura of the spiritual nature.
<P>
The " health aura " is thus described <B>:</B> " It is almost colourless,
but becomes perceptible by reason of possessing a curious system of radial
striation, that is to say, it is composed of an enormous number of straight
lines, radiating evenly in all directions from the body." The second, or
"vital" aura, is said to he to a certain extent under the control of the
will, when it circulates within the " linga charira" or astral body, of a
" delicate rosy tint, which it loses, becoming bluish as it radiates outward,"
The third aura is "the field of manifestation, or the mirror in which every
feeling, every desire is reflected." Of this aura the colours constantly
change, as seen by the clairvoyant vision. "An outburst of anger will charge
the whole aura with deep red flashes on a dark ground, while sudden terror
will, in a moment, change everything to a ghastly grey. The fourth aura is
that of the permanent character, and is said to contain the record of the
past earth life of the personality. The fifth aura is not often seen even
by clairvoyants, but it is described by those who have seen it, only in the
cases where the spiritual nature is the most powerful factor, as " outshining
all the rest of the auras with startling brilliancy." The auric colour, it
is declared, cannot be adequately described in terms of the ordinary colours
discernible to the physical vision, being very much brighter, and of more
varied hues and shades. The symbolic meaning of these is roughly of the following
order<B>:</B>
<P>
Rose, pure affection; brilliant red, anger and force; dirty red, passion
and sensuality; yellow, of the purest lemon colour, the highest type of
intellectual activity; orange, intellect used for selfish ends, pride and
ambition; brown, avarice. Green is a colour of varied significance; its root
meaning is the placing of one's self in the position of another. In its lower
aspects it represents deceit and jealousy; higher up in the emotional gamut,
it signifies adaptability, and at its very highest, when it tells on the
colour of foliage, sympathy, the very essence of thinking for other people.
In some shades green stands for the lower intellectual and critical faculties,
merging into yellow. Blue indicates religious feeling and devotion, its various
shades being said to correspond to different degrees of devotion, rising
from fetishism to the loftiest religious idealism, Purple represents psychic
faculty, spirituality, regality. spiritual power arising from knowledge,
and occult pre-eminence.

Australia : <I>Native Magic.-From </I>birth to death, the native Australian
or black-fellow is surrounded by magical influences, In many tribes the power
to perform magic, "sympathetic" or otherwise, is possessed by only a few
people; but among the central tribes it is practised by both men and women-more
often, however, by the former, who conserve the knowledge of certain forms
of their own. There is also among them a distinct class of medicine-men,
whose duty it is to discover whose magic has caused the death of anyone.
Among the central tribes, unlike many others, magic is not made a means of
profit or emolument. A heavy taboo rests on a great many things that the
boy or young man would like to do, and this is for the behoof of the older
men of the tribe, who attach to themselves the choicest morsels of food and
so forth. Among girls and women the same law applies; and the latter are
sternly forbidden to go near the places where the men perform their magical
ceremonies, To terrify them away from such spots, the natives have invented
an instrument called a "bull-roarer "-a thin slip of wood swung round at
the end of a string, which makes a screaming, whistling noise, which the
women believe is the voice of the Great Spirit. The natives preserve long
oval pieces of wood, which they call <I>churingas. </I>In these are supposed
to remain the spirits of their ancestors, so that in reality they are of
a fetish nature, These are kept concealed in the most secret manner.
<P>
<I></I>
<P>
Sympathetic Magic is of course rife amongst such a primitive people. Certain
ceremonies are employed to control nature so as to ensure a plentiful supply
of food and water, or to injure an enemy. One of the commonest forms of these
is the use of the pointed stick or bone, which is used in one form or another
by all Australian tribes. The former is a small piece of wood, varying in
length from three to eighteen inches, resembling a skewer, and tapering to
a point. At the handle end it is topped with a knob of resin, to which is
attached a strand of human hair. Magical songs are sung over it, to endow
it with occult potency, The man who wishes to use it goes into the bush singly,
or with a friend, where he will be free from observation, and planting the
stick in the ground, mutters over it what he desires to happen to his enemy.
It is then left in the ground for a few days. The evil magic is supposed
to proceed from the stick to the man, who often succumbs, unless a medicine-man,
chances to discover the implement.
<P>
The Australian savage has a special dread of magic connected with places
at a distance, and any magical apparatus purchased or obtained from far-away
tribes is supposed to possess potency of much greater kind than if it had
been made among themselves. Thus certain little stones traded by Northern
tribes are supposed to contain a very powerful form of evil magic called
<I>mauia. </I>These are wrapped up in many folds of bark and string, According
to their traditions this type of magic was first introduced by a Bat-man,
who dropped it to earth where it made a great explosion at a certain spot,
whence it can still be procured. Sticks procured from a distance, with which
the natives chastise their wives, are sufficient by their very sight to make
the women obey their husbands. Much mystery surrounds what are known as
"debil-debil "'shoes, which consist of a pad of emu feathers, rounded at
both ends, in order that no one should be able to trace in which direction
the wearer is journeying. These are supposed to be worn by a being called
<I>kurdaitcha, </I>to whom deaths are attributed. Like other savages, the
Australian native believes that death is always due to evil magic. A man
may become a <I>kurdaitcha </I>by submitting to a certain ceremony, in which
the little toe of his foot is dislocated. Dressed up and painted grotesquely,
he sets out accompanied by a medicine-man and wearing the <I>kurdaitcha
</I>shoes, when he desires to slay an enemy. When he spears him, the medicine-man
closes up the wound, and the victim returns to consciousness oblivious of
the fact that he is full of evil magic; but in a while he sickens and dies;
and then it is known that he has been attacked by a <I>kurdaitcha. </I>Many
long and elaborate ceremonies are connected with the <I>churinga, </I>and
these have been well described by Messrs. Spencer and Gillen, Howitt, Fison,
and others.
<P>

<P>
Spiritualism in Australia has both a public and private representation. The
latter is far more general than the former in every country ,except America,
but although demonstrations of spirit power are more commonly known in Australia
amongst individuals and families, than on the rostrum, or through the columns
of the journals, they are less available for the purposes of historical record.
It seems that many Australian colonists had heard of the Spiritualist movement
before settling in the country, and on their arrival, pursuing the customary
methods of unfoldment through the spirit circle, a deep interest was awakened
long before public attention was called to the subject. In Sydney, Melbourne,
Ballarat, Geelong, Brisbane, and numerous other towns and mining districts,
communion with spirits was successfully practised in circles and families,
up to about <B>1867</B>. After that epoch it seems to have become the subject
of various journalistic reports of the usual adverse, eulogistic, or
non-committal character. At or about that period, a large number of influential
persons became interested in the matter, and not a few whose names were a
sufficient guarantee of their good faith, began to detail wonderful experiences
in the columns of the public journals. The debate and denial, rejoinder and
defence, called forth by these narratives, served as propaganda of the movement,
and rendered each freshly recorded manifestation, the centre of an ever-widening
circle of interest.
<P>
In Victoria a gentleman of considerable wealth and learning, writing under
the <I>nom de plume </I>of " Schamlyn," entered into a warm controversy with
the editor of the <I>Collingwood Advertiser, </I>in defence of Spiritualism.
Another influential supporter of the Spiritual cause who was an early convert,
and for a time became a pillar of strength in its maintenance, was a gentleman
connected with the editorial department of the <I>Melbourne Argus, </I>one
of the leading journals of Victoria, and an organ well calculated to exert
a powerful sway over the minds of its readers.
<P>
As the tides of public opinion moved on, doctors, lawyers, merchants, and
men of eminence began to joins the ranks. Tidings of phenomena of the most
astounding character poured in from distant towns and districts. Members
of the press began to share the general infection, and though some would
not, and others could not avow their convictions, their private prepossessions
induced them to open their columns for debate and correspondence on the subject.
To add to the stimulus thus imparted, many of the leading colonial journals
indulged in tirades of abuse and misrepresentation, which only served to
increase the contagion without in the least diminishing its force. At length
the clergy began to arouse themselves and manifest their interest by furious
abuse. Denunciation provoked retort; discussion compelled investigation.
In Sydney, many converts of rank and influence suddenly appeared. The late
Hon. John Bowie Wilson, Land Minister, and a champion of temperance, became
an open convert to Spiritualism, and by his personal influence no less than
his public defence of the cause made converts unnumbered. Amongst the many
others whose names have also been recorded in the ranks of Spiritualism in
Sydney may be mentioned Mr. Henry Gale, Mrs. Wilson and Mrs. Gale, Mrs. Woolley
and Mrs, Greville, besides a number of other ladies ; Mr. Greville, M.P.,
and several other member's of the New South Wales Parliament and Cabinet;
Hon. J. Windeyer, Attorney-General of the Colony, subsequently one of the
judges; Mr. Alfred De Lissa, an eminent barrister; Mr. Cyril Haviland, a
literary man; Mr. Macdonald; Captain Barron; Mr.. Milner Stephen a barrister
of eminence, his wife and family, and many others. Another who did more to
advance the cause of Spiritualism, and crystallize its scattered fragments
into concrete strength than any other individual in the ranks was Mr. Wm.
Terry, the well-known and enterprising editor of the Melbourne <I>Harbinger
of Light </I>Spiritual organ,
<P>
"About <B>1869</B> ", says Mr. H. Tuttle, " the necessity for a Spiritualistic
journal was impressed deeply on the mind of Mr. Terry. He could not cast
it <I>off, </I>but pondered over the enterprise. At this time, an exceedingly
sensitive patient described a spirit holding a scroll on which was written
"Harbinger of Light" and the motto, "Dawn approaches, error is passing away;
men arising shall hail the day." This influenced him, and in August
<B>1870</B>, he set to work to prepare the first number, which appeared on
the <B>1</B>st of September of that year.
<P>
"There was no organisation in Australian Spiritualism, and Mr. Terry saw
the advantage and necessity of associative movement. He consulted a few friends,
and in November, <B>1870</B>, he organised the first Victorian Association
of Spiritualists. A hall was rented, and Sunday services, consisting of essays
and reading by members, enlivened by appropriate hymns, were held. In October,
<B>1872</B>, impressed with the desirability of forming a Lyceum, he called
together a few willing workers, and held the first session on October
<B>20</B>th, <B>1872</B>. It is, and has been from the first in a flourishing
condition, numbering one hundred and fifty members, with a very handsome
and complete outfit, and excellent library. He has remained an officer ever
since, and conductor four sessions. He assisted in the establishment of the
Spiritualist and Free-thought Association, which succeeded the original one,
and was its first president. He has lectured occasionally to appreciative
audiences, and his lectures have been widely circulated. His mediumship,
which gave such fair promise, both in regard to writing and speaking, became
controlled, especially for the relief of the sick. Without the assistance
of advertising he has acquired a fine practice. With this he combines a trade
in Reform and Spiritualistic publications, as extensive as the colony, and
the publication of the <I>Harbinger of Light, a </I>Spiritual journal that
is an honour to the cause, and well sustains the grand philosophy of immortality.
No man is doing more for the cause or has done more efficient work,"
<P>
A short but interesting summary of the rise and progress of Spiritualism
in Australia is given in the American <I>Banner of Light, </I><B>1880</B>,
in which Mr. Terry's good service is again alluded to, and placed in line
with that of several other pioneers of the movement, of whom mention has
not yet been made. It is as follows<B>:</B>
<P>
"The <I>Harbinger of Light, </I>published at Melbourne, Australia, furnishes
a review of the origin of its publication and the work it has accomplished
during the ten years just closed. At its advent in <B>1870</B>, considerable
interest had been awakened in the subject of Spiritualism, by the lectures
of Mr. Nayler, in Melbourne, and Mr. Leech, at Castlemaine. The leaders of
the church became disturbed, and seeing their gods in danger, sought to stay
the progress of what would eventually lessen their influence and possibly
their income. But Mr. Nayler spoke and wrote with more vigour<B>:</B> the
addresses of Mr. Leech were published from week to week in pamphlet form,
and widely distributed. At the same time, Mr. Charles Bright, who had published
letters on Spiritualism in the <I>Argus, </I>over an assumed name, openly
identified himself with the movement, and spoke publicly on the subject.
Shortly after, eleven persons met and formed an association, which soon increased
to eighty members. A hymn-book was compiled, and Sunday services began. As
elsewhere, the press ridiculed, arid the pulpit denounced Spiritualism as
a delusion. A number of articles in the <I>Argus </I>brought some of the
facts prominently before the public, and the growing interest was advanced
by a public discussion between Messrs, Tyerman and Blair. In <B>1872</B>,
a Sunday school, on harmonial principles, was established, Mr. W. H. Terry,
the proprietor of the <I>Harbinger, </I>being its first conductor. Almost
simultaneously with this was the visit of Dr. J. M. Peebles, whose public
lectures and work in the Lyceum served to consolidate the movement. A controversy
in the <I>Age, </I>between Rev. Mr. Potter, Mr. Tyerman and Mr. Terry, brought
the facts and teachings of Spiritualism into further notice.
<P>
"Soon came Dr. Peebles, Thomas Walker, Mrs. Britten and others, who widened
the influence of the spiritualistic philosophy, and aided the <I>Harbinger
</I>in its efforts to establish Spiritualism on a broad rational basis. Mr.
W. H. Terry is deserving of all praise for his unselfish and faithful exertions
in carrying the <I>Harbinger </I>through the years of as hard labour as ever
befell any similar enterprise, and we bespeak for him, in his continued efforts
to make known the evidences of a future existence, and the illuminating truths
of Spiritualism, the hearty co-operation and sympathy of all friends of the
cause."
<P>
Writing to the <I>Banner of Light </I>on the subject of Mr. Tyerman's accession
to the Spiritual ranks, an esteemed American correspondent says
<P>
"The Rev. J. Tyerman, of the Church of England, resident in one of the country
districts, boldly declared his full reception of Spiritualism as a great
fact, and his change of religious faith consequent upon the teachings of
spirits. Of course, he was welcomed with open arms by the whole body of
Spiritualists in Melbourne, the only city where there was any considerable
number enrolled in one association. He soon became the principal lecturer,
though not the only one employed by the Association, and well bas he wielded
the sword of the new faith. He is decidedly of the pioneer stamp, a skilful
debater, a fluent speaker, ready at any moment to engage with any one, either
by word of mouth or as a writer. So widely, indeed, did he make his influence
felt, and so individual was it, that a new society grew up around him, called
the Free-Thought and Spiritualist Propaganda Society, which remained in existence
till Mr. Tyerman removed to Sydney, when it coalesced with the older association,
under the combined name of Melbourne Spiritualist and Free-Thought Association."
<P>
Another valuable convert to the cause of Spiritualism, at a time when it
most needed good service, was Mrs. Florence Williams, the daughter of the
celebrated English novelist, G. P. R. James, and the inheritor of his talent,
originality of thought, and high culture. This lady for a long time officiated
at the first Spiritual meetings convened for Sabbath Day exercises, as an
acceptable and eloquent lecturer, and her essays would have formed an admirable
epitome of spiritual revelations at the time in which they were delivered.
<P>
The visits of several zealous propagandists have been alluded to in previous
quotations, Amongst the first to break ground as a public exponent of
Spiritualism, was the Rev. J, M. Peebles, formerly a minister of Battle Creek,
Michigan. Mr. Peebles was well known in America as a fine writer and lecturer,
and as such was justified in expecting courteous, if not eulogistic mention
from the press of a foreign country, with whom his own was on terms of amicable
intercourse, How widely different was the journalistic treatment he experienced
may be gathered from his own remarks addressed to the <I>Banner of Light
</I>some five years after his first visit, and describing in graphic terms
the changed spirit which marked alike the progress of the movement and the
alteration in the tone of public opinion. Mr. Peebles says
<P>
"Relative to Spiritualism and its divine principles, public sentiment has
changed rapidly, and for the better, during the past five years. Upon my
late public appearance in Melbourne, the Hon. John McIlwraith, ex-Mayor of
the city, and Commissioner to our. Centennial Exhibition, took the chair,
introducing me to the audience. On my previous visit some of the Spiritualists
seemed a little timid. They preferred being called investigators, remaining
a good distance from the front. Then my travelling companion, Dr. Dunn, was
misrepresented, and meanly vilified in the city journal; while I was hissed
in the market, caricatured in <I>Punch, </I>burlesqued in a theatre, and
published in the daily press as an 'ignorant Yankee,' an 'American trickster,'
a 'long-haired apostate,' and 'a most unblushing blasphemer.' But how changed
I Recently the secular press treated me fairly. Even the usually abusive
<I>Telegraph </I>published Mr. Stevenson's article assuring the Rev. Mr.
Green that I was willing to meet him at once in a public discussion. The
<I>Melbourne Argus, </I>one of the best daily papers in the world, the
<I>Australasian, </I>the <I>Herald, </I>and the <I>Age, </I>all dealt honourably
by me, reporting my lectures, if briefly, with admirable impartiality. The
press is a reflector; and those audiences of <B>2</B>,<B>000</B> and
<B>2</B>,<B>500</B> in the great Opera House on each Sunday for several
successive months, were not without a most striking moral significance. It
seemed to be the general opinion that Spiritualism had never before occupied
so prominent yet so favourable a position in the eyes of the public...."
<P>
Efficient service was rendered to the cause of Spiritualism by Mr. Thomas
Walker, a young Englishman, first introduced in the Colonies by the Rev.
J. M. Peebles. Alleging himself to be a "trance speaker" under the control
of certain spirits, whom he named, Mr. Walker lectured acceptably in Sydney,
Melbourne, and other places in the Colonies on the Spiritual rostrum. In
March, <B>1878</B>, Mr. Walker maintained a public debate with a Mr. M. W.
Green, a minister of a denomination termed "the Church of Christ." This gentleman
had acquired some reputation in the Colonies as a preacher, and as one who
had bitterly opposed, and taken every possible opportunity, to misrepresent
Spiritualism. The debate, which was held in the Temperance Hall, Melbourne,
attracted large audiences, and been extended for several nights beyond the
period originally agreed upon.
<P>
The following extracts are taken from the <I>Melbourne Age, </I>one of the
leading daily journals of the city. They are dated August <B>20</B>th,
<B>1878</B>, and read thus<B>:</B>
<P>
"Spiritualism is just now very much to the front in Melbourne. The lectures
of Mrs. Emma Hardinge-Britten, delivered to crowded audiences at the Opera
House every Sunday evening, have naturally attracted a sort of wondering
curiosity to the subject, and the interest has probably been intensified
by the strenuous efforts that are being made in some of the orthodox pulpits
to prove that the whole thing is an emanation from the devil. The announcement
that the famous Dr. Slade had arrived to strengthen the ranks of the
Spiritualists, has therefore been made at a very critical juncture, and I
should not be surprised to find that the consequence will be to infuse a
galvanic activity into the forces on both sides. Though I do not profess
to be a Spiritualist, I own to having been infected with the fashionable
itch for witnessing 'physical manifestations,' as they are called, and
accordingly I have attended several circles with more or less gratification.
But Dr. Slade is not an ordinary medium even among professionals. The literature
of the Spiritualists is full of his extraordinary achievements, attested
to all appearance by credible witnesses, who have not been ashamed to append
their names to their statements. . . I see that on one occasion, writing
in six different languages was obtained on a single slate, and one day,
accompanied by two learned professors, Dr. Slade had a sitting with the Grand
Duke Constantine, who obtained writing on a new slate held by himself alone.
From St. Petersburg, Dr. Slade went to Berlin, where he is said to have obtained
some marvellous manifestations in the house of Professor Zollner, and where
he was visited by the court conjurer to the Emperor, Samuel
Bellachini&amp;hellip;My object in visiting Dr. Slade can be understood when
I was introduced to him with my friend, whom I shall call Omega, and who
was bent on the same errand. Dr. Slade and Mr. Terry constituted the circle
of four who sat around the table in the centre of the room almost as immediately
as we entered it. There was nothing in the room to attract attention. No
signs of confederacy, human or mechanical. The hour was eleven in the morning.
The window was unshuttered, and the sun was shining brightly. The table at
which we sat was a new one, made especially by Wallach Brothers, of Elizabeth
Street, of polished cedar, having four slight legs, one flap, and no ledges
of any kind underneath. As soon as we examined it Dr. Slade took his seat
on one side facing the window, and the rest of us occupied the other three
seats. He was particularly anxious that we should see he had nothing about
him. It has been said that he wrote on the slate by means of a crumb of pencil
stuck in his finger-nail's, but his nails were cut to the quick, while his
legs and feet were ostentatiously placed away from the table in a side position,
exposed to view the whole time. He first produced a slate of the ordinary
school size, with a wet sponge, which I used to it. A chip of pencil about
the size of a grain of wheat was placed upon it on the table; we joined hands,
and immediately taps were heard about the table, and in answer to a question-'
Will you write ?&amp;rsquo; - from Dr. Slade, three raps were given, and
he forthwith took up the slate with the pencil lying on it, and held half
of it under the table by his finger and thumb, which clasped the corner of
the half that was outside the table, and was therefore easily seen by all
present. His left hand remained near the centre of the table, resting on
those of the two sitters on either side of him. Several convulsive jerks
of his arm were now given, then a pause, and immediately the sound of writing
was audible to every one, a scratching sound interrupted by the tap of the
pencil. which indicated, as we afterwards found, that the t's were being
crossed and the i&amp;rsquo;s dotted. The slate was then exposed, and the
words written were in answer to the question which had been put by Omega
as to whether he had psychic power or not. I pass over the conversation that
ensued on the subject, and go on to the next phenomenon. To satisfy myself
that the 'trick' was not done by means of sympathetic writing on the slate,
I had ten minutes previously purchased a slate from a shop in Bourke Street,
containing three leaves, and shutting up book fashion. This I produced, and
Dr. Slade readily repeated his performance with it. It was necessary to break
the pencil down to a mere crumb, in order to insert it between the leaves
of the slate. This done, the phenomenon at once recurred with this rather
perplexing difference, that the slate. instead of being put half under the
table, forced itself by a series of jerks on to my neck, and reposed quietly
under my ear, in the eyes of everyone present. The scratching then commenced;
I heard the t's crossed and the i's dotted by the moving pencil, and at the
usual signal I opened the slate, and found an intelligible reply to the question
put. . . . The next manifestation was the levitation of one of the sitters
in his chair about a clear foot from the ground, and the levitation of the
table about two feet. I ought to have mentioned that during the whole of
the <I>seance </I>there was a good deal of by-play going on. Everyone felt
the touch of hands more or less, and the sitters' chairs were twice wrenched
from under them, or nearly so, but the psychic could not possibly have done
it

an inside view of Spiritualism in Australia, by republishing one of the many
articles sent by the author to the American Spiritual journals during her
sojourn in the Colonies. The following excerpt' was written as the result

"&amp;rsquo;Spiritualism in these colonies finds little or no public
representation outside of Melbourne or Sydney, nevertheless warm friends
of the cause are scattered all over the land, and endeavours are being made
to enlarge the numerous circles into public meetings, and the fugitive efforts
of whole-hearted individuals into associations as powerful as that which
exists in Melbourne. At present, the at-tempt to effect missionary work in
any portions of Australia outside Sydney or Melbourne, becomes too great
a burden to the luckless individual, who has not only to do the work, but
to bear the entire cost of the undertaking, as I have had to do in my visits
to various towns in Victoria. Expenses which are cheerfully divided amongst
the many in the United States, become all too heavy for endurance when shouldered
upon the isolated workers; hence the paucity of public representation, and
the impossibility of those who visit the Colonies, as I have done, effecting
any important pioneer work beyond the two great centres I have named. Mr.
Walker at Sydney, and I at Melbourne, have been favoured with the largest
gatherings ever assembled at Colonial Sunday meetings.
<P>
"'Having, by desire of my spirit guides, exchanged rostrums, he filling my
place at Melbourne, and I his at Sydney, we find simultaneously at the same
time, and on the same Sundays, the lessees of the two theatres we occupied
raising their rent upon us one hundred and fifty per cent, The freethinkers
and Spiritualists had occupied the theatre in Sydney four years at the rate
of four pounds per Sunday. For my benefit the landlord raised the rent to
ten pounds, whilst the same wonderful spirit of accordance caused the Melbourne
manager to increase upon Mr. Walker from eight pounds to a demand of twenty.
With our heavy expenses and small admission fees this was tantamount to driving
us out altogether. Both of us have succeeded after much difficulty, and fighting
Christian warriors with the Christian arms of subtlety and vigilance, in
securing other places to lecture in and despite the fact that the press insult
us, the pulpit curse us, and Christians generally devote us to as complete
a prophecy of what they would wish us to enjoy everlastingly as their piety
can devise, we are each attracting our thousands every Sunday night, and
making such unmistakable marks on public opinion as will not easily be effaced
again.
<P>
"'Dr. Slade's advent in Melbourne since last September has been productive
of an immense amount of good. How far his labours here will prove remunerative
I am not prepared to say. Frankly speaking, I do not advise Spirit Mediums
or speakers to visit these colonies on financial advancement intent. There
is an abundant crop of Medium power existing, interest enough in the cause,
and many of the kindest hearts and clearest brains in the world to be found
here; but the lack of organisation, to which I have before alluded, and the
imperative necessity for the workers who come here to make their labours
remunerative, paralyses all attempts at advancement, except in the sensation
line. Still I feel confident that with united action throughout the scattered
force of Spiritualistic thought in these Colonies, Spiritualism might and
would supersede every other phase of religious thought in an incredibly short
space of time. I must not omit to mention that the friends in every place
I have visited have been more than kind, hospitable and appreciative. The
public have defied both press and pulpit in their unstinted support of my
lectures. The press have been equally servile, and the Christian world equally
stirred, and equally active in desperate attempts to crush out the obvious
proofs of immortality Spiritualism brings.
<P>
"'In Melbourne, I had to fight my way to comply with an invitation to lecture
for the benefit of the City Hospital. I fought and conquered; and the hospital
committee revenged itself for a crowded attendance at the Town Hall by taking
my money without the grace of thanks, either in public or private, and the
simply formal acknowledgment of my services by an official receipt. In Sydney,
where I now am, I was equally privileged in lecturing for the benefit of
the Temperance Alliance, and equally honoured, after an enthusiastic and
successful meeting, by the daily press of the city in their utter silence
concerning such an important meeting, and their careful record of all sorts
of such trash as they disgrace their columns with. So mote it be. The wheel
will turn some day I

During the years <B>1881</B> and '<B>82</B> the Australian colonists were
favoured with visits from three more well-known American Spiritualists. The
first of these was Professor Denton, an able and eloquent lecturer on geology,
and one who never failed to combine with his scientific addresses, one or
more stirring lectures on Spiritualism. The second propagandist was Mrs.
Ada Foye, one of the best test-writing, rapping, and seeing Mediums, who
has ever appeared in the ranks of Spiritualism; whilst the third was Mrs.
E. L. Watson, a trance-speaker.
<P>
Professor Denton's lectures created a wide-spread interest amongst all classes
of listeners.
<P>
It now becomes necessary to speak of one of the most arbitrary acts of tyranny
on the part of the Victorian Government towards Spiritualism which the records
of the movement can show. This was the interdict promulgated by "the Chief
Secretary', against the proprietor of the Melbourne Opera House, forbidding
him to allow Spiritualists to take money at the door for admission to their
services, and in effect, forbidding them to hold services there at all. A
similar interdict was issued in the case of Mr. Proctor, the celebrated English
lecturer on astronomy. The excuse for this tyrannical procedure in Mr. Proctor's
case, might have been justified on the ground, that the Chief Secretary was
entirely ignorant of the fact, that astronomy had anything to do with religion,
or that it was not orthodox to talk about the celestial bodies on a Sunday,
except in quotations from Genesis, or Revelations; but in the case of "the
Victorian Association of Spiritualists" it was quite another point. Spiritualism
was their religion, and Spiritual lectures their Sabbath Day exercises. Messrs.
Walker, Peebles, and Mrs. Britten, had occupied the Opera House for months
together, and admission fees had been charged at each of their Sunday services,
without let or hindrance. The result of many gatherings for the purpose of
denouncing their policy may be judged by a perusal of the following paragraph
published in the <I>Harbinger of Light </I>of March, <B>1882:-</B>
<P>
"On Friday last a letter was received from the Government by the Executive
of the Victorian Association of Spiritualists, intimating that the former
had no desire to suppress the lectures, but endorsed the permit of May
<B>1879</B>. The directors of the Opera House Company were interviewed, and
on the understanding that no money be taken at the doors, consented to the
opening of the House. The fact being announced in Saturday's papers drew
a large audience to hear Mr. Walker's lecture on Sunday, 'Lord Macaulay on
Roman Catholicism.' The services will be continued as heretofore. Seats in
dress circle or stalls may be hired by month or quarter, at W. H. Terry's
<B>84</B>, Russel Street."
<P>
During Dr. Slade's visit to Sydney, a very able and energetic worker in
Spiritualism became convinced of its truth, in the person of Mr. E. Cyril
Haviland, the author of two excellent pamphlets and many articles, tracts,
and good literary contributions on this subject. Mr. Haviland, Mr. Harold
Stephen, and several other gentlemen of literary repute in Sydney, combined
during the author's last visit to form a "Psychological Society," the members
of which like the persons above named. represented some of the most accomplished
writers and advanced thinkers of the city.

In Austria, Spiritualism was first promulgated by M. Constantine Delby of
Vienna. He was a warm adherent of Allan Kardec, and founded a society under
legal auspices, besides starting a Spiritual journal. The society numbered
but few members, in fact Spiritualism never obtained much foothold in Vienna.
At Buda-Pesth it was quite otherwise. In a short time a considerable amount
of interest was awakened, and many persons of note began to take part in
the circles that were being formed there, amongst these were Mr. Anton Prohasker
and Dr. Adolf Grunhut. At length a society was formed, legalised by the State,
of which Baron Edmund Vay, was elected president. Mr. Lishner, of Pesth.
built a handsome seance room which the society rented. At that time there
were one hundred and ten members, many of them being Hebrews, though all
Christians. Baron Vay was the honorary president, Dr. Grunhut, was the active
president, and these and Mr. Prohasker were amongst the most devoted and
faithful workers. The principles of the society, indeed the basis of it were
taken from the <I>Geist Krap Stoff </I>of Baroness Adelma Von Vay and the
works of Allan Kardec - purely Christian Spiritualism It never encouraged
paid Mediumship. All the officers were voluntary and honorary. It had no
physical Medium, but good trance, writing and seeing mediums.

Automatic Writing and Speaking <B>:</B> Writing executed or speech uttered
without the agent's volition, and sometimes without his knowledge. The term
is used by psychical researchers and applied particularly to the trance phenomena
of the seance-room. By spiritualists, writing or speaking produced under
these conditions, are said to be performed " under control "-that is, under
the con-trolling agency of the spirits of the dead-and are therefore not
judged to be truly "automatic." The general consensus of opinion, however,
ascribes such performances to the subconscious activity of the agent. Automatic
writing and speaking necessarily imply some deviation from the normal in
the subject, though such abnormality need not be pronounced, but may vary
from a slight disturbance of the nerve-centres occasioned by excitement or
fatigue to hystero-epilepsy or actual insanity. When the phenomena are produced
during a state of trance or somnambulism the agent may be entirely unconscious
of his actions. On the other hand the automatic writing may be executed while
the agent is in a condition scarcely varying from the normal and quite capable
of observing the phenomena in a critical spirit, though perhaps ignorant
of a word in advance of what he is actually writing. Between these states
of full consciousness or complete unconsciousness there are many intermediate
stages. The secondary personality, as displayed in the writings or utterances,
may gain only a partial ascendancy over the primary, as may happen in dreams
or in the hypnotic trance. As a rule automatic speech and writings display
nothing more than a revivifying of faded mental imagery, thoughts and conjectures
and impressions which never came to birth in the upper consciousness. But
at times there appears an extraordinary exaltation of memory, or even of
the intellectual faculties. Cases are on record where lost articles have
been recovered by mean's of automatic writing. Foreign languages which have
been forgotten, or with which the subject has small acquaintance, are Spoken
or written fluently. Helene Smith, the 'subject of Professor Flournoy, even
went so far as to invent a new language, purporting to be that of the Martians,
but in reality showing a marked resemblance to French-the mother-tongue of
the medium. Automatic writing and speaking have been produced in considerable
quantities, mainly in connection' with spiritualistic circles, though it
existed long before the advent of spiritualism in the speaking with "tongues"
of the early ecstatics. These unintelligible outpourings are still to be
met with, but are no longer a marked feature of automatic utterance. But,
though the matter and style may on occasion transcend the capabilities of
the agent in his normal state, the great body of automatic productions does
not show an erudition or literary excellence beyond the scope of the natural
resources of the automist. The style is involved, obscure, inflated, yet
possessing a superficial smoothness and a suggestion of flowing periods and
musical cadence's. The ideas are often shallow and incoherent, and all but
lost in a multitude of words. The best known of automatic writings are the
<I>Spirit Teachings </I>of the Rev. Stanton Moses, the works of A. J. Davis,
J. Murray Spear, and Charles Linton, and, perhaps most important of all,
the <I>Trance Utterances </I>of Mrs. Piper, these last offering no inconsiderable
evidence for telepathy. A good deal of poetry has been produced automatically,
notably by the Rev. T. L. Harris. Among those who are known to have produced
automatic writings are Goethe, Victor Hugo, Victorien Sardou, and other eminent
men of letters. (For the hypothesis of spirit control, <I>see article

Avicenna : Named <I>Aben Sina </I>by Hebrew writers, but properly, <I>Ebor
Sina, </I>or-to give his long array of names in full -
A<B><I>1</I></B>-Sheihk Al-Rayis Abu Ali Al-Hossein ben Abdallah ben Sina,
born at Kharmatain, near Bokhara, in the year of the Hegira <B>370</B>. or
A.D. <B>980</B>. He was educated at Bokhara, and displayed such extraordinary
precocity that when he had reached his tenth year, he had completely mastered
the Koran, and acquired a knowledge of algebra, the Mussulman theology, and
the <I>His ab ul-Hind, </I>or arithmetic of the Hindoos. Under Abdallah Al-
Natheli he studied logic, Euclid, and the Almagest.. and then, as a diversion,
devoted himself to the study of medicine. He was only twenty-one years old
when he composed his Kitab al-Majmu or, <I>The Book of the Sum Total, </I>whose
mysteries he afterwards endeavoured to elucidate in a commentary in twenty
volumes. His reputation for wisdom and erudition was so great that on the
death of his father he was promoted by Sultan Magdal Douleth to the high
office of Grand Vizier, which he held with advantage to the State until a
political revolution accomplished the downfall of the Samanide dynasty. He
then quitted Bokhara. and wandered from place to place, increasing his store
of knowledge, but yielding himself to a life of the grossest sensuality.
About <B>1012</B> he retired to Jorjan, where he began his great work on
medicine, which is still held in some repute as one of the earliest systems
of that art with any pretensions to philosophical completeness. It is arranged
with singular clearness, and presents a very admirable resume' of the doctrines
of the ancient Greek physicians, Avicenna subsequently lived at Rul, Kazwin,
and Jspahan, where he became physician to the Persian sovereign, Alaeddaulah.
He is said to have been dismissed from this post on account of his debauched
living. He then retired to Hamadan, where, worn out with years of sensual
indulgence.. he died, at the age of <B>58</B>, in <B>1038</B>. His works
on philosophy. mathematics. and medicine, are nearly one hundred in number,
and include at least seven treatises on the Philosopher's Stone. His <I>Book
of the Canon of Medicine </I>acquired an European celebrity, and has been
several times translated into Latin. Contemporary with Avicenna were numerous
votaries of the alchemistical science, and almost every professor of medicine
was an astrologer The influence of the stars upon the conditions of the human
body was generally accepted as a first principle in medicine; and the possible
transmutation of metals engaged the attention of every inquiring intellect.
At the same time, the Arabians were almost the sole depositaries of human
knowledge; and. in the East glowed that steadily-shining light which, never
utterly extinct, had withdrawn its splendour and its glory from the classic
lands of the West. "They cultivated with success," says Gibbon, "the sub-lime
science of astronomy, which elevates the mind of man to disdain his diminutive
planet and momentary existence." The names of Mesua and Geber, of Rhazis
and Avicenna, are ranked with the Grecian masters; in the city of Bagdad,
eight hundred and sixty physicians were licensed to exercise their lucrative
profession ; in Spain, the life of the Catholic princes was entrusted to
the skill of the Saracens, and the school of Salerno, their legitimate offspring,
revived in Italy and Europe the precepts of the healing art.

Avichi <B>:</B> is the Theosophic hell. Though it is a place of torment,
it differs in great degree from the ordinary conception of hell. its torments
are the torments of fleshly cravings, which for want of a physical body,
cannot be satisfied. A man remains after death exactly the same entity as
he was before it, and, if in life, he has been obsessed with strong desires
or passions, such obsession still continues, though, in the astral plane
in which he finds himself the satisfaction of these desires or passions is
impossible. Of course, the manner of these torments is infinite, whether
it be the confirmed sensualist who suffers them, or more ordinary men who,
without being bound to the. things of the flesh, have nevertheless allowed
the affairs of the world to bulk too largely in their lives, and are now
doomed to regret the small attention they have bestowed on higher matters.
Avichi is a place of regrets for things done and things undone. Its torments
are not, however, eternal, and with the passing of time of which there is
no measure in the astral plane - they are gradually discontinued, though
at the cost of terrible suffering.

King Arthur and his queen Guinevere, accompanied by their favourite knight
Sir Gawane, had whilst hunting in the wilds. of Cumberland. They were overtaken
by darkness, while separated from the rest of the party, and the ghost of
the queen's mother appears to them. The apparition tells of the torments
to which it is being subjected, and entreats that prayers will he offered
up for its release. This the queen and Sir Gawane promise, and on their return

Axinomancy : Divination by means of a hatchet or a woodcutter's axe. It is
by this form of divination that the diviners predicted the ruin of Jerusalem,
as is. seen from Psalm LXXIII. Francois de la Tour-Blanche, who remarked
upon this, does not tell us how the diviners made use of the hatchet. We
can only suppose that it was by one of the two methods employed in ancient
times and still practised in certain northern countries. The first is as
follows<B>:</B> When it is desired to find a treasure, a round agate must
be procured, the head of the axe must be made red-hot in the fire. and so
placed that its edge may stand perpendicularly in the air. The agate must
be placed on the edge. If it remains there, there is no treasure, if it falls,
it will roll quickly away. It must, however. be replaced three times, and
if it rolls three times towards the same place. there the treasure will be
found. If it rolls a different way each time, one must seek about for the
treasure.
<P>
The second method of divination by the axe is for the purpose of detecting
robbers. The hatchet is cast on the ground, head-downwards, with the handle
rising perpendicularly in the air. Those present must dance round it in a
ring, till the handle of the axe totters and it falls to the ground. The
end of the handle indicates the direction in which the thieves must be sought.
It is said by some that if this divination is to succeed, the head of the
axe must be stuck in a round pot, but this, as Delancre says, is absurd.
For how could an ax,' be fixed in a round pot. any more than the pot could
be sewed or patched if the axe had broken it to pieces?

fell was sacrificed, and his blood served for expiation. The High Priest
then put his two hands on the head of the other, confessed his sins and those
of the people, charged the animal with them, and allowed him to be led into
the desert and set free. And the people, having left the care of their iniquities
to the goat of Azazel - also known as the "cape-goat-return home with clean
