<P>Caacrinolaas :</B> According to Wierius (q.v.) Grand President of Hell also 
known as Caasimolar and Glasya. He is figured in the shape of a god with the 
wings of a griffon. He is supposed to Inspire knowledge of the liberal arts, and 
to incite homicides. It is this fiend who can render man invisible. He commands 
thirty-six legions.</P><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Cabiri, or more properly Cabeiri</B> : A group of minor deities of Greek 
origin, of the nature and worship of whom very little is known. The name appears 
to be of Semitic origin, signifying the &quot;great gods,&quot; and the 
<I>Cabiri </I>seem to have been connected in some manner with the sea, 
protecting sailors and vessels. The chief seats of their worship were Lemnos, 
Samothrace, Thessalia and Boeotia. They were originally only two in number -the 
elder identified with Dionysus, and the younger identified with Hermes, who was 
also known as Cadmilus. Their worship was at an early date amalgamated with that 
of Demeter and Ceres, with the result that two sets of <I>Cabiri </I>came into 
being-Dionysus and Demeter, and Cadmilus and Ceres. A Greek writer of the second 
century B.C. states that they were four in number-Axisros, Axiokersa, 
Axiokersos, and Casmilus, corresponding, he states to Demeter, Persephone, Hades 
and Hermes. The Romans identified the <I>Cabiri </I>with the Penates. In Lemnos 
a festival of these deities was held annually and lasted nine days, during which 
all domestic and other fires were extinguished, and sacred fire was brought, 
from Dabs. From this fact it has been judged that the <I>Cabiri </I>may have 
been volcanic demons; but this view has latterly been abandoned. It was in 
Samothracia that the cult of the <I>Cabiri </I>attained its widest significance, 
and in this island as early as the fifth century B.C. their mysteries were held 
with great eclat, and attracted almost universal attention. Initiation into 
these was regarded as a safeguard against misfortune of all kinds, and persons 
of distinction exerted all their influence to become initiates. In <B>1888</B> 
interesting details as to the bacchanal cult of the <I>Cabiri </I>were obtained 
by the excavation of their temple near Thebes. Statues of a deity called 
Cabeiros were found, attended by a boy cup-bearer. His attributes appear to be 
bacchic.</P>
<P>The <I>Cabiri </I>are often mentioned as powerful magicians, and Herodotus 
and other writers speak of the <I>Cabiri </I>as sons of Vulcan. Cicero, however, 
regards them as the children of Proserpine; and Jupiter is often named as their 
father. Strabo, on the other hand, regards them as the ministers of Hecate and 
Bochart recognises in them the three principal infernal deities, Pluto, 
Proserpine, and Mercury. It is more than likely that they were originally of 
Semitic or Egyptian origin-more probably the former; but we find a temple of 
Memphis consecrated to them in Egypt. It is not unlikely, as Herodotus supposes, 
that the cult is Pelasgian in origin, as it is known thatt the Pelasgians 
occupied the island of Samothrace, and established there certain mysteries, 
which they afterwards carried to Athens. There are also traditions that the 
worship of the <I>Cabiri </I>originally came from the Troad, a Semitic centre. 
Kenrick in his Egypt <I>before Herodotus </I>brings forward the following 
conclusions concerning the <I>Cabiri :</I></P>
<P>&quot;<B>1</B>. The existence of the worship of the <I>Cabiri </I>at Memphis 
under a pigmy form, and its connection with the worship of Vulcan. The coins of 
Thessalonica also establish this connection those which bear the legend 
Kabeiros' having a figure with a hammer in his hand, the pileus and apron of 
Vulcan, and sometimes an anvil near the feet.</P><B>
<P>&quot;2. </B>The <I>Cabiri </I>belonged also to the Phoenician theology. The 
proofs are drawn from the statements of Herodotus. Also the coins of Cossyra, a 
Phoenician settlement, exhibit a dwarfish figure with the hammer and short 
apron, and sometimes a radiated head, apparently allusive to the element of 
fire, like the star of the Dioscuri.</P>
<P>&quot;<B>3</B>. The isle of Lemnos was another remarkable seat of the worship 
of the <I>Cabiri </I>and of Vulcan, as representing the element of fire. Mystic 
rites were celebrated here over which they presided, and the coins of the island 
exhibit the head of Vulcan, or a Cabirus, with the pileus, hammer and forceps. 
It was this connection with fire, metallurgy, and the most remarkable product of 
the art, weapons of war, which caused the <I>Cabiri </I>to be identified with 
the Cureks of Etolia, the Idaei Dactyli of Crete, the Corybantes of Phrygia, and 
the Telchines of Rhodes. They were the same probably in Phoenician origin, the 
same in mystical and orgiastic rites, but different in number. genealogy, and 
local circumstances, and by the mixture of other mythical traditions, according 
to the various countries in which their worship prevailed. The fable that one 
Cabirus had been killed by his brother or brothers was probably a moral mythus 
representing the result of the invention of armour and analogous to the story of 
the mutual destruction of the men in brazen armour, who sprang from the dragon's 
teeth sown by Cadmus and Jason. It is remarkable that the name of the first 
fratricide signifies a 'lance,' and in Arabic a 'smith.'</P>
<P>&quot;<B>4</B>. The worship of the <I>Cabiri </I>prevailed also in Imbros, 
near the entrance of the Hellespont, which makes it probable that the great gods 
in the neighbouring island of Samothrace were of the same origin. The <I>Cabiri, 
</I>Curetes, and Corybantes appear to have represented air as well as fire. This 
island was inhabited by Pelasgi, who may have derived from the neighbouring 
country of Thrace and Phrygia, and with the old Pelasgic mysteries of Ceres. 
Hence the various explanations given of the Samothracan deities, and the number 
of them so differently stated, some making them two, some four, some eight, the 
latter agreeing with the number of early Egyptian gods mentioned by Herodotus. 
It is still probable that their original number was two, from their 
identification with the Dioscuri and Tyndaridae, and from the number of the 
Pateeci on Phoenician vessels. The addition of Vulcan as their father or brother 
made them three, and a fourth may have been their mother Cabira.</P>
<P>&quot;<B>5</B>. The Samothracian divinities continued to be held in high 
veneration in late times, but are commonly spoken of in connection with 
navigation, as the twin Dioscuri or Tyndaridae; on the other hand the Dioscuri 
are spoken of as the Curetes or Corybantes. The coins of Tripolis exhibit the 
spears and star of the Dioscuri, with the legend' <I>Cabiri.'</I></P>
<P>&quot;<B>6</B>. The Roman Penates have been identified with the Dioscuri, and 
Dionysius states that he had seen two figures of ancient workmanship, 
representing youths armed with spears, which, from an antique inscription on 
them, he knew to be meant for Penates. So, the 'Lares' of Etruria and Rome.</P>
<P>&quot;<B>7</B>. The worship of the <I>Cabiri </I>furnishes the key to the 
wanderings of AEneas, the foundation of Rome, and the War of Troy itself, as 
well as the Argonautic expedition. Samothrace and the Troad were so closely 
connected in this worship, that it is difficult to judge in which of the two it 
originated, and the gods of Lavinium, the supposed colony from Troy, were 
Samothracian. Also the Palladium, a pigmy image, was connected at once with 
AEneas and the Troad, with Rome, Vesta, and the Penates, and the religious 
belief and traditions of several towns in the south of Italy. Mr. Kenrick also 
recognises a mythical personage in AEneas, whose attributes were derived from 
those of the <I>Cabiri, </I>and continues with some interesting observations on 
the Homeric fables. He concludes that the essential part of the War of Troy 
originated in the desire to connect together and explain the traces of ancient 
religion. It fine, he notes one other remarkable circumstance, that the 
countries in which the Samothracian and Cabiriac worship prevailed were peopled 
either the Pelasgi, or by the AEolians, who of all the tribes comprehended under 
the general name Hellenes, approach the most nearly in antiquity and language to 
the Pelasgi, 'We seem warranted, then (our author observes), in two conclusions 
first that the Pelasgian tribes in Italy, Greece and Asia were united in times 
reaching high above the commencement of history, by community of religious ideas 
and rites, as well as letters, arts, and language ; an( secondly, that large 
portions of what is called the hero history of Greece, are nothing else than 
fictions devise to account for the traces of this affinity, when time an the 
ascendancy of other nations had destroyed the primitive connection, and rendered 
the cause of the similarly obscure. The original derivation of the Cabiriac 
system from Phoenicia and Egypt is a less certain, though still highly probable 
conclusion.</P>
<P>&quot;<B>8</B>. The name <I>Cab</I>iri has been very generally deduce the 
Phoenician 'mighty' and this etymology is in accordance with the fact that the 
gods of Samothrace were called ' Divi potes.' Mr. Kenrick believes, however, 
that the Phoenicians used some other name which the Greek translated' Kabeiros,' 
and that it denoted the two element of fire and wind'.&quot;</P>
<P>Pococke in his <I>India in Greece </I>will have it that the <I>Cabiri </I>are 
the 'Khyberi&quot; or people of the &quot; Khyber,&quot; or a Buddhist tribe - 
totally unlikely origin for them.</P>
<P>In the <I>Generations </I>of Sanconiathon, the <I>Cabiri </I>an claimed for 
the Phoenicians, though we understand the whole mystically. The myth proceeds 
thus. Of the Wind and the Night were born two mortal men, AEon and Protogonus. 
The immediate descendants of these were, 'Genus and 'Genea,' man and woman To 
Genus were born their mortal children, Phos, Pur, and Phlox, who discovered 
fire, and these again begat &quot;sons of vast bulk and height whose names were 
given to the mountains in which they dwelt, Cassiul, Libanus, Antilibanus, and 
Brathu. The issue of these giant men by their own mothers were Meinrumus, 
Hypsuranius, and Usous. Hypsuranius inhabited Tyre; and Usous becoming a 
huntsman, consecrated two pillars to fire and the wind, with the blood of the 
wild beasts that he captured. In times long subsequent to these, the race of 
Hypsuranius gave being to Agreus and Halieus, inventors, it is said, of the arts 
of hunting and fishing. From these descended two brothers, one of whom was 
Chrysor or Hephaestus; in words, charms and divinations; he also invented boats, 
and was the first that sailed. His brother first built walls with bricks, and 
their descendants in the second generation seem to have completed the invention 
of houses, by the addition of courts, porticos, and crypts. They are called 
Aletae and Titans, and in their time began husbandry and hunting with dogs. From 
the Titans descended Amynus, a builder, and Magus, who taught men to construct 
villages and tend flocks; and of these two were begotten Misor (perhaps 
Mizraim), whose name signifies Well-freed; and Sydic, whose name denotes the 
Just; these found the use of salt. We now come to the important point in this 
line of wonders. From Misor descended Taautus (Thoth, Athothis, or Hermes 
Trismegistus), who invented letters and from Sydic descended the Dioscuri, or 
<I>Cabiri, </I>or Corybantes, or Samothraces. These, according to Sanconiathon, 
first built a complete ship, and others descended from them who discovered 
medicine and charms. All this dates prior to Babylon and the gods of Paganism, 
the elder of whom are next introduced in the' Generations.' Finally, 
Sanconiathon settles Poseidon (Neptune) and the <I>Cabiri </I>at Berytus ; but 
not till circumsision, the sacrifice of human beings. and the portrayal of the 
gods had been introduced. In recording this event, the <I>Cabiri </I>are called 
husbandmen and fishermen, which leads to the presumption that the people who 
worshipped those ancient gods were at length called by their name. But little is 
known regarding the methods of initiation:-</P>
<P>&quot;The candidate for initiation was crowned with a garland of olive, and 
wore a purple band round his loins. Thus attired, and prepared by secret 
ceremonies (probably mesmeric), he was seated on a throne brilliantly lighted, 
and the other initiates then danced round him in hieroglyphic measures. It may 
be imagined that solemnities of this nature would easily degenerate into orgies 
of the most immoral tendency, as the ancient faith and reverence for sacred 
things perished, and such was really the case. Still, the primitive institution 
was pure in form and beautiful in its mystic signification, which passed from 
one ritual to another, till its last glimmer expired in the freemasonry of a 
very recent period. The general idea represented was the passage through death 
to a higher life, and while the outward senses were held in the thrall of 
magnetism, it is probable that revelations, good or evil, were made to the high 
priests of these ceremonies.&quot;</P>
<P>It is extremely difficult to arrive at any scientific conclusion regarding 
the origin of the <I>Cabiri, </I>but, to summarise, they were probably of 
Semitic origin, arriving in Greece through Phoenician influence; and that they 
approximated in character to the gods with whom the Greeks identified them is 
extremely likely. <I>(See </I>Strabo,L. <B>10; </B>Varro, <I>DeLinguaLatina, 
</I>L. <B>4</B>; Herodotus, L. <B>3</B>, c. <B>37</B>; Eusebius, <I>Praep Evang; 
</I>Pausanius, L. <B>9</B>; Bryant, <I>Antient Mythology, </I>Vol.III.)</P><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Cacodaemons :</B> Deities of inferior rank, one of whom it was believed by 
many was attached to each mortal from his birth as a constant companion, and 
were capable of giving impulses, and acting as a sort of messenger between the 
gods and men. The <I>cacodaemons </I>were of a hostile nature, as opposed to the 
agathodaemons who were friendly. It is said that one of the cacodaemons who 
appeared to Cassius was a man of huge stature, and of a black hue. The belief in 
these daemons is probably traditional, and it is said that they are the 
rebellious angels who were expelled from heaven for their crimes. They tried, 
but in vain, to obtain a settlement in various parts of the universe; and their 
final abode is believed to be all the space between the earth and the stars. 
There they abide, hated by all the elements, and finding their pleasure in 
revenge and injury. Their king was called Hades by the Greeks, Typhon by the 
Egyptians, and Ahrimanes by the Persians and Chaldaeans.</P><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Cacodemon : </B>The name given by the ancients to an evil spirit. He changed 
his shape so frequently that no one could tell in what guise he most generally 
appeared to man. Each person was also supposed to have a good and bad genius, 
the evil being the <I>cacodemon. </I>The astrologers also called the twelfth 
house of the sun, which is regarded as evil, that of <I>cacodemon.</I></P><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Cactomite :</B> A marvellous stone, said to possess occult properties, which 
was known to the ancients, and which was probably the cornelian. Any one wearing 
it was supposed to be assured of victory in battle.</P><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Caer :</B> The daughter of Ethal Anubal, Prince of the Danaans of Connaught, 
and mentioned in Irish myths. It was said that she lived year about in the form 
of a maiden and of a swan. She was beloved by Angus Og, who also found himself 
transformed into a swan; and all who heard the rapturous song of the swan-lovers 
were plunged into a deep sleep, lasting for three days and nights.</P><B>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Cagliostro :</B> one of the greatest occult figures of all time. It was the 
fashion during the latter half of the XIXth century to regard <I>Cagliostro 
</I>as a charlatan and impostor, and this point of view was greatly aided by the 
savage attack perpetrated on his memory by Carlyle, who alluded to him as the 
&quot; Prince of Quacks.&quot; Recent researches, however, and especially those 
made by Mr. W. R. H. Trowbridge in his <I>Cagliostro : the Splendour and Misery 
of a Master </I>of <I>Magic </I>(<B>1910</B>), go to show that if <I>Cagliostro 
</I>was not a man of unimpeachable honour, he was by no means the quack and 
scoundrel that so many have made him out to be. In the first place it will be 
well to give a brief outline of his life as known to us before Mr. Trowbridge's 
examination of the whole question placed <I>Cagliostro's </I>circumstances in a 
different light, and then to check the details of his career in view of what may 
be termed Mr. Trowbridge' s discoveries.</P>
<P>We find that Carlyle possessed a strong prejudice in regard to <I>Cagliostro, 
</I>and that he made no allowance for the flagrant mendacity of the documentary 
evidence regarding the so-called magician; and this leads up to the fact that 
although documents and books relating to <I>Cagliostro </I>abound, they possess 
little or no value. An account compiled from all these sources would present the 
following features</P><I>
<P>Cagliostro's </I>father whose name is alleged to have been Peter Balsamo, a 
person of humble origin, died young, and his mother, unable to support him, was 
glad to receive assistance for this purpose from one of her brothers; but from 
infancy he showed himself averse to proper courses, and when placed in an 
religious seminary at Palermo, he more than once ran away from it, usually to be 
recaptured in undesirable company. Sent next to a Benedictine convent, where he 
was under the care of a Father Superior, who quickly discovered his natural 
aptitude, he became the assistant of an apothecary attached to the convent, from 
whom he learned the principles of chemistry and medicine; but even then his 
desire was more to discover surprising and astonishing chemical combinations 
than to gain more useful knowledge. Tiring of the life at last, he succeeded in 
escaping from the convent, and betook himself to Palermo where he associated 
with rascals and vagabonds. He was constantly in the hands of the police, and 
his kind uncle who tried to assist him was rewarded by being robbed of a 
considerable sum. Engaged in every description of rascality, he was even said to 
have assisted in the assassination of a wealthy canon. At this time it is 
asserted that he was only fourteen years of age, but, later, becoming tired of 
lesser villainies he resolved upon a grand stroke, upon which to lay the 
foundations of his fortunes.</P>
<P>At Palermo resided an avaricious goldsmith named Marano, a stupid, 
superstitious man who believed devoutedly in the efficacy of magic. He became 
attracted to <I>Cagliostro, </I>who at the age of seventeen posed as being 
deeply versed in occultism, and had been seen evoking spirits. Marano made his 
acquaintance and confided to him that he had spent a great deal of money upon 
quack alchemists; but that he was convinced that in meeting him <I>(Cagliostro) 
</I>he had at last chanced upon a real master of magic. <I>Cagliostro 
</I>willingly ministered to the man's superstitions, and told him as a profound 
secret that in a field at no great distance from Palermo lay a buried treasure 
which, by the aid of magic ceremonies he could absolutely locate. But the 
operation necessitated some expensive preliminaries-at least <B>60</B> oz. of 
gold would be required in connection with it. To this very considerable sum 
Marano demurred, and <I>Cagliostro </I>cooly asserted that he would enjoy the 
vast treasure alone. But the credulity of Marano was too strong for his better 
sense, and at length he agreed to furnish the necessary funds.</P>
<P>At midnight they sought the field where it was supposed the treasure was hid. 
<I>Cagliostro </I>proceeded with his incantations and Marano, terrified at their 
dreadful nature, fell prostrate on his face, in which position he was 
unmercifully belaboured by a number of scoundrels whom <I>Cagliostro </I>had 
collected for that purpose. Palermo rang with the affair, but <I>Cagliostro 
</I>managed to escape to Messina, where he adopted the title of &quot; 
Count.&quot;</P>
<P>It was in this town that he first met with the mysterious Althotas. He was 
walking one day in the vicinity of the harbour when he encountered a person of 
singular dress and countenance. This man, apparently about fifty years of age, 
was dressed as an oriental, with caftan and robes, and was accompanied by an 
Albanian greyhound. Attracted by his appearance <I>Cagliostro </I>saluted him, 
and after some conversation the stranger offered to tell the pseudo-count the 
story of his past, and to reveal what was actually passing in his mind at that 
moment. <I>Cagliostro </I>was interested and made arrangements for visiting the 
stranger, who pointed out to him the house in which he resided, requesting him 
to call a little before midnight, and to rap twice on the knocker, then three 
times more slowly, when he would be admitted. At the time appointed 
<I>Cagliostro </I>duly appeared and was conducted along a narrow passage lit by 
a single lamp in a niche of the wall. At the end of this was a spacious 
apartment illuminated by wax candles, and furnished with everything necessary 
for the practice of alchemy. Althotas expressed himself as a believer in the 
mutability of physical law rather than of magic, which he regarded as a science 
having fixed laws discoverable and reducible to reason. He proposed to depart 
for Egypt, and to carry <I>Cagliostro </I>thither with him-a proposal which the 
latter joyfully accepted. Althotas acquainted him with the fact that he 
possessed no funds, and upon <I>Cagliostro's </I>expressing some annoyance at 
this circumstance laughed at him, telling him that it was an easy matter for him 
to make sufficient gold to pay the expenses of their voyage. Authorities differ 
greatly regarding the personality of Althotas; but we will leave this part of 
the <I>Cagliostro </I>mystery for the moment.</P>
<P>Embarking upon a Genoese ship they duly came to Alexandria where Althotas 
told his comrade that he was absolutely ignorant regarding his birth and 
parentage, and said that he was much older than he appeared to be, but that he 
was in possession of certain secrets for the preservation of strength and 
health. &quot;Nothing&quot; he said &quot;astonishes me; nothing grieves me, 
save the evils which I am powerless to prevent; and I trust to reach in peace 
the term of my protracted existence.&quot; His early years had been passed near 
Tunis on the coast of Barbary, where he had been the slave of a wealthy 
Mussulman pirate. At twelve years of age he spoke Arabic fluently, studied 
botany, and read the Koran to his master, who died when Althotas was sixteen. 
Althotas now found himself free and master of a very considerable sum which had 
been bequeathed him by his late owner.</P>
<P>Accompanied by <I>Cagliostro </I>he penetrated into Africa and the heart of 
Egypt, visiting the Pyramids, making the acquaintance of the priests of 
different temples, and receiving from them much hidden knowledge. (The slightest 
acquaintance with Egyptian history would have saved the author of this statement 
from making such an absurd anachronism). Following upon their Egyptian tour, 
however, they visited the principal kingdoms of Africa and Asia, and they are 
subsequently discovered at Rhodes pursuing alchemical operations. At Malta they 
assisted the Grand-master Pinto, who was infatuated with alchemical experiments, 
and from that moment Althotas completely disappears-the memoir of <I>Cagliostro 
</I>merely stating that during their residence in Malta he passed away. 
<I>Cagliostro </I>on the death of his comrade repaired to Naples. He was in 
funds, for Pinto had well provided him before he left Malta. In Naples he met 
with a Sicilian prince, who conceived a strong predilection for his society, and 
invited him to his castle near Palermo. This was dangerous ground but 
<I>Cagliostro </I>was nothing if not courageous, and besides he was curious to 
revisit the haunts of his youth. He had not been long in Palermo when one day he 
travelled to Messina where he encountered by chance one of his confederates in 
the affair of Marano the goldsmith. This man warned him strongly not to enter 
the town of Palermo, and finally persuaded him to return to Naples to open a 
gambling-house for the plucking of wealthy foreigners. This scheme the pair 
carried out, but the Neapolitan authorities regarded them with such grave 
suspicion that they betook themselves to the Papal States. Here they parted 
company, and regarding this time the alleged memoir of <I>Cagliostro </I>is not 
very clear. It however leads us to believe that the so-called Count had no lack 
of dupes, and from this obscurity he emerges' at Rome where we find him 
established as an empiric, retailing specifics for all the diseases that flesh 
is heir to. Money flowed in upon him, and he lived in considerable luxury.</P>
<P>It was at this time that he met the young and beautiful Lorenza Feliciani, to 
whom he proposed marriage; her father dazzled by <I>Cagliostro's </I>apparent 
wealth and importance consented, and the marriage took place with some ceremony. 
All biographers of <I>Cagliostro </I>agree in stating that Lorenza was a 
thoroughly good woman, honest, devoted and modest. The most dreadful accusations 
have been made concerning the manner in which <I>Cagliostro </I>treated his 
wife, and it has been alleged that he thoroughly ruined her character and 
corrupted her mind. But we shall discover later that this account has been 
coloured by the unscrupulous imagination of the Jesuitical writers of the Roman 
Inquisition. All biographers agree that <I>Cagliostro </I>hastened his wife's 
ruin, but it is difficult to know how they came by their data; and in any case 
they disagree substantially in their details. <I>Cagliostro's </I>residence now 
became the resort of card-sharpers and other undesirables. and it is said that 
he himself assumed the title and uniform of a Prussian colonel; but he and his 
confederates quarrelled and with his wife he was forced to quit Rome with a 
so-called Marquis D'Agriata. They took the road to Venice, and reached Bergamo, 
which through their rogueries they had speedily to leave. They then made the 
best of their way through Sardinia and Genoa, and indeed spent several years in 
wandering through Southern Europe. At last they arrived in Spain by way of 
Barcelona, where they tarried for six months. proceeding afterwards to Madrid 
and Lisbon. From Lisbon they sailed to England, where <I>Cagliostro </I>lived 
upon his wits, duping certain foreigners.. An English life of <I>Cagliostro 
</I>gives an account of his adventures in London, and tells how he was robbed of 
a large sum in plate, jewels and money; how he hired apartments in Whitcomb 
Street, where he spent most of his time in studying chemistry and physics, 
giving away much money and comporting himself generously and decently on all 
sides.</P>
<P>In <B>1772</B> he returned to France with his wife and a certain Duplaisir. 
At this time it is said that Duplaisir eloped with Lorenza, and that 
<I>Cagliostro </I>obtaining an order for her arrest, she was imprisoned in a 
penitentiary, where she was detained for several months. On her release, it is 
alleged, an immediate reconciliation occurred between husband and wife. At this 
time <I>Cagliostro </I>had attracted much attention in Paris by his alchemical 
successes. It was the period of mystic enthusiasm in Europe, when princes, 
bishops, and the nobility generally were keen to probe the secrets of nature, 
and when alchemy and the allied sciences were the pursuits and hobbies of the 
great. But according to his Italian biographer <I>Cagliostro </I>went too far 
and raised such hopes in the breasts of his dupes that at last they entertained 
suspicions of his honesty, so that he was' forced to flee to Brussels, whence he 
made his way to his native town of Palermo, where he was speedily arrested by 
the goldsmith Marano. A certain nobleman, however, interested himself on his 
behalf, and procured his release, and he embarked with his wife who had 
accompanied him, for Malta. From that island they soon retired to Naples, and 
from there to Marseilles and Barcelona. Their progress was marked by 
considerable state, and having cheated a certain alchemist of 
<B>100</B>,<B>000</B> crowns under the pretence of achieving some alchemical 
secret, they hurried to England.</P>
<P>It was during his second visit to London that the Count was initiated into 
Masonry, and conceived his great idea of employing that system for his own 
behoof. With this grand object in view he incessantly visited the various London 
Lodges, and ingratiated himself with their principals and officials. At this 
period he is said to have picked up in an obscure London bookstall a curious 
manuscript which is said to have belonged to a certain George Gaston, concerning 
whom nothing is known. This document dealt with the mysteries of Egyptian 
Masonry, and abounded in magical and mystical references. It was from this, it 
is alleged, that <I>Cagliostro </I>gathered his occult inspirations. He studied 
it closely and laid his plans carefully. After another and somewhat harassed 
tour through Holland, Italy and Germany, he paid a visit to the celebrated Count 
de St. Germain. In his usual eccentric manner, St. Germain arranged their 
meeting for the hour of two in the morning, at which time <I>Cagliostro </I>and 
his wife, robed in white garments, and cinctured by girdles of rose colour, 
presented themselves before the Count's temple of mystery. The drawbridge was 
lowered, and a man of exceptional height led them into a dimly lighted apartment 
where folded doors sprang suddenly open, and they beheld a temple illuminated by 
hundreds of wax lights. The Count of St. Germain sat upon the altar, and at his 
feet two acolytes swung golden censers. In the <I>Lives of the AIchemystical 
Philosophers </I>this interview is thus detailed. &quot; The divinity bore upon 
his breast a diamond pentagram of almost intolerable radiance. A majestic 
statue, white and diaphanous, upheld on the steps of the altar a vase inscribed, 
' Elixir of Immortality,' while a vast mirror was on the wall, and before it a 
living being, majestic as the statue, walked to and fro. Above the mirror were 
these singular words'-' Store House of Wandering Souls.' The most solemn silence 
prevailed in this sacred retreat, but at length a voice, which seemed hardly a 
voice, pronounced these words'-' Who are you ? Whence come you? What would you?' 
Then the Count and Countess <I>Cagliostro </I>prostrated themselves, and the 
former answered after a long pause, ' I come to invoke the God of the faithful, 
the Son of Nature, the Sire of Truth. I come to demand of him one of the 
fourteen thousand seven hundred secrets which are treasured in his breast, I 
come to proclaim myself his slave, his' apostle his' martyr.'</P>
<P>&quot;The divinity did not respond, but after a long silence, the same voice 
asked :-' What does the partner of thy long wanderings intend?'</P>
<P>&quot;To obey and to serve,&quot; answered Lorenza.</P>
<P>&quot;Simultaneously with her words, profound darkness succeeded the glare of 
light, uproar followed on tranquillity, terror on trust, and a sharp and 
menacing voice cried loudly :-' Woe to those who cannot stand the tests.'</P>
<P>&quot;Husband and wife were immediately separated to undergo their respective 
trials, which they endured with exemplary fortitude, and which are detailed in 
the text of their memoirs. When the romantic mummery was over, the two 
postulants' were led back into the temple with the promise of admission to the 
divine mysteries' There a man mysteriously draped in a long mantle cried out to 
them :- Know ye that the arcanum of our great art is the government of mankind, 
and that the one means to rule them is never to tell them the truth. Do not 
foolishly regulate your actions according to the rules of common sense; rather 
outrage reason and courageously maintain every unbelievable absurdity. Remember 
that reproduction is the palmary active power in nature, politics and society 
alike; that it is a mania with mortals' to be immortal, to know the future 
without under-standing the present, and to be spiritual while all that 
surrounds' them is material.'</P>
<P>&quot;After this harangue the orator genuflected devoutly before the divinity 
of the temple and retired. At the same moment a man of gigantic stature led the 
countess to the feet of the immortal Count de St. Germain who thus spoke</P>
<P>&quot;&rsquo;Elected from my tenderest youth to the things of greatness, I 
employed myself in ascertaining the nature of veritable glory. Politics appeared 
to me nothing but the science of deception, tactics the art of assassination, 
philosophy the ambitious' imbecility of complete irrationality; physics fine 
fancies about Nature and the continual mistakes of persons' suddenly 
transplanted into a country which is utterly unknown to them; theology the 
science of the misery which results from human pride; history the melancholy 
spectacle of perpetual perfidy and blundering. Thence I concluded that the 
statesman was a skilful liar, the hero an illustrious' idiot, the philosopher an 
eccentric creature, the physician a pitiable and blind man, the theologian an 
anatical pedagogue, and the historian a word-monger. Then did I hear of the 
divinity of this temple. I cast my cares upon him, with my in-certitudes and 
aspirations. When he took possession of my soul he caused me to perceive all 
objects' in a new light; I began to read futurity. This' universe so limited, so 
narrow, so desert, was now enlarged. I abode not only with those who are, but 
with those who were. He united me to the loveliest women of antiquity. I found 
it eminently delectable to know all without studying anything, to dispose of the 
treasures of the earth without the solicitations of monarchs', to rule the 
elements rather than men. Heaven made me liberal; I have sufficient to satisfy 
my taste; all that surrounds me is rich, loving, predestinated.</P>
<P>When the service was finished the costume of ordinary life was resumed. A 
superb repast terminated the ceremony. During the course of the banquet the two 
guests were informed that the Elixir of Immortality was merely Tokay coloured 
green or red according to the necessities of the case. Several essential 
precepts were enjoined upon them, among others that they must detest, avoid, and 
calumniate men of understanding, but flatter, foster, and blind fools, that they 
must spread abroad with much mystery the intelligence that the Count de St. 
Germain was' five hundred years old, and that they must make gold, but dupes 
before all.&quot;</P>
<P>There is no good authority for this singular interview, but if it really 
occurred it only probably served to confirm <I>Cagliostro </I>in the projects he 
had mapped out for himself.</P>
<P>Travelling into Courland, he and his wife succeeded in establishing several 
Masonic Lodges according to the rite of what he called Egyptian Freemasonry. 
Persons of high rank flocked around the couple, and it is even said that he 
plotted for the sovereignty of the Grand Duchy. Be this as' it may, it is 
alleged that he collected a very large treasure of presents and money, and ret 
out for St. Peters-burg, where. he established himself as a physician.</P>
<P>A large number of cures have been credited to <I>Cagliostro </I>throughout 
his' career, and his' methods have been the subject of considerable controversy. 
But there is' little doubt that the basis of them was a species' of mesmeric 
influence. It has' been said that he trusted simply to the laying on of hands; 
that he charged nothing for his service; that most of his' time was occupied in 
treating the poor, among whom he distributed vast amounts of money. The source 
of this wealth was' said to have been derived from the Masonic Lodges', with 
whose assistance and countenance he had undertaken this work.</P>
<P>Returning to Germany he was received in most of the towns' through which he 
passed as a benefactor of the human race. Some regarded his cures as' miracles, 
others' as' sorceries, while he himself asserted that they were effected by 
celestial aid.</P>
<P>For three years <I>Cagliostro </I>remained at Strasburg, feted and lauded by 
all. He formed a strong friendship with the famous Cardinal-archbishop, the 
Prince de Rohan who was' fired by the idea of achieving alchemical successes. 
Rohan was' extremely credulous, and leaned greatly to the marvellous. 
<I>Cagliostro </I>accomplished supposed transmutations under his eyes, and the 
Prince delighted with the seeming successes lavished immense sume upon the 
Count. He even believed that the elixir of life was known to <I>Cagliostro 
</I>and built a small house in which he was to undergo a physical regeneration. 
When he had sucked the Prince almost dry, <I>Cagliostro </I>repaired to 
Bordeaux, proceeding afterwards' to Lyons', where he occupied himself with the 
foundation of headquarters' for his Egyptian Masonic rite. He now betook himself 
to Paris, where he assumed the role of a master of practical magic, and where it 
is said he evoked phantoms which he caused to appear at the wish of the enquirer 
in a vase of clear water, or mirror. Mr. Waite thinks in this connection that 
fraud was an impossibility, and appears to lean to the theory that the visions 
evoked by <I>Cagliostro </I>were such as occur in crystal-gazing, and that no 
one was more astonished than the Count himself at the results he obtained. 
Paris' rang with his name and he won the appellation of the &quot;Divine 
<I>Cagliostro.&quot; </I>Introduced to the Court of Louis' XVI. he succeeded in 
evoking apparitions in mirrors before many spectators-these including many 
deceased persons specially selected by those present. His residence was' 
isolated and surrounded by gardens, and here he established a laboratory. His 
wife affected great privacy, and only appeared in a diaphanous costume at 
certain hours, before a very select company. This' heightened the mystery 
surrounding them, and the elite of Parisian society vied with one another to be 
present at their magic suppers', at which the evocation of the illustrious' dead 
the principal amusement. It is even stated that deceased statesmen, authors and 
nobles took their seats at <I>Cagliostro's </I>supper-table.</P>
<P>But the grand object of <I>Cagliostro </I>appears to have been the spread of 
his Egyptian Masonic rite. The lodges which he founded were androgynal, that is 
they admitted both men and women; the ladies being instructed by the Master's' 
wife, who figured as the Grand Mistress' of the Order-her husband adopting the 
title of Grand Copt. There is little doubt that a good deal of money was 
subscribed by the neophytes of the various lodges: the ladies who joined, each 
sacrificing on the altar of mysticism no less than <B>100</B> louis; and 
<I>Cagliostro's </I>immense wealth, which has' never been doubted by any 
authority on his life, in the strictest probability found its' source in the 
numerous gifts which showered in upon him from the powerful and wealthy for the 
purpose of furthering his masonic schemes.</P>
<P>But although he lived in considerable magnificence, <I>Cagliostro </I>by no 
means led a life of abandoned luxury; for there is the best evidence that he 
gave away vast sums to the poor and needy, that he attended the sick hand and 
foot, and in short played the part of healer and reformer at one and the same 
time.</P>
<P>A great deal of mystery surrounded the doings of the Egyptian Masonry in its 
headquarters in the Faubourg Saint Honor, and the seances for initiation took 
place at midnight. Figuier and the Marquis de Luchet have both given striking 
accounts of what occurred during the female initiations:-</P>
<P>&quot;On entering the first apartment,&quot; says Figuier, &quot;the ladies 
were obliged to disrobe and assume a white garment, with a girdle of various 
colours. They were divided into six groups, distinguished by the tint of their 
cinctures A large veil was also provided, and they were caused to enter a temple 
lighted from the root and furnished with thirty-six arm-chairs covered with 
black satin Lorenza clothed in white, was seated On a species of throne, 
supported by two tall figures, <B>50</B> habited that their sex could not be 
determined. The light was lowered by degrees till surrounding objects could 
scarcely be distinguished, when the Grand Mistress commanded the ladies to 
uncover their left legs as far as the thigh, and raising the right arm to rest 
it on a neighbouring pillar. Two young women then entered sword in hand, and 
with silk ropes bound all the ladies together by the arms and legs. Then after a 
period of impressive silence, Lorenza pronounced an oration, which is given at 
length, but on doubtful authority, by several biographers, and which preached 
fervidly the emancipation of womankind from the shameful bonds imposed on them 
by the lords of creation.</P>
<P>&quot;These bonds were symbolised by the silken ropes from which the fair 
initiates were released at the end of the harangue, when they were conducted 
into separate apartments, each opening on the Garden, where they had the most 
unheard-of experiences. Some were pursued by men who unmercifully persecuted' 
them with barbarous solicitations; others encountered less dreadful admirers, 
who sighed in the most languishing postures at their feet. More than one 
discovered the counterpart of her own love but the oath they had all taken 
necessitated the most inexorable inhumanity, and all faithfully fulfilled what 
was required of them. The new spirit infused into regenerated woman triumphed 
along the whole line of the six and thirty initiates, who with intact and 
immaculate symbols re-entered triumphant and palpitating, the twilight of the 
vaulted temple to receive the congratulations of the sovereign priestess.</P>
<P>&quot;When they had breathed a little after their trials, the vaulted roof 
opened suddenly, and, on a vast sphere of gold, there descended a man, naked as 
the unfallen Adam, holding a serpent in his hand, and having a burning star upon 
his head.</P>
<P>&quot;The Grand Mistress announced that this was the genius of Truth, the 
immortal, the divine <I>Cagliostro, </I>issued without procreation from the 
bosom of our father Abraham, and the depositary of all that hath been, is, or 
shall be known on the universal earth. He was there to initiate them into the 
secrets of which they had been fraudently deprived. The Grand Copt thereupon 
commanded them to dispense with the profanity of clothing, for if they would 
receive truth they must be as naked as itself. The sovereign priestess setting 
the example unbound her girdle and permitted her drapery to fall to the ground, 
and the fair initiates following her example exposed themselves in all the 
nudity of their charms to the magnetic glances of the celestial genius, who then 
commenced his revelations.</P>
<P>&quot;He informed his daughters that the much abused magical art was the 
secret of doing good to humanity. It was initiation into the mysteries of 
Nature, and the power to make use of her occult force?. The visions which they 
had beheld in the Garden where so many had seen and recognised those who were 
dearest to their hearts, proved the reality of hermetic operations. They had 
shewn themselves worthy to know the truth; he undertook to instruct them by 
gradations therein. It was enough at the outset to inform them that the sublime 
end of that Egyptian Freemasonry which he had brought from the very heart of the 
Orient was the happiness of mankind. This happiness was illimitable in its 
nature, including material enjoyments as much as spiritual peace, and the 
pleasures of the understanding.</P>
<P>The Grand Copt at the end of this harangue once more seated himself upon the 
sphere of gold and was borne away through the roof; and the proceedings ended, 
rather absurdly in a ball. This sort of thing was of course as the breath of his 
nostrils to <I>Cagliostro, </I>who could not have existed without the atmosphere 
of theatrical mysticism, in which he perfectly revelled.</P>
<P>It was at this period that <I>Cagliostro </I>became implicated in the 
extraordinary affair of the Diamond Necklace. He had been on terms of great 
intimacy with the Cardinal de Rohan. A certain Countess de Lamotte had 
petitioned that prince for a pension on account of long aristocratic descent. De 
Rohan was greatly ambitious to become First Minister of the Throne, but Marie 
Antoinette, the Queen, disliked him and stood in the way of such an honour. Mm. 
Lamotte soon discovered this, and for purposes of her own told the Cardinal that 
the Queen favoured his ambitions, and either forged, or procured someone else to 
forge, letters to the Cardinal purporting to come from the Queen, some of which 
begged for money for a poor family in which her Majesty was interested. The 
letters continued of the begging description, and Rohan, who was himself heavily 
in debt, and had misappropriated the funds of various institutions, was driven 
into the hands of money-lenders. The wretched Countess de Lamotte met by chance 
a poor woman whose resemblance to the Queen was exceedingly marked. This person 
she trained to represent Marie Antoinette, and arranged nightly meetings between 
her and Rohan, in which the disguised woman made all sorts of promises to the 
Cardinal. Between them the adventuresses mulcted the unfortunate prelate in 
immense sums. Meanwhile a certain Bahmer, a jeweller, was very desirous of 
selling a wonderful diamond necklace in which, for over ten years he had locked 
up his whole fortune. Hearing that Mme. de Lamotte had great influence 'with the 
Queen, he approached her for the purpose of getting her to induce Marie 
Antoinette to purchase it. She at once corresponded with De Rohan on the matter, 
who came post haste to Paris, to be told by Mme. de Lamotte that the Queen 
wished him to be security for the purchase of the necklace, for which she had 
agreed to pay <B>1</B>,<B>600</B>,<B>000</B> livres, or 
&pound;<B>64</B>,<B>000</B>, in four half-yearly installments. He was naturally 
staggered at the suggestion but however, affixed his signature to the agreement, 
and Mme. de Lamotte became the possessor of the necklace. She speedily broke it 
up, picking the jewels from their setting with an ordinary penknife. Matters 
went smoothly enough until the date when the first installment of 
<B>400</B>,<B>000 </B>livres became due. De Rohan, never dreaming that the Queen 
would not meet it, could not lay his hands on such a sum, and Bahmer noting his 
anxiety mentioned the matter to one of the Queen's ladies-in-waiting, who 
retorted that he must be mad, as the Queen had never purchased the necklace at 
all. He went at once to Mme. de Lamotte who laughed at him, said he was being 
fooled, that it had nothing to do with her, and told him to go to the Cardinal. 
The terrified jeweller did not however take her advice, but went to the 
King.</P>
<P>The amazed Louis XVI. listened to the story quietly enough, and then turned 
to the Queen who was present, who at once broke forth in a tempest of 
indignation. As a matter of fact Bahmer had for years pestered her to buy the 
necklace, but the crowning indignity was that Do Rohan, whom she cordially 
detested, should have been made the medium for such a scandalous disgrace in 
connection with her name, and she at once gave directions that the Cardinal 
should be arrested. The King acquiesced in this, and shortly afterwards the 
Countess de Lamotte, <I>Cagliostro </I>and his wife, and others, followed him to 
the Bastille.</P>
<P>The trial which followed was one of the most sensational and stirring in the 
annals of French history. The King was greatly blamed for allowing the affair to 
become public at all, and there is little doubt that such conduct as the 
evidence displayed as that of aristocrats assisted to hasten the French 
Revolution.</P>
<P>It was Mme. de Lamotte who charged <I>Cagliostro </I>with the robbery of the 
necklace, and she did not hesitate to invent for him a terrible past, 
designating him an empiric, alchemist, false prophet, and Jew. This is not the 
place to deal with the trial at length, and it will suffice to state that 
<I>Cagliostro </I>easily proved his complete innocence. But the Parisian public 
looked to <I>Cagliostro </I>to supply the comedy in this great drama, and 
assuredly they were not disappointed, for he provided them with what must be 
described as 'one of the most romantic and fanciful, if manifestly absurd, life 
stories in the history of autobiography. His account of himself which is worth 
quoting at length is as follows:-</P>
<P>&quot;I cannot,&quot; he says, &quot;speak positively as to the place of my 
nativity, nor to the parents who gave me birth. All my inquiries have ended only 
in giving me some great notions, it is true, but altogether vague and uncertain, 
concerning my family.</P>
<P>&quot;I spent the years of my childhood in the city of Medina in Arabia. 
There I was brought up under the name of Acharat, which I preserved during my 
progress through Africa and Asia. I had my apartments in the palace of the 
Muphti Salahaym. It is needless to add that the Muphti is the chief of the 
Mahometan religion, and that his constant residence is at Medina.</P>
<P>&quot;I recollect perfectly that I had then four persons attached to my 
service: a governor, between forty-five and sixty years of age, whose name was 
Althotas, and three servants, a white one who attended me as &quot;'valet <I>de 
</I>chambre and two blacks, one of whom was constantly about me night and 
day.</P>
<P>&quot;My governor always told me that I had been left an orphan when only 
about three months old, that my parents were Christians and nobly born; but he 
left me absolutely in the dark about their names and the place of my nativity. 
Some words, however, which he let fall by chance have induced ms to suspect that 
I was born at Malta. Althotas, whose name I cannot speak without he tenderest 
emotion, treated me with great care and all the attention of a father. He 
thought to develop the talent I displayed for the sciences. I may truly say that 
he knew them all, from the most abstruse down to those of mere amusement. My 
greatest aptitude was for the study of botany and chemistry.</P>
<P>&quot;By him I was taught to worship God, to love and assist my neighbours, 
and to respect everywhere religion and the laws. We both dressed like Mahometans 
and conformed outwardly to the worship of Islam; but the true religion was 
imprinted in our hearts.</P>
<P>&quot;The Muphiti, who often visited me, always treated me with great 
goodness and seemed to entertain the highest regard for my governor. The latter 
instructed me in most of the Eastern languages. He would often converse with me 
on the pyramids of Egypt, on those vast subterraneous caves dug out by the 
ancient Egyptians, to be the repository of human knowledge and to shelter the 
precious trust from the injuries of time.</P>
<P>&quot;The desire of travelling and of beholding the wonders of which he spoke 
grew so strong upon me, that Medina and my youthful sports there lost all the 
allurements I had found in them before. At least, when I was in my twelfth year, 
Althotas informed me one day that we were going to commence our travels. A 
caravan was prepared and we set out, after having taken our leave of the Muphti 
who was pleased to express his concern at our departure in the most obliging 
manner.</P>
<P>&quot;On our arrival at Mecca we alighted at the palace of the Cherif. Here 
Althotas provided me with sumptuous apparel and presented me to the Cherif, who 
honoured me with the most endearing caresses. At sight of this prince my senses 
experienced a sudden emotion, which it is not in the power of words to express, 
and my eyes dropped the most delicious tears I have ever shed in my life. His, I 
perceived, he could hardly contain.</P>
<P>&quot;I remained in Mecca for the space of three years; not a day passed 
without my being admitted to the sovereign's presence, and every hour increased 
his attachment and added to my gratitude. I sometimes surprised his gaze riveted 
upon me, and turned to heaven with every expression of pity and commiseration. 
Thoughtful, I would go from him a prey to an ever-fruitless curiosity. I dared 
not question Althotas, who always rebuked me with great severity, as if it had 
been a crime in me to wish for some information concerning my parents and the 
place where I was born. I attempted in vain to get the secret from the negro who 
slept in my apartment. If I chanced to talk of my parents he would turn a deaf 
ear to my questions. But one night when I was more pressing than usual, he told 
me that if ever I should leave Mecca I was threatened with the greatest 
misfortunes, and bid me, above all, <I>beware </I>of the city of 
<I>Trebizond.</I></P>
<P>&quot;My inclination, however, got the better of his foreboding. I was tired 
of the uniformity of life I led at the Cherif's court. One day when I was alone 
the prince entered my apartment; he strained me to his bosom with more than 
usual tenderness, bid me never cease to adore the Almighty, and added, bedewing 
my cheeks with his tears: <I>'Nature&rsquo;s unfortunate child, adieu !'</I></P>
<P>&quot;This was our last interview. The caravan waited only for me and I set 
off, leaving Mecca never to re-enter it more</P>
<P>&quot;I directed my course first to Egypt, where I inspected these celebrated 
pyramids which to the eye of the superficial observer only appear an enormous 
mass of marble and granite. I also got acquainted with the priests of the 
various temples, who had the complacence to introduce me into such places as no 
ordinary traveller ever entered before. The next three years of my progress were 
spent in the principal kingdoms of Africa and Asia. Accompanied by Althotas, and 
the three attendants who continued in my service, I arrived in <B>1766</B> at 
the island of Rhodes, and there embarked on a French ship bound to Malta.</P>
<P>&quot;Notwithstanding the general rule by which all vessels coming from the 
Levant are obliged to enter quarantine, I obtained on the second day leave to go 
ashore. Pinto, the Grand Master of the Knights of Malta, gave us apartments in 
his palace, and I perfectly recollect that mine were near the laboratory.</P>
<P>&quot; The first thing the Grand Master was pleased to do was to request the 
Chevalier d'Aquino, of the princely house of Caramanica, to bear me company and 
do me the honours of the island. It was here that I first assumed; European 
dress and with it the name of Count <I>Cagliostro, </I>nor was it a small matter 
of surprise to me to see Althotas appear in a clerical dress with the insignia 
of the Order of Malta.</P>
<P>&quot;I have every reason to believe that the Grand Master Pinto was 
acquainted with my real origin. He often spoke to me of the Cherif and mentioned 
the city of Trebizond, but never would consent to enter into further particulars 
on the subject. Meanwhile he treated me with the utmost distinction, and assured 
me of very rapid preferment if I would consent to take the cross. But my taste 
for travelling and the predominant desire of practising medicine, induced me to 
decline an offer that was as generous as it was honourable.</P>
<P>It was' in the island of Malta that I had the misfortune of losing my best 
friend and master, the wisest as well as the most learned of men, the venerable 
Althotas. Some minutes before he expired, pressing my hand, he said in a feeble 
voice', 'My son, keep for ever before your eyes the' fear of God and the love of 
your fellow-creatures; you will soon be convinced by experience of what you have 
been taught by me.</P>
<P>&quot;The spot where I had parted for ever from the friend who had been as a 
father to me, soon became odious. I begged leave of the Grand Master to quit the 
island in order to travel over Europe; he consented reluctantly, and the 
Chevalier d'Aquino was so obliging as to accompany me. Our first trip was to 
Sicily, from thence we went to the different islands of the Greek Archipelago, 
and returning, arrived at Naples, the birthplace of my companion.</P>
<P>&quot;The Chevalier, owing to his private affairs, being obliged to undertake 
a private journey, I proceeded alone to Rome, provided with a letter of credit 
on the banking house of Signor Bellone. In the capital of the Christian world I 
resolved upon keeping the strictest <I>incognito. </I>One morning, as I was shut 
up in my apartment, endeavouring to improve myself in the Italian language, my 
<I>valet </I>de chambre introduced to my presence the secretary of Cardinal 
Orsini, who requested me to wait on his Eminence. I repaired at once to his 
palace and was received with the most flattering civility. The Cardinal often 
invited me to his table and procured me the acquaintance of several cardinals 
and Roman' princes, amongst others, Cardinals York and Ganganelli, who was 
afterwards Pope Clement XIV. Pope Rezzonico, who then filled the papal chair, 
having expressed a desire of seeing me, I had the honour of frequent interviews 
with his Holiness.</P>
<P>&quot;I was then (<B>1770</B>) in my twenty-second year, when by chance I met 
a young lady of quality, Seraphina Fell ciani, whose budding charms kindled in 
my bosom a flame which sixteen years of marriage have only served to strengthen. 
It is that unfortunate woman, whom neither her virtues, her innocence, nor her 
quality of stranger could save from the hardships of a captivity as cruel as it 
is unmerited.&quot;</P><I>
<P>Cagliostro </I>is reticent regarding his life between the period last dealt 
with, and the date of his coming to Paris. But .although proved innocent he had 
through his ver} innocence offended so many persons in high places that he was 
banished, amidst shouts of laughter from everyone in the court. Even the judges 
were convulsed, but on his return from the court-house the mob cheered him 
heartily. If he had accomplished nothing else he had at least won the hearts of 
the populace by his kindness and the many acts of faithful service he had 
lavished upon them. and it was partly to his popularity, and partly to the 
violent hatred of the Court, that he owed the reception accorded to him. He was 
re-united to his wife, and shortly afterwards took his departure for London 
where he was received with considerable eclat. Here he addressed a letter to the 
people of France, which obtained wide circulation and predicted the French 
Revolution, the demolishment of the Bastille, and the downfall of the monarchy. 
Following upon this the <I>Courser de l'Europe </I>a French paper published in 
London, printed a so-called exposure of the real life of <I>Cagliostro </I>from 
beginning to end. From that moment, however, his descent was headlong; his 
reputation had Switzerland and Austria, he could find no rest for the sole of 
his foot. At last he came 'to Rome, whither Lorenza, his wife accompanied him. 
At first he was well received there, and even entertained by several cardinals, 
privately studying medicine, and living very quietly: but he made the grand 
mistake of attempting to further his masonic ideas within the bounds of the 
Papal States. Masonry was of course anathema to the Roman Church, and upon his 
attempting to found a Lodge in the Eternal City itself, he was arrested on the 
<B>27</B>th September, <B>1789</B>, by order of the Holy Inquisition, and 
imprisoned in the Castle of Saint Angelo. His examination occupied his 
inquisitors for no less than eighteen months, and he was sentenced to death on 
the <B>7</B>th April, <B>1791</B>. He was, however, recommended to mercy, and 
the Pope commuted his sentence to perpetual imprisonment in the Castle of Saint 
Angelo. On one occasion he made a desperate attempt to escape: requesting the 
services of a confessor he attempted to strangle the Brother sent to him, but 
the burly priest, whose habit he had intended to disguise himself in proved too 
strong for him, and he was quickly overpowered. After this he was imprisoned in 
the solitary Castle of San Leo near Montefeltro, the situation of which 
stronghold is one of the most singular in Europe, where he died and was interred 
in <B>1795</B>. The manner of his death is absolutely unknown, but an official 
commissioned by Napoleon to visit the Italian prisons gives some account of 
<I>Cagliostro's </I>quarters there.</P>
<P>&quot;The galleries,&quot; he reports, &quot;which have been cut out of the 
solid rock, were divided into cells, and old dried-up cisterns had been 
converted into' dungeons for the worst criminals, and further surrounded by high 
walls, so that the only possible egress, if escape was attempted, would be by a 
staircase cut in the rock and guarded night and day by sentinels.</P>
<P>&quot;It was in one of these cisterns that the celebrated <I>Cagliostro 
</I>was interred in <B>1791</B>. In recommending the Pope to commute the 
sentence of death, which the Inquisition had passed upon him, into perpetual 
imprisonment, the Holy Tribunal took care that the commutation should be 
equivalent to the death penalty. His only communication with mankind was when 
his jailers raised the trap to let food down to him. Here he languished for 
three years without air, movement, or intercourse with his fellow-creatures. 
During the last months of his life his condition excited the pity of the 
governor, who had him removed from this dungeon to a cell on the level with the 
ground, where the curious, who obtain permission to visit the prison, may read 
on the walls various inscriptions and sentences traced there by the unhappy 
alchemist. The last bears the date of the <B>6</B>th of March 
<B>1795</B>.&quot;</P>
<P>The Countess Cagliostro was also sentenced by the Inquisition to imprisonment 
for life. She was confined in the Convent of St. Appolonia, a penitentiary for 
women in Rome, where it was rumoured that she died in <B>1794</B>, 
<I>Cagliostro's </I>manuscript volume entitled &quot;Egyptian Freemasonry&quot; 
fell with his other papers into the hands of the Inquisition, and was solemnly 
condemned by it as subversive to the interests of Christianity. It was publicly 
burned, but oddly enough the Inquisition set apart</P>
<P>Cagliostro one of its brethren to write--&quot; concoct&quot; is the better 
word -some kind of Life of <I>Cagliostro </I>and in this are given several 
valuable particulars concerning his Masonic method as follows:-</P>
<P>&quot;It may be unnecessary to enter into some details concerning Egyptian 
Masonry. We shall extract our facts from a book compiled by himself, and now in 
our possession, by which he owns he was always directed in the exercise of his 
functions, and from which those regulations and instructions were copied, 
wherewith he enriched many mother lodges. In this treatise, which is written in 
French, he promises to conduct his disciples to perfection by means of physical 
and moral regeneration, to confer perpetual youth and beauty on them, and 
restore them to that state of innocence which they were deprived of by means of 
original sin. He asserts that Egyptian Masonry was first propagated by Enoch and 
Elias, but that since that time it has lost much of its purity and splendour. 
Common masonry, according to him, has degenerated into mere buffoonery, and 
women have of late been entirely excluded from its mysteries; but the time was 
now arrived when the Grand Copt was about to restore the glory of masonry, and 
allow its benefits to be participated by both sexes.</P>
<P>&quot;The statutes of the order then follow in rotation, the division of the 
members into three distinct classes, the various signs by' which they might 
discover each other, the officers who are to preside over and regulate the 
society, the stated times when the members are to assemble, the erection of a 
tribunal for deciding all differences that may arise between the several lodges 
or the particular members of each, and the various ceremonies which ought to 
take place at the admission of the candidates. In every part of this book the 
pious reader is disgusted with the sacrilege, the profanity, the superstition, 
and the idolatry with which it abounds-the invocations in the name of God, the 
prostrations, the adorations paid to the Grand Master, the fumigations, the 
incense, the exorcisms, the emblems of the Divine Triad, of the moon, of the 
sun, of the compass, of the square, and a thousand other scandalous particulars, 
with which the world is at present acquainted.</P>
<P>&quot;The Grand Copt, or chief of the lodge, is compared to God the Father. 
He is invoked upon every occasion; he regulates all the actions of the members 
and all the ceremonies of the lodge, and he is even supposed to have 
communication with angels and with the Divinity. In the exercise of many of the 
rites they are desired to repeat the <I>Venii </I>and the <I>Te Deum-nay, </I>to 
such an excess of impiety are they enjoined, that in reciting the psalm 
<I>Memento Domine David, </I>the name of the Grand Master is always to be 
substituted for that of the King of Israel.</P>
<P>People of all religions are admitted into the society of Egyptian Masonry-the 
Jew, the Calvinist, the Lutheran are to be received into it as well as the 
Catholic-provided they believe in the existence of God and the immortality of 
the soul, and have been previously allowed to participate in the mysteries of 
the common masonry. When men are admitted, they receive a pair of garters from 
the Grand Copt, as is usual in all lodges, for their mistresses; and when women 
are received into the society, they are pre-seated by the Grand Mistress with a 
cockade, which they are desired to give to that man to whom they are most 
attached.</P>
<P>&quot;We shall here recount the ceremonies made use of on admitting a 
female.</P>
<P>&quot;The candidate having presented herself, the Grand Mistress (Madame 
Cagliostro generally presided in that capacity) breathed upon her face from the 
forehead to the chin, and then said, I breathe upon you on purpose to inspire 
you with virtues which we possess, so that they may take root and flourish in 
your heart, I thus fortify your soul, I thus confirm you in the faith of your 
brethren and sisters. according to the engagements which you have contracted 
with them. We now admit you as a daughter of the Egyptian lodge. We order that 
you be acknowledged in that capacity by all the brethren and sisters of the 
Egyptian lodges, and that you enjoy with them the same prerogatives as with 
ourselves.'</P>
<P>&quot;The Grand Master thus addresses the male candidate: 'In virtue of the 
power which I have received from the Grand Copt, the founder of our order, and 
by the particular grace of God, I hereby confer upon you the honour of being 
admitted into our lodge in the name of Hellos, Mene, Tetragrammaton.'</P>
<P>&quot;In a book said to be printed at Paris in <B>1780</B>, it is asserted 
that the last words were suggested to <I>Cagliostro </I>as sacred and 
cabalistical expressions by a pretended conjuror. who said that he was assisted 
by a spirit, and that this spirit was no other than a cabalistical Jew, who by 
means of the magical art had murdered his own father before the incarnation of 
Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>&quot;'Common masons have been accustomed to regard St. John as their patron, 
and to celebrate' the festival of that saint. <I>Cagliostro </I>also adopted him 
as his protector. and it is not a little remarkable that he was imprisoned at 
Rome on the very festival of his patron. The reason for his veneration of this 
great prophet was, if we are to believe himself, the great similarity between 
the Apocalypse and the rites of his institution.</P>
<P>&quot;We must here observe that when any of his disciples were admitted into 
the highest class, the following execrable ceremony took place. A young boy or 
girl, in the state of virgin innocence and purity, was procured, who was called 
the pupil, and to whom power was given over the seven spirits that surround the 
throne of their divinity and preside over the seven planets. Their names 
according to <I>Cagliostro's </I>book are Anael, Michael, Raphael, Gabriel, 
Uriel, Zobiachel, and Anachiel. The pupil is then made use of as an intermediate 
agent between the spiritual and physical worlds, and being clothed in a long 
white robe, adorned with a red ribbon, and blue silk festoons, he is shut up in 
a little closet. From that place he gives responses to the Grand Master, and 
tells whether the spirits and Moses have agreed to receive the candidates into 
the highest class of Egyptian masons.</P>
<P>&quot;In his instructions to obtain the moral and physical regeneration which 
he had promised to his disciples, he is exceedingly careful to give a minute 
description of the operations to which they have to submit. Those who are 
desirous of experiencing the moral regeneration are to retire from the world for 
the space of forty days, and to distribute their time into certain proportions. 
Six hours are to be employed in reflection, three in prayer to the Deity, nine 
in the holy operations of Egyptian Masonry, while the remaining period is to be 
dedicated to repose. At the end of the' thirty-three days a visible 
communication is to take place between the patient and the seven primitive 
spirits, and on the morning of the fortieth day his soul will be inspired with 
divine knowledge, and his body be as pure as that of a new-born infant.</P>
<P>&quot;To procure a physical regeneration, the patient is to retire into the 
country in the month of May, and during forty days is to live according to the 
most strict and austere rules, eating very little, and then only laxative and 
sanative herbs, and making use of no other drink than distilled water, or rain 
that has fallen in the course of the month. On the seventeenth day, after having 
let blood certain white drops are to be taken, six at night and six in the 
morning, increasing them two a day in progression. In three days more a small 
quantity of blood is again to be let from the arm before sunrise, and the 
patient is to retire to bed till the operation is completed. A grain of the 
panacea is then to be taken; this panacea is the same as that of which God 
created man when He first made him immortal. When this is swallowed the 
candidate loses his speech and his reflection for three entire days, and he is 
subject to frequent convulsions, struggles, and perspirations. Having recovered 
from this state, in which however, he experiences no pain whatever, on that day, 
he takes the third and last grain of the panacea, which causes him to fail into 
a profound and tranquil sleep; it is then that he loses his hair, his skin, and 
his teeth. These again are all reproduced in a few hours, and having become a 
new man, on the morning of the fortieth day he leaves his room, enjoying a 
complete rejuvenescence, by which he is enabled to live <B>5557</B> years, or to 
such time as he, of his own accord, may be desirous of going to the world of 
spirits.&quot;</P>
<P>To revert to the question of the researches of Mr. Trowbridge, it will appear 
to any unbiassed reader of his work that he has proved that <I>Cagliostro 
</I>was not the same as Joseph Balsamo with whom his detractors have identified 
him. Balsamo was a Sicilian vagabond adventurer, and the statement that he and 
Cagliostro were one and the same person originally rests on the word of the 
editor of the <I>Courier de l' Europe, </I>a person of the lowest and most 
profligate habits, and upon an anonymous letter from Palermo to the Chief of the 
Paris police. Mr. Trowbridge sees in the circumstance that the names of the 
Countess <I>Cagliostro </I>and the wife of Balsamo were identical nothing but a 
mere coincidence, as the name Lorenza Feliciani is a very common one in Italy. 
He also proves that the testimony of the handwriting experts as to the 
remarkable similarity between the writing of Balsamo and <I>Cagliostro </I>is 
worthless, and states that nobody who had known Balsamo ever saw <I>Cagliostro. 
</I>He also points out that Balsamo, who had been in England in <B>1771</B>, was 
&quot;wanted&quot; by the London police: how was it then that six years 
afterward they did not recognise him in Count <I>Cagliostro </I>who spent four 
months in a debtors' prison there, for no fault of his own? The whole evidence 
against <I>Cagliostro's </I>character rests with the editor of the <I>Courier 
</I>de <I>l'Europe </I>and his Inquisition biographer, neither of whom can be 
credited for various good reasons. Again, it must be recollected that the 
narrative of the Inquisition biographer is supposed to be based upon the 
confessions of <I>Cagliostro </I>under torture in the Castle of St. Angelo. 
Neither was the damaging disclosure of the editor of the Courier <I>de l'Europe 
</I>at all topical, as he raked up matter which was at least fourteen years old, 
and of which he had no personal knowledge whatsoever. Mr. Trowbridge also proves 
that the <I>dossier </I>discovered in the French archives in <B>1783</B>, which 
was supposed to embody the Countess Cagliostro's confessions regarding the 
career of her husband when she was imprisoned in the Salpetriere prison, is 
palpably a forgery, and he further disposes of the statements that <I>Cagliostro 
</I>lived on the immoral earnings of his wife.</P>
<P>It is distinctly no easy matter to get at the bed-rock truth regarding 
<I>Cagliostro </I>or to form any just estimate of his true character. That he 
was vain, naturally pompous, fond of theatrical mystery, and of the popular side 
of occultism, is most probable. Another circumstance which stands out in 
relation to his personality is that he was vastly desirous of gaining cheap 
popularity. He was probably a little mad. On the other hand he was beneficent, 
and felt it his mission in the then king-ridden state of Europe to found 
Egyptian Masonry for the protection of society in general, and the middle and 
lower classes in particular. A born adventurer, he was by no means a rogue, as 
his lack of shrewdness has been proved on many occasions. There is small 
question either that the various Masonic lodges which he founded and which were 
patronised by persons of ample means, provided him with extensive funds, and it 
is a known fact that he was subsidised by several extremely wealthy men, who, 
themselves dissatisfied with the state of affairs in Europe, did not hesitate to 
place their riches at his disposal for the purpose of undermining the tyrannic 
powers which then wielded sway. There is reason to believe that he had in some 
way and 'at some period of his life acquired a certain working knowledge of 
practical occultism, and that he possessed certain elementary psychic powers of 
hypnotism and telepathy. His absurd account of his childhood is almost 
undoubtedly a plagiarism of that stated in the first manifesto to the public of 
the mysterious Rosicrucian Brotherhood, (q.v) as containing an account of the 
childhood of their Chief But on the whole he is a mystery, and in all likelihood 
the clouds which surround his origin and earlier years will never be dispersed. 
It is probably better that this should be so, as although <I>Cagliostro </I>was 
by no means an exalted character, he was yet one of the most picturesque figures 
in the later history of Europe; and assuredly not the least aid to his 
picturesque figures is the obscurity in which his origin is involved.

much hampered by the seeming infant in crossing a river, took the supposed child 
before him on his horse. But he was so heavy that the animal sank under the 
weight. Some time afterwards the mendicant was taken and admitted that the child 
he habitually carried was a little demon whom he had trained so carefully that 
no one refused him alms whilst carrying it.</P><B>

Khmer people, and Chinese, Annamese Malaya and aboriginal elements are also' 
represented.</P><I>
<P>Magic.-Magic </I>is mixed up to a' surprising degree with the daily life of 
this people. They consult sorcerers upon the most trivial matters, and are 
constantly at great pains to discover whether any small venture is' likely to 
prove lucky or unlucky. There are two kinds of sorcerers (or sorceresses), the 
soothsayers (ap thmop) and the medicine-sorcerers <I>(kru). </I>Of these the 
latter enjoy the highest reputation as healers and exorcists, while the former 
are less respected, dealing, as they do in charms and philtres</P>
<P>for the sake of gain, or in evil incantations and spells to indulge their 
spite and hatred. The outcast <I>kru, </I>however, can be ministers of 
destruction as well as of healing. One of the means used to take the. life of an 
enemy is the old device favoured by witches.' They make a wax figure 'of the 
victim, prick it at the spot where they wish to harm him, and thus bring disease 
and death upon him. Another plan is to take two skulls from which the tops have 
been removed, place them against each other, and convey them secretly under the 
bed of a healthy man where they have very evil results. Sometimes by means of 
spells they transform wood-shavings or grains of' rice into a large. beetle, or 
into worms, which enter the body of their victim and cause his illness, and, 
perhaps his death. If the man thus attacked happens to possess the friendship of 
a more powerful sorcerer, however, the latter may afford him his protection,. 
and thus undo the mischief,. The more harmless occupations of the wizards 
consist in making philtres and amulets to insure the admiration of women, the 
favour of the king, and success at play.</P><I>
<P>Evil </I>Spirits.-The evil spirits, to whom they ascribe the moat malicious 
intent, are called <I>pray. </I>Of these the most fearsome variety is the 
&quot;wicked dead&quot; <I>(khmoc o&pound; pray), </I>which includes the spirits 
of women who have died in childbed. From their hiding-place in the trees these 
spirits torment inoffensive passers-by with their hideous laughter, and shower 
down stones upon them. These practices arc, of course, calculated either to kill 
or to drive the unfortunate . recipients of their attentions insane. Among the 
trees there are also concealed mischievous demons who inflict terrible and 
incurable diseases upon mankind.</P>
<P>Those. who have suffered a violent death are also greatly to be feared. From 
the nethermost regions they return, wan and terrible, to demand food from human 
beings, who dare not deny it to them. Their name <I>beisac </I>signifies 
&quot;'goblin,&quot; and they have the power to inflict all manner of evil on 
those who refuse their request. So the good Cambodian, to avert such happenings, 
puts. his offering of rice or other food in the brushwood to appease the 
goblins. The <I>pray, </I>it may be bald, require to have their offerings laid 
'on. the winnowing fan that enters so largely into Cambodian superstition.</P>
<P>Were-wolves, both male and female, strike terror into the hearts of the 
natives. By the use of certain magical rites and formulae, men can become 
endowed with super-natural powers, such as the ability to swallow dishes, and 
are thereupon changed to were'-wolves. Women who have been rubbed with oil which 
a wizard has consecrated are said to lose their reason, and to flee away to the 
woods They retain their human shape for seven days. If during that time a man 
shall undergo the same process .of being rubbed with consecrated oil, and shall 
follow the <I>toman </I>to the woods, and strike her on the head with a heavy 
bar-then, the Cambodians say, she shall recover her reason and may return' home. 
If, on the other hand, no such drastic remedy is to be found, at the end of 
seven days the woman shall turn into a tigress. In order to cure men who have 
the powers of a were-wolf, one must strike them on the shoulder with a hook.</P>
<P>The Cambodians believe that ghosts issue from dead bodies during the process 
of decomposition. When this ceases the ghosts are no longer seen, and the 
remains are changed into owls and other nocturnal birds.</P>
<P>Most hideous of all the evil spirits in <I>Cambodia, </I>are the <I>srei ap 
</I>or ghouls, who, represented only by head and alimentary canal, prowl nightly 
in search of their gruesome orgies. They are known by their terrible and 
blood-shot eyes, and are much feared, since even their wish to harm can inflict 
injury. When anyone is denounced as a ghoul she is treated with great severity, 
either by the authorities, who may sentence her to banishment or death, or by 
the villagers, who sometimes take the law into their own hands and punish the 
supposed offender.</P><I>
<P>Astrology, etc.-The </I>science of astrology is not without its votaries in 
<I>Cambodia. </I>Astrologers, or, as they are called, horas, are attached to the 
court, and their direct employment by the king gives them some standing in the 
country. At the beginning of each year they make a calendar, which contains, 
besides the usual astronomical information, weather and other predictions. They 
are consulted by the people on all sorts of subjects, and are believed to be 
able to avert the calamities they predict.</P>
<P>It is not surprising that in such a country, where good and evil powers are 
ascribed so lavishly, much attention should be paid to omens, and much time 
spent in rites to avert misfortune. The wind, the fog, the trees, are objects of 
fear and awe, and must be approached with circumspection lest they send disease 
and misfortune, or withhold some good. For instance, trees whose roots grow 
under a house bring ill-luck to it. The bamboo and cotton-plant are also 
dangerous when planted near a house, for should they grow higher than the house, 
they would wish, out ,of a perverted sense of gratitude, to provide a funeral 
cushion and matting for the occupants.</P>
<P>Animals receive their share of superstitious veneration. Tigers are regarded 
as malevolent creatures, 'whose whiskers are very poisonous. Elephants are 
looked upon as sacred, and particularly so white elephants, Monkeys they 'will 
on no account destroy. Should a butterfly enter the house, it is considered 
extremely unlucky, while a grasshopper, on the contrary, indicates coming good 
fortune.</P>
<P>There are other superstitions relating to household objects, customs, etc., 
which do not differ greatly from those of other countries.</P>

<P>Capnomancy :</B> Was the observation of smoke, which consisted in two 
principal methods. The more important was the smoke of the sacrifices, .which 
augured well if it rose lightly from the altar, and ascended straight to the 
clouds; but the contrary if it hung about. Another method was to throw a few 
jasmine or poppy seeds upon burning coals. There was yet a third practice by 
breathing the smoke of the sacrificial fire.</P><B>

<P>Caqueux or Cacoux:</B> Formerly a caste of rope-makers dwelling in Brittany, 
who in some of the cantons of that country were treated as pariahs, perhaps 
because the ropes they manufactured were to the people the symbols of slavery 
and death by hanging. Be that as it may, they were interdicted from entering the 
churches, and were regarded as sorcerers. They did not hesitate to profit by 
this evil reputation, but dealt in talismans which were supposed to render their 
wearers invulnerable, and also acted as diviners. They were further credited 
with the ability to raise and sell winds and tempests like the sorcerers of 
Finland It is said that they were originally of Jewish origin, separated like 
lepers from other folk. Francois II, Duke of Brittany, enacted that they should 
wear a mark composed of red cloth on a part of their dress where it could be 
readily seen. <I>(See </I>Cambry, Voyage dans le Finistere, t.<B>3</B>,

<P>Carbuncle :</B> The ancients supposed this stone to give out a native light 
without reflection, and they ranked it fifth in order after diamonds, emeralds, 
opal, and pearls. It is among the gems ruled by the sun, and is both male and 
female-the former distinguished by the brightness which appears as if burning 
within it, while the latter throws it out. It takes no colour from any other 
gem, applied to it, but imparts its' own. The virtue of the <I>carbuncle </I>is 
to drive away poisonous air, repress luxury, and preserve the health of the 
body. It also reconciles differences among friends.</P><B>

<P>Cardan, Jerome : </B>A so-called magician, who lived about the end of the 
fifteenth, or the beginning of the sixteenth, century. He was contemporary with 
Faustus and Paracelsus, to whom, as to the other necromancers of his age, he was 
entirely dissimilar. He has left in his <I>Memoirs </I>a frank and detailed 
analysis of a curiously .complicated and abnormal intellectuality, sensitive, 
intense, and not altogether free from the taint of insanity. He declares himself 
subject to strange fits of abstraction and exaltation, the intensity of which 
became at length so intolerable that he was forced to inflict on himself severe 
bodily pain as a means of banishing them. He would, he tells us, talk habitually 
of those things which were most likely to be distasteful to the company; he 
would argue on any side of a 'question, quite irrespective of whether he 
believed it right or wrong, and he had an extraordinary passion for gambling. He 
tells us of three peculiarities, in winch we may trace the workings of a 
diseased imagination, and in the third, at least, that abnormal delicacy of 
perception which characterised him. The first was the faculty of projecting his 
spirit outside his body, to the accompaniment of strange physical sensations. 
The second was the ability to perceive sensibly anything he desired to perceive. 
As a child, he explains, he saw these images involuntarily and without the power 
of selection, but when he reached manhood he could control them to suit his 
choice. The third of his peculiar qualities was, that before every event of 
moment in his .life, he had a dream which warned him of it. Indeed, he himself 
has written a commentary of considerable length on Synesius's treatise on 
dreams, in which he advances the theory that any virtuous person can acquire the 
faculty of interpreting dreams, that, in fact, anyone can draw up for himself a 
code of dream-interpretations by merely studying carefully his own dreams. We 
cannot put much faith in <I>Cardan's </I>wonderful. dreams, however. His is not 
the type of mind to. which we would go for an accurate statement concerning 
mental phenomena, but such significant dreams as he may have had,. were 
probably, as has already been suggested, the result of his abnormal 
sub-conscious perceptiveness.' In one instance at least, his prediction was not 
entirely successful. He foretold the date of his own death, and, at the age of 
seventy-five, was obliged to abstain from food in order to die at the time he 
had predicted.</P><B>

<P>Catalepsy :</B> A condition involving the sudden suspension of sensation and 
volition, and the partial suspension of the vital functions. The body assumes a 
rigid and statuesque appearance, sometimes mistaken for death, and the patient 
remains unconscious throughout the attack. On occasion, the cataleptic state may 
be marked by symptoms of intense mental excitement. and by apparently volitional 
speech and action. Sometimes the symptoms are hardly distinguishable from those 
of hysteria. The period covered by the attack may vary from a few minutes to 
several days, though the latter only in exceptional cases; it may, however, 
recur on trifling provocation in the absence of resistance from the will-power 
of the patient. The affection is caused by a pathological condition of the 
nervous system, generally produced by severe or prolonged mental emotion, and it 
must not be confused with the hypnotic trance. The belief that it may occur in a 
perfectly healthy person is, on the whole, fallacious. There is some reason to 
suppose that <I>catalepsy, </I>like ecstacy and mediumistic faculties, may at 
times prove contagious. Dr. Petetin, in his <I>Electricite Animale 
</I>(<B>1808</B>) makes mention of as many as eight cases met with in a 
restricted area, although <I>catalepsy </I>is in ordinary circumstances of rare 
occurrence. Petetin also mentions certain strange phenomena witnessed by him in 
connection with the state of spontaneous <I>catalepsy (see </I>Stomach, seeing 
with). which would seem to show that persons in this condition are, amenable to 
suggestion in a high degree. The true physical reasons for catalepsy are still 
practically unknown to science. But there seem to be good reasons for believing 
that it can be self-induced in certain cases. Many Eastern fakirs have been 
known to cast themselves into cataleptic sleep lasting for months and cases have 
even been known where they permitted themselves to be buried, being exhumed when 
the grass had grown over their graves.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<P>Catoptromancy, or Enoptromaney :</B> is a species of divination by the 
mirror, which Pausanius describes : &quot;Before the Temple of Ceres at Patras, 
there was a fountain, separated from the temple by a wall, and there was an 
oracle, very truthful, not for all events, but for the sick only. The sick 
person let down a mirror, suspended by a thread, till its base touched the 
surface of the water, having first prayed to the goddess and offered incense. 
Then looking in the mirror, he saw the presage of death or recovery, according 
as the face appeared fresh and healthy, or of a ghastly aspect.&quot; Another 
method of using the mirror was to place it at the back of a boy's or girl's 
head, whose eyes were bandaged. In Thessaly, the response appeared in characters 
of blood on the face of the moon, probably represented in the mirror. The 
Thessalian sorceresses derived their art from the Persians, who always 
endeavoured to plant their religion and mystic rites in the countries they 
invaded.</P><B>

<P>Cellini, Benvenuto:</B> This celebrated Italian artist and crafts-man had 
several most interesting adventures with demons and professors of the black art. 
In his <I>Life </I>he writes as follows:-</P>
<P>&quot;It happened, through a variety of odd accidents, that I made 
acquaintance with a Sicilian priest, who was a man of genius, and well versed in 
the ,Latin and Greek author. Happening one day to have some conversation with 
him, when the subject turned on the subject of necromancy, I, who had a great 
desire to know something of the matter, told him, that I had all my life felt a 
curiosity to be acquainted with the mysteries of this art. The priest made 
answer, 'That the man must be of a resolute and steady temper who enters upon 
that study.' I replied, 'That I had fortitude and resolution enough, if I could 
but find an opportunity.' The priest subjoined, 'If you think you have the heart 
to venture, I will give you all the satisfaction you can desire.' Thus we agreed 
to enter upon a plan of necromancy. The priest one evening prepared to satisfy 
me, and desired me to look out for a companion or two. I invited one Vincenzio 
Romoli, who was my intimate acquaintance: he brought with him a native of 
Pistoia, who cultivated the black art himself. We repaired to the Colloseo, and 
the priest, according to the custom of necromancers, began to draw circles upon 
the ground with the most impressive ceremonies imaginable: he likewise brought 
hither assafoetida, several precious perfumes and fire, with some compositions 
also which diffused noisome odour. As soon as he was in readiness, he made an 
opening to the circle, and having taken us by the hand, ordered the other 
necromancer, his partner, to throw the perfumes into the fire at the proper 
time, intrusting the care of' the fire and the perfumes to the rest; and then he 
began his incantations. This ceremony lasted above an hour and a half, when 
there appeared several legions of devils a half, when there appeared several 
legions of devils insomuch that the amphitheatre was quite filled with them. I 
was busy about the perfumes, when the priest, perceiving there was a 
considerable number of infernal spirits, turned to me and said, <I>'Benvenuto, 
</I>ask them something.' I answered, 'Let them bring me into the company of my 
Sicilian mistress, Angelica.' That night we obtained no answer of any sort; but 
I had received great satisfaction in having my curiosity so far indulged. The 
necromancer told me, it was requisite we should go a second time, assuring me, 
that I should be satisfied in whatever I asked; but that I must bring with me a 
pure immaculate boy.</P>
<P>&quot;I took with me a youth who was in my service, of about twelve years of 
age, together with the same Vincenzio Romoli, who had been my companion the 
first time and one Agnolino Gaddi, an intimate acquaintance, whom I likewise 
prevailed on to assist at the ceremony. When we came to the place appointed, the 
priest having made his preparations as before, with the same and. even more 
striking ceremonies, placed us within the circle, which he had likewise drawn 
with a more wonderful art, and in a more solemn manner, than at our former 
meeting. Thus having committed the care of the perfume and the fire to my friend 
Vincenzio, who was assisted by Agnolino Gaddi, he put into my hand a pintacula 
or magical chart, and bid me turn it towards the places that he should direct 
me; and under the pintacula I held the boy. The necromancer having begun to make 
his tremendous invocations, called by their names a multitude of demons, who 
were the leaders of the several legions, and questioned them by the power of the 
eternal uncreated God, who lives for ever, in the Hebrew language, as likewise 
in Latin and Greek; insomuch that the amphitheatre was almost in an instant 
filled with demons more numerous than at the former conjuration. Vincenzio 
Romoli was busied in making a fire, with the assistance of Agnolino, and burning 
a great quantity of precious perfumes. I. by the direction of the necromancer, 
again desired to be in the company of my Angelica. The former thereupon turning 
to me, said, 'Know, they have declared, that in the space of a month you shall 
be in her company.</P>
<P>&quot;He then requested me to stand resolutely by him, because the legions 
were now above a thousand more in number than he had designed; and, besides 
these were the most dangerous;. so that, after they had answered my question, it 
behoved him to be civil to them, and dismiss them quietly. At the same time the 
hay under the pintacula was in a terrible fright, saying, that there were in 
that place a million of fierce men, who threatened to destroy us; and that, 
moreover, four armed giants of an enormous stature were endeavouring to break 
into our circle. During this time, whilst the necromancer, trembling with fear, 
endeavoured by mild and gentle methods to dismiss them in the best way he could, 
Vincenzio Romoli, who quivered like an aspen leaf, took care of the perfumes.. 
Though I was as much terrified as any of them, I did my utmost to conceal the 
terror I felt; so that I greatly contributed to inspire the rest with 
resolution; but the truth is, I gave myself over for a dead man, seeing the 
horrid fright the necromancer was in. The boy placed his head between his knees, 
and said, ' In this posture I will die; for we shall all surely perish.' I told 
him that all these demons were under us, and what he saw was smoke and shadows; 
so I bid him hold up his head and take courage. No sooner did he look up, but he 
cried out,' The whole amphitheatre is burning, and the fire is just. falling 
upon us ;' so covering his eyes with his hands, he again exclaimed that 
destruction was inevitable, and he desired to see no more. The necromancer 
entreated me to have a good heart, and take care to burn the proper perfumes; 
upon which I turned to Romoli, and bid him burn all the Most precious perfumes 
he had. At the same time I cast my eye upon Agnolino Gaddi, who was terrified to 
such a degree that he could scarce distinguish objects, and seemed to be 
half-dead. Seeing him in this condition, I said, Agnolino, upon these occasions 
a man should not yield to fear, but should stir about and give his assistance; 
so come directly and put on some more of these perfumes.' Poor Agnolino, upon 
attempting to move, was so violently terrified that the effects of his fear 
overpowered all the perfumes we were burning. The boy, hearing a crepitation, 
ventured once more to raise his head, when, seeing me laugh, he began to take 
courage, and. said, 'That the devils were flying away with a vengeance.</P>
<P>&quot;In this condition we stayed till the bell rang for morning prayer. The 
boy again told us, that there remained but few devils, and these were at a great 
distance. When the magician had performed the rest of his ceremonies, he 
stripped off his gown and took up a wallet full of books which he had brought 
with him. We all went out of the circle together, keeping as close to each other 
as we possibly could, especially the boy, who had placed himself in the middle, 
holding the necromancer by the coat, and me by the cloak. As we were going to 
our houses in the quarter of Banchi, the boy told us that two of the demons whom 
we had seen at the amphitheatre, went on before us leaping and skipping, 
sometimes running upon the roofs of the houses, and sometimes upon the ground. 
The priest declared, that though he had often entered magic circles, nothing so 
extraordinary had ever happened to him. As we went along, he would fain persuade 
me to assist with him at consecrating a book, from which, he said, we should 
derive immense riches we should then ask the demons to discover to us the 
various treasures with which the earth abounds, which would raise us to opulence 
and power; but that those love affairs were mere follies, from whence no good 
could be expected. I answered, 'That I would readily have accepted his proposal 
if I understood Latin:' he redoubled his persuasions, assuring me, that the 
know-ledge of the Latin language was by no means material. He added, that he 
could have Latin scholars enough, if he had thought it worth while to look out 
for them; but that he could never have met with a partner of resolution and 
intrepidity equal to mine, and that I should by all means follow his advice. 
Whilst we were engaged in this conversation, we arrived at our respective homes, 
and all that night dreamt of nothing but devils.&quot;</P><B>

<P>Celonitis or Celontes:</B> This wonderful stone is found in the tortoise, and 
its property is to resist fire. Its healing virtues are two-fold, similar to 
those of the Asinius. Carried under the tongue on the day of the new moon, and 
for the fifteen days following, during the lunar ascension, it inspires its 
fortunate possessor to foretell future events every day from sunrising to six 
o'clock; and in the decrease during the intervening hours.</P><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Celts: Magic :</B> among the Celtic peoples in ancient times was so closely 
identified with Druidism that its origin may be said to have been Druidic. That 
Druidism was of Celtic origin, however, is a question upon which much discussion 
has been lavished, some authorities, among them Rhys, believing it to have been 
non-Celtic and even non-Aryan origin. This is to say that the earliest non-Aryan 
or so-called &quot;Iberian&quot; or Megalithic people of Britain introduced the 
immigrant Celts to the Druidic religion. An argument in favour of this theory is 
that the continental <I>Celts </I>sent their neophyte Druid priests to Britain 
to undergo a special training at the hands of the Druids there, and there is 
little doubt that this island was regarded as the headquarters of the cult. The 
people of Cisalpine Gaul, for instance, had no Druidic priesthood. <I>(See 
</I>Rice Holmes' <I>Caesar's Conquest, pp. </I><B>532</B>-<B>536</B>). Caesar 
has told us that in Gaul Druidic seminaries were very numerous , and that in 
them severe study and discipline were entailed upon the neophytes, the principal 
business of whom was to commit to memory countless verses enshrining Druidic 
knowledge and tradition. That this instruction was astrological and magical we 
have the fullest proof, and it is with these aspects of the Celtic religion 
alone that we have to deal in this place.</P>
<P>The Druids were magi as they were hierophants in the same sense that the 
American-Indian medicine-man is both magus and priest. That is they were 
medicine-men On a higher-scale, and possessed a larger share of transcendental 
knowledge than the shamans of more barbarous races. Thus they may be said to be 
a link between the shaman and the magus of medieval times. Many o: their 
practices were purely shamanistic, whilst others were more closely connected 
with medieval magical rite. But they were not the only magicians among the 
Celts, for we find that magic power is frequently the progression of women and 
the poetic craft. The art magic of Druidism bad many points of comparison 'with 
most magical systems, and may be said to have approximated more to that black 
magic which desires power for the sake of power alone, than to any more 
transcendental type. Thus it included the power to render oneself invisible, to 
change the bodily shape, to produce an enchanted sleep, to induce lunacy, and 
the utterance of spells and charms which caused death. Power over the elements 
was also claimed, as in the case of Broichan, a Caledonian Druid who opposed 
Saint Columbia, as we read in Adamnan's <I>Life </I>of that saint as follows</P>
<P>&quot;Broichan, speaking one day to the holy man, says: 'Tell me, Columba, at 
what time dost thou propose to sail forth? &quot;On the third day,' says the 
Saint, 'God willing and life remaining, we propose to begin our voyage.' 'Thou 
wilt not be able to do so,' says Broichan in reply, 'for I can make the wind 
contrary for thee, and bring dark clouds upon thee.' The Saint says: 'The 
omnipotence of God rules over all things, in Whose Name all our movements, He 
Himself governing them, are directed.&rsquo; What more need be said? On the same 
day as he had purposed in his heart the Saint came to the long lake of the river 
Ness, a great crowd following. But the Druids then began to rejoice when they 
saw a great darkness coming over, and a contrary wind with a tempest. Nor should 
it be wondered at that these things can be done by the art of demons, God 
permitting it, so that even winds and waters are roused to fury.</P>
<P>For it was thus that legions of devils once met the holy bishop Germanus in 
mid-ocean, what time he was sailing from the Gallican Gulf (the British Channel) 
to Britain in the cause of man's salvation, and stirred up dangerous storms and 
spread darkness over the sky and obscured daylight. All which storms, however, 
were stilled at the prayer of St. Germanus, and, quicker than said, ceased, and 
the darkness was swept away.</P>
<P>&quot;Our Columba, therefore, seeing the furious elements stirred up against 
him, calls upon Christ the Lord, and entering the boat while the sailors are 
hesitating, he with all the more confidence, orders the sail to be rigged 
against the wind. Which being done, the whole crowd looking on meanwhile, the 
boat is borne along against the contrary winds with amazing velocity. And after 
no great interval, the adverse winds veer round to the advantage of the voyage 
amid the astonishment of all. And thus, throughout that whole day, the blessed 
man's boat was driven along by gentle favouring breezes, and reached the desired 
haven. Let the reader, therefore, consider how great and saintly was that 
venerable man through whom Almighty God manifested His glorious Name by such 
miraculous powers as have just been described in the presence of a heathen 
people.&quot;</P>
<P>The art of rain-making. bringing down fire from the sky, and causing mists, 
snow-storms and floods was also claimed by the Druids. Many of the spells 
probably in nse among the Druids survived until a comparatively late period, and 
are still in use in some remote Celtic localities-the names of Saints being 
substituted for those of Celtic deities, -as in Well-worship (q.v.) a possibly 
Druidic cultus, and certain ritual practices which are still carried out in the 
vicinity of megalithic structures. In pronouncing incantations, the usual method 
employed was to stand upon one leg, to point to the person or object on which 
the spell was to be laid with the fore-finger, at the same time closing an eye, 
as if to concentrate the force of the entire personality upon that which was to 
be placed under ban. A manuscript preserved in the Monastery of St. Gall and 
dating from the eighth or ninth century, has preserved magical formulae for the 
preservation of butter and the healing of certain diseases in the name of the 
Irish god Diancecht. These and others bear a close resemblance to Babylonian and 
Etruscan spells, and this goes to strengthen the hypothesis often put forward 
with more or less ability that Druidism had an eastern origin. All magical rites 
were accompanied by spells. Druids often accompanied an army to assist by their 
magical art in confounding the enemy.</P>
<P>There is little doubt that the conception of a Druidic priesthood has 
descended down to our own time in a more or less debased condition in British 
Celtic areas. Thus the existence of guardians and keepers of wells said to 
possess magical properties, and the fact that certain familiar magical spells 
and formulae are handed down from one generation to another, is a proof of the 
survival of Druidic tradition, however feeble. Females are generally the 
conservators of these mysteries, but that there were Druid priestesses is fairly 
certain.</P>
<P>There are also indications that to some extent Scottish witchcraft was a 
survival of Celtic religio-magical practice. <I>(See </I>Witchcraft, Scottish in 
article Scotland.)</P>
<P>Amulets were extensively worn by the <I>Cells, </I>the principal forms in use 
being phallic (against the evil eye), coral, the &quot;serpent's egg &quot;-some 
description of fossil. The person who passed a number of serpents together 
forming such an &quot;egg&quot; from their collected spume had to catch it in 
his cloak ere it fell to earth, and then make all speed over a running-stream 
where he was safe from the reptiles' vengeance. Totemic amulets were also 
common. (See Scotland and Ireland.)</P>

<P>Ceremonial Magic :</B> Ceremonial magic is chiefly occupied with the art of 
dealing with spirits. Its rites are supposedly religious, and the rituals which 
contain it partake largely of the nature of religious observances. It is not, as 
generally supposed, a reversed Christianity or Judaism, nor does it partake of 
the profanation of religious ritual. It is in effect an attempt to derive power 
from God for the successful control of evil spirits. In the Grimoires and Keys 
of Black Magic, the operator is constantly reminded that he must meditate 
continually on the undertaking in hand, and centre every hope in the infinite 
goodness of the Great Adonai. The god invoked in Black Magic is not Satan as is 
so often supposed, but the Jehovah of the Jews, and the Trinity of the 
Christians. The foundation of practical magic is almost certainly the belief in 
the power of divine words to compel the obedience of all spirits to those who 
could pronounce them. Such words and names were supposed to invoke or dismiss 
the denizens of the spirit world, and these with suitable prayers were used in 
all magical ceremonies. Again it was thought that it was easier to control evil 
spirits than to enlist the sympathies of angels.</P>
<P>He who would gain such power over demons is exhorted in the magical texts 
which exist to observe continence and abstinence, to disrobe as seldom and sleep 
as little as possible during the period of preparation, to meditate continually 
on his undertaking and centre all his hopes on the Great Adonai. The fast should 
be most austere, and human society must be avoided as much as possible. The 
concluding days of the fast should be additionally strict-sustenance being 
reduced to bread and water. Daily ablutions are necessary, and these must be 
made in water which has been previously exorcised according to the ritual: 
especially must this be observed immediately before the ceremony. Certain 
periods of the day and night are ruled by certain planets and these are to be 
found in the book known as the <I>Key of Solomon the King </I>(q.v). <I>(See 
also </I>Astrology.) The Book of Black Magic taught that the hours of Saturn, 
Mars and Venus are good for communion with spirits,-the hour of the first named 
planet for invoking souls in Hell; and that of the second those who have been 
slain in battle. In fact these hours and seasons are ruled by the laws of 
astrology. In the preparation of the instruments employed, the ceremonies of 
purifying and consecrating, must be carefully observed. An aspergillum composed 
of mint, marjoram, and rosemary should be used for the first and should be 
contained in a pot of glazed earth. For fumigation a chafing dish should be used 
filled with freshly kindled coal and perfumed with aloe-wood or mace, benzoin or 
storax.</P>
<P>The experiment of holding converse with spirits should be made in the day and 
hour of Mercury: that is the <B>1</B>st or <B>8</B>th, or the <B>15</B>th or 
<B>22</B>nd <I>(See </I>Necromancy). The <I>Grand Grimoire </I>says that when 
the night of action has arrived, the operator shall take a rod, a goat-skin, a 
Wood-stone, two crowns of vervain, and two candlesticks with candles; also a new 
steel and two new flints, enough wood to make a fire, half a bottle of brandy, 
incense and camphor, and four nails from the coffin of a dead child. Either one 
or three persons must take part in the ceremony-on of whom only must address the 
spirit. The Kabbalistic circle is formed with strips of kid's skin fastened to 
the ground by the four nails. With the blood-stone a triangle is traced within 
the circle, beginning at the eastern point. The letters a <I>e </I>a j must be 
drawn in like manner, as also the Name of the Saviour between two crosses. The 
candles and vervain crowns are then set in the left and right sides of the 
triangle within the circle, and they with the brazier are set alight-the fire 
being fed with brandy and camphor. A prayer is then repeated. The operator must 
be careful to have no alloyed metal about him except a gold or silver coin 
wrapped in paper. which must be cast to the spirit when he appears outside the 
circle. The spirit is then conjured three times. Should the spirit fail to 
appear. the two ends of the magic rod must be plunged into the flames of the 
brazier. This ritual is known as the Rite of Lucifuge, and is believed to invoke 
the demon Lucifuge Rofocale.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Ceroscopy :</B> Divination by wax. The process was as follows. Fine wax was 
melted in a brass vessel until it became a liquid <B>of </B>uniform consistence. 
It was then poured slowly into another vessel filled with cold water, in such a 
way that the wax congealed in tiny discs upon the surface of the water. The 
magician then interpreted the figures thus presented as he saw fit.</P><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Chagrin or Cagrino :</B> An evil spirit believed in by the Continental 
Gypsies. It has the form of a hedgehog, is yellow in colour, and is a foot and a 
half in length and a span in breadth. &quot; I am certain,&quot; says Wlislocki, 
&quot;that this creature is none other than the equally demoniac being called 
Harginn, still believed in by the inhabitants of North-western India. Horses are 
the special prey of the <I>Chagrin, </I>who rides them into a state of 
exhaustion, as does the Guecubu (q.v.) of Chili. The next day they appear sick 
and weary, with tangled manes and bathed in sweat. When this is observed they 
are tethered to a stake which has been rubbed with garlic juice. then a red 
thread is laid on the ground in the form of a cross, or else some of the hair of 
the animal is mixed with salt, meal and the blood of a bat and cooked to bread, 
with which the hoof of the horse is smeared. The empty vessel which contained 
the mixture is put in the trunk of a high tree while these words are 
uttered:</P>
<P>&quot;Tarry, pipkin, in this tree. </P>
<P>Till such time as full ye be.&quot;</P><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Chain, Forming a :</B> In spiritualism, a term denoting the joining of the 
hands of the sitters round a table, whereby the magnetic current is strengthened 
and reinforced. The Baron de Guldenstubbe gives the following directions for 
forming a chain. &quot;In order to form a chain, the twelve persons each place 
their right hand on the table, and their left hand on that of their neighbour, 
thus making a circle round the table. Observe that the medium or mediums if 
there be more than one, are entirely isolated from those who form the 
chain.&quot;</P>
<P>Dr. Lapponi, in <I>his Hypnotism and Spiritism </I>(trans. London, 
<B>1906</B>), gives an account of the usual procedure for the formation of a 
chain. &quot;He (the medium) makes those present choose a table, which they may 
examine as much as they like, and may place in whatever part of the room they 
choose. He then invites some of the assistants to place their hands on the table 
in the following manner:</P>
<P>The two thumbs of each person are to be touching each other, and each little 
finger is to be in communication with the little finger of the persons on either 
side. He himself completes the <I>chain </I>with his two hands. The hands of all 
altogether rest on the edge of the table. <I>(See </I>Planetary Chains.)</P><B>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Chakras : </B>These. are, according to theosophists, the sense organs of the 
etheral body (q.v.) and receive their name from their appearance which resembles 
vortices. <I>Alto</I>gether there are ten chakras-visible only to 
clairvoyants-but of these it is advisable to use only seven. They are situated, 
not on the denser physical body, but opposite certain parts of it as follows: 
(<B>1</B>)<B> </B>the top of the head, (<B>2</B>)<B> </B>between the eyebrows, 
(<B>3</B>) the throat, (<B>4</B>) the heart, (<B>5</B>) the spleen-(where 
vitality is indrawn from the sun), (<B>6</B>) the solar plexus, (<B>7</B>) the 
base of the spine. The remaining three <I>chakras </I>are situated in the lower 
part of the pelvis and normally are not used, but are brought into play only in 
Black Magic. It is by means of the <I>chakras </I>that the trained occultist can 
become acquainted with the astral world. <I>(See 
</I><STRONG>Theosophy.</STRONG>)</P><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Chalcedony :</B> A good specific against phantasy and the illusions of evil 
spirits. It also quickens the power of the body, and renders its possessor 
fortunate in law. To the latter effect it must be perforated and suspended by 
hairs from an ass. The black variety prevents hoarseness and clears the 
voice.</P><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Chams :</B> A race of Indo-Chinese origin, numbering about 
<B>130</B>,<B>000</B> souls, settled in Annam, Siam, Cochin-China, and Cambodia. 
They have some reputation among the surrounding population as sorcerers; this 
corruption probably arising from the mythic influence of a conquered race. Their 
magicians claim to be able to slay at a distance, or to bring ruin and disease 
by the aid of magical formula. Among' the Cambodian <I>Chams, </I>sorcerers are 
cordially detested by the common people as they are believed to be the source of 
all the evil which befalls them, and the majority of them usually end their days 
by secret assassination. They are nearly always of the female sex, and enter the 
sisterhood by means of a secret initiation held in the depths of the forest at 
the hour of midnight. Indeed the actual method of initiation is known to us. The 
woman who desires to become a sorceress procures the nest of a termite, and 
sacrifices thereon a cock <I>(See </I>Cook), cutting it in two from the head to 
the tail, and dancing in front of it in a condition of complete nudity, until by 
force of her incantations the two halves of the bird approach one another and it 
becomes once more alive and gives vent to a crow. Sorceresses are said to be 
known by the tendency of their complexion to alter its hue, and by their swollen 
and bloodshot eyes. They possess numerous rites for the propitiation of evil 
spirits, in which, in common with the neighbouring and surrounding populations, 
they implicitly believe Thus in building a house numerous propitiatory rites 
must be observed, accompanied by invocation of the protecting deities. They 
believe in lucky and unlucky days, and are careful not to undertake any-thing of 
importance unless favoured by propitious omens. They possess many peculiar 
superstitions. Thus they 'will not disturb grain which has been stored during 
the day time, as they say it is then asleep, and wait until nightfall before 
supplying themselves from it. They also have many magical agricultural formulae, 
such as the &quot;instruction&quot; to, and passing&quot; of, the standing 
rice-stems in the harvest field before they are cut and garnered, so that they 
may be worthy to be stored. The Brahmanic <I>Chams </I>believe that the souls of 
good men betake themselves to the sun, those of women to the moon, and those of 
the coolie class into clouds, but these are only places of temporary sojourn, 
until such time as all finally come to reside within the centre of the earth. 
The belief in metempsychosis is also highly popular. See E. Aymonier, <I>Les 
Tchames et leur Religions, </I>Paris, <B>1891</B>; Aymonier Chaton, 
<I>Dictionnaire Cam-Francaise, </I>Paris, <B>1906</B>; Cahaton, <I>Nouvelles

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Changelings :</B> The substitution of a little old mannikin of the elf race, 
for a young child. There are many tales representative of this ,belief in 
Scotland. The <I>changeling </I>grows up peevish and misshapen, always crying, 
and gives many proofs of its origin to those versed in such matters. There are 
many ways of getting rid of him, such as sticking a knife into him, making him 
sit on a gridiron with a fire below, dropping him into a river, etc.,-which one 
would imagine would prove fairly successful The changeling sometimes gives 
himself away by 'unthinking reference to his age.</P><B>

<P>Charlemagne; or Charles the Great :</B> The greatest of Frankish kings; was 
the elder son of Pepin the Short, and succeeded his father in <B>768</B> A.D. He 
is included in this work chiefly because of his close connection with the 
supernatural so far as legend is concerned. Again and again in the pages of 
French romance, notably in these romances dealing with the adventures of William 
of Orange, do we find the Emperor visited by angels who are the direct 
messengers of the heavenly power. This of course is to symbolise his position as 
the head and front of Christendom in the world. He was its champion and 
upholder, surrounded as he was on all sides by the forces of paganism,-' the 
Moors on his southern borders, and the Prussian and Saxons on his flank. 
<I>Charles </I>was regarded by the Christians of Europe as the direct 
representative of heaven,, whose mission it was to Christianise Europe and to 
defend the true faith in every way. No less do we find him and his court 
connected with the realm of fiery. Notices of the encounters of the fairy folk 
by his paladins are not so numerous in the original French romances which deal 
with him and them; but in the hands of Boiardo, Ariosto, and Pulci, they dwelt 
in an enchanted region where at any moment they might meet with all kinds of 
supernatural beings. But both in the older and later romances the powers of 
magic and enchantment are ever present. These are chiefly instanced in magical 
weapons such as the Sword Durandal of Roland which cannot be shivered; the 
magical ointments of giant-like Ferragus, which rubbed on their bodies make them 
invulnerable; the wearing of armour which exercises a similar guardianship on 
the body of its possessor, and so forth. but we find heroes like Ogier, the 
Dane, penetrating into fairy land itself, and wedding its queen. This was the 
fate of a great many medieval heroes, and Ogier finds in the enchanted realm 
King Arthur. and several other paladins. The analogous cases of Tom-a-Lincolne. 
Taunhauser and Thomas the Rhymer, will readily occur to the reader. The magical 
and the marvellous is everywhere in use in the romances which deal with 
<I>Charlemagne. </I>Indeed in this respect they entirely put in the shade the 
later romances proper, as distinguished from the Chansons de Geste.</P><B>

<P>Charnock, Thomas :</B> Alchemist. (<B>1524</B> ? - <B>1581</B>). 
Comparatively little biographical matter concerning this English alchemist is 
forthcoming, but it is recorded that he was born somewhere in the Isle of 
Thanet, Kent; while as to the date, this is revealed inasmuch as one of his 
manuscripts, dated <B>1574</B>, is stated by the writer to have been penned in 
the fifty years of my age.&quot; As a young man he travelled all over England in 
search of alchemistic knowledge, but eventually he fixed his residence at 
Oxford, and here he chanced to make the acquaintance of a noted scientist. The 
latter, greatly impressed with the youth's cleverness, straightway appointed him 
his confidant and assistant in general; and, after working in this capacity for 
a number of years, <I>Charnock </I>found himself the sole legatee of his 
patron's paraphernalia. and likewise of the various secrets written in his 
note-books. Armed thus, he proceeded to devote himself more eagerly than ever to 
the quest of gold-production; but in <B>1555</B>, <I>just </I>as he imagined 
himself on the verge of triumph, his hopes were frustrated by a sudden explosion 
in his laboratory; while in <B>1557</B>, when he again thought that success was 
imminent. the press-gang arrived at his house and laid violent hands on him, 
being anxious <I>for </I>recruits wherewith to swell the English army then 
fighting the French. The alchemist was bitterly chagrined on being kidnapped in 
this wise, and, lest his secrets should be discovered by prying eyes, he set 
himself to destroy all his precious <I>impedinlenta.</I></P>
<P>&quot;With my works made such a furious faire </P>
<P>That the gold flew forth in the aire,&quot;-</P>
<P>so he writes concerning this iconoclasm, and, subsequent to this event, he 
proceeded to France as a soldier, and took part in the disastrous campaign which 
culminated in the English being worsted at Calais by the Duc de Guise. How 
<I>Charnock </I>fared during the expedition is not known, and it is likely that 
he found small pleasure in the rough life; but be that as it may, he returned to 
England safely, and in <B>1562</B> he was married to one Agnes Norton. 
Thereafter he settled at Stockland, in the county of Somerset, and here he 
continued to pursue scientific researches, apparently unmolested by further 
visitations from the military powers. Nor would it seem that the clergy molested 
him either, or 'looked askance on his alchemistic studies; for on his death, 
which occurred in <B>1581</B>, his mortal remains were duly interred at 
Otterhampton Church, Bridgwater. </P>
<P>That facetious antiquary and historian, Anthony Wood, in his <I>Athenae 
Oxoniensis, </I>credits <I>Charnock </I>with a considerable amount of writing, 
and it is possible that several items enumerated are in reality from some other 
pen than the alchemist's. However, there are certain books which the latter 
undoubtedly wrote, notably <I>AEnigma </I>ad <I>Alchi</I>miam, issued in 
<B>1572</B>; while no less interesting than this is the <I>Breviary of Natural 
Philosophy, </I>which is couched in verse, was published originally in 
<B>1557</B>, and was subsequently reprinted in the <I>Theatrum Chemicum </I>of 
Elias Ashmole.</P><B>

<P>China :</B> Although it can hardly be said that any system of magic worthy of 
the name ever originated in China, and though magical practice was uncommon, yet 
instances are not wanting of the employment of magical means in the Celestial 
Empire, and the belief in a supernatural world peopled by gods, demons and other 
beings is very strong in the popular Chinese mind.</P>
<P>&quot;Although the Chinese mind possessed under such a constitution but few 
elements in which magic could strike root and throw out its ramifications and 
influence, yet we find many traces giving evidence of the instinctive movement 
of the mind, as well as of magical influence; though certainly not in the manner 
or abundance that we meet with it in India. The great variety of these 
appearances is, however, striking, as in no other country are they so seldom met 
with.</P>
<P>As the King, as it were, microcosmically represents the human races in 
fortune or misfortune before the divinity so must his eye be constantly directed 
to those signs in which the will of the Most High is revealed; 'He must observe 
dreams as much as the phenomena of nature, the eclipses and the positions of the 
stars; and, when all else is wanting, he must consult the oracle of the 
tortoise, or the Plant Tsche, and direct his actions accordingly.' He is 
therefore, as it were, the universal oracle of the people, as the popular mind 
is relieved from every flight of imagination by a highly remarkable mental 
compulsion.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It is easy to understand from these circumstances wherefore we find so 
few of these phenomena of magic and the visionary and ecstatic state, in other 
parts of the East so frequent, and therefore they are scattered and uncertain. 
Accounts are, however, not wanting to show that the phenomena as well as 
theories of prophecy were known in more remote times. Under the Emperor Hoel Ti, 
about A.D. <B>304</B>, a mystical sect arose in <I>China </I>calling themselves 
the teachers of the emptiness and nothingness of all things. They also exhibited 
the art of binding the power of the senses, and producing a condition which they 
believed perfection.&quot;</P><I>
<P>Demonism and Obsession. </I>The Chinese are implicit believers in demons whom 
they imagine surround them on every hand. Says Peebles &quot;English officials, 
American missionaries, mandarins and many of the Chinese literati (Confucians, 
Taoists and Buddhist believers alike) declare that spritism in some form, and 
under some name, is the almost universal belief of <I>China. </I>It is generally 
denominated 'ancestral worship.'&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;There is no driving out of these Chinese,&quot; says Father Gonzalo, 
&quot;the cursed belief that the spirits of their ancestors are ever about them, 
availing themselves of every opportunity to give advice and counsel.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The medium consulted,&quot; remarks Dr. Doolittle, &quot;takes in the 
hand a stick of lighted incense to dispel ad defiling influences, then prayers 
of some kind are ,repeated, the body becomes spasmodic, the medium&rsquo;s eyes 
are shut, and the form sways about, assuming the walk and peculiar attitude of 
the spirit when in the body. Then the communication' from the divinity begins, 
which may be of a faultfinding or a flattering character. . . . Sometimes these 
Chinese mediums profess to be possessed by some specified historical god of 
great healing power, and in this condition they prescribe for the sick. It is 
believed that the ghoul or spirit invoked actually casts himself into the 
medium, and dictates the medicine.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Volume, might be written upon the gods, genii and familiar spirits 
supposed to be continually in communication with this people,&quot; writes Dr. 
John L. Nevius, in his works, <I>China </I>and <I>The Chinese. </I>&quot;The 
Chinese have a large number of books upon this subject, among the most noted of 
which is the Liau-chai-chei,' a large work of sixteen volumes. . . . Tu Sein 
signifies a spirit in the body, and there are a class of familiar spirits 
supposed to dwell in the bodies of certain Chinese who became the mediums of 
communication with the unseen world. Individuals said 'to be possessed by these 
spirits are visited by multitudes, particularly those who have lost recently 
relatives by death, and wish to converse with them.</P>
<P>Remarkable disclosures and revelations are believed to be made by the 
involuntary movements of a bamboo pencil, and through a similar method some 
claim to see in the dark. Persons considering themselves endowed with superior 
intelligence are firm believers in those and other modes of consulting 
spirits.&quot;</P>
<P>The public teacher in Chen Sin Ling (W. J. Plumb says) &quot; In the district 
of Tu-ching, obsessions by evil spirits or demons are very common. He further 
writes that &quot;there are very many cases also in Chang-lo.&quot; Again he 
says:</P>
<P>&quot;When a man is thus afflicted, the spirit <I>(Kwei) </I>takes possession 
of his body without regard to his being strong or weak in health. It is not easy 
to resist the demon's power. Though without bodily ailments, possessed persons 
appear as if ill. When under the entrancing spell of the demon, they seem 
different from their ordinary selves.</P>
<P>&quot;In most cases the spirit takes possession of a man's body contrary to 
his will, and he is helpless in the matter. The kwei has the power of driving 
out the man's spirit, as in sleep or dreams. When the subject awakes to 
consciousness, he has not the slightest knowledge of what has transpired.</P>
<P>&quot;The actions of possessed persons vary exceedingly. They leap about and 
toss their arms, and then the demon tells them what particular spirit he is, 
often taking a false name, or deceitfully calling himself a god, or one of the 
genii come down to the abodes of mortals. Or, perhaps, it professes to be the 
spirit of a deceased husband or wife. There are also kwei of the quiet sort, who 
talk and laugh like other people, only that the voice is changed. Some have a 
voice like a bird. Some speak Mandarin-the language of <I>Northern China-and 
</I>some the local dialect; but though the speech proceeds from the mouth of the 
man, what is said does not appear to come from him. The outward appearance and 
manner is also changed.</P>
<P>&quot;In Fu-show there is a class of persons who collect in large numbers and 
make use of incense, pictures, candles and lamps to establish what are called 
incense tables.' Taoist priests are engaged to attend the ceremonies and they 
also make use of 'mediums.' The Taoist writes a charm for the medium, who, 
taking the incense .stick in his hand, stands like a graven image, thus 
signifying his willingness to have the demon come and take possession of him. 
Afterward, the charm is burned and the demon-spirit is worshipped and invoked, 
the priest, in the meanwhile' going on with his chanting. After a while the 
medium begins to tremble, and then speaks and announces what spirit has 
descended, and asks what is wanted of him. Then, whoever has requests to make, 
takes incense sticks, makes prostrations, and asks a response respecting some 
disease, or for protection from some calamity. In winter the same performances 
are carried on to a great extent by gambling companies; If some of the responses 
hit the mark, a large number of people are attracted. They establish a shrine 
and offer sacrifices, and appoint days, calling upon people from every quarter 
to come and consult the spirit respecting diseases. .</P>
<P>&quot;There is also a class of men who establish what they call a 'Hall of 
Revelations.' At the present time there are many engaged in this practice. They 
are, for the most part, literary men of great ability. The people in large 
numbers apply to them for responses. The mediums spoken of above are also 
numerous. All of the above practices are not spirits seeking to possess men; but 
rather men seeking spirits to possess them, and allowing themselves to be 
voluntarily used as their instruments.</P>
<P>As to the outward appearance of persons when possessed, of course, they are 
the same person as to outward form as at ordinary times; but the colour of the 
countenance may change. The demon may cause the subject to assume a threatening 
air, and a fierce, violent manner, The muscles often stand out on the face, the 
eyes are closed, or they protrude with a frightful stare. These demons sometimes 
prophesy.</P>
<P>&quot;The words spoken certainly proceed from the mouths of the persons 
possessed; but what is said does not appear to come from their minds or wills, 
but rather from some other personality, often accompanied by a change of voice. 
Of this there can be no doubt. When the subject returns to consciousness, he 
invariably declares himself ignorant of what he has said.</P>
<P>&quot;The Chinese make use of various methods to cast out demons. They are so 
troubled and vexed by inflictions affecting bodily health, or it may be throwing 
stones, moving furniture, or the moving about and destruction of family 
utensils, that they are driven to call in the service of some respected scholar 
or Taoist priest, to offer sacrifices, or chant sacred books, and pray for 
protection and exemption from suffering. Some make use of sacrifices and 
offerings of paper clothes and money in order to induce the demon to go back to 
the gloomy region of Yan-chow. As to whether these methods. have any effect, I 
do not know. As a rule, when demons are not very troublesome, the families 
afflicted by them generally think it best to hide their affliction, or to keep 
these wicked spirits quiet by sacrifices, and burning incense to them.&quot;</P>
<P>An article in the <I>London Daily News </I>gives lengthy extracts from an 
address upon the Chinese by Mrs. Montague Beaucham, who had spent many years in 
<I>China </I>in educational work. Speaking of their spiritism, she said, 
&quot;The latest London craze in using the planchette has been one of the 
recognized means in <I>China </I>of conversing with evil spirits from time 
immemorial.&quot; She had lived in one of the particular provinces known as 
demon land, where the natives are bound up in the belief and worship of spirits. 
&quot;There is a real power,&quot; she added, &quot;in this necromancy. They do 
healings and tell fortunes.&quot; She personally knew of one instance that the 
spirits through the planchette had foretold a great flood. The boxer rising was 
prophesied by the planchette.. These spirits disturbed family relations, caused 
fits of frothing at the mouth, and made some of their victims insane. In closing 
she declared that &quot;Chinese spiritism was from hell,&quot; the obsession 
baffling the power of both Christian missionaries and native priests.</P>
<P>Dr. Nevius sent out a circular communication for the purpose of discovering 
the actual beliefs of the Chinese regarding demonism through which he obtained 
much valuable information. Wang Wu-Fang, an educated Chinese wrote:</P>
<P>&quot;Cases of demon possession abound among all classes. They are found 
among persons of robust health, as well as those who are weak and sickly. In 
many unquestionable cases of obsession, the unwilling subjects have resisted, 
but have been obliged to submit themselves to the control of the demon.</P>
<P>&quot;In the majority of cases of possession, the beginning of the malady is 
a fit of grief, anger or mourning. These conditions seem to open the door to the 
demons. The outward manifestations are apt to be fierce and violent. It may be 
that the subject alternately talks and laughs; he walks awhile and then sits, or 
he rolls on the ground, or leaps about; or exhibits contortions of the body and 
twistings of the neck. . . . It was common among. them to send for exorcists, 
who made use of written charms, or chanted verses. or punctured the body with 
needles These are among the Chinese methods of cure.</P>
<P>&quot;Demons are of different kinds. There are those which clearly declare 
themselves; and then those who work in secret. There are those which are cast 
out with difficulty, and others with ease.</P>
<P>&quot;In cases of possession by familiar demons, what is said by the subject 
certainly does not proceed, from his own will. When the demon has gone out and 
the subject recovers consciousness, he has no recollection whatever of what he 
has said or done. This is true almost invariably.</P>
<P>&quot;The methods by which the Chinese cast out demons are enticing them to 
leave by burning charms and paper money, or by begging and exhorting them, or by 
frightening them with magic spells and incantations, or driving them away by 
pricking with needles, or pinching with the fingers, in which case they cry out 
and promise to go.</P>
<P>&quot;I was formerly accustomed to drive out demons by means of needles. At 
that time cases of possession by evil spirits were very common in our villages, 
and my services were in very frequent demand </P>
<P>The Rev. Timothy Richard, missionary, also writing in response to Dr. 
Nevius&rsquo; circular, says:-</P>
<P>&quot;The Chinese orthodox definition of spirit is, 'the soul of the 
departed;' some of the best of whom are raised to the rank of gods. . . . There 
is no disease to which the Chinese are' ordinarily subject that may not be 
caused by demons. In this case the mind is untouched. It is only the body that 
suffers; and the Chinese endeavour to get rid of the demon by vows and offerings 
to the gods. The subject in this case is an involuntary one.</P>
<P>&quot;Persons possessed range between fifteen and fifty years of age, quite 
irrespective of sex. This infliction comes on very suddenly, sometimes in the 
day, and sometimes in the night. The demoniac talks madly, smashes everything 
near him, acquires unusual strength, tears his clothes into rags, and rushes 
into the street, or to the mountains or kills himself unless prevented. After 
this violent possession, the demoniac calms down and submits to his fate, but 
under the most heart-rending protests. These mad spells which are experienced on 
the demon's entrance return at intervals, and increase in frequency, and 
generally also in intensity, so that death at last ensues from their 
violence.</P>
<P>&quot;A Chefoo boy of fifteen was going on an errand. His path led through 
fields where men were working at their crops. When he came up to the men and had 
exchanged a word or two with them, he suddenly began to rave wildly; his eyes 
rolled, then he made for a pond near by. Seeing this, the people ran up to him, 
stopped him from drowning himself and took him home to his parents. When he got 
home, he sprang up from the ground to such a height as manifested almost a 
superhuman strength. After a few days he calmed down and became unusually quiet 
and gentle; but his own consciousness was lost. The demon spoke of its friends 
in Nan-Kin. After six months this demon departed. He has been in the service of 
several foreigners in Chefoo since. In this case no worship was offered to the 
demon.</P>
<P>&quot;Now we proceed to those, who involuntarily possessed, yield to and 
worship the demon. The demon says he will cease tormenting the demoniac if he 
will worship him, and he will reward him by increasing his riches. But if not, 
he will punish his victim, make heavier his torments and rob him of his 
property. People find that their food is cursed. They cannot prepare any, but 
filth and dirt comes down from the air to render it uneatable. Their wells are 
likewise cursed; their wardrobes are set on fire, and their money very 
mysteriously disappears. Hence arose the custom of cutting off the head of a 
string of cash that it might not run away. . . . When all efforts to rid 
themselves of the demon fail, they yield to it, and say</P>
<P>'Hold! Cease thy tormenting and we will worship thee!, A picture is pasted 
upon the wall, sometimes of a woman, and sometimes of a man, and incense is 
burned, and prostrations are made to it twice a month. Being thus reverenced, 
money now comes in mysteriously, instead of going out. Even mill-stones are made 
to move at the demon's orders, and the family becomes rich at once. But it is 
said that no luck attends such families, and they will eventually be reduced to 
poverty. Officials believe these things. Palaces are known to have been built by 
them for these demons, who, however, are obliged to be satisfied with humbler 
shrines from the poor.</P>
<P>&quot;Somewhat similar to the above class is another small one which has 
power to enter the lower regions. There are the opposite of necromancers, for 
instead of calling up the dead and learning of them about the future. destiny of 
the individual in whose behalf they are engaged, they lie in a trance for two 
days, when their spirits are said to have gone to the Prince of Darkness, to 
inquire how long the sick person shall be left among the living.</P>
<P>&quot;Let us now note the different methods adopted to cast out the evil 
'spirits from the demoniacs. Doctors are called to do it. They use needles to 
puncture the tips of the fingers, the nose, the neck. They also use a certain 
pill, and apply it in the following manner: the thumbs of the two hands are tied 
tightly together, and the two big toes are tied together in the same manner. 
Then one pill is put on the two big toes at the root of the nail, and the other 
at the root of the thumb nails. At the same instant the two pills are set on 
fire, and they are kept until the flesh is burned. In the application of the 
pills, or in the piercing of the needle, the invariable cry is: 'I am going; I 
am going immediately. I will never dare to come back again. Oh, have mercy on me 
this once. I'll never return I</P>
<P>&quot;When the doctors fail, they' call on people who practise spiritism. 
They themselves cannot drive the demon away, but they call another demon to do 
it. Both the Confucianists and Taoists practise this method. . . . Sometimes the 
spirits are very ungovernable. Tables are turned, chairs are rattled, and a 
general noise of smashing is heard, until the very mediums themselves tremble 
with fear. If the demon is of this dreadful character, they quickly write 
another charm with the name of the particular spirit whose quiet disposition is 
known to them. Lu-tsu is a favourite one of this kind. After the burning of the 
charm and incense, and when prostrations are made, a little frame is procured, 
to which a Chinese pencil is attached. Two men on each side hold it on a table 
spread with sand or millet. Sometimes a prescription is written, the pencil 
moving of its own accord( They buy the medicine prescribed and give it to the 
possessed. . . . Should they find that burning incense and offering sacrifices 
fails to ,liberate the poor victim, they may call in conjurors, such as the 
Taoists, who sit on mats and are carried by invisible power from place to place. 
They ascend to a height of twenty or fifty feet, and are carried to a distance 
of four or five <I>Ii </I>(about half a mile). Of this class are those who, in 
Manchuria call down fire from the sky in those funerals where the corpse is 
burned. </P>
<P>&quot;These exorcists may belong to any of the three religions in China. The 
dragon procession. on the fifteenth of the first month, is said by some to 
commemorate a Buddhist priest's victory over evil spirits. . . . They paste up 
charms on windows and doors, and on the body of the demoniac, and conjure the 
demon never to return. The evil spirit answers: ' I'll never return You need not 
'take tile trouble of pasting all these charms upon the doors and windows.</P>
<P>&quot;Exorcists are specially hated by the evil spirits. Sometimes they feel 
themselves beaten fearfully; but no hand is seen. Bricks and stones may fall on 
them from the sky or housetops. On the road they may without any warning be 
plastered over from head to foot with mud or filth, or may be seized when 
approaching a river. and held under the water and drowned.&quot;</P>
<P>In his <I>Social Life among </I>She <I>Chinese, </I>Dr. Doolittle says:</P>
<P>&quot;They have invented several ways by which they find out the pleasure of 
gods and spirits. One of the most common of their utensils is the <I>Ka-pue, 
</I>a piece of bamboo root, bean-shaped, and divided in the centre, to indicate 
the, positive and the. negative. The incense lighted, the Ka-pue properly 
manipulated before the symbol god, the pieces are tossed from the medium's hand, 
indicating the will of the spirit by the way they fall.&quot;</P>
<P>The following manifestation is mental rather than physical:-</P>
<P>&quot;The professional takes in the hand a stick of lighted incense to expel 
all defiling influences; prayers of some sort are repeated, the fingers 
interlaced, and the medium's eyes are shut, giving unmistakable evidence of 
being possessed by some supernatural or spiritual power. The body sways back and 
forward; the incense falls, and the person begins to step about, assuming the 
walk and peculiar attitude of the spirit. This is considered as infallible proof 
that the divinity has entered the' body of the medium. Some-times the god, using 
the mouth of the medium, gives the supplicant a sound scolding for invoking his 
aid to obtain unlawful ,or unworthy ends.</P><I>
<P>&quot;Divination,&quot; </I>writes Sir John Burrows, &quot;with many strange' 
methods of summoning the dead to instruct the living and reveal the future, is 
of very ancient origin, as is proved by Chinese manuscripts antedating the 
revelations of the Jewish Scriptures.&quot;</P>
<P>An ancient Chinese book called <I>Poh-shi-ching-tsung, </I>consisting of six 
volumes on the &quot;Source of True Divination,' contains the following 
preface:</P>
<P>&quot;The secret of augury consists in the study of the mysteries and in 
communications with gods and demons. The interpretations of the transformations 
are deep and mysterious. The theory of the science is most intricate, the 
practice of it most important. The sacred classic says: 'That which is true 
gives indications of the future.' To know the condition, of the dead, and hold 
with them intelligent intercourse, as did the ancients, produces a most salutary 
influence upon the parties But when from intoxication or feasting, or licentious 
pleasures, they proceed to invoke the gods, what infatuation to suppose that 
their prayers will move them Often when no response is given. 'or the 
interpretation is not verified, they lay the blame at the door of the augur, 
forgetting that their failure is due to their want of sincerity. ., . . It is 
the great fault of augurs, too, that, from a desire of gain, they use the art of 
divination as a trap to ensnare' the people.&quot;</P>
<P>Peebles adds; &quot;Naturally undemonstrative and secretive, the higher 
classes of Chinese seek to conceal their full knowledge of spirit intercourse 
from foreigners, and from the inferior castes of their own countrymen. thinking 
them not sufficiently. intelligent to rightly use it. The lower orders, 
superstitious and money-grasping, often prostitute their magic gifts to gain and 
fortune-telling. These clairvoyant fortune-tellers, surpassing wandering gypsies 
in 'hitting' the past, infest the temples, streets and toad-sides, promising to 
find lost property, discover precious metals and reveal the hidden 
future.&quot;</P><I>
<P>Ghosts.-The </I>Chinese are strong in' the belief that they are surrounded by 
the spirits of the dead. Indeed ancestor-worship constitutes a powerful feature 
in the national faith, but as it deals with religion it does not come within the 
scope of this article. Suffice it to say that the Celestial has ever before him 
the likelihood and 'desirability of communion with the dead. On the death of a 
person they make a hole in the roof to permit the soul to 'effect its escape 
from the house. When a child is at the point of death, its mother will go into 
the garden and call its name, hoping thereby to bring back its wandering 
spirit.</P>
<P>&quot;With the Chinese the souls of suicides are specially obnoxious, and 
they consider that the very worst penalty that can befall a soul is the sight of 
its former surroundings. This, it is supposed that, in the case of the wicked 
man, 'they only see their homes as if they were near them: they see their last 
wishes disregarded, everything upside down, their substance squandered, 
strangers possess the old estate; in their misery the dead man's family curse 
him, his children become corrupt, land is gone, the wife sees her husband 
tortured, the husband sees his wife' stricken down with mortal disease; even 
friends forget, but some, perhaps, for the sake of bygone times, may stroke the 
coffin and let fall a tear, departing with a cold smile.'&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;In <I>China, </I>the ghosts which are animated by a, sense of duty are 
frequently ,seen: at one time' they seek to serve virtue in distress, and at 
another they aim to restore wrongfully held&quot; treasure. Indeed, as it has 
been observed, one of the most powerful as well as the most widely diffused of 
the people's ghost stories is that which treats of the persecuted child whose 
mother comes out of' the grave to succour him.&quot;'</P>
<P>&quot;The Chinese have a dread of the wandering spirits of persons who have 
come to an unfortunate end. At Canton, <B>1817</B>, the wife of an officer of 
Government had occasioned the death of two female domestic slaves, from some 
jealous suspicion it was supposed of her husband's conduct towards the girls; 
and, in order to screen herself from the consequences, she suspended the bodies 
by the neck, with a view to its being construed into an act of suicide. But the 
conscious of the woman tormented her to such a degree that she became insane, 
and at times personated the victims of her cruelty, or, as the Chinese supposed. 
the spirits of the murdered girls possessed her, and utilised her mouth to 
declare her own guilt. In her ravings she tore her clothes and beat her own 
person with all the fury of madness; after which she would recover her senses 
for a time, when it was supposed the demons quitted her, but only to return with 
greater frenzy, which took place a short time previous to her death. According 
to Mr. Dennys, the most common forms of Chinese ghost story is that wherein the 
ghost seeks to bring to justice the murderer who shuffled off its mortal 
coil.&quot;</P>
<P>Poltergeists (q.v.) are not uncommon in <I>China, </I>and several cases of 
their occurrence have been recorded by the Jesuit missionaries of the eighteenth 
century in Cochin China. Mr. Dennys in his <I>Folklore of China, </I>mentions a 
case in which a Chinaman was forced to take refuge in a temple by the usual 
phenomena - throwing about of crockery, etc., after the decease of a 
monkey.</P><I>
<P>Secret Societies. </I>For an account of secret societies in <I>China, See 
</I>Thion-ti-Hwlr and Triad Society.</P>
<P>It has sometimes been claimed that the systems of Confucius and Lao-Tze are 
magical or kabalistic, but such claims have been advanced by persons who did not 
appreciate their proper status as philosophic systems. (See Y-Kin, Book 
of.)</P><I>
<P>Symbolism. </I>There are numerous mysteries of meaning in the strange 
symbols, characters, personages. birds, beasts, etc. which adorn all species of 
Chinese art objects. For example a rectangular Chinese vase is feminine 
representing the creative or ultimate principle. A group of seemingly 
miscellaneous art objects, depicted perhaps upon a brush tray, are probably the 
<I>po-ku, </I>or 'hundred antiques,' emblematic of culture and implying a 
delicate compliment to the recipient of the tray. Birds and animals occur with 
frequency on Chinese porcelains, and, if one will observe closely, it is a 
somewhat select menagerie, in which certain types are emphasised by repetition. 
For instance, the dragon. is so familiar as to be no longer remarked, and yet 
his' significance is perhaps not fully understood by all. There are, in fact, 
three kinds of dragons, the <I>lung </I>of the sky, the <I>Ii </I>of the sea, 
and the <I>kiau. </I>of the marshes. The <I>lung </I>is the favourite kind, 
however, and may be known when met by his having' the head of a camel, the horns 
of a deer, the eyes of a rabbit, ears of a cow, neck of a snake, belly of a 
frog, scales of a carp, claws of a hawk, and palm of a tiger.' His special 
office is to 'guard and support the mansions of the gods, and he is naturally 
the peculiar symbol of the Emperor,. or Son of Heaven.</P>
<P>A less familiar beast is the <I>chi-lin, </I>which resembles in part a 
rhinoceros, but has head, feet, and legs like ,a deer, and a tufted tail. In 
spite of his unprepossessing appearance he is of a benevolent disposition, and 
his image on a vase or other ornament is an emblem of good government and length 
of days. A strange bird, having the head of a pheasant, a long flexible neck and 
a plumed tail, may often be seen flying in the midst of scroll-like clouds, or 
walking in a grove of treepeonies. This is the <I>fengbuang, </I>the Chinese 
phoenix, emblem of immortality and appearing to mortals only as a presage of the 
auspicious reign of a virtuous Emperor. The tortoise <I>(kuei), </I>which bears 
upon its back the seagirt abode of the Eight Immortals, is a third supernatural 
creature associated with strength, longevity, and (because of the markings on 
its back) with a mystic plan of numerals which is a key to the philosophy of the 
unseen.</P>
<P>Colours have their significance, blue being the colour of the heavens, yellow 
of the earth and the Emperor, red of the sun, white of Jupiter or the Year Star, 
while each dynasty had its own particular hue, that of' the Chou dynasty being 
described as 'blue of the sky after rain where it appears between the 
clouds.'</P>
<P>One could go on indefinitely 'reading' the meaning of the seemingly' 
fantastic creations of the Chinese artist-devotee, but enough has been said to 
show that the strange beings, the conventional arrangements, the apparently 
haphazard conjunction of objective in his decorative schemes are far from being 
matter of chance, but add to their decorative properties the intellectual charm 
of significance.</P><B>

come to be regarded as the special haunt of ghosts. The popular imagination may 
well be excused for supposing that the spirits of the dead continue to hover 
over the spot where their bodies are laid. The ancient Greeks thought that the 
souls of the dead were especially powerful near their graves or sepulchres, 
because of some natural tie binding soul and body, even after death. The more 
gross and earthly' a soul was, the less willing was it to leave the vicinity of 
its body, and in consequence. spectres encountered in a <I>churchyard </I>were 
more to be feared than those met with elsewhere. The apparitions witnessed at 
the tombs of saints, however, were to be regarded rather as. good angels than 
the souls of the saints themselves.</P><B>

<P>Circles, Spiritualistic :</B> A group of persons who meet at intervals for 
the purpose of holding seances for spirit communication. It is essential that at 
least one among them be a medium; occasionally there are several mediums in one 
circle. But indeed ail the members of a circle must be chosen with care, if the 
seances are to be productive of phenomena. The Baron de Guldenstubbe, in his 
<I>Practical Experimental Pheumatology, or the Reality of Spirits and the 
Marvellous Phenomenon of their Direct Writing, </I>published early in the 
history of the movement, gives directions for the forming of a circle after the 
American fashion.</P>
<P>&quot;Setting aside the moral conditions,&quot; he says, &quot;which are 
equally requisite it is known that American Circles are based on the distinction 
of positive and 'electric or negative magnetic currents.</P>
<P>&quot;The circles consist of twelve persons, representing in equal 
proportions 'the positive and negative or sensitive elements. This distinction 
does not follow the sex of the members, though generally women are negative and 
sensitive, while men are positive and. magnetic. The mental and physical 
constitution of each individual must be studied before forming the circles, for 
some delicate women have masculine qualities, while some &quot;strong men are, 
morally speaking, women. A table is placed in a clear and ventilated spot; the 
medium is seated at one end and entirely isolated; by his calm and contemplative 
quietude he serves as a conductor for the electricity and it may be noted that a 
good somnambulist is usually an excellent medium. The six electrical or negative 
dispositions, which are generally recognised by their emotional qualities and 
their sensibility, are placed at the right of the medium, the most sensitive of 
all being next to him. The same rule is followed with the positive 
personalities, who are at the left of the medium, with' the most positive among 
them next to him. In order to form a chain, the twelve person each ,place their 
right hand on the table, and their left hand on that of the neighbour, thus 
making a circle round the table. Observe that the medium or mediums, if there be 
more than one, are entirely isolated from those who form the chain.&quot;</P>
<P>The formation of a circle is accomplished on similar lines at the present 
day. M. Camille Flammarion states that the alternation of the sexes is generally 
provided to &quot;rein-force the fluids.&quot; That the seance may be as 
productive when the circle is composed of a few investigators, following no 
rules, but their own, has been abundantly proved in recent years. The one 
indispensable feature is the medium.</P><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Clairaudience (&quot;'Clear Hearing&quot;) :</B> The ability to hear sounds 
inaudible to the normal ear, such as &quot;spirit&quot; voices; a faculty 
analogous to clairvoyance, (q.v.), but considerably less frequently met with. If 
<I>clairaudience </I>be ascribed to auditory, as clairvoyance to visual, 
hallucination, its comparative rareness is accounted for, since visual 
hallucination is the more common of the two. At the same time there are a goodly 
number of instances of the clairaudient faculty on record, some of them of a 
very picturesque nature. (See Spirit Music). Perhaps the best known case is that 
of Joan of Arc, but she was not the only martyr who heard the voices of saints 
and angels urging them to the performance of some special task. In 
spiritualistic circles the faculty is frequently claimed by mediums, but 
distinction must be made between the &quot;inner voice,&quot; in which the 
latter are supposed to receive communications from the denizens of the other 
world, and an externalised voice comparable to an actual physical sound. 
Frequently some such physical sounds form the basis of an auditory 
hallucination, just as the points of light in a crystal are said to form 
<I>points de repere </I>round which the hallucination of the visualiser may 
shape itself.</P><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Clairvoyance <I>( i.e. , </I>&quot;clear vision&quot;) :</B> A term denoting 
the supposed supernormal faculty of seeing persons and events which are distant 
in time or place, and of which no knowledge can reach the seer through the 
normal sense-channels. <I>Clairvoyance </I>may be roughly divided into three 
classes-retrocognition and premonition, or the perception of past and future 
events respectively, and the perception of contemporary events happening at a 
distance, or outside the range of the normal vision. <I>Clairvoyance </I>may 
include psychometry, second sight, and crystal-gazing, all of which see. For the 
early history of <I>clairvoyance, see </I>Divination. In prophecy, we have a 
form of <I>clairvoyance </I>extending back into antiquity, and second-sight also 
is an ancient form. It is notable that spiritualism in Great Britain was 
directly heralded, about the third decade of the nineteenth century, by an 
outbreak of <I>clairvoyance. </I>Among the clairvoyants of that period may be 
mentioned Alexis Didier (q.v.), whose phenomena suggested that telepathy at 
least entered into his feats, which included the reading of letters enclosed in 
sealed packets, the playing of <I>ecarte. </I>with bandaged eyes, and others of 
a like nature. <I>Clairvoyance </I>remains to the present day a prominent 
feature of the spiritualistic seance. Though there exists a quantity of 
evidence, collected by the members of the Society for Psychical Research and 
other scientific investigators, which would seem to support the theory of a 
supernormal vision, yet at the same time it must be acknowledged that many cases 
of <I>clairvoyance </I>lend themselves to a more mundane explanation. For 
instance, it has been shown that it is almost, if not quite, impossible so to 
bandage the eyes of the medium that he cannot make some use of his. normal 
vision. The possibility of hyperaesthesia during trance must also be taken into 
account, nor must we overlook the hypothetical factor of telepathy, which may 
conceivably play a part in clairvoyant performances. A private enquiry agency 
might also be suggested as a possible source of some of the knowledge displayed 
by the professional clairvoyant. The crystal is, as has been indicated, a 
favourite mode of exercising the clairvoyant faculty, presumably because the 
hypnotic state is favourable to the development of the supernormal vision, 
though it might also be suggested that the condition thus induced favoured the 
rising into the upper consciousness of knowledge' sub-consciously gleaned. The 
term <I>clairvoyance </I>is also used to cover the power to see discarnate 
spirits, and is thus applied to mediumship generally.</P><B>

<P>Cledonism, or in full, Cledonismantia</B> : is the good or evil presage of 
certain words uttered without premeditation when persons come together in any 
way. It also regulated the words to be used on particular occasions. Cicero says 
the Pythagoreans were very attentive to these presages; and according to 
Pausanius, it was a favourite method of divination at Smyrna, where the oracles 
of Apollo were thus interpreted..</P><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Cleromancy :</B> was practised by throwing black and white beans, little 
bones or dice, and perhaps, stones; anything,. in short, suitable for lots. A 
method of practising <I>cleromancy </I>in the streets of Egypt is mentioned 
under the head of Sortilege, and the same thing was common in Rome. The Thriaean 
lots, named before, meant indifferently the same thing as <I>cleromancy; </I>it 
was nothing more than dicing, only that the objects used bore particular marks 
or characters, ,and were consecrated to Mercury, who was regarded as the patron 
of this method of divination. For this reason an olive leaf, called&quot; the 
lot of Mercury,&quot; was generally put in the urn in order to propitiate his 
favour.</P><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Clidomancy :</B> could be exercised when the sun or moon is in Virgo. the 
name should be written upon a key the key should be tied' to a Bible, and both 
should be hung upon the nail of the ring-finger of a virgin, who must thrice 
softly repeat certain words. According as the key and book turns or is 
stationary, the name is to be considered right or wrong. Some ancients added the 
seven Psalms with litanies and sacred prayers, and then more fearful effects 
were produced upon the guilty; for not only the key and the book turned, but 
either the impression of the key was found upon him, or he lost an eye. Another 
.method of practising with the Bible and key, is to place the street door key on 
the fiftieth-psalm, close the volume and fasten it very tightly with the garter 
of a female; it is then suspended to a nail and will turn when the name of the 
thief is mentioned. By a third method, two persons suspend the Bible between 
them; holding the ring of the key by their two forefingers.</P><B>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Cock :</B> The <I>cock </I>has always been connected with. magical practice 
in the various parts of the world throughout the ages, and is to be considered 
in more than one light in this connection. He is the herald of the dawn, and 
many examples might be cited of assemblies of demons and sorcerers where his 
shrill cry, announcing dayspring, has put the infernal Sabbath to rout. It is 
said that for the purpose of averting such a contingency, sorcerers were wont to 
smear the head and breast of the <I>cock </I>with olive oil, or else to place 
around his neck a collar of vine-branches. In many cases the future was divined 
through the instrumentality of this bird. <I>(See </I>Alectryomancy). It was 
also believed that in the stomach of the <I>cock </I>was found a stone, called 
Lappilus Alectorius, from the Greek name of the bird, the virtue of which was to 
give strength and courage, and which is said to have inspired the gigantic might 
of Milo of Crotona.</P>
<P>Originally a native of India, the <I>cock </I>arrived in Europe in early 
times, via. Persia, where we find him alluded to in the Zoroastrian books as the 
beadle of Sraosa, the sun, and affrighter of demons. Among the Arabs, it is said 
that he crows when 'he becomes aware of the presence of jinns. The Jews received 
their conception of the <I>cock </I>as a scarer of evil spirits from the 
Persians, as did the Armenians, who say that he greets with his clarion call the 
guardian angels, who descend to earth. with the day, and that he gives' the 
key-note to the angelic choirs of heaven to commence their daily round of song. 
In India, too, and among the Pagan Slavs, he was supposed to scare away demons 
from dwelling</P>
<P>places, and was often the first living creature introduced into a newly-built 
house. The Jews, however, believe that it is possible for the <I>cock </I>to 
become the victim of demons, and they say that if he upsets a dish he should be 
killed. The <I>cock </I>is often used directly in magical practice. Thus, in 
Scotland, he is buried under the patients' bed in cases of epilepsy. The Germans 
believed that if a sorcerer throws a black <I>cock </I>into the air, thunder and 
lightning will follow, and among the Chams of Cambodia, a woman who wishes to 
become a sorceress, sacrifices a live <I>cock </I>on a termite's nest, cutting 
the bird in two from the head to the tail, and placing it on an altar, in front 
of which she dances and sings, until the two halves of the bird come together 
again, and it comes to life and crows. His name was often pronounced by the 
Greeks as a cure for the diseases of animals, and it was said by the Romans that 
locked doors could be opened with his tail feathers. The bird was often pictured 
on amulets in early times, and figured as the symbol of Abraxas, the principal 
deity of a Gnostic sect.</P>
<P>The <I>cock </I>is often regarded as the guide of souls to the underworld, 
and in this respect was associated by the Greeks with Persephone and Hermes, 
'and the Slavs of pagan times often sacrificed <I>cocks </I>to the dead, and 'to 
the household 'serpents in which they believed their ancestors to be 
reincarnated. Conversely, the <I>cock </I>was sometimes pictured as having an 
infernal connection, especially if his colour be black. Indeed he is often 
employed in black magic, perhaps the earliest instance of this being in the 
Atharia Veda. A black <I>cock </I>is offered up to propitiate the Devil in 
Hungary, and a black hen was used or the same purpose in Germany. The Greek 
syrens, the Shedim of the Talmud, and the Izpuzteque, whom the dead Aztec 
encounters on the road to Mictlan, the Place of the Dead, all have <I>cock's 
</I>feet. There is a widespread folk-belief that once in seven years the <I>cock 
</I>lays a little egg. In Germany it is necessary to throw this over the roof, 
or tempests will wreck the homestead, but should the egg be hatched, it will 
produce a cockatrice or basilisk. In Lithuania they put the <I>cock's </I>egg in 
a pot, and place it in the oven. From this egg is hatched a Kauks a bird with a 
tail like that of a golden pheasant, which, if properly tended, will bring its 
owner great good luck. Gross mentions in a chronicle of Bile, in Switzerland, 
that in the month of August, <B>1474, </B>a <I>cock </I>of that town was accused 
and convicted of laying an egg. and was condemned to death. He was publicly 
burned along with his egg, at a place called Kablenberg, in sight of a great 
multitude of people.</P>
<P>The <I>cock </I>was also regarded as having a connection with light and with 
the sun, probably because of the redness of his comb, and the fiery sheen of his 
plumage, or perhaps because he heralds the day. It is the <I>cock </I>who daily 
wakens the heroes in the Scandinavian Asgard. <I>(See </I>Alectromancy.)</P><B>

<P>Cock Lane Ghost :</B> The supposed cause of a mysterious out-break of 
rappings, apparitions, and similar manifestations which broke out at a house in 
Cock Lane, Smithfield, London, in <B>1762</B>.<B> </B>The disturbance was of the 
usual character of poltergeist hauntings, but for some reason or other it 
attracted wide-spread attention in London. Crowds flocked to the haunted spot, 
and claimed to have witnessed the manifestations. The ghost purported to be the 
spirit of a former resident in the Cock Lane house, a Mrs. Kent, and stated that 
she had been murdered by her husband. The tenant of the house at the time of the 
disturbance was a man named Parsons, and it was more than surmised that he had 
invented the ghost for the purpose of blackmailing the deceased's woman's 
husband. The disturbance was finally traced to Parson's daughter, a girl of 
eleven, and Parsons himself was prosecuted and pilloried. <I>(See </I>Andrew

<P>Coleridge, Samuel Taylor :</B> English author and mystic <B>(1772-1834</B>). 
<I>Samuel Taylor Coleridge, </I>one of the greatest of English poets and 
critics, was born in the year <B>1772 </B>at Ottery St. Mary, Devonshire, his 
father being John Cole-ridge, a clergyman and schoolmaster, who enjoyed 
considerable reputation as a theological scholar, and was author of a Latin 
grammar. Samuel's childhood was mostly spent at the native village, and from the 
first his parents observed that his was no ordinary temperament, for he showed a 
marked aversion to games. he even eschewed the company of other children, and 
instead gave his time chiefly to promiscuous reading. At six years of age,&quot; 
he writes in one of his letters to his friend, Thomas Poole, I remember to have 
read <I>Belisarius, Robinson Crusoe, </I>and <I>Philip Quarll, </I>and then I 
found the <I>Arabian Nights Entertainments,&quot; </I>while in this same letter 
he tells how the boys around him despised him for his eccentricity, the result 
being that he soon became a confirmed dreamer, finding in the kingdom of his 
mind a welcome haven of refuge from the scorn thus levelled at him.</P>
<P>By the time be was nine years old, <I>Coleridge </I>had shown a marked 
predilection for mysticism, in consequence where of his father decided to make 
him a clergyman; and in <B>1782 </B>the boy left home to go to Christ's 
Hospital, London, Here he found among his fellow pupils at least one who shared 
his literary tastes, Charles Lamb, and a warm friendship quickly sprang up 
between the two; while a little later <I>Coleridge </I>conceived an affection 
for a young girl called Mary Evans, but the progress of the love affair was soon 
arrested, the poet leaving London In <B>1790</B> to go to Cambridge. Beginning 
his university career as a sizar at Jesus College, he soon became known as a 
brilliant conversationalist, yet he made enemies by his extreme views on 
politics and religion, and in <B>1793, </B>finding himself in various 
difficulties, he went back to London where he enlisted in the <B>15</B>th 
Dragoons. Bought out soon afterwards by his relations, he returned to Cambridge, 
and in <B>1794</B>, he published his drama, <I>The Fall of Robespierre, 
</I>while in the following year he was married to Sarah Fricker, and in <B>1796 
</B>he issued a volume of <I>Poems. </I>He now began to preach occasionally in 
Unitarian chapels, while in <B>1797</B> he met Wordsworth, with whom he speedily 
became intimate, and whom he joined in publishing <I>Lyrical Ballads, </I>this 
containing some of <I>Coleridge's </I>finest things, notably <I>The Ancient 
Mariner. </I>Nor was this the only masterpiece he wrote at this time, for 
scarcely was it finished, ere he composed two other poems of like worth, 
<I>Christabel </I>and <I>Kubla Khan; </I>while in <B>1798</B> he was appointed 
Unitarian minister at Shrewsbury, and after holding this post for a little 
while, he went to travel in Germany, the requisite funds having been given him 
by Josiah and Thomas Wedgwood, both of whom were keen admirers of <I>Coleridge's 
</I>philosophical powers, and were of opinion that study on the continent would 
be of material service to him.</P>
<P>Among <I>Coleridge's </I>first acts on returning from Germany was to publish 
his translation of Schiller's <I>Wallenstein, </I>while simultaneously he took a 
cottage at Keswick, intending to live there quietly for many years. But peace 
and quiet are benefits usually sought in vain by poets, and <I>Coleridge </I>was 
no exception herein, for early in life he had begun to take occasional doses of 
laudanum, and now this practice developed into a habit which ruled his whole 
life. In <B>1804 </B>he sought relief by going to Malta, while afterwards' he 
visited Rome, and though, on returning to England, he was cheered by finding 
that a small annuity had been left him by the Wedgwoods, he was quite incapable 
of shaking off this deadly drug habit. As yet, however, it had not begun to 
vitiate his gifts altogether; and, after staying for awhile with Wordsworth at 
Grasmere, he delivered a series of lectures on poetry at Bristol and 
subsequently in London. Especially in the Metropolis his genius was quickly 
recognised. and he was made a pensioner of the Society of Literature, this 
enabling him to take a small house at Highgate, and there he mainly spent his 
declining years, while it was in Highgate Cemetery that his remains were 
interred after his death in <B>1834</B>.</P>
<P>Everything from <I>Coleridge's </I>hand is penetrated by a wealth of thought. 
Apart from his purely metaphysical works, of which the most notable are <I>Aids 
to Reflection </I>and <I>Confessions of an Enquiring Spirit, </I>his 
<I>Biographia Literaria </I>and other fine contributions to critical literature 
are all of a mystical temper; for Coleridge -more,. perhaps, than any other 
critics, not even excepting Goethe and Walter Pater-is never content with 
handling the surface of things, but always reflects a striving to understand and 
lay bare the mysterious point where artistic creation begins. For him, 
literature is a form of life, one of the most mysterious forms of life, and 
while he is supremely quick at noticing purely aesthetic merit, and equally 
quick at marking defect, it is really the philosophical element in his criticism 
which gives it its transcendant value and interest.</P><I>
<P>Coleridge's </I>metaphysical predilections are not more salient in his prose 
than in his verse, In a singularly beautiful poem, <I>To the Evening Star, 
</I>he tells that he gazes thereon,</P>
<P>&quot;Till I, myself, all spirit seem to grow.&quot;</P>
<P>And in most of his poems, indeed, he is &quot;all spirit,&quot; while often 
he hypnotises the reader into feeling something of the author&quot;' 
spirituality. Here and there, no doubt, he attempt to express in words things 
too deep and mysterious to be resolved into that sadly limited mode of 
utterance, the result being a baffling and even exasperating obscurity; but 
waiving altogether <I>Coleridge's </I>metaphysical poems, may it not be said 
justly that he introduced the occult into verse with a mastery wholly 
unsurpassed in English literature? May it not be said that <I>The Ancient 
Mariner, </I>and more especially <I>Christabel, </I>are the most beautiful of 
all poems in which the supernatural plays an important part?</P>

mother, and Keelta meets with St. Patrick and his monks at Drumdreg. Keelta

<P>Community of Sensation :</B> The term. applied by the early mesmerists to a 
phenomenon of the hypnotic' trance, wherein the somnambule seemed to <I>share 
the sensations </I>of the operator. Thus an hypnotic subject, insensible to pain 
and utterly indifferent to any stimulus applied to his own organism, would 
immediately respond to such stimuli applied to the hypnotist. If the latter had 
his nose tweaked or his hair pulled, the entranced subject, though in a separate 
apartment, would rub the corresponding part of his own person. with every sign 
of pain and indignation. The most common sensations shared in this wise were 
those of tasting and smelling. but apparent community of sight and even hearing 
were not unknown. In the. days of Reichenbach such experiences were largely 
attributed to fraud, but they have since been proved to be genuine trance 
phenomena, probably arising from unconscious suggestion and hyperaesthesia, or, 
in the few cases where that hypothesis will not cover the ground, telepathic 
communication between operator and subject. <I>Community of Sensation </I>is 
not, however. confined to the trance -condition. Many instances of <I>community 
of sensation </I>arising spontaneously in the cases of persons in <I>rapport 
</I>with one another are to be found in the <I>Journal </I>and <I>Proceedings 
</I>of the Society for Psychical Research.</P><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Compacts with the Devil :</B> An anonymous writer has handed down to us the 
agreement entered into between Louis Gaufridi and the devil:-</P>
<P>&quot;I, Louis, a priest, renounce each and every one of the spiritual and 
corporal gifts which may accrue to me from God, from the Virgin, and from all 
the saints, and especially from my patron John the Baptist, and the apostles 
Peter and Paul and St. Francis. And to you, Lucifer, now before me, I give 
myself and all the good I may accomplish, except the returns from the sacrament 
in the cases where I may administer it; all of which I sign and 
attest.&quot;</P>
<P>On his side Lucifer made the following agreement with Louis Gaufridi:</P>
<P>&quot;I, Lucifer, bind myself to give you, Louis Gaufridi, priest, 'the 
faculty and power of bewitching by blowing with the mouth, all and any of the 
women and -girls you may desire; in proof of which I sign myself 
Lucifer.&quot;</P>
<P>Bodin gives the following: &quot;Magdalen of the Cross, native of Cordova in 
Spain and abbess of a convent, finding that she was suspected by the nuns and 
fearing that she would be burnt if charged, desired to anticipate them, and 
obtain the pardon of the pope' by confessing that from the age of twelve years, 
a bad spirit in the form of a black Moor had desired her chastity, and that she 
had given in, and this had gone on for thirty years or more, she usually 
sleeping with him. Through his means while in the church, she was raised up. and 
when the nuns took the Sacrament after the consecration, the host came even to 
her in the. air, in the sight of the other nuns who regarded it as sacred and 
the priest also, who used-to complain at that time of a host.&quot;</P>
<P>According to Don Calmet there is to be seen at Molsheim in the chapel of St. 
Ignatius in the church of the Jesuit fathers a well-known inscription giving the 
history of a young German nobleman named Michel Louis, of the family of 
Boubenhoren, who was sent when quite young to the court. of the Duke of Lorraine 
to learn French and there lost all his money at cards. Reduced to despair he 
decided. to give himself up to the devil if that spirit of evil could or would 
give him good money. for he was afraid that he would be able to supply him only 
with counterfeit. While thinking this over a young man his own age, well-built 
and well-clothed, suddenly appeared before him and asking him the cause of his 
distress, put out his hand full of money and invited him to prove its worth, 
telling him to look him up again. on the morrow. Michel- returned' to his 
companions who were still playing, won back all he had lost and all that of his 
companions. Then he called on his devil who asked in return three drops of. 
blood which he collected in an acorn shell, and offering a pen to Michel told 
him to write to his dictation. This consisted of unknown words, which were taken 
down</P>
<P>Compacts <I>on </I>two different notes, one of which the devil retained, and 
the other was put into the arm of Michel in the same places from which the blood 
had been taken. The devil then said: &quot; I undertake to serve you for seven 
years, after which you belong to me without reserve.&quot; The young man agreed, 
though with some dread, and the devil did not fail to appear to him, day and 
night in various forms, inspiring him to things varied, unknown and curious and 
always with a tendency of evil. The fatal period of seven years was drawing to a 
end, and the young man was then about twenty years of age. He went home to his 
father, where the devil to whom he had given himself inspired him to poison his 
father and mother, burn the castle and kill himself. He tried to carry out all 
these crimes, but God prevented their success -the gun with which he would have' 
killed himself missed fire twice, and the poison failed to act on his parents. 
Getting more and more uneasy he confided the unhappy condition he was in to some 
of his father's servants and begged them to. get help. At the same time the 
devil seized him, twisting his body around and stopping very short of breaking 
his bones. His mother, who followed the teachings of Svenfeld and had enlisted 
her son in them, .finding no help in her cult against the demon who possessed or 
obsessed him, was forced to put him in the care of some monks. But he soon left 
them and escaped to Islade whence lie was sent back to Molsheim by his brother, 
canon of Wissbourg, who put him again into the hands of the Fathers of the 
Society. It was then that the demon made the most violent efforts against him, 
appearing to him in the form of wild animals. One day among others the demon, in 
the form of a man, wild and covered with hair, threw on the ground a note or 
contract different from the true one which he had got from the young man, so as 
to try by this. false show to get him out of' the hands of those who were 
looking after him and to prevent his making a full confession. Finally the 
<B>20</B>th October, <B>1603</B>,. was set aside for proof in the Chapel of St. 
Ignatius, and for the reproduction of the true contract containing the deal made 
with' the demon. The young man made profession of the orthodox catholic faith, 
renounced the demon and received the holy Eucharist Then with terrible cries he 
said that he saw two goats of immense size standing with their fore feet in the 
air and each holding between its hoofs one of the contracts or compacts. But 
when the exorcism was begun and the name of St. Ignace was invoked the two goats 
disappeared and there issued from the arm or left hand of the young man 
practically without pain and leaving no scar, the contract, which fell at the 
feet of the exorcist. There still remained. the contract which had been retained 
by the demon. The exorcisms were begun again, St. Ignatius was invoked and a 
mass was promised in his honour, when a stork appeared, large, deformed and 
ill-shapen, and dropped from its beak the second contract, which was found on 
the altar.&quot;</P>
<P>There is frequent mention among the ancients of certain demons who show 
themselves, especially towards midday, to those with whom they are on familiar 
terms. They visit such persons in the form of men or animals or allow themselves 
to be enclosed in a letter, account or' phial or even in a ring, wide and hollow 
within. &quot;Magicians are known,&quot; adds Leloyer, &quot;who make use of 
them, and to my great regret I am forced to admit that the practice is only too 
common.&quot;</P>
<P>Housdorf in his' <I>Theatre des examples du </I>se <I>commandement,&quot; 
</I>quoted by Goulart, says: &quot;A doctor of medicine forgot himself so far as 
to form an alliance with the enemy of our salvation whom he called up and 
enclosed in a glass from which the seducer and familiar spirit answered him. The 
doctor was fortunate in the cure of ailments, and amassed great wealth in his 
practice, so much so that he left his children' the sum of <B>78</B>,<B>000</B> 
francs. Shortly before, his death, when his conscience began to prick him, he 
fell into such a frenzy that lie never spoke but to invoke the devil or 
blaspheme the Holy Ghost and it was in this unfortunate condition that he passed 
away.&quot;</P>
<P>Goulart repeats, from Alexander of Alexandria, the story of a prisoner who 
had, invoked the- help of the devil and had visited the lower regions:-</P>
<P>&quot;The overlord of a small town in the principality of Sulmona and Kingdom 
of Naples, proved very miserly and arrogant in his rule, so much so that his 
subjects were too poor to live beside his harsh 'treatment of them. One of them, 
honest, but poor and despised, gave a sound beating for some reason to a hunting 
dog of this overlord, and the death of the. dog angered the latter so much that 
he had the poor man seized and shut .up in a dungeon. After some days the 
warders, who kept the gates carefully locked went to open them as usual to give 
him a crust of bread, but he was not to be found in his cell. Having looked for 
him. everywhere, again and again, and finding no trace of him nor his method of 
escape, they at last reported this wonderful affair to their master, who first 
ridiculed, and then threatened them, ' but realising at length the truth of it, 
he was no less astonished than they. Three days after this alarming incident, 
and with all the doors of the prison and dungeon closed as before, this same 
prisoner, unbeknown to anyone, was found shut up in his own dungeon. He was much 
distracted, and asked to be taken without delay before the overlord as he had a 
matter of much importance to communicate. When taken there he .said that he had 
come back from the lower regions. His case was that, not being able to stand any 
longer the rigors of prison life, overcome with despair, fearing death and 
lacking any good advice, he had invoked the help of the devil that he might 
release him from his confinement. That soon after, the Evil One, in a terribly 
hideous form, had appeared in his dungeon where they made a bargain, after which 
he was dragged out, not without severe injury, and projected into subterranean 
passages, wonderfully hollowed out, like the bottom of the earth; there he had 
seen the dungeons of the wicked, their tortures and their miseries, dark and 
terrible. Kings,. princes and high lords were plunged into abysses of darkness 
where, with indescribable torture, they were seared with a raging fire. That he 
had seen popes, cardinals and other prelates, beautifully dressed, and other 
kinds of persons in varying garb, suffering' other anguish in gulfs of great 
depth, where the torture was incessant.. Proceeding, he said he had recognised 
some acquaintances and especially a former great friend of his who, recognising 
him in return, enquired as to his condition. The prisoner told him that their 
land was in the hands of a- cruel master, whereupon the other charged him to 
command this cruel master, on returning, to renounce his tyrannical ways, 
otherwise his place would be one of the neighbouring seats, which was shown to 
the prisoner. And (continued this shade) in order that the said overlord may 
have faith in your report recall to him the. secret counsel and talks we had 
together when engaged in a certain war, the chiefs in which he named, and then 
he gave in detail the secret, their agreement, the words and promises given on 
each side. The prisoner gave them all distinctly one by one in their order, and 
the lord was much astonished at the message,' wondering how things committed to 
himself and not revealed by him to anybody, could be so easily and so boldly 
unfolded to him by a poor subject of his who told them as if he had read them in 
a book. Further, the prisoner enquired of his friend in the lower regions, 
whether it could be true that all the .magnificently dressed persons that he saw 
were conscious of their torments. The other answered that they were seared with 
an eternal fire, overwhelmed with torture and indescribable anguish, and that 
all this scarlet and golden raiment was nought but the colouring of the glowing 
fire. Wishing to test this he drew near to touch this scarlet effect and the 
other begged him to go, but the fierceness of the fire had scorched the whole of 
the palm of his hand, which he showed all roasted and cooked as in the embers of 
a great fire. The poor prisoner being released, to those who met him on his way 
home he appeared stupid. He neither saw nor heard anything, was always deep in 
thought, spoke little and replied very shortly to the questions put to him. His 
face, too, had become so hideous, his appearance so will and ill-favoured that 
his wife and children had difficulty in recognising him again, and when they did 
it was only to weep and cry at this change in him. He lived but a few days after 
his return and so great was his distraction that he had great difficulty in 
looking after his affairs.&quot;</P>
<P>Crespet describes the mark with which Satan brands his own:- </P>
<P>&quot;It may be assumed that it is no fallacy but very evident that Satan's 
mark on sorcerers is like leprosy, for the spot is insensitive to all punctures, 
and it is in the possession of such marks that one recognises them as true 
sorcerers for they feel the puncture no more than if they were leprous, nor does 
any blood appear, and never indeed, does any,, pain that may be inflicted cause 
them to move the part.</P>
<P>&quot;They receive, with this badge, the power of injuring and of pleasing', 
and, secretly or openly. their children are made to participate in the oath and 
connection which the fathers have taken with the devil. Even the mothers with 
this in view, dedicate and consecrate their children to the demons, not only as 
soon as born but even when conceived, and so it happens that, through the 
ministrations of these demons, sorcerers have been seen with two pupils in each 
eye, while others had the picture of a horse in one eye and two pupils in the 
other, and such serve as marks and badges of contracts made with them, for these 
demons can engrave and render in effigy such or similar lines and features on 
the bodies of the very young embryo.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;These marks,&quot; says Jacques Fontaine, &quot;are not engraved on the 
bodies of sorcerers by the demons for recognition purposes only, as the captains 
of companies of light-horse know those of their number by the colour of their 
coats, but to imitate the creator of all things, to show his power and the 
authority he has gained over those miserable beings who have allowed themselves 
to be caught by his cunning and trickery, and by the recognition of these marks 
of their master to keep them in his power. Further, to prevent them, as far as 
possible, from withdrawing from their promises and oaths of fidelity, because 
though breaking faith with him the marks still remain with them and serve, in an 
accusation, as a means of betraying them, with even the smallest amount of 
evidence that may be brought forward.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Louis Gaufridy, a prisoner, who had just been condemned to be burnt as 
marked in more than thirty places over the body and on the loins especially 
there was a mark of lust so large and deep, considering the site, that a needle 
could be inserted for the width of three fingers across it without any feeling 
being shown by the puncture.&quot;</P>
<P>The same author shows that the marks on sorcerers are areas which have 
mortified' from the touch of the devil's finger.</P>
<P>&quot;About <B>1591</B>, Leonarde Chastenet, an old woman of eighty, was 
taken up as a sorceress while begging in Poitou. Brought before Mathurin 
Bonnevault, who deponed to having seen her at the meeting of witches, she 
confessed that she had been there with her husband, and that the devil, a very 
disgusting beast, was there in the form of a goat. She denied that she would 
have carried out any witchcraft, but nineteen witnesses testified to her having 
caused the death of five labourers and a number of animals.</P>
<P>&quot;Finding her crimes discovered and herself condemned she confessed that 
she had made a compact with the devil, given him some of her hair, and promised 
to do all the harm she could. She added that at night in prison the devil had 
appeared to her, in the form of a cat, to which she expressed the wish to die, 
whereupon this devil presented her with two pieces of wax telling her to eat 
them and she would die, but she had been unwilling to do it. She had the pieces 
of wax with her, but on examination their composition could not be made out. She 
was then condemned and the pieces of wax burnt with her.&quot;</P>

<P>Compass Brothers : </B>Between the years <B>1400 </B>arid <B>1790</B>, there 
existed at Lubeck a guild of this name, which met twice a year. Their badge was 
a compass and sector suspended from a crowned letter &quot;C,&quot; over which 
was a radiated triangular plate. In <B>1485</B> they adopted chains composed of 
these emblems united by eagles' tails. They appear to have been a magical or 
Kabbalistic society.</P><B>

<P>Conan Mae Morna : </B>A figure in the Ossianic cycle of Irish legend, 
described as scoffing and deriding all that was high and noble. One day while 
hunting, he and others of the Fians, entered a magnificent palace which they 
found empty and began to feast. It soon became apparent, however, that the 
palace was enchanted, and the walls 'shrank to the size of a fox's hole. 
<I>Conan </I>seemed to be unaware of the danger and continued to eat; but two of 
the Fians pulled him off his chair, to which some of his skin stuck. To soothe 
the pain a black sheep-skin was placed on his back, on to which it grew, and he 
wore it till he died.</P><B>

<P>Conary Mor :</B> A legendary High King of Ireland. It is said that his 
great-grandfather destroyed the Fairy Mound of Bri-Leith, and thus brought down 
ill-fate upon <I>Conary Mor. </I>When a child he left his three foster-brothers 
on the Plains of Liffey, and followed a flock of beautiful birds down to the 
shore. These were transformed into armed men, who told him that they belonged to 
his father and were his kin. His <I>geise </I>(or taboo) was made known to him. 
and later he was proclaimed King of Erin. His reign was good, happy and 
prosperous, until the Danaan folk lured 'aim to the breaking of his <I>geise. 
</I>It is told how <I>Conary, </I>dying of thirst after battle, sent his warrior 
Mac Cecht to bring him water. Mac Cecht had much difficulty in obtaining this, 
and on his return found that <I>Conary </I>had been beheaded : the water, 
however, was raised to the mouth of the bodyless head-which, it is said, thanked

<P>Conte Del Graal :</B> One of the &quot; Quest &quot; versions of the legend 
of the Holy Grail (q,v.) compiled by various authors. It tells how Perceval was 
reared to the life of a forester by his mother; but forsaking her he becomes a 
member of the Court of King Arthur. Thence he goes forth as a knight - errant, 
and his numerous adventures are recited. During these, he meets with certain 
mysteries, but returns to the court. The adventures of Gauvain, another of the 
knights are fully detailed. Perceval, himself, sets forth again, and wanders 
about for five years in a very godless state of mind. One Good Friday he meets 
with a band of pilgrims, who remonstrate with him for riding armed on a holy day 
; and he turns aside to confess to a hermit who turns out to be his uncle. From 
him he learns that only the sinless can find the Grail, and that he has sinned 
in abandoning his mother, and thus causing her death. In a continuation of the 
legend by a different author, Perceval appears to continue his search, but 
apparently unsuccessfully; and finally, by yet another compiler we are told that 
Perceval after many adventures marries Blanchfleure. The nature and origin of 
the Grail are described in these continuations of the legend.</P><B>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Convulsionaries of St. Medard :</B> During the first half of the eighteenth 
century there occurred in the cemetery of St. Medard, Paris, an extraordinary 
outbreak of convulsions and religious extasy, whose victims were the Jansenists, 
at that time suffering much persecution at the hands of the government and the 
church. The outbreak commenced with a few isolated cases of miraculous healing. 
One, Mlle. Morsaron, a paralytic, having for her confessor an enthusiastic 
Jansenist, was recommended by him to seek the tomb of St. Francis de Paris, in 
the cemetery of St. Medard. When she had repaired thither a few times she 
recovered her health. The news spread abroad, and other cures followed. Violent 
convulsions became a feature of the crisis which preceded these cures. At length 
the healing by Deacon Paris of a more than usually obstinate case, by a crisis 
of more than ordinary severity, was the signal for a violent outburst of 
epidemic frenzy. People of both sexes and all ages repaired to the tomb of the 
holy deacon, where the most appalling scenes were witnessed. People from the 
provinces helped to swell the ranks, till there was not a vacant foot of ground 
in the neighbourhood of St. Medard. At length, on January <B>27</B>th, 
<B>1732</B>,<B> </B>the cemetery was closed by order of the king. On its closed 
gate a wit inscribed the lines</P>
<P>De par le roi defense </P>
<P>Dieu De faire miracle en ce lieu.</P>
<P>However the king's ordinance did not put an end to the epidemic, which spread 
from Paris to many other towns. Ten years after its commencement-in 
<B>1741</B>-it seemed to have died away, but in <B>1759 </B>it burst out in 
Paris with renewed vigour, accompanied by scenes still more awful. In the 
following year it disappeared once more, though isolated examples persisted so 
late as <B>1787</B>.</P><B>

<P>Cook, Florence :</B> An English medium, the first to present the phenomenon 
of materialisation in its complete form. In the production of the crowning 
physical manifestation, she was associated at the Outset of her mediumistic 
career at the beginning of the decade <B>1870</B>-<B>80</B> - with the medium 
Herne, but ere long dispensed with his assistance. So that she might not be 
under the necessity of taking fees for her services, a wealthy Manchester 
spiritualist, Mr. Charles Blackburn, paid her a sum of money annually. She was 
thus practically a private medium, and for the most part, her seances were held 
in her own home. Her principal control was the now famous spirit Katie King. 
Mr.-now Sir William - Crookes, who investigated the phenomena produced in Miss 
Cook's presence, declared his conviction that Katie and the medium were two 
separate entities, and was satisfied of the supernormal nature of the former. 
Not all the sitters, however, were equally convinced. Many persons traced a 
resemblance in form and feature between medium and control, and it has been 
suggested that the apparent differences were achieved by a change in the mode of 
hair-dressing, by tip-toeing, and other mechanical means.</P><B>

<P>Coscinomancy :</B> is practised with a sieve, and a pair of tongs or shears, 
which are supported upon the thumb nails of two persons, who look one upon the 
other, or the nails of the middle finger maybe used. Potter, in his <I>Greek 
Antiquities, </I>says : &quot; It was generally used to discover thieves, or 
others suspected of any crime, in this manner: they tied a thread to the sieve 
by which it was upheld, or else placed a pair of shears, which they held up by 
two fingers, then prayed to the gods to direct and assist them ; after that they 
repeated the names of the persons under suspicion, and he, at whose name the 
sieve whirled round or moved, was thought guilty.&quot; In the <I>Athenian 
Oracle </I>it is called &quot; the trick of the sieve and scissors, the 
coskiomancy of the ancients, as old as Theocritus,&quot; he having mentioned in 
his third idyll, a woman who was very skilful in it. Saunders, in his 
<I>Chiromancy, </I>and Agrippa, at the end of his works, gives certain mystic 
words to be pronounced before the sieve will turn. It was used to discover love 
secrets as well as unknown persons. According to Grose, a chapter in the Bible 
is to be read, and the appeal made to St. Peter or St. Paul.</P><B>

<P>Crollius, Oswald :</B> A disciple of the school of Paracelsus, and author of 
the <I>Book of Signatures -the </I>preface to which contains a good sketch of 
hermetic philosophy. The writer seeks to demonstrate that God and Nature have, 
so to speak, signed all their works, that every product of a given natural force 
is as the sum of that force, printed in indelible characters, so that he who is 
initiated in the occult writings can read as in an open book the sympathies and 
antipathies of things, the properties of substances, and all other secrets of 
creation. &quot; The characters of different writings,&quot; says Eliphas Levi, 
&quot; were borrowed primitively from these natural signatures existing in stars 
and flowers, in mountains and the smallest pebble; the figures of crystals. the 
marks on minerals, were impressions of the thought which the Creator had in 
their creation.</P>
<P>. . . .But we lack any grammar of this mysterious language of worlds, and a 
mathematical vocabulary of this primitive and absolute speech. King Solomon 
alone is credited with having accomplished the dual labour, but the books of 
Solomon are lost. The enterprise of <I>Crollius </I>was not the reconstitution 
of these, but an attempt to discover the fundamental principles obtaining in the 
universal language of the creative world. It was recognised in these principles 
that the original hieroglyphics, based on the prime elements of geometry, 
corresponded to the constitutive and essential laws of forms, determined by 
alternating or combined movements, which, in their turn, were determined by 
equilibratory attractions. Simples were distinguished from composites by their 
external figures; and by the correspondence between figures and numbers it 
became possible to make a mathematical classification of all substances revealed 
by the lines of their services. At the root of these endeavours, which are 
reminiscences of Edenic science, there is a whole world of discoveries awaiting 
the sciences. Paracelsus had defined them, <I>Crollius </I>indicates them, 
another, who shall follow, will realise and provide the demonstration concerning 
them. What seemed the folly of yesterday will be the genius of to-morrow, and 
progress will hail the sublime seekers who first looked into this lost and 
recovered world, this Atlantis of human knowledge.&quot;</P><B>

<P>Crosland, Mrs. Newton :</B> An early spiritualistic medium. Under the name of 
Camilla Toulmin, she published, in <B>1857</B>, <I>Light in the Valley, </I>a 
record of her experiences. There is a trend of Swedenborgian mysticism in her 
writings. <I>(See </I><B>Spiritualism.</B>)</P><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Cross-Correspondences :</B> Corespondences found in the script - of two or 
more automatic writers acting without collusion, and under such conditions that 
the possibility of communicating by normal means is removed. Since the beginning 
of the present century efforts have been made by members of the Society for 
Psychical Research to prove, by the production of script containing 
<I>cross-correspondence. </I>the existence of discarnate intelligences, - and 
their ability to operate through the physical organism of a medium. The first 
instances were of a spontaneous character, and occurred in 'the trance 
-utterances of Mrs. Thompson and those of another medium, Miss Rawson. 
Thereafter the idea was conceived of deliberately cultivating them, and several 
ladies-Mrs. Verrall, Mrs. Holland, and others-who had been successful in 
producing automatic script, sent it to the Society for Psychical Research, where 
the writings were found to show more numerous correspondences than mere 
coincidence would warrant, It --was arranged that experiments should be made 
under stricter-test conditions. Frequently the script of Mrs. Verral was of an 
allusive and enigmatical character, so that she herself was unable to interpret 
it until the key had been supplied by the writings of a second automatist. 
Sometimes three automatists succeeded in producing writings having a decided 
connection with each other, Two obscure -writings have been rendered 
intelligible by means of a third, perhaps in itself equally obscure. In at least 
one case correspondences occurred in the script of no less than six automatists, 
under somewhat curious circumstances. Mr. Piddington, a well known member of the 
Society for Psychical Research, had written a &quot;test&quot; letter, which he 
proposed should be opened after his death. The contents, which dealt 
emphatically with the 'number seven, he told to no one. On hearing, however, of 
the remarkable <I>cross-correspondences- all </I>dealing with the number 
seven-he opened his letter, four years after it was written, and supplied the 
clue. In <B>1906</B>, Mrs. Piper was brought to this country so that the 
correspondences might be studied to better advantage. The experiments were 
successful to a surprising degree, and seemed to place beyond a doubt the 
operation in all the writings of an intelligence other than the automatist's. 
Mr. Podmore, however, would refer the phenomena of <I>cross-correspondences, 
</I>at least in part, to the operation of a complex form of telepathy-a 
possible, but in view of the facts, not very probable, explanation.</P><B>

<P>Crystal :</B> <I>Crystal </I>prevails against unpleasant dreams, dissolves 
enchantments, and is a medium for magical visions. Being bruised with honey, it 
fills the breasts with milk. Leonardus appears to have indulged a little spite 
against this beautiful mineral. &quot; The principal use of <I>- crystal,&quot; 
</I>he says, &quot;is for making cups, rather than anything else that is 
good.&quot;</P><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Crystalomancy, or Crystal Gazing :</B> A mode of divination practised from 
very early times with the aid of a crystal globe, a pool of water, a mirror, or 
indeed any transparent object. Divinations by means' of-. water, ink, and such 
substances are also known by the name of hydromancy (q.v.). <I>Crystal gazing 
</I>may be a very simple or a very elaborate-performance, according to the 
period in which it was practised, but in every case the object is to induce in 
the clairvoyant a form of hypnosis, so that he may see visions in the crystal. 
The &quot;crystal&quot; most in favour among modern crystal gazers is a 
spherical or oval globe, about four inches in diameter, and preferably a genuine 
crystal; but as a crystal of - this size and shape is necessarily expensive, a 
sphere of glass is frequently substituted, and with very good results. It must, 
however, be a perfect sphere of oval, free from speck or flaw, highly polished, 
and contained in a stand of polished ebony, ivory, or boxwood. Among the Hindus, 
a cup of treacle or -a pool of ink is made to serve the same purpose. Precious 
stones' were much used by crystallomancers in the past, the favourite stone 
being the beryl in pale sea green or reddish tints. By the ancients 
<I>crystallomancy </I>was practised with a view to the invocation of spirits, 
and very elaborate preparations and ceremonials were considered necessary. He 
who would practise invocations in this wise must, in the first instance, be a 
man of pure life and religious disposition. For the few days immediately 
preceding the inspection of the crystal, he must make frequent ablutions, and 
subject himself to strict religious discipline, with prayer and fasting. The 
crystal, as well as the stand on which it rests, must be inscribed with sacred 
characters, - as must also the floor of the room in which the invocation is to 
take place. A quiet, retired spot is suggested -for the purpose, where the 
magician may be free from all disturbance. Besides these matters of solitude 
and- cleanliness, there is the question of the mental attitude to be considered, 
and this is no less important than the material preparations. A perfect faith is 
an essential condition of success. If the magician would be accompanied by one 
or two of his friends, they also must conform to the same rules and be guided by 
the same principles. The time of the invocation is chosen according to the 
position in the heavens of the various planets, all preparations having been 
made during the increase of the moon. All the instruments and accessories used 
in the performance the sword, rod and compasses, the fire and the perfume to be 
burned thereon, as well as the crystal itself-are consecrated or 
&quot;charged&quot; prior to the actual ceremony. </P>
<P>During the process of invocation, the magician faces the east and summons 
from the crystal the spirit he desires. Magic circles have previously been 
inscribed on the floor, and it is desirable <I>that </I>the crystallomancer 
remain within these for some little time after the spirit has been dismissed. It 
was essential that no part of the ceremonial be omitted, otherwise the 
invocation would be a failure. Paracelsus, however, and others declared that all 
such elaborate ceremonies were unnecessary, and that the <I>magnes microcosmi, 
</I>the magnetic principle in man, was in itself sufficient to achieve the 
desired object. At a later period, though the ceremonial was not abolished, it 
became decidedly less imposing. If the person on whose behalf the divination was 
to be performed was not himself gifted with the clairvoyant faculty, he sought, 
for a suitable medium, the best for the purpose being a young boy or girl, born 
in wedlock, and perfectly pure and innocent. Prayers and magical words were 
pronounced prior to the ceremony, and incense and perfumes were burned. 
Sometimes the child's forehead was anointed, and he himself provided with 
garments suitable to the impressive nature of the ceremony. Some writers mention 
a formula of prayers, known as the Call, which preceded the inspection of the 
crystal. Finally, the latter having been charged, it was handed over to the 
medium. The first indication of the clairvoyant vision was the appearance of a 
mist or cloud in the crystal. This gradually cleared away, and the vision made 
its appearance.</P>
<P>Modern <I>Crystal gazing </I>is carried on in much the same manner, though 
the preparations are simpler. 'The crystal is spherical and of the size of an 
orange; when in use it may be held between the agent's finger and thumb, or, if 
the end be slightly flattened, placed on a table; alternatively it may be held 
in the palm of the hand against a background of black cloth. The operation may 
be more readily carried out in a subdued light. A medium or clairvoyant person 
acts as the seer and if the divination be made for anyone else it is advisable 
that he be allowed to hold the crystal in his hand for a few minutes before it 
is passed into the hands of the clairvoyant. The object of crystal gazing is, as 
has been said, the induction of an hypnotic state giving rise to visionary 
hallucinations, the reflection of light in the crystal forming <I>points de 
repere </I>for such hallucinations. The value of elaborate ceremonials and 
impressive rituals thus lies in their potency to affect the mind and imagination 
of the seer. So far, the mystery of crystal vision is no mystery at all. But the 
remarkable frequency with which, according to reliable witnesses, visions seen 
in the crystal have tallied with events happening elsewhere at the same moment, 
or even with future events, is a fact for which science has not yet found an 
adequate explanation. It has been suggested that if telepathy operates with 
greater freedom during the hypnotic state, so it may be also with the 
self-induced hypnosis of crystal gazing. And this, though it cannot be said to 
cover the entire ground, is perhaps, on the whole, the best explanation yet 
offered. There are many well-attested cases wherein the crystal has been 
successfully used for the purpose of tracing criminals, or recovering lost or 
stolen property. The telepathic theory, however, will hardly apply to these 
instances wherein events have been witnessed in the crystal <I>before </I>their 
actual occurrence. Such mysteries as these must be left to the art of the 
psychical researcher to' unravel.</P><B>

<P>Crucifixion, Gnostic Conception of :</B> As soon as ,Christ was born 
according to the Gnostic speculative view of Christianity, Christos, united 
himself with Sophia (Holy Wisdom). descended through the seven planetary 
regions, assuming in each an analogous form to the region, and concealing his 
true nature from its genii, whilst he attracted into himself the spark of Divine 
Light they severally retained in their angelic essence. Thus Christos, having 
passed through the seven Angelic Regions before the &quot;Throne,&quot; entered 
into the man Jesus, at the moment of his baptism In the Jordan. From that time 
forth, being super' naturally gifted, Jesus began to work miracles. Before that, 
he had been completely ignorant of his mission. When on the cross, Christos and 
Sophia left his body, and returned to their own sphere. Upon his death, the two 
took the man &quot;Jesus,&quot; and abandoned his material body to the earth: 
for the Gnostics held that the true Jesus did not (and could not) physically 
suffer on the cross, and die, and that Simon of Cyrene, who bore his cross, did 
in reality suffer in his room And they compelled one, Simon a Cyrenian, who 
passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear 
his cross&quot; (St. Mark XV. <B>21</B>).<B> </B>The Gnostics contended that a, 
portion of the real history of the Crucifixion was never written. </P>
<P>At the resurrection Christos and Sophia gave the man Jesus another body, made 
up of ether (Rosicrucian Aetheroeum). Thence-forward he consisted of the two 
first Rosicrucian principles only, soul and spirit: which was the reason that 
the disciples did not recognise 'him after the resurrection. During his sojourn 
upon earth after he had risen, he received from Sophia, or Holy Wisdom, that 
perfect knowledge or illumination, that true &quot;Gnosis,&quot; which he 
communicated to the small number of the Apostles who were capable of receiving 
the same.</P><B>

<P>Cursed Bread :</B> Used for purposes of divination, or ordeal by flour or 
bread. A piece of bread, about an ounce in weight, over which a spell had been 
cast, was administered to the suspected person. Should it cause sickness or 
choking the man was said to be guilty, but if he remained well he was regarded 
as innocent. Barley bread was often used for this form of divination, being more
