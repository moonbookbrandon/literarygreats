<P>Fabre, Pierre Charles :</B> (French Alchemist - Fl. <B>1630</B>.<B>) 
</B>Hardly any biographical details concerning this French alchemist are 
forthcoming. Mr. Waite, in his <I>Lives of the Alchemystical Philosophers, 
</I>declares that <I>Fabre </I>was a native of Montpellier; but we do not find 
any evidence to support this statement, and it is possible that he has 
confounded <I>Fabre </I>the alchemist with a painter of the same name, who was 
born at Montpellier, and after whom the Musee Fabre at that town is called. 
Pierre Jean Fabre appears to have been a doctor of medicine, and to have been 
renowned in his own day as a scholar of chemistry, a subject on which he 
compiled several treatises ; while, though it is not recorded that he ever won 
any marked successes in the field of alchemy, he certainly wrote numerous things 
dealing wholly or partly with that topic. Of these the most important are 
<I>Alchimista Christianus </I>and <I>Hercules Pischymicus, </I>both published at 
Toulouse, the first in <B>1632, </B>the second two years afterwards; and in the 
latter he maintains that the mythological&quot; labours of Hercules &quot; are 
allegories, embodying the arcana of hermetic philosophy. The philosopher's 
stone, he declares complacently, may be found in all compounded circumstances, 
and is formed of salt, mercury and sulphur.</P>

<P>Fagail :</B> The parting gift,, of the fairies, of Gaelic origin. This may be 
of a pleasant or unpleasant nature-it may be death, or the conversion of a man 
who worked badly, was ugly, and of rude speech, into the best workman, the best 
looking man, and the best speaker in the place.-Camp-bell's <I>Superstitions of 
the Scottish Highlands.</I></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Fairies :</B> A species of supernatural beings, and one of the most beautiful 
and important of mythological conceptions. The belief in <I>fairies </I>is very 
ancient and widespread, and the same ideas concerning them are to be found among 
rude and uncultivated races as in the poesy of more civilised peoples. Of 
British <I>fairies </I>there are several distinct kinds, and these differ 
considerably in their characteristics. In Ireland, where the belief is 
strongest, the <I>fairies </I>are called good people,&quot; and are of a 
benevolent but capricious and mischievous disposition. The pixies of England are 
very similar. The industrious domestic spirit known as Puck, or Robin 
Goodfellow, is of the fairy kind ; so also are the brownies of Scotland. It is 
supposed that the hard work of the latter has given them the swarthiness from 
which they take their name, the other being called <I>fairies </I>from their 
fairness.</P>
<P>Scottish fairy mythology resembles that of Ireland, though of a more sombre 
cast. In Highland Scotland <I>fairies </I>are called <I>daoine sithe </I>or 
&quot; men of peace,&quot; and it is believed that every year the devil carries 
off a tenth part of them. They steal human children, and leave in their places 
fairy changelings, fretful, wizened, unchildish things. Flint arrow-heads are 
believed, both in Ireland and Scot-land, to be fairy weapons, and the water in 
which they are dipped is a cure for many ills. Fairy music may often be heard in 
certain spots, and like the <I>fairies </I>themselves it is of exquisite beauty. 
As in the myth of Persephone, mortals who eat or drink in fairyland are doomed 
to remain there for ever. If a fairy marry with a human being, there is 
generally some condition imposed on the latter which, being broken, leads to his 
undoing. Many fairy legends are found all over Europe, varying a little with the 
locality but identical in their essential points. The conception of <I>fairies 
</I>is probably animistic. <I>(See </I>Animism.)</P>

<P>Familiars :</B> Spirits attendant upon a magician, sorcerer, or witch. The 
idea probably arose out of that of fetishism (q.v.) especially as many 
<I>familiars </I>were supposed to reside in rings, lockets, or other trinkets 
worn by the wizard or sorcerer. From Delrio we learn that these spirits were 
called by the Greeks ' Paredrii,&quot; as being ever assiduously at hand; and by 
the Latins, beside &quot; Familiares,&quot; ' Martinelli,&quot; or 
&quot;Magistelli,&quot; for which names he does not assign any reason. The black 
dog of Cornelius Agrippa is among the best known <I>familiars </I>of modern 
times. His story rests on the authority of Paulus Jovius, (&quot; Elogia&quot; 
ci.) and it has been copied by Thevet, among others, in his <I>Hist. des Hommes 
plus Illustres et Scavans, </I>XVIII. Jovius relates that Agrippa was always 
accompanied by the devil in the shape of a black dog, and that, perceiving the 
approach of death, he took a collar ornamented with nails, disposed in magical 
inscriptions from the neck of the animal, and dismissed him with these memorable 
words, &quot; Abi perdita Bestia quae me totum perdidisti.&quot; (Away, accursed 
beast, through whose agency I must now sink into perdition.) The dog thus 
addressed, it is said, ran hastily to the banks of the Saone, into which he 
plunged headlong, and was never afterwards seen. Le Loyer says :-&quot; With 
regard to the demons whom they imprisoned in rings and charms, the magicians of 
the school of Salamanca and Toledo, and their master Picatrix, together with 
those in Italy who made traffic of this kind of ware, knew better than to say 
whether or not they had appeared to those who had been in possession or bought 
them. And truly I cannot speak without horror of those who pretend to such 
vulgar familiarity with them, even to speaking of the nature of each particular 
demon shut up in a ring ; whether he be a Mercurial, Jovial, Saturnine, Martial, 
or Aphrodisiac spirit in what form he is wont to appear when required ; how many 
times in the night he awakes his possessor ; whether benign or cruel in 
disposition ; whether he can be transferred to another ; and if, once possessed, 
he can alter the natural temperament, so as to render men of Saturnine 
complexion Jovial, or the Jovials Saturnine, and so on. There is no end of the 
stories which might be collected under this head, to which if I gave faith, as 
some of the learned of our time have done, it would be filling my paper to 
little purpose. I will not speak therefore of the crystal ring mentioned by 
Joalium of Cambray, in which a young child could see all that they demanded of 
him, and which eventually was broken by the possessor, as the occasion by which 
the devil too much tormented him. Still less will I stay say pen to tell of the 
sorcerer of Courtray, whose ring had a demon enclosed in it, to whom it behoved 
him to speak every five days. In fine, the briefest allusion must suffice to 
what they relate of a gentleman of Poiton, who had playfully taken from the 
bosom of a young lady a certain charm in which a devil was shut up. Having 
thrown it into the fire,&quot; the story goes.,&quot; he was incessantly 
tormented with visions of the devil till the latter granted him another charm, 
similar to the one he had destroyed, for the purpose of returning to the lady 
and renewing her interest in him.&quot; Heywood writes, if not much more fully 
on the subject than Le Loyer does, and evidently attaches a far greater degree 
of credibility to the narratives which he brings forward. &quot;Grillandus is of 
opinion, that everie Magition and Witch, after they have done their homage to 
the devell, have a familiar spirit given to attend them, whom they call ' 
Magistellus,' ' Magister,' ' Martinettus or Martinellus' &quot; and these are 
sometimes visible to men in the shape of a dog, a rat, an aethiope, etc. So it 
is reported of one Magdalena Crucia, that she had one of these paredni to attend 
her like a blackemore. Glycas tells us, that Simon Magus had a great black dog 
tyed in a chaine, who, if any man came to speak with him whom he had no desire 
to see was ready to devoure him. His shadow likewise he caused still to go 
before him ; making the people beleeve that it was the soule of a dead man who 
still at-tended him.</P>
<P>These kindes of familiar spirits are such as they include or keepe in rings 
hallowed, in viols, boxes, and caskets not that spirits, having no bodies, can 
be imprisoned there against their wills, but that they seem to be confined of 
their own free-will and voluntarie action.</P>
<P>&quot;Johannes Leo writeth, that such are frequent in Africke, shut in caves, 
and bear the figure of birds called Aves Hanolatrices, by which the Magitions 
raise great summes of money, by predicting by them of things future. For being 
demanded of anv difficulty, they bring an answer written in a small scroll of 
paper, and deliver it to the magition in their bills. Martinus Anthonius 
Deirius, of the Society of Jesus, a ma of profound learning and judgment, 
writeth, that in Burdegell there was an advocate who in a viol kept one of these 
Paradrii inclosed. Hee dying, his heires knowmg thereof, were neither willing to 
keepe it, nor durst they break it and demanding counsell, they were persuaded to 
go to thc Jesuit's Colledge, and to be directed by them. The fathers commanded 
it to be brought before them and broken; but the executors humbly besought them 
that it might not be done in their presence, being fearfull least some great 
disaster might succeed thereof. At which they smiling, flung it against the 
wall, at the breaking thereof there was nothing seen or heard, save a small 
noise, as if the two elements of water and fire had nearly met together, and as 
soone parted.</P>
<P>Philostratus tells us, that Apollonius Tyaneus was never without such rings ; 
and Alexander Neapolitanius affirmeth, that he received them of Jarcha, the 
great prince of the Gymnosophists, which he took of him as a rich present, for 
by them he could be acquainted with any deep secret whatsoever. Such a ring had 
Johannes Jodocus Rosa, a citizen of Cortacensia, who every fifth day had 
conference with the spirit enclosed using it as a counsellor and director in all 
his affairs and interprises whatsoever. By it he was not only acquainted with 
all newes as well forrein as domesticke, but learned the cure and remedy for all 
griefs and diseases ; insomuch that he had the reputation of a learned and 
excellent physition. At length, being accused of sortilege or enchantment, at 
Ambam, in Guelderland, he was proscribed, and in the year <B>1548</B> the 
chancellor caused his ring, in the public market, to be layd upon an anvil, and 
with an iron hammer beaten to pieces.</P>
<P>&quot;Mengius reporteth from the relation of a deare friend of his (a man of 
approved fame and honestie) this historie. In a certain town under the 
jurisdiction of the Venetians, one of their praestigious artists (whom some call 
Pythonickes), having one of these rings, in which he had two familiar spirits 
exorcised and bound, came to a predicant or preaching friar, a man of sincere 
life and conversation; and confessed unto him that bee was possessed of such an 
enchanted ring, with such spirits charmed, with whom he had conference at his 
pleasure. But since he considered with himselfe, that it was a thing dangerous 
to his soule, and abhominable both to God and man, he desired to be cleanly 
acquit of it, and to that purpose he came to receive of him some godly counsell. 
But by no persuasion would the religious man be induced to have any speech at 
all with these evil spirits (to which motion the other had before earnestly 
solicited him), but admonished him to cause the magicke ring to be broken, and 
th<B>4</B>t to be done with all speed possible. At which words the <I>familiars 
</I>were heard (as it were) to mourne and lament in the ring, and to desire that 
no such violence might be offered unto them; but rather than so, that it would 
please him to accept the ring, and keepe it, promising to do him all service and 
vassallage of which, if he pleased to accept, they would in a short time make 
him to be the most famous and admired predicant in all Italy. But he perceiving 
the devils cunning, under this colour of courtesie, made absolute refusall of 
their offer and withall conjured them to know the reason why they would so 
willingly submit themselves to his patronage ? After many evasive lies and 
deceptious answers, they plainly confessed unto him, that they had of purpose 
persuaded the magition to heare him preach ; that by that sermon, his conscience 
being pricked and galled, he might be weary of the ring, and being refused of 
the one, be accepted of the other ; by which they hoped in short time so to have 
puft him up with pride and heresie, to have percipitated his soule into certaine 
and never ending destruction. At which the churchman being zealously inraged, 
with a great hammer broke the ring almost to dust, and in the name of God sent 
them thence to their own habitation of darkness, or whither it pleased the 
highest powers to dispose them.</P>
<P>Of this kinde doubtlesse was the ring of Ggyes (of whom Herodotus doth make 
mention), by vertue of which he had power to walke invisible; who, by the murder 
of his sovereign Candaules, married his queene, and so became King of Lydia. 
Such, likewise, had the Phocensian tyrant, who, as Clemens Stromaeus speaketh, 
by a sound which came of itselfe, was warned of all times, seasonable and 
unseasonable, in which to manage his affairs; who, notwithstanding, could not be 
forewarned of his pretended death, but his <I>familiar </I>left him in the end, 
suffering him to be slain, by the conspirators. Such a ring, likewise, had one 
Hieronimus, Chancellor of Mediolanum, which afterwards proved to be his untimely 
ruine.&quot; <I>(Hierarchie of the Blessed Angels, vii.; The Principats, p. 
<B>475</B> etc.)</I></P>
<P>Sometimes the <I>familiar </I>annexed himself voluntarily to a master, 
without any exercise of magic skill or invocation on his part, nor could such a 
spirit be disposed of without exorcism, as we learn from the following story 
cited by Delrio (vi., c. ii., s. <B>3</B>., q. <B>3</B>.) :- &quot; A certain 
man (pater familias-head of a family), lived at Trapani, in Sicily, in whose 
house it is said, in the year <B>1585</B>, mysterious voices had been heard for 
a period of some months. <I>This familiar </I>was a daemon, who, in various 
ways, endeavoured to annoy man. He had cast huge stones, though as yet he had 
broken ho mortal head ; and he had even thrown the domestic vessels about, but 
without fracturing any of them. When a young man in the house played and sung, 
the demon, hearing all, accompanied the sound of the lute with lascivious songs, 
and this distinctly. He vaunted himself to be a daemon; and when the master of 
the house, together with his wife, went away on business to a certain town, the 
daemon volunteered his company. When he returned, however, soaked through with 
rain, the spirit went forward in advance, crying aloud as he came, and warning 
the servants to make up a good fire,&quot; etc. In spite of these essential 
services, the paterfamilias called in the aid of a priest and expelled the 
<I>familiar, </I>though not without some difficulty.</P>
<P>A learned German physician has given an instance in which the devil of his 
own accord enclosed himself in a ring as a <I>familiar, </I>thereby proving how 
dangerous it is to trifle with him.</P>
<P>Paracelsus was believed to carry about with him a <I>familiar </I>in the hilt 
of his sword. Naude assures us, that he never laid this weapon aside even when 
he went to bed, that he often got up in the night and struck it violently 
against the floor, and that frequently when overnight he was without a penny, he 
would show a purseful of gold in the morning. <I>(Apologie pour les Grands 
Hommes soupcoonez de Magie, </I>xiv., p. <B>281</B>.) After this, we are not a 
little disconcerted with the ignoble explanation which he gives of this reputed 
demon, namely, that although the alchemists maintain that it was no other than 
the philosopher's stone, he (Naude) thinks it more rational to believe, if 
indeed there was anything at all in it, that it was two or three doses of 
laudanum, which Paracelsus never went without, and with which he effected many 
strange cures.</P>
<P>The feats of Kelly, &quot; Speculator&quot; to Dr. Dee, may be read in the 
life of the last-named writer. Of Dr. Dee himself and the spirits Ash, Il, Po, 
Va, and many others, who used to appear to him, by Kelly's ministry, in a beryl, 
much may be found in Merie Casaubon's <I>Relation of what passed for many years 
between Dr. John Dee and some spirits. </I>This narrative comprises the 
transactions of four-and-twenty years, from <B>1583</B> to <B>1607</B>. 
<I>Familiars </I>partook of that jealousy which is always a characteristic of 
spiritual beings, from the time of Psyche's Cupid downwards, in their 
intercourse with mortals. This feeling is strongly exemplified in a narrative 
given by Froissart, and translated by Lord Berners, which relates : - &quot; How 
a spyrite, called Orthone, served the lorde of Corasse a long time, and brought 
euer tidynges from all parts of the worlde.&quot;</P>

<P>Fascination :</B> From Latin <I>fascinare, </I>to enchant. The word in its 
general acceptation signifies charm, enchant, to bewitch, by the eyes, the looks 
; generally, to charm or enchant; to hold or keep in thraldom by charms, by 
powers of pleasing.</P>
<P>A belief in <I>Fascination </I>(strictly so called) appears to have been very 
generally prevalent in most ages and countries. For its existence in Greece and 
Rome we may quote the wish of Theocritus that an old woman might be with him to 
avert this ill by spitting, or the complaint of Menalcas, in Virgil, that some 
evil eye has fascinated his lambs. The Romans, indeed, with their usual passion 
for increasing the host of heaven, deified this power of ill, and enrolled a god 
fascinus &quot; among their objects of worship. Although he was a&quot; 
numen,&quot; the celebration of his rites was intrusted by a singular 
incongruity, to the care of the vestal virgins and his phallic attribute was 
suspended round the necks of children and from the triumphal chariots. 
Lucretius, writing <I>Of </I>Natural <I>Witchcraft for Love, etc., </I>says : 
&quot;But as there is <I>fascination </I>and witchcraft by malicious and angry 
eyes unto displeasure, so are there witching aspects tending contrariwise to 
love, or, at the least, to the procuring of good will and liking. For if the 
<I>fascination </I>or witch-craft be brought to pass or provoked by the desire, 
by the wishing or coveting any beautiful shape or favour, the venom is strained 
through the eyes, though it be from afar, and the imagination of a beautiful 
form resteth in the heart of the lover, and kindleth the fire where it is 
afflicted. And because the most delicate, sweet and tender blood of the beloved 
doth there wander, his countenance is there represented, shining in his own 
blood, and cannot there be quiet, and is so haled from thence, that the blood of 
him that is wounded, reboundeth, and slippeth into the wounder.&quot;</P>
<P>Vairus, Prior of the Benedictine Convent of Sta. Sophia in Benevento, 
published a Treatise, <I>Dc Fascino, </I>in <B>1589</B>. He first points to 
whole nations which have been reported to possess the power of <I>fascination. 
</I>Thus the idolatrous &quot;Biarbi&quot; and &quot; Hamaxobii,&quot; on the 
authority of Olaus Magnus, are represented to be &quot; most deeply versed in 
the art of fascinating men, so that by witchcraft of the eyes, or words, or of 
aught else (a very useful latitude of expression) they so compel men that they 
are no longer free, nor of sane understanding, and often are reduced to extreme 
emaciation, and perish by a wasting disease.&quot; He then proceeds to similar 
marvels concerning animals. Wolves, if they see a man first, deprive him of all 
power of speech ; a fact yet earlier from Theocritus. The shadow of the hyaena 
produces the same effect upon a dog; and this sagacious wild beast is so well 
acquainted with its own virtue, that whenever it finds dog or man sleeping, its 
first care is to stretch its length by the side of the slumberer, and thus 
ascertain his comparative magnitude with its own. If itself be larger of the 
two, then it is able to afflict its prey with madness, and it fearlessly begins 
to nibble his hands or paws (whichever they may be) to prevent resistance ; if 
it be smaller, it quietly runs away. It may be as well to know, (though not 
immediately bearing on <I>fascination), </I>that an attack from an hyaena, if it 
approaches on the right hand, is peculiarly dangerous; if from the left, it may 
be beaten off without much trouble. Lastly, tortoises lay their eggs and 
afterwards hatch them, as is very credibly affirmed, by virtue of their eyes 
alone. </P>
<P>The tenth chapter of the <I>First Book of Vairus </I>inquires : &quot;An 
aliqui se fascinare possint ? &quot; a question which is decided in the 
affirmative, by the example of the Basilisk of Narcissus, and of one less known, 
though equally unfortunate, Eutelis. In the twelfth chapter he affirms. that the 
more wicked any person is, the better is he adapted to exercise evil 
<I>fascination. </I>From this book we may extract two useful cautions : Let no 
servant ever hire himself to a squinting master, and let jewellers be cautious 
to whose hands, or rather eyes, they intrust their choicest wares. A friend of 
Vairus told him, that he had seen a person who was gifted with an eye of such 
fascinating power, that once while he was looking attentively on a precious 
stone of fine water, exquisite cutting, and admirable polish, in the hands of a 
lapidary, the jewel of its own accord split into two parts.</P>
<P>In his Second Book, after disputing against &quot;natural&quot; 
<I>fascination, </I>which he treats as visionary, Vairus determines that all 
<I>fascination </I>is an evil power, attained by tacit or open compact with the 
devil.</P>
<P>A second writer on this matter is John Lazarus Gutierrez, a Spanish 
physician, who may be believed to be equally well qualified for the 
consideration of mystery. His <I>Opusculum de Fascino </I>appeared in 
<B>1653</B>. On his own experience he does not state much, but in his <I>Dubium 
</I>(III.) he cites Mendoza for an account of a servant of a Tyrolese nobleman, 
who could bring down a falcon from her very highest flight by steadily looking 
at her. From Antonius Carthaginensis, also, he produces two other wonders. The 
first, of a man in Guadalazara, who was in the habit of breaking mirrors into 
minute fragments solely by looking at them ; the second, of another in Ocana, 
who used. to kill his own children, as well as those of other folks, by the 
contagion of his eyes; nay, still more, occasionally, in like manner, to be the 
cause of death to many valuable horses.</P>
<P>From Cardan, Gutierrez extracts the following symptoms by which a physician 
may determine that his patient is fascinated :-Loss of colour, heavy and 
melancholy eyes, either overflowing with tears or unnaturally dry, frequent 
sighs. and lowness of spirits. watchfulness, bad dreams, falling away of flesh. 
Also, if a coral or jacinth worn by him loses its colour, or if a ring, made of 
the hoof of an ass, put on his finger, grows too big for him after a few days' 
wearing. According to the same writer, the Persians used to determine the sort 
of <I>fascination </I>under which the patient laboured, by binding a clean linen 
cloth round his head, letting it dry there, and remarking whether any and what 
spots arose on it.</P>
<P>But the most curious fact which we learn from Gutierrez is that the Spanish 
children in his time wore amulets against <I>fascination, </I>somewhat 
resembling those in use among the Romans. The son of Gutierrez himself wore one 
of these ; it was a cross of jet, (&quot; agavache&quot;) and it was believed 
that it would split if regarded by evil eyes, thus transferring their venom from 
the child upon itself. In point. of fact, the amulet worn by young Gutierrez did 
so split one day, while a person was steadfastly looking at him; and, in justice 
to the learned physician, we must add, that he attributes the occurrence to some 
accidental cause, and expresses his conviction that the same thing would have 
happened under any other circumstances. Throughout his volume, indeed, all his 
reasoning is brought forward to explode the superstition.</P>
<P>A third similar work is that of John Christian Frommann, a physician of 
Saxe-Coburg, who published his <I>Tractatus de Fascinatione </I>in 
<B>1675</B>.</P>
<P>We have already learned from Vairus, that all those who are immoderately 
praised, especially behind their backs, persons of fair complexion, and of 
handsome face or figure, particularly children, are most exposed to 
<I>fascination, </I>and this notion probably arose from such children attracting 
from strangers more attention than others less indebted to nature. It was an 
impression of his own personal beauty which induced Polyphemus to put in 
practice the spitting charm which Cotattaris had taught him. So we read in 
Theocritus, Frommann adds, that children in unwashed baby linen are easily 
subject to <I>fascination, </I>and so also is any fair one who employs two 
lady's maids to dress her hair; moreover, that all those who lie in bed very 
late in the morning, especially if they wear nightcaps, all who break their fast 
on cheese or peas, and all children who, having been once weaned, are brought 
back to the breast, will, even against their inclination, be gifted with the 
power of fascinating both men and beasts.</P>
<P>In order to ascertain whether a child be fascinated, three oak apples may be 
dropped into a basin of water under its cradle, the person who drops them 
observing the strictest silence ; if they swim the child is free, if they sink 
it is affected; or a slice of bread may be cut with a knife marked with three 
crosses, and both the bread and the knife left on the child's pillow for a 
night; if marks of rust appear in the morning the child is fascinated. If on 
licking the child's forehead with your tongue a salt taste is perceived, this 
also is an infallible. proof of <I>fascination.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P></I>
<P>The following remedies against <I>fascination </I>rest upon the authorities 
either of Vairus or Frommann, or both of them ; several of them may be traced to 
Pliny :-An invocation of Nemesis ; the root of the &quot; Satyrios Orchis the 
skin of a hyaena's forehead; the kernel of the fruit of a palm tree; &quot; 
Alyssum&quot; (madwort) hung up anywhere in the house ; the stone &quot; 
Catochites ;&quot; spitting on the right 'shoe before it be put on ; hyssop ; 
lilies ; fumigations; sprinklings; necklaces Qf jacinth, sapphire, or carbuncle 
; washings in river water, provided silence be kept; licking a child's forehead, 
first upward, next across, and lastly up again, and then spitting behind its 
back; sweeping its face with the bough of a pine tree; laying it on the ground, 
covered up in a linen cloth, and then sprinkling it in the form of a cross, with 
three handfuls of earth, dug where the eaves drop, and brought thence at three 
separate times within an hour; laying turf from a boy's grave under a boy's 
pillow, from a girl's under a girl's silently placing near a child the clothes 
in which 'it was baptized ; if, as is sometimes the case. a child appears to 
derive no benefit from washing, taking three scrapings from the plaster of each 
of the four walls of its bedroom, and sprinkling them on its linen; three &quot; 
lavemeats&quot; of three spoonfuls of milk; giving in a drink the ashes of a 
rope in which a man has been hanged; drawing water silently, and throwing a 
lighted candle into it in the name of the Holy Trinity, then washing the 
patient's legs in this water, and throwing the remainder behind its back in the 
form of a cross; hanging up the key of the house over the child's cradle; laying 
on it crumbs of bread, a lock with the bolt shut, a looking-glass, or some coral 
washed in the font in which it was baptized; hanging round its neck fennel 
seeds, or bread and cheese.</P>
<P>Vairus states, that huntsmen, as a protection against <I>fascination, 
</I>were used to split an oak plant, and pass themselves and their dogs between 
it. As amulets against love <I>fascination, </I>he recommends sprinkling with 
the dust in which a mule has rolled itself; a bone which may be found in the 
right side of a toad ; or the liver of a chameleon. Vida has given a highly 
elaborate description of one who possessed this destructive power in his eye, 
after enjoining especial caution respecting those who are permitted to look at 
the silkworms. Some instances of yet more modern belief in <I>fascination 
</I>than those to which we have referred above, may be found collected in 
Brand's <I>Popular Antiquities. </I>It appears even in our own days to be 
prevalent among the inhabitants of the western islands of Scotland, who use 
nuts, called Molluca beans, as amulets against it. Dallaway, in his <I>Account 
of Constantinople </I>remarks, that Nothing can exceed the superstition of the 
Turks respecting the evil eye of an enemy or infidel. Passages from the Koran 
are painted on the outside of the houses, globes of glass are suspended from the 
ceiling, and a part of the superfluous caparison of their horses is designed to 
attract attention and divert a sinister influence.&quot;</P>
<P>Delrio has a very short notice of <I>fascination; </I>he divides it into 
Poetica seu Vulgaris,&quot; that resulting from obscure physical causes, which 
he treats as fabulous ; &quot; Philosophica,&quot; which lie considers to be 
contagion; and&quot; Magica,&quot; to which he heartily assents.</P>

<P>Faust :</B> A magician of the sixteenth century, famous in legend and 
literature. There is sound proof that such a person existed. Trithemius (q.v.) 
mentions him in a letter written in <B>1507</B>, in which he speaks of him in 
terms of contempt, as a fool and a mountebank who pretended that he could 
restore the writings of the ancients were they wiped out of human memory, and 
blasphemed concerning the miracles of Christ. Mudt, a canon of the German Church 
also alludes to him in a letter as a charlatan. Johann Gast, a Protestant pastor 
of Basel, appears to have known Faust, and considers a horse and dog belonging 
to him to have been familiar spirits. Wier (q.v.), the great protector of 
witches, mentions <I>Faust </I>in a work of his, as a drunkard who had studied 
magic at Cracow. He also mentions that in the end Satan strangled him after his 
house had been shaken by a terrific din. From other evidence it is pretty clear 
that <I>Faust </I>was a wandering magician or necromancer, whose picturesque 
character won him wide publicity or notoriety. By the end of the century in 
which he flourished he had become the model of the medieval magician. and his 
name was for ever linked with those of Virgil, Bacon, Pope Silvester and 
others.</P>
<P>The origins of the <I>Faust </I>legend are of very great antiquity. The 
essentials underlying the story are the pact with Satan, and the supposed 
vicious character of purely human learning. The idea of the pact with Satan 
belongs to both Jewish and Christian magico-religious belief, but is probably 
more truly Kabalistic than anything else, and can scarcely be traced further 
back ; unless it resides in the savage idea that a sacrificed person takes the 
place of the deity, to which he is immolated during the period of life remaining 
to him before his execution, and afterwards becomes one with the god. The 
wickedness of believing in the all-sufficiency of human knowledge is a favourite 
theme with the early Lutherans, whose beliefs strongly coloured the <I>Faust 
</I>legend; but vivid hues and wondrously carven outlines were also afforded its 
edifice by the thought of the age in which it finally took shape; and in the 
ancient <I>Faust- books </I>we find tortuous passages of thought and 
quaintnesses of conception which recall to our minds the artistry of the 
Renaissance.</P>
<P>The <I>Faust-book </I>soon spread over Europe; but to England is due the 
honour of the first dramatic representation of the story by Christopher Marlowe, 
who in the <I>Tragicall History of Dr. Faustus </I>produced a wondrous, if 
unequal drama,-the outstanding passages of which contained most of his best 
work. Lessing wrote a <I>Faust </I>play daring the German revival of the 
eighteenth century, but it remained to Goethe to crown the legend with the 
creation of the greatest psychological drama the world has ever seen. The manner 
in which Goethe differed from his predecessors in his treatment of the story 
lies in the circumstance that he gives a different character to the pact between 
<I>Faust </I>and Mephistopheles, whose nature again is totally at variance with 
the devils of the old <I>Faust-books. </I>From Lessing Goethe received the idea 
of <I>Faust's </I>final salvation. It may be said that though in some respects 
Goethe adopted the letter of the-old legend he did not adopt its spirit. 
Probably the story of <I>Faust </I>has given to thousands their only idea of 
medieval magic, and this idea has lost nothing in the hands of Goethe, who has 
cast about the subject a much greater halo of mystery than it perhaps really 
contains. <I>(See </I>Goethe.)</P>

<P>Fetch :</B> According to Irish belief, the apparition of a living, person ; 
the Irish form of the wraith (q.v.) It resembles in every particular the 
individual whose death it is sup posed to foretell, but it is generally of a 
shadowy or ghostly appearance. The <I>fetch </I>may be seen by more than one 
person at the same time and, like the wraith of England and Scotland, may appear 
to the person it represents. There is a belief, too, that if the <I>fetch </I>be 
seen in the morning, it indicates long life for the original : but if it be seen 
at night, his speedy demise may be expected. The <I>Fetch </I>enters largely 
into the folk-tales of Ireland ; and it is hardly surprising that so many tales 
have been woven around it, for there is something gruesome in the idea of being 
haunted by one's own &quot;double&quot; which has frequently been turned to 
account by more sophisticated writers than the inventors of folk-tales.</P>
<P>Patrick Kennedy, in his <I>Legendary Fiction of the Irish Celt, </I>speaking 
of the Irish <I>fetch, </I>gives the following tale of <I>The Doctor's Fetch, 
</I>based, it is stated, on the most authentic sources : &quot; In one of our 
Irish cities, and in a room where the mild moonbeams were resting on the carpet 
and on a table near the window, Mrs. B., wife of a doctor in good practice and 
general esteem, looking towards the window from her pillow, was startled by the 
appearance of her husband standing near the table just mentioned, and seeming to 
look with attention on the book which was lying open on it. Now, the living and 
breathing man was by her side apparently asleep, and, greatly as she was 
surprised and affected, she had sufficient command of herself to remain without 
moving, lest she should expose him to the terror which she herself at the moment 
experienced. After gazing on the apparition for a few seconds, she bent her eyes 
upon her husband to ascertain if his looks were turned in the direction of the 
window, but his eyes were closed. She turned round again, although now dreading 
the sight of what she believed to be her husband's <I>fetch, </I>but it was no 
longer there. She remained sleepless throughout the remainder of the night, but 
still bravely refrained from disturbing her partner.</P>
<P>Next morning, Mr. B., seeing signs of disquiet on his wife's countenance 
while at breakfast, made some affectionate inquiries, but she concealed her 
trouble, and at his ordinary hour he sallied forth to make his calls. Meeting 
Dr. C, in the street, and falling into conversation with him, he asked his 
opinion on the subject of <I>fetches. </I>' I think,' was the answer, ' and so I 
am sure do you, that they are mere illusions produced by a disturbed stomach 
acting upon the excited brain of a highly imaginative or superstitious person.' 
Then,' said Mr. B., I am highly imaginative or superstitious, for I distinctly 
saw my own outward man last night standing at the table in the bedroom, and 
clearly distinguishable in the moonlight. I am afraid my wife saw it too, but I 
have been afraid to speak to her on the subject.'</P>
<P>About the same hour on the ensuing night the poor lady was again roused, but 
by a more painful circumstance. She felt her husband moving convulsively, and 
immediately afterwards he cried to her in low, interrupted accents, Elleo, my 
dear, I am suffocating; send for Dr. C.' She sprang up, huddled on some clothes, 
and ran to his house. He came with all speed, but his efforts for his friend 
were useless. He had burst a large blood-vessel in the lungs, and was soon 
beyond human aid. In her lamentations the bereaved wife frequently cried out, ' 
Oh the <I>fetch, </I>the <I>fetch </I>!' and at a later period told the doctor 
of the appearance the night before her husband's death.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Fetishism :</B> The term <I>fetishism </I>is employed in more than one sense. 
Thus it may mean in some cases pure idolatry or the worship of inanimate 
objects. Again in older works of travel, it is even used to signify African 
religion. But taken in its general and more modern sense, it signifies any 
inanimate object which appears to the savage as the residence of a spirit. Thus 
a carved doll, a necklace of teeth, a flint stone into which a shaman or 
medicine-man has succeeded in coaxing a spirit to reside, is regarded by the 
savage as a fetish. But larger objects are occasionally adopted as fetishes, and 
in the adoption of these in contradistinction to the smaller fetishes we can 
trace the evolution of the idol. As a general rule the fetish is an object 
peculiar in shape or material, for such is considered by the shaman as being 
more likely to attract a wandering spirit than any more ordinary substance. Thus 
we find as fetishes peculiarly shaped stones, tufts of human hair and bones, 
parts of animals and birds, and so forth. Fossils are not uncommonly employed as 
fetishes, possibly because of their freakish formation.</P>
<P>The origin of <I>fetishism </I>is undoubtedly animistic <I>(See </I>Animism). 
The savage intelligence regards everything that surrounds it as possessing the 
property of life-water, the earth, trees, stones and so forth. But this is 
modified by the idea that many of these objects are under the power of some 
spell or potent enchantment. Thus the rocks and trees are the living tombs of 
imprisoned spirits, resembling the dryads of folk-lore ; so that it is not at 
all strange to the savage mind to perceive an imprisoned intelligence more or 
less powerful, in any object, no matter how uncommon its form. In fact, 
according to the savage mind, spirit was dependent to a great extent upon 
material body. The wandering spirit, according to the barbarian; could not fare 
much better, materially speaking, than a wandering savage it would suffer the 
rigours of hunger and cold, and would be only too agreeable to be at rest for a 
while where it would be treated with every deference and properly attended to. 
For this purpose a shaman will either manufacture or search for a fitting 
residence for this spirit, and he will proceed by various rites to attempt to 
coax some wandering intelligence to take up its home therein.</P>
<P>There is of course a point at which the fetish commences to develop into a 
god. This happens when fetishes survive the test of experience and achieve a 
more than personal or tribal popularity. Thus amongst the Zuni Indians a fetish 
called &quot; The Knife-feathered Monster &quot; has practically become the 
tribal god of war, and a pony and sheep fetish are at present in course of 
evolving as deities in the pantheon of this people. Amongst the Zuni there 
appears to have been the conception that their fetishes were totemistic. 
<I>Fetishism </I>and totemism are not incompatible with one another, but often 
flourish side by side ; but the basic difference between a fetish and a totem is 
that the fetish spirit is the bond slave of the person who owns its abode, 
whereas the totem is his patron spirit, personal or tribal. Nevertheless the 
fetish partakes more of the nature of those spirits which are subservient to 
man, as for example the Arabian Jinn, than of those which subsequently develop 
into gods. They are more of the race of faery, of the little folk who dwelt in 
the crevices of rocks and trees, the smaller swarm of the supernatural, than of 
the strain of Olympus. A capital example of a fetish, which will be familiar to 
all, is that which occurs in the story of Aladdin and his lamp. Here we have the 
subservient nature-spirit-the original conception of which must have been that 
it dwelt in the lamp or the ring, and was only freed therefrom on the summons of 
its temporary master to perform some special piece of work. But a fetish is not 
necessarily a piece of personal property : it may belong collectively to an 
entire community or family, and it is usually an heirloom.</P>
<P>The savage naturally attaches great importance to those fetishes which assist 
him in the chase. Thus the Zuni Indians, who possess perhaps the most complete 
fetishistic system of any barbarous people, have a special temple-house set 
apart for their tribal fetishes of the hunt, which they call the Prey-gods. On 
setting out for the hunt, the Zuni Indian will visit the fetish-house, and 
sprinkle a little maize meal on a platter placed before that fetish which he 
wishes to employ in his expedition. In this office he is usually assisted by a 
medicine-man set aside for the purpose, whose special duty it is to see that the 
fetishes are properly placated and returned when their services are no more 
required. Let us suppose that he selects the fetish of the mountain-lion. This 
is a stone object, shaped in the likeness of that animal. Once in the open 
country, the hunter places the mouth of the fetish to his own and suspires 
deeply, imagining that by so doing he is breathing in the hunting instinct of 
the mountain-lion. He then forcibly emits his breath. The Indian idea is that 
beasts of prey are able by the emission of breath to render the game helpless 
over a wide area, and this the bunter believes he has successfully and magically 
imitated. When he meets with his game, after slaying it, his first act is to 
excise the liver, which he smears upon the lips of the fetish, which is then 
duly returned to the fetish-house. Most of the objects belonging to a 
medicine-man or shaman are believed to be fetishes,-that is, they possess a 
certain quality of life that other, and more ordinary, objects do not have.</P>
<P>The word fetish is derived from the Portuguese <I>feitico </I>which implies 
&quot; something made,&quot; and was applied by early voyagers in West Africa to 
the wooden figures, stones and so forth, regarded as the residence of spirits. 
<I>Fetishism </I>in Africa appears t<B>6</B> be generally confined to the 
coasts, but in America it is prevalent more or less over the whole hemisphere. 
That it was once prevalent in Europe is practically certain from the nature of 
many objects found in prehistoric and early historic graves, and in certain 
parts of Asia, it is by no means extinct. The material conception of 
<I>fetishism </I>survives in the charm, amulet or mascot, which is regarded as a 
luck-bringer, although the spiritual significance connected with it has quite 
vanished. <I>(See </I>Charms and Amulets, Familiar).</P>

<P>Fiction, English Occult :</B> English literature, as it is known today, 
really begins with the Elizabethan age for the writers prior to that time, 
excellent as many of them are, elicit comparatively little interest nowadays 
save among experts. And, by the time of Elizabeth's advent, the old miracle 
plays &quot; had gone out of fashion yet tales about the miraculous doings of 
mythical heroes continued to find favour, and many new things of this kind were 
written.</P>
<P>A few of the Restoration dramatists dealt in magic and the like, but 
throughout the Georgian age people were mostly too prosaic, too matter-of-fact, 
to care for things of that sort, and they were eschewed by the majority of 
prominent writers of the day. However, after the great artistic movement 
commonly styled the Renaissance of Wonder, the old interest in the occult began 
to revive apace, and, ere the nineteenth century was very far advanced, a 
literature suitable to this budding taste was being purveyed on a voluminous 
scale. Among the first to enter the lists, <I>soi disant, </I>was William 
Godwin, with his novel of <I>St. Truyne the Rosicrucian </I>while Godwin's 
daughter, Mary, chiefly remembered nowadays as the second wife of Shelley, 
merits notice as a mystical writer by virtue of her story of <I>Frankenstein. 
</I>A little before the advent of this authoress, numerous occult tales had been 
written by Matthew Lewis, notably <I>Tales of Terror </I>and the drama of 
<I>Castle Spectre, </I>staged successfully at Drury Lane in <B>1798</B> while 
not long after Lewis a further novelist came to swell the muster-roll, Bulwer 
Lytton, whose taste for the mystic is seen especially in <I>Zanoni, A Strange 
Story, </I>and <I>Haunters and the Haunted. </I>His essays of this kind, 
nevertheless, were never very satisfactory in the real literary sense and as 
Leslie Stephen once discovered, they too often smacked of the theatrical. But 
Sir Walter Scott, on the other hand, writing just before Lytton's time, not only 
showed a keen fondness for occult matter, but frequently utilised it to genuine 
artistic purpose. In <I>The Monastery </I>a mysterious sylph rises from a 
fountain astrology is introduced into <I>The Mannering, The Fortunes of Nigel, 
</I>and <I>Quentin Durward; </I>while a splendid ghost story is told in 
<I>Redgauntlet, </I>and ghosts figure also in <I>Wood-stock. </I>In <I>The Bride 
of Lammermoor, </I>besides, the author deals incidentally with that firm belief 
in prophecy which was long a prominent part of Scottish life ; while in 
<I>Waverley, </I>again, he depicts a Highland chief as awestruck and unmanned by 
the sight of a peculiar omen. Highland superstitions, indeed, appealed with 
particular potency to Sir Walter's romantic temper ; while he was not the only 
writer of his time who dealt ably with this branch of the occult, another being 
Susan Ferrier in her novels of <I>Destiny </I>and <I>The Chief's Daughter. 
</I>Nor should we fail ere leaving this period, to mention Ann Radcliffe, for in 
almost all her novels the supernatural figures prominently.</P>
<P>While the last-named trio were at work thus in Britain, some good stories in 
which magic occurs were being written in America by Washington Irving ; and, not 
very long after his day, a second American arose to treat brilliantly of 
weirdness and wizardry, Edgar Allan Poe. Then, reverting to England, ghosts 
appear in a few of Dickens' novels, and Charles Reade manifests here and there a 
love of the occult ; while coming to slightly later times, a writer who 
manifested this predilection abundantly is Robert Louis Stevenson. His <I>Dr. 
Jekyll and Mr. Hyde </I>is among the best of all modern novels in which the 
supernatural plays a salient role, and many of his short stories pertain also to 
the category of occult, for example, the tale of the magic bottle in <I>Island 
Nights Entertainments; </I>while, about the date these were being composed, 
Oscar Wilde was writing what is one of the most beautiful things dealing with 
invisible powers, <I>The Picture of Dorian Gray. </I>Much inferior to this 
masterpiece, yet possessing considerable excellence, are George du Maurier's 
<I>Peter Ibbetson, Trilby </I>and <I>The Martian, </I>in each of which the 
supernatural is prominent while a further work which should certainly be cited 
is Lafcadio Hearn's <I>Dead Love, </I>a tiny tale of magic which the author 
thought lightly of, but which future generations are almost sure to prize on 
account of its lovely wording, at some places worthy of Theophile Gautier 
himself, who was Hearn's acknowledged master.</P>
<P>These recent authors do not by any means conclude the list, for a wealth of 
occult <I>fiction </I>has been written since their day. Among its most 
remarkable items is <I>The Ghost Ship </I>of Richard Middleton, a singularly 
promising storyteller and poet who died by his own hand lately at the early age 
of twenty-nine; while many contemporary novelists have introduced magic into 
their books, for instance; Mr. Rider Haggard in <I>She, </I>the late Mr. Bram 
Stoker in <I>Dracula, </I>and Mr. F. A. Anstey in <I>Vice Versa </I>and <I>The 
Brass Bottle. </I>In fact, were one to cite all the living wont to trade in the 
occult, an article of formidable size would be the result, and accordingly the 
attempt must be eschewed ; but at least it is essential to mention Mr. Theodore 
Watts-Dunton's <I>Aylwin, </I>this reflecting really fine treatment of mystic 
matter, and being couched throughout in a style of exceptional beauty. Mr. 
Arthur Symons is another great writer of to-day who loves the borderland between 
dreams and realities, as witness many pages in his <I>Spiritual Adventures 
</I>while the invisible world has always appealed powerfully to Mr. W. B. Yeats, 
and is employed to good purpose here and there in his stories of the Irish 
peasantry. It is less the ghost than the fairy which he delights in, true Celt 
that he is ; and his predilection herein sets one dreaming of fairy-tales in 
general, and summons a curious medley of names. William Morris wrote a host of 
beautiful fairy-stories, some of them concerned with the promulgation of 
socialistic ideas, but others innocent of anything of that sort; while the 
voluminous works of Ruskin include what can only be defined as a fairy tale, 
<I>The King of the Golden River. </I>Numerous contemporary writers have likewise 
done good work in this field-Lord Dunsany, Mr. J. M. Barrie, and more especially 
Mr. Laurence Housman-while a remarkable fairy play has been written lately by 
Mr. Graham Robertson, and has been staged with surprising triumph. Then, 
reverting for a moment to defunct authors, fairies occur in that charming volume 
by H. D. Lowry, <I>Make Believe, </I>and in Richard Middleton's book, <I>The Day 
Before Yesterday </I>; while no account of this particular domain of literature 
would be complete without mention of the work of Lewis Carrol, and also of Jean 
Ingelow's lovely story, <I>Mopsa the Fairy. </I>This last is possibly the best 
of all fairy stories, and one which has been most widely and wisely cherished ; 
and it stands out very clearly in the memory of nearly every man of imaginative 
temperament, reminding him of his own childhood.</P>

<P>Figuier, Guillaume Louis :</B> A French writer and chemist, born at 
Montpellier in <B>1819</B>. His uncle, Pierre Figuier, was professor of 
chemistry at the School of Pharmacy, Montpellier, and Louis, having taken his 
degree of doctor of medicine, and studied chemistry at the laboratory of Balard 
in Paris, was made professor of chemistry at the School of Pharmacy, 
Montpellier. He later- <B>1853</B> - exchanged this post for a similar one in 
the School of Pharmacy of Paris. Thereafter many honorary degrees in science and 
medicine were conferred upon him by various faculties. In <B>1857</B> he finally 
left off teaching and devoted himself to the popularising of science, mainly 
physiology and medical chemistry. He published from time to time many notable 
works, and was not more distinguished for his prodigious output than for its 
literary quality. Of those works having a bearing on occult matters the 
principal are <I>le Lendemein de la mort ou La Vie future selon Ia science 
</I>(<B>1872</B>) dealing with the transmigration of souls ; <B><I>1</B>' 
Atchimie et les Alchimistes </I>(<B>1854</B>); <I>histoire du merveilleux dens 
les temps modernes </I>(<B>1859</B>-<B>60</B> ); <I>les Bonheurs d' outre tombe 
</I>(<B>1892</B>.) He tried to popularize science by introducing on the stage 
plays whose heroes were savants and inventors. His attempt however, met with but 
a cold reception. In <B>1889</B> he published a volume of dramas and comedies, 
la <I>Science au Theatre. </I>He died at Paris in <B>1894</B>.</P>

<P>Finn Mac Cummal :</B> In Irish romance, Captain of the Fianna and the centre 
of the Ossianic tales. His father Cumhal, chief of the clan Basena, was slain at 
Castle Knock by the rival clan Morna, but his mother succeeded in saving him 
from the enemy. He was brought up in hiding and given the name of <I>Finn 
</I>from the clearness of his skin. He learned science and poetry from the druid 
Finegas who dwelt on the river Boyne. The druid had been unable to catch the 
salmon of knowledge until <I>Finn </I>became his pupil, and when he did succeed 
in catching it, he told <I>Finn </I>to watch it while it was cooking but not to 
partake of it. <I>Finn, </I>however, burned his fingers as he turned the spit 
and put one of them in his mouth. Seeing this, Finegas bade him eat the salmon 
and he became filled with the wisdom of all ages. Afterwards he took service 
with King Cormac to whom he revealed his name and lineage. Cormac promised him 
the leadership of the Fianna if he succeeded in killing the fire-blowing demon 
that came yearly to set Tara in flames. <I>Finn </I>slew the demon and bore his 
head back to Tara. The Fianna were therefore ordered to swear allegiance to 
<I>Finn </I>as their captain, which, led by Goll mac Morna, their former 
captain, they all did. Under <I>Finn, </I>the Fianna rose to great eminence, an

the battle of Bowra. <I>Finn's </I>end is shrouded in mystery. According to 
popular tradition he and his great companions he sleeping in an enchanted cave 
whence they shall arise in the hour of their country's need, like Arthur, 
Barbarossa and Charlemagne.</P>

<P>Fioravanti, Leonardi : </B>An Italian alchemist doctor and surgeon of the 
sixteenth century. He was a voluminous writer whose best known work is a 
<I>Summary of the Arcana of Medicine, Surgery and Alchemy, </I>published in 
Venice in <B>1571</B>. It embraces an application of the principles and methods 
of Hermes to the Science of Medicine. The author's account of the <I>petra 
philosophorum </I>shews its designation to be purely arbitrary. It is a mixture 
of mercury, nitre and other ingredients intended as a stomachic and has no 
connection with the transmuting <I>lapis </I>of the alchemists.</P>

<P>Fire :</B> Many nations have adored this element. In Persia a chimneyless 
enclosure was made, and into it <I>fire </I>was introduced. Essences and 
perfumes were cast into the <I>fire </I>by the great persons of the nation. When 
a Persian king was at the point of death all the <I>fires </I>in the principal 
towns of the kingdom were extinguished, and were not rekindled until the 
crowning of his successor. Certain Tartars never accost foreigners who have not 
purified themselves by passing between two fires ; they are also careful to 
drink with their faces turned to the south, in honour of the element of <I>fire. 
</I>In some parts of Siberia it is believed that <I>fire </I>is inhabited by a 
being who dispenses good and evil; they offer him perpetual sacrifices. 
According to the kabalists, this was the element of the Salamanders. <I>(See 
also </I>Fire Ordeal.)</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Fire-ordeal :</B> The <I>fire-ordeal </I>is of great antiquity, and probably 
arose from the conception of the purifying influence of fire. Among the Hindoos, 
from the earliest times until comparatively recently, those who were suspected 
of wrongdoing were required to prove their guilt or innocence by walking over 
red-hot iron. If they escaped unharmed their innocence was placed beyond a 
doubt. The priestesses of a Cappodocian goddess, Diana Parasya, walked 
barefooted on red-hot coals, attributing their invulnerability to the powers of 
the divinity. In Europe trial by fire was of two kinds-traversing the flames, or 
undergoing the ordeal of hot iron. The latter form comprised the carrying in the 
hand of red-hot irons, the walking over iron bars or glowing ploughshares, and 
the thrusting of the hand into a red-hot gauntlet. An early instance of the 
former mode in European history is that of Pierre Barthelemy, who in <B>1097</B> 
declared to the Crusaders that heaven had revealed to him the place where was 
concealed the spear that had pierced the Saviour's body. To prove his assertion 
he offered-to undergo the ordeal by fire, and was duly required to walk a path 
about a foot in width and some fourteen feet in length, on either side of which 
were piled blazing olive-branches. The judgment of the fire was unfavourable, 
and twelve days later the rash adventurer expired in agony. Books also were 
sometimes submitted to the trial by fire. This method was adopted to decide the 
claims of the Roman and Mozaratian liturgies, the former emerging victorious 
from the flames. Among savage people the <I>fire-ordeal </I>is also to be met 
with, and especially in New Zealand, India, Fiji, and Japan. It may be suspected 
that the issue of these ordeals was not always left on the knees of the gods. 
There is no doubt that the ancient Egyptians were acquainted with substances 
which rendered the body partly immune. Albertus Magnus gives a recipe for this 
purpose. It is made up of powdered lime, made into<SUP> </SUP>a paste with the 
white of an egg, the juice of the radish, the juice of the marsh mallow, and the 
seeds of the fleabane. A first coat of this mixture is applied to the body and 
allowed to dry, when a second coat is applied. If the feet he constantly oiled, 
or moistened with sulphuric acid, they may be rendered impervious. Possibly the 
ancients were not unaware of the fire-resisting properties of asbestos. The 
<I>fire-ordeal </I>has remained to this day as one of the phenomena of 
spiritualism. D. D. Home frequently handled live coals, and laid them on a 
handkerchief without damaging the material in the least. On one occasion he 
enclosed a glowing coal in his hands and blew upon it until it became white hot. 
A well known instance is that related by Mrs. S. C. Hall, when Home placed a 
burning coal on the head of Mr. Hall, whose white hair was then drawn over the 
still glowing coal. In an account given by Mrs. Homewood and Lord Lindsay of a 
seance with the same medium we are told that Home took a chimney from a lighted 
lamp and thrust it into the fire, making it so hot that a match applied to it 
ignited instantly, and then thrust it into his mouth, touching it with his 
tongue, without any apparent ill effects. Another account states that Home 
placed his face right in the fire among the burning coals&quot; moving it about 
as though bathing it in water.&quot; Other mediums, both in England and America, 
emulated this feat with some measure of success. It has been suggested that the 
state of trance generally accompanying such exploits, and corresponding to the 
ecstasy of the shaman performing a similar feat, may produce anaesthesia, or 
insensibility to the pain of burning. But how it comes that the skin is not 
scorched, nor the material of the handkerchief marked by the burning coal, it is 
not easy to say.</P>

<P>Flamel, Nicholas :</B> was born at Pontoise, of a poor but respectable 
family, about the beginning of the fourteenth century. He received a good 
education, of which his natural abilities enabled him to make the best use. 
Repairing to Paris, he obtained employment as a public scrivener,-sitting at the 
corner of the Rue de Marivaux, copying or inditing letters and other documents. 
The occupation brought with it little profit, and <I>Flamel </I>tried in 
succession poetry and painting with an equally unsatisfactory result. His quick 
wits suggested that as he could make no money by teaching mankind, it might be 
more profitable to cheat them, and he took up the pursuit of Astrology, casting 
horoscopes and telling fortunes. He was right in his conjectures, and soon 
throve so vigorously that he was enabled to take unto himself a wife named 
Petronella. But those who begin to study the magic art for profit or amusement 
generally finish by addicting themselves to it with a blindly passionate love. 
<I>Nicholas </I>devoted himself both day and night to his fascinating but 
deceptive pursuits; and soon acquired a thorough knowledge of all that previous 
adepts had written upon the <I>elixir vita', </I>the universal Alkahest, and the 
Philosopher's Stone. In <B>1297</B> he lighted upon a manual of the art which 
would have been invaluable if it had been intelligible. He bought it for two 
florins. It contained three times seven leaves written with a steel instrument 
upon the bark of trees. The caligraphy was as admirable as the Latin was 
cryptical. Each seventh leaf was free from writing, but emblazoned with a 
picture the first, representing a serpent swallowing rods ; the second, a 
serpent crucified on a cross ; and the third, the arid expanse of a treeless 
desert, in whose depths a fountain bubbled, with serpents trailing their slimy 
folds from side to side. The author of this mysterious book purported to be 
&quot; Abraham, the patriarch, Jew, prince, philosopher, Levite, priest, and 
astrologer,&quot; (q.v.) who added to his other claims upon the wonder of 
mankind a knowledge of Latin. He had included within these precious pages a 
complete exposition of the art of transmuting metals; describing every process, 
explaining the different vessels, and pointing out the proper seasons for making 
experiments. In fact, the book would have been perfect, hut for one deficiency; 
it was addressed not so much to the tyro as to an adept, and took it for granted 
that its student was already in possession of the Philosopher's Stone. This was 
a terrible obstacle to the inquiring <I>Flamel </I>The more he studied the book 
the less he understood it He studied the letterpress, and he studied the 
illustrations he invited the wise men of France to come and study them but no 
light was thrown upon the darkness For thrice seven years he pored over these 
perplexing pages until at length his wife suggested that a Jewish Rabbi might be 
able to interpret them. As the chiefs of the Jews uere principally located in 
Spain, to Spain went <I>Flamel </I>and there he remained for two years. Prom one 
of the Hebrew sages he obtained some hints which afforded a key to the 
patriarchal mysteries, and returning to Paris he recommenced his studies with a 
new vigour. They were rewarded with success. On the <B>13</B>th of February, 
<B>1382</B>, o.s., <I>Flanzel </I>made a projection on Mercury, and produced 
some virgin silver. On the <B>25</B>th of the following April he converted some 
Mercury into gold, and found himself the fortunate possessor of an inexhaustible 
treasure. But his good fortune did not end here. <I>Flamel </I>continuing his 
researches discovered the elixir of life, which enabled him to prolong his life 
and accumulate gold-to the venerable age of <B>116</B>. He further administered 
the life-giving potion to his wife, who reached nearly as great a longevity as 
himself, dying in the year preceding his own death, A.D. <B>1414</B>. As they 
had no children, they spent their wealth upon churches and hospitals, and 
several of the religious and charitable institutions of France still attest 
their well-directed benevolence. There is no doubt that <I>Flamel </I>practised 
alchemy, and one of his works on the fascinating science - poem entitled <I>The 
Philosophic Summary-was </I>printed as late as <B>1735</B>. in Salmon's valuable 
and very curious <I>Bibliotheque des Philosophes Chimiques </I>are preserved 
same specimens of the drawings in Abraham's treatise on metallurgy and of his 
own handwriting. But <I>Flamel </I>was neither an enthusiast nor a dupe. His 
alchemical studies were but the disguises of his usurious practices. To account 
for the immense wealth he acquired by money-lending to the young French nobles, 
and by transacting business between the Jews of France and those of Spain, he 
invented the fiction of his discovery of the Philosopher's Stone. He 
nevertheless obtained great repute as a magician, and his followers believed 
that he was still alive though retired from the world, and would live for six 
centuries.</P>

<P>Fludd, or Flud, Robert :</B> This Rosicrucian and alchemist was born in 
<B>1574</B> at Milgate House, in the parish of Bearsted, Kent, his father being 
one Sir Thomas Fludd, a knight who enjoyed the patronage of Queen Elizabeth, and 
served her for several years as Treasurer of War in the Low Countries.&quot; At 
the age of seventeen Robert entered St. John's College, Oxford, and five years 
later he took Isis degree as Bachelor of Arts ; while shortly afterwards, on his 
deciding to take up medical science, he left England and went to prosecute his 
studies on the Continent. Going first to Spain, he travelled thence to Italy, 
and subsequently stayed for some time in Germany, where he is said to have 
supported himself by acting as pedagogue in various noble households; but soon 
he was home again, and in <B>1605</B> his <I>alma mater of </I>Oxford conferred 
on him the degrees of Bachelor of Medicine and Doctor of Medians, while five 
years later he became a Fellow of the College of Physicians. Having thus 
equipped himself thoroughly for the medical profession, Fludd went to London and 
took a house in Fenchurch Street, a quiet place in those days, though now a 
noisy centre of commerce; and here he soon gained an extensive practice, his 
success being due not merely to his genuine skill, but to his having an 
attractive and even magnetic personality. But busy though he was in this way, he 
found leisure to write at length on medicine; while anon he became an important 
and influential member of the Fraternity of the Rosy Cross, and at the same time 
he commenced alchemistic experiments. He preached the great efficacy of the 
magnet, of sympathetic cures, of the weapon-salve ; he declared his belief in 
the Philosopher's Stone, the universal alkahest or solvent, the <I>elixir vita'; 
</I>he maintained that all things were animated by two principles-condensation, 
the Boreal, or northern virtue; and rarefaction, the Austral, or southern 
virtue. He asserted that the human body was controlled by a number of demons, 
that each disease had its peculiar demon, each demon his particular place in the 
frame of humanity, and that to conquer a disease-say in the right leg-you must 
call in the aid of the demon who ruled the left, always proceeding by this rule 
of contraries. As soon as the doctrines of the Rosy Cross Brotherhood were 
promulgated <I>Fludd </I>embraced them with all the eagerness of which his 
dreamy intellect was capable; and several German writers having made an attack 
upon them, he published a defence in <B>1616</B>, under the title of <I>Apologia 
Compendiaria Fraternitatem de Rosea-Cruce Suspicionis et Infamia Maculis 
Aspersam Abluens, </I>which procured him a wide-spread reputation as one of the 
apostles of the new fraternity. He met with the usual fate of prophets, and was 
lustily belaboured by a host of enemies-by Mersenne, Gassendi, and Kepler. 
<I>Fludd </I>was by no means discomfited, and retorted upon his opponents in an 
elaborate treatise, <I>Summum Bonum, quod est Magiae, Cabalae, Alchimiae, 
Fratrum Rosea-Crucis Verorum, et adversus Mersenium Columniatorem. </I>He made 
at a later period and aventurous attempt to identify the doctrines of the 
Rosicrucians with what he was pleased to call the Philosophy of Moses 
<I>(Philosophia Mosaica, in qua sapientia et scientia Creationis explicantur), 
</I>published at Ghent, <B>1638</B>, and wrote numerous treatises on alchemy and 
medical science. He founded an English school of Rosicrucians. <I>Fludd </I>is 
one of the high priests of the Magnetic Philosophy, and learnedly expounds the 
laws of astral medicine, the doctrines of sympathies, and the fine powers and 
marvellous effects of the magnet. When two men approach each other-such was his 
theory-their magnetism is either active or passive ; that is, positive or 
negative. If the emanations which they send out are broken or thrown back, there 
arises antipathy, or <I>Magnetismus negativus </I>but when the emanations pass 
through each other, the positive magnetism is produced, for the magnetic rays 
proceed from the centre to the circumference. Man, like the earth, has his 
poles, or two main streams of magnetic influence. Like a little world, he is 
endowed with a magnetic virtue which, however, is subjected to the same laws as, 
on a larger scale, the magnetic power of the universe. How these principles may 
be developed in the cure or prevention of disease, the reader must learn from 
the mystic pages of Robertus a Fluctibus himself.</P><I>
<P>Fludd </I>died in <B>1637</B> at a house in Coleman Street, to which he had 
removed a few years before ; but ere his demise he had won a fairly wide 
reputation by his chymical ability, and had also issued a considerable number of 
books, prominent among them being <I>Tractatus Apologeticus integritatem 
Societatis de Rusae Cruce defendans, </I>Leyden <B>1617</B>, <I>Veritatis 
Proscenium, </I>Frankfort <B>1621</B>, <I>Med,cina Catholica, </I>Frankfort 
<B>1629</B>, <I>Monochordum Mundi Syhiphoniacum, </I>Frankfort, <B>1622</B>.</P>

<P>Flute, Charm of the :</B> The flute is often mentioned in history as being 
used for the purpose of charming animals, and the serpent seems to have been 
peculiarly delighted with its music. It is Slid that adders will swell at the 
sound of the flute, raising themselves up, twisting about and keeping proper 
time. A Spanish writer says that in India he had often seen the Gentiles leading 
about enchanted serpents, making them dance to the sound of a flute, putting 
them round their necks, and touching them without harm ; and to this day a 
musical instrument of this nature is used by the snake-charmers of that country. 
In opposition to this, Hippocrates mentions a man, Nicanor, who fainted whenever 
he heard the sound of a flute.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Flying Dutchman, The</B> <B>:</B> Sailors in Holland long believed that a 
certain Dutch skipper, van Straaten by name, was condemned as a penalty for his 
sins to sail for year after year through the seas beating around the Cape of 
Storms, this being the old name for the Cape of Good Hope; and crews returning 
to the Zudyer Zee after voyaging in the region aforesaid, use to declared that 
they had seen van Straaten's mysterious craft, and had fled from it in terror. 
This legend is probably a very old one, albeit the exact date at which it became 
current is indeterminate; and it should be added that the story is found in the 
folklore of various countries besides Holland, notably Germany. Several German 
versions call the ill-starred seaman von Falkenberg. and maintain that it was 
not near South Africa, but in the North Sea that his spectral barque commonly 
hovered; while some of them contend further that the devil was wont to pay 
periodic visits to the captain on board his ship, and that frequently the two 
were seen playing dice on deck, the stakes at issue being von Falkenberg's soul. 
The tale soon found its way from folk-lore into actual literature, among the 
greatest of those writers utilising it being Heinrich Heine, and in his 
rendering the sailor has a chance of salvation. That is to say, the fates allow 
him to put foot on <I>terra firma </I>once every seven years and if, during his 
brief period of respite, he contrives to win the affection of an unsullied 
maiden, liberation from perennial sea-wandering will be granted him as reward. 
Heine's form o the story appealed keenly to Wagner, who was always prone to 
regard woman devoutly as before all else a regenerating force ; and accordingly 
the great composer wrote a music-drama on the subject of <I>The Flying Dutchman, 
</I>or as he calls it in German, <I>Der Fliegende Hollander, </I>in which the 
scene is mostly laid in the North Sea, while the sailor himself is called van 
Derdecken. and the maiden to whom he makes advances is Senta. This opera was 
first staged at Dresden in <B>1843</B>, and, though it can hardly be said that 
it won speedy appreciation, at least it did not elicit quite the scorn meted out 
originally to the majority of Wagner's works. Marryat has also a novel on the 
subject.</P>

<P>Fong-Chur :</B> A mysterious operation practised in China, in the disposition 
of buildings, and particularly of tombs. If someone should chance to build in a 
position contrary to his neighbours, so that the corner of his house faced the 
side of a house belonging to someone else, the latter believes that the worst of 
misfortune will befall him. Longstanding feuds may result from the unfortunate 
action. The remedy consists in placing in a chamber a dragon or other monster in 
terra-cotta, facing the corner of the fatal edifice. The terrible gaze of the 
monster will repulse the evil influence. Incense is burned before the dragon. 
and he is treated with much respect.</P>

<P>Fontaine, John :</B> This Flemish alchemist and poet appears to have lived at 
Valenciennes towards the close of the thirteenth century. Two books are ascribed 
to him, <I>La Fontaine des Amoureux de Science </I>and <I>La Fontaine 
Perilleuse. </I>both of which are written in French and were published at Paris, 
the first-named in <B>1561</B> and the second eleven years later. His claims to 
the authorship of the latter work have frequently been disputed, but the former 
is almost certainly his, and a curious production it is. At the outset the 
author professes himself an adept in hermetic philosophy, and thereafter he 
proceeds, in poetry of an allegorical style which recalls <I>The Romaunt of the 
Rose, </I>to describe the different processes to be gone through ere achieving a 
transmutation. There is little in this metrical treatise which indicates that 
the writer was an alchemist of any great ability. but he certainly possessed a 
distinct gift for making pleasant if hardly powerful verses.</P>

<P>Fortune-telling :</B> <I>Fortune-telling </I>in Britain, was formerly 
included under the crime of Witchcraft, and was made punishable by death under 
the Statute of <B>1563</B> C. <B>73</B>. This Act was repealed by <B>9</B> 
George II. C. <B>5</B>, which ordained that no prosecution should thereafter be 
made on charge of Witchcraft, also by the said Act all persons professing to 
occult skill or undertaking ?o tell fortunes might be sentenced to imprisonment 
for one year, and to stand pillory and find surety for their future good 
behaviour.</P>
<P>Punishment by pillory is now abolished. By Act <B>5</B> George IV. c. 
<B>83</B> fortune-tellers were included along with other vagrants under the 
general category of rogues and vagabonds, and were liable to imprisonment for 
three months. This Act was made applicable to Scotland by <B>34</B> and 
<B>35</B> Vict. C. <B>24</B>.</P>
<P>No prosecution occurred under it until the case of <I>Smith </I>(<B>23</B> R 
(I.C.) <B>77</B>). The old Act extended to Scotland as aforesaid enacted that 
&quot;every person pretending or professing to tell fortunes or using any subtle 
craft, means, or device, by palmistry or otherwise to deceive, and impose on any 
of His Majesty's Subjects&quot; shall be deemed a vagabond and rogue within the 
meaning of tile Act and shall be punishable as therein provided. In the case 
above referred to the complainer, a woman named Jone Lee or Smith, was charged 
in the Police Court at Glasgow, with a contravention of the above enactment in 
respect that at a time and place specified, did pretend to tell the fortunes of 
&quot; a person named&quot; who was thereby induced to pay the accused the sum 
of sixpence. The accused was convicted of the contravention &quot;as 
libelled&quot; and brought a suspension. The Court <I>quashed </I>the 
conviction, holding that the complaint was irrelevant in that it did not set 
forth that the accused had pretended to tell fortunes with intent to deceive and 
impose on any one. Lord Young, one of the judges, in the course of his opinion 
says It has never been imagined, so far as I have ever heard, or thought, that 
writing, publishing, or selling books on the lines of the hand, or even on 
astrology-the position of the stars at birth and the rules upon which 
astrologers proceed in telling fortunes therefrom. I say that I have never heard 
of publishing, or selling such books is an offence, or that reading such books, 
and telling fortunes therefrom is an offence. Roguery and knavery might be 
committed that way. but it would be a special case. I am not in any way 
suggesting that a spae wife or anyone else may not through that means commit 
knavery and deception, and so be liable to punishment.&quot;</P>
<P>It would thus appear that <I>fortune-telling </I>is of itself no offence, 
unless it is accompanied by fraud impositions, or intent to deceive. While it 
might be an offence for the palmist or fortune-teller knowingly to accept 
payment from a half witted or obviously apparent ignorant person, it can hardly 
be pretended that the ordinary person who consults a professional fortune teller 
or chrystal gazer and tenders payment in return for their skill at delineations 
of character or forecasting of the future, feels that he has been imposed upon 
should the delineations be at fault, or the forecast turn Out inaccurate.

<P>Fountain Spirits of Behmen :</B> According to Jacob Behmen, there were in 
nature seven active principles, the &quot; <I>Fountain Spirits, </I>or &quot; 
Mothers of Existence.&quot; These were-the astringent quality; the sweet quality 
; the bitter quality the quality of fire; the quality of love ; the quality of 
sound ; and the quality of essential substance. The reciprocal action of these 
antipathetic qualities resulted in Supreme Unity. Each is at once the parent and 
the child of all the rest, for they generate and are generated by each other. 
They are typified by the seven golden candlesticks of the Apocalypse.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Fourth Dimension of Space :</B> There are three known dimensions in space 
typified in the three geometric figures-a line, having length, a surface, length 
and breadth, a cube, length, breadth and thickness. It has been conjectured that 
a <I>fourth dimension </I>may exist in addition to length, breadth, and 
thickness. Spiritualists have claimed to find proof of a <I>fourth dimension 
</I>in certain of the physical phenomena of the seance-room such as the tying of 
knots in endless cords, and the passage of matter through matter.</P>

<P>France :</B> Magical practice in pre-Roman <I>France </I>was vested in the 
druidic cast, and was practically identical with that of the same body in 
Britain, from which, indeed, it drew its inspiration. It is not likely that 
Roman magic gained any footing in Gaul, but we have little evidence to show 
whether this was or was not the case. In the early Frankish period of the 
Merovingian dynasty, we find the baleful personality of Fredegonda, wife of 
Hilperic, king of Soissons, &quot; a woman whose glance was witchcraft.&quot; 
She destroyed many people on the pretext of sorcery, but there is no doubt that 
she herself experimented in black magic, and protected many practitioners of the 
art. Thus she saved a sorceress who had been arrested by Ageric, bishop of 
Verdun, by hiding her in the palace. <I>(See </I>Fredegonda.) The practice of 
magic was not punished under the rule of the early French kings, except in those 
in high places, with whom it was regarded as a political offence, as in the case 
of the military leader Mummol, who was tortured by command of Hilperic for 
sorcery. One of the Salic laws attributed to Pharamond by Sigebert states that; 
If any one shall testify that another has acted as <I>hireburge </I>or 
<I>strioporte-titles </I>applied to those who carry the copper vessel to the 
spot where the vampires perform their enchantments-and if he fail to convict 
him, he shall be condemned hereby to a forfeit of <B>7</B>,<B>500</B> 
<I>deniers, </I>being <B>180</B> &frac12; sous. . . . If a vampire shall devour 
a man and be found guilty, she shall forfeit <B>8</B>,<B>000</B> <I>deniers,

<P>The Church legislated also against sorcerers and vampires, and the Council of 
Agde, in Languedoc, held in A.D, <B>506</B>, pronounced excommunication against 
them. The first Council of Orleans, convened in <B>541</B>, condemned divination 
and augury, and that of Narbonne, in <B>589</B>, besides excommunicating all 
sorcerers, ordained that they should be sold as slaves for the benefit of the 
poor. Those who had dealings with the Devil were also condemned to be whipped by 
the same Council. Some extraordinary phenomena are alleged to have occurred in 
<I>France </I>during the reign of Pepin le Bref. The air seemed to be alive with 
human shapes, mirages filled the heavens, and sorcerers were seen among the 
clouds, scattering unwholesome powders and poisons with open hands ; crops 
failed, cattle died, and many human beings perished. It is perhaps possible that 
such visions were stimulated by the teachings of the famous Kabalist, Zedekias, 
who presided over a school of occult science, where he refrained indeed from 
unveiling the hidden secrets of his art, and contented himself by spreading the 
theory of elemental spirits, who, he stated, bad before the fall of man been 
subservient to him.</P>
<P>It was thought that the visions alluded to above signified the descent of 
sylphs and salamanders in search of their former masters. Says Eliphas Levi:</P>
<P>&quot;Voyages to the land of sylphs were talked of on all sides as we talk at 
the present day of animated tables and fluidic manifestations. The folly took 
possession even of strong minds, and it was time for an intervention on the part 
of the Church, which does not relish the supernatural being hawked in the public 
streets, seeing that such disclosures, by imperilling the respect due to 
authority and to the hierarchic chain of instruction, cannot be attributed to 
the spirit of order and light. The cloud-phantoms were therefore arraigned and 
accused of being hell-born illusions, while the people-anxious to get something 
into their hands-began a crusade against sorcerers. The public folly turned into 
a paroxysm of mania strangers in country places were accused of descending from 
heaven and were killed without mercy; imbeciles confessed that they had been 
abducted by sylphs or demons ; others who had boasted like this previously 
either would not or could not unsay it; they were burned or drowned, and, 
according to Gannet, the number who perished throughout the kingdom almost 
exceeds belief. It is the common catastrophe of dramas in which the first parts 
are played by ignorance or fear.</P>
<P>&quot;Such visionary epidemics recurred in the reigns following, and all the 
power of Charlemagne was put in action to calm the public agitation. An edict, 
afterwards renewed by Louis the Pious, forbade sylphs to manifest under the 
heaviest penalties. It will be understood that in the absence of the aerial 
beings the judgments fell upon those who had made a boast of having seen them, 
and hence they ceased to be seen. The ships in air sailed back to the port of 
oblivion, and no one claimed any longer to have journeyed through the blue 
distance. Other popular frenzies replaced the previous mania, while the romantic 
splendours of the great reign of Charlemagne furnished the makers of legends 
with new prodigies to believe and new marvels to relate.&quot;</P>
<P>Around the figure of Charlemagne (q.v.) clusters such an immense amount of 
the matter of faery that it is reserved for treatment in a special article, and 
it will suffice to state here that it almost partakes of the nature of true 
myth. It is stated that the <I>Enchiridion </I>(q.v.) (which may well be 
stigmatised as an early text-book of occult absurdity having no claim to figure 
in the true genealogy of occult literature) was presented to Charlemagne by Pope 
Leo III.</P>
<P>Eliphas Levi presents a picturesque condition of affairs in the <I>France 
</I>of Charlemagne in the following passage:- </P>
<P>&quot;We know that superstitions die hard and that degenerated Druidism had 
struck its roots deeply in the savage lands of the North. The recurring 
insurrections of Saxons testified to a fanaticism which was (a) always 
turbulent, and (b) incapable of repression by moral force alone. All defeated 
forms of worship-Roman paganism, Germanic idolatry, Jewish rancour conspired 
against victorious Christianity. Nocturnal assemblies took place thereat the 
conspirators cemented their alliance with the blood of human victims; and a 
pantheistic idol of monstrous form, with the horns of a goat, presided over 
festivals which might be called <I>agapae </I>of hatred. In a word, the Sabbath 
was still celebrated in every forest and wild if yet </P>
<P>unreclaimed provinces. The adepts who attended them were masked and otherwise 
unrecognisable; the assemblies extinguished their lights and broke up before 
daybreak, the guilty were to be found everywhere, and they could be brought to 
book nowhere. It came about therefore that Charlemagne determined to fight them 
with their own weapons.</P>
<P>&quot;In those days, moreover, feudal tyrants were in league with sectarians 
against lawful authority ; female sorcerers were attached to castles as 
courtesans; bandits who frequented the Sabbaths divided with nobles the 
blood-stained loot of rapine ; feudal courts were at the command of the highest 
bidder; and the public burdens weighed with all their force only on the weak and 
poor. The evil was at its height in Westphalia, and faithful agents were 
despatched thither by Charlemagne entrusted with a secret mission. Whatsoever 
energy remained among the oppressed, whosoever still loved justice, whether 
among the people or among the nobility, were drawn by these emissaries together, 
bound by pledges and vigilance in common. To the initiates thus incorporated 
they made known the full powers which they carried from the emperor himself, and 
they proceeded to institute the Tribunal of Free Judges.</P>
<P>A great deal of this, of course, is only what might be expected from the 
French magus. It is not likely that the Sabbath was yet celebrated in such an 
extreme manner as in later times, nor was the Vehmgericht founded by 
Charlemagne. or indeed, founded at all, for four and a half centuries after his 
day.</P>
<P>From the reign of Robert the Pious to that of St. Louis, there is not much to 
relate that can strike the imagination of the student of occult history. In the 
time of the latter monarch flourished the famous Rabbi Jachiel, the celebrated 
Kabalist. There is some reason to believe that be had glimmerings of the uses of 
electricity, for on the approach of night a radiant star appeared in his 
lodging, the light being so brilliant that no eye could gaze thereon without 
being dazzled, while it darted rainbow colours. It appeared to be inexhaustible, 
and was never replenished with oil or other combustible substance. When the 
Rabbi was annoyed by intruders at his door he struck a nail fixed in his 
cabinet, producing simultaneously a blue spark on the head of the nail and the 
door-knocker, to which, if the intruder clung, he received a severe shock. 
Albertus Magnus (q.v.) lived at the same period.</P>
<P>The next circumstance of interest which falls to be noted is the prosecutions 
of the Templars (q.v.) who were brought to trial by Philip the Fair. Other 
prosecutions for sorcery were those of Joan of Arc, Gilles de Laval (q.v.), lord 
of Raiz, the prototype of Bluebeard, a renowned sorcerer, who with two 
assistants, Prelati and Sille, practised diabolical rites at his castle of 
Machecoul, celebrating the black mass in the most revolting manner. He had been 
in the habit of slaughtering children to assist him in his search for the 
philosopher's stone. We now near the period of those astounding prosecutions for 
sorcery which are fully noted under the article &quot; Witchcraft&quot; and 
elsewhere. As early as the thirteenth century the charge of sorcery had been 
made as one of the means of branding with infamy the heretical Waldenses (q.v.), 
who were accused of selling themselves to the Devil, and of holding sabbatical 
orgies where they did homage to the enemy of mankind. About the middle of the 
fifteenth century <I>France </I>became the theatre of wholesale oppression 
against suspected sorcerers, but one finds leading up to this a series of events 
which prove that the outburst in question was by no means a novelty in that 
country. In <B>13 1 5</B> Enguerraud de Marigny, who had conducted the execution 
of the Templars a minister of Philip the Fair, was hanged along with an 
adventurer named Paviot, for attempting to compass the deaths of the Counts of 
Valois and St. Paul. In <B>1134</B> the Countess of Artois and her son were 
thrown into prison on a suspicion of sorcery. In <B>1393</B>, in the reign of 
Charles VI., it was considered that his sister-in-law, the Duchess of Orleans, 
who was a viscomte and the daughter of the Duke of Milan, had rendered the King 
mad by sorcery. The ministers of the court resolved to pit a magician against 
her, and one Arnaud Guillaume (q.v.) was brought from Guienne as a suitable 
adversary to the noble lady. He possessed a book to which he gave the strange 
title of <I>Smagorad, </I>the original of which, he said, was given by God to 
Adam, to console him for the loss of his son Abel, and he asserted that the 
possessor of this volume would hold the stars in subjection, and command the 
four elements. He assured the King's advisers that Charles was suffering from 
the malignity of a sorcerer, but in the meantime the young monarch recovered, 
and the possessor of the patriarchal volume fell back into his original 
obscurity. Five years later the King had another attack, and two Augustine 
friars were sent from Guienne for the purpose of effecting a cure. But their 
conduct was so outrageous that they were executed. A third attack in <B>1403</B> 
was combated by two sorcerers of Dijon, Poinson and Briquet. For this purpose 
they established themselves in a thick wood not far from the gates of Dijon, 
where they made a magic circle of iron of immense weight, which was supported by 
iron columns of the height of a middle-sized man, and to which twelve chains of 
iron were attached. So great was the popular anxiety for the King's recovery, 
that the two sorcerers succeeded in persuading twelve of the principal persons 
of the town to enter the circle, and allow themselves to be fastened by the 
chains. The sorcerers then proceeded with their incantations, but they were 
altogether without result. The bailiff of Dijon, who was one of the twelve, and 
had averred his incredulity from the first, caused the sorcerers to be arrested, 
and they were burnt for their pretences.</P>
<P>The Duke of Orleans appears to have fallen under the same suspicion of 
sorcery as his Italian consort. After his murder by order of the Duke of 
Burgundy-the commencement of those troubles which led to the desolation of 
<I>France-the </I>latter drew up various heads of accusation against his victim 
as justifications of the crime, and one of these was, that the Duke of Orleans 
had attempted to compass his death by means of sorcery. According to this 
statement, he had received a magician-another apostate friar- into his castle of 
Mountjoie, where he was employed in these sinister designs. He performed his 
magical ceremonies before sunrise on a neighbouring mountain, where two demons, 
named Herman and Astramon, appeared to him and these became his active 
instruments in the prosecution of his design.</P>
<P>About the year <B>1400</B> the belief in the nightly meetings of the witches' 
Sabbath had become almost universal. It would indeed be difficult to attempt to 
trace the origin of this practice, which does not seem altogether referable to 
the survival of pagan belief. <I>(See </I>Witchcraft.) The wholesale nature of 
the prosecutions against sorcerers and witches prove that there must have been 
an extraordinary number of them in the country. In Paris alone, in the time of 
Charles IX, there were no less than thirty thousand sorcerers, and it is 
computed that <I>France </I>contained more than three times that number in the 
reign of Henry III., not a town or village being exempt from their presence. 
They belonged to all classes, and generally met the same fate, regardless of 
rank, age or sex. Children of the tenderest years and nonagenarians were alike 
committed to the flames, and the terror of being publicly accused as a sorcerer 
hung like a black cloud over the life of every successful man, as the charge was 
one which envy readily seized upon for the destruction of its object. No 
elaborate or perfect creed regarding witchcraft had at this epoch been evolved 
in England, but in <I>France </I>and other continental countries it had been 
assuming a form systematic and complete. There were probably two reasons for 
this, the decrees of ecclesiastical councils and the numerous treatises of 
scholars who professed to illustrate their various theories regarding sorcery by 
alleged statements from the mouths of its innumerable victims. Indeed the 
writings of these men served to standardise the sorcery creed of all continental 
countries. During the earlier part of the sixteenth century, trials for 
witchcraft in <I>France </I>are of rare occurrence, and there are no cases of 
great importance recorded till after the year <B>1560</B>. In <B>1561</B> a 
number of persons were brought to trial at Vernon, accused of having held their 
Sabbath as witches in an old ruined castle in the shape of cats; and witnesses 
deposed to having seen the assembly, and to having suffered from the attacks of 
the pseudo-feline conspirators. But the court threw out the charge. as worthy 
only of ridicule. In <B>1564</B>, three men and a woman were executed at 
Poitiers, after having been made to confess to various acts of sorcery; among 
other things, they said that they had regularly attended the witches' Sabbath, 
which was held three times a year, and that the demon who presided at it ended 
by burning himself to make powder for the use of his agents in mischief. In 
<B>1571</B>, a mere conjurer, who played tricks upon cards, was thrown into 
prison in Paris, forced to confess that he was an attendant on the Sabbath, and 
then executed. In <B>1573</B>, a man was burnt at Drole, on the charge of having 
changed himself into a wolf, and in that form devoured several children. Several 
witches, who all confessed to having been at the Sabbaths, were in the same year 
condemned to be burnt in different parts of <I>France. </I>In <B>1578</B>, 
another man was tried and condemned in Paris for changing himself into a wolf; 
and a man was condemned at Orleans for the same supposed crime in <B>1583</B>. 
As <I>France </I>was often infested by these rapacious animals, it is not 
difficult to conceive how popular credulity was led to connect their ravages 
with the crime of witchcraft. The belief in what were in England called 
<I>wer-wolves </I>(men-wolves), and hi <I>France loups-garous, </I>was a very 
ancient superstition throughout Europe. It is asserted by a serious and 
intelligent writer of the time that, in <B>1588</B>, a gentleman, looking out of 
the window of his chateau in a village two leagues from Apchon, in the mountains 
of Auvergne, saw one of his acquaintances going a-hunting, and begged he would 
bring him home some game. The hunter, while occupied in the chase, was attacked 
by a fierce she-wolf, and after having fired at it without effect, struck it 
with his hunting-knife, and cut off the paw of his right fore-leg, on which it 
immediately took to flight. The hunter took up the paw, threw it into his bag 
with the rest of his game, and soon afterwards returned to his friend's chateau, 
and told him of his adventure, at the same time putting his hand into the bag to 
bring forth the wolf's paw in confirmation of his story. What was his surprise 
at drawing out a lady's hand, with a gold ring on one finger His friend's 
astonishment was still greater when he recognised the ring as one which he had 
given to his own wife; and, descending hastily into the kitchen, he found the 
lady warming herself by the fire, with her right arm wrapped in her apron. This 
he at once seized, and found to his horror that the hand was cut off. The lady 
confessed that it was she who, in the form of a wolf, had attacked the hunter; 
she was, in due course of time, brought to her trial and condemned, and was 
immediately afterwards burnt at Rioms.</P>
<P>In <B>1578</B>, a witch was burnt at Compiegne ; she confessed that she had 
given herself to the devil, who appeared to her as a great black man, on 
horseback, booted and spurred. Another avowed witch was burnt the same year, who 
also stated that the evil one came to her in the shape of a black man. In 
<B>1582</B> and <B>1583</B>, several witches were burnt, all frequenters of the 
Sabbaths. Several local councils at this date passed severe laws against 
witchcraft, and from that time to the end of the century, the number of 
miserable persons put to death in <I>France </I>under the accusation was very 
great. In the course only of fifteen years, from <B>1580</B> to <B>1595</B>, and 
only in one province, that of Lorraine, the president Remigius burnt nine 
hundred witches, and as many more fled out of the country to save their lives 
and about the close of the century, one of the French judges tells us that the 
crime of witchcraft had become so common that there were not jails enough to 
hold the prisoners, or judges to hear their causes. A trial which he had 
witnessed in <B>1568</B>, induced Jean Bodin, a learned physician, to compose 
his book <I>De la Demonomanie des Sorciers, </I>which was ever afterwards the 
text-book on this subject.</P>
<P>Among the English witches, the evil one generally came in person to seduce 
his victims, but in <I>France </I>and other countries, this seems to have been 
unnecessary, as each person, when once initiated, became seized with an 
uncontrollable desire of making converts, whom he or she carried to the Sabbath 
to be duly enrolled. Bodin says, that one witch was enough to corrupt five 
hundred honest persons. The infection quickly ran through a family, and was 
generally carried down from generation to generation, which explained 
satisfactorily, according to the learned commentator on demonology just 
mentioned, the extent to which the evil had spread itself in his days. The 
novice, at his or her reception, after having performed the preliminaries, and 
in general received a new and burlesque rite of baptism, was marked with the 
sign of the demon in some part of the body least exposed to observation, and 
performed the first criminal act of compliance which was afterwards to be so 
frequently repeated, the evil one presenting himself on these occasions in the 
form of either sex, the reverse to that of the victim.</P>
<P>Towards the end of the sixteenth century, the witchcraft infatuation had 
risen to its greatest height in <I>France, </I>and not only the lower classes, 
but persons of the highest rank in society were liable to suspicions of dealing 
in sorcery. We need only mention that such charges were publicly made against 
King Henry III. and Queen Catherine de Medicis, and that, early in the following 
century, they became the ground of state trials which had a fatal 
conclusion.</P>
<P>In <B>1610</B>, during the reign of Louis XIII., occurred the <I>cause 
celebre </I>of the marechale d'Ancre. Among the servants attached to the train 
of Marie de Medici was a certain Eleanora Don, who married one, Concini, a 
prodigal spendthrift. Marie de Medici, as guardian to her son, was virtually 
ruler of <I>France, </I>and considerable power was exercised by these favourites 
of hers. The result was that the peers of France leagued themselves together 
against the upstarts, but with little result at first, as Concini was created 
Marechal of <I>France, </I>with the title of Marquis d'Ancre. His wife, who was 
very superstitious, fell sick, and attributed her ill-health to the effects of 
sorcery. The upshot was that d'Ancre was assassinated by the nobles during a 
hunting expedition. The mob dragged the corpse of d'Ancre from its grave and 
hanged it on the Pont Neuf. His wretched widow was accused of sorcery, and of 
having bewitched the Queen Mother. The exorcists who had assisted her to free 
herself from illness had advised the sacrifice of a cock, and this was now 
represented as a sacrifice to the infernal powers. Added to this, the 
astrological nativities of the royal family were found in her possession, as 
were, it is said; a quantity of magical books, and a great number of magical 
characters. After being tortured with-Out result she was beheaded and burnt, and 
strangely enough the anger of the Parisian mob turned to general commiseration. 
Many other interesting cases occurred in <I>France </I>in the seventeenth 
century, among others that of the Ursulines at Aix (q.v.), for the enchantment 
of whom Louis Gaufridi was burnt, the Nuns of Louviais, and the auns of Assonne. 
The case of the Ursulines of Loudon (q.v.), is fully dealt with elsewhere. 
<I>(See </I>Urban Grandler). </P>
<P>The eighteenth century in <I>France </I>was fairly prolific in occult 
history. At a time when Europe was credulous about nothing but magic, <I>France 
</I>did not escape the prevailing craze. Perhaps the most striking personality 
of this age in the occult connection was the Comte de Saint Germain (q.v.), who 
was credited with possessing the secrets of alchemy and magic. His family 
connections were unknown, and his conversation suggested that he had lived for 
many centuries. Another mysterious adept was an alchemist calling himself 
Lascaris (q.v.) who literally sowed his path through Europe with gold. Then 
followed Cagliostro (q.v.), who attained a fame unrivalled in the history of 
French occultism. He founded many masonic lodges throughout the country, and 
assisted in many ways to bring about the French Revolution. A school of 
initiates was founded by Martines de Pasqually, which appears in some measure to 
have incorporated the teachings of the later European adepts. One of the most 
important figures at this time is Louis Claude de Saint-Martin, known as 
&quot;Le Philosophe Inconnu&quot; who came under the influence of Pasqually 
(q.v.), and later, under that of the writings of Boehme, whose works he 
translated. Cazotte (q.v.) was the first of these names who were associated with 
both magic and the Revolution, which, indeed, owed much in its inception to 
those mysterious brotherhoods of <I>France </I>and Germany, who during the 
eighteenth century sowed the seeds of equality and Illuminism throughout Europe. 
Another was Loiseaut (q.v.), who formed a mystical society, which met in great 
secrecy, awaiting a vision of John the Baptist, who came to them to foretell the 
Revolution. The spiritual director of this circle was a monk named Dom Gerle 
(q.v.) one of the first mesmerists in Paris, who is said to have foretold the 
dreadful fame of Robespierre by means of Catherine Theot, his medium. He was 
expelled by the members of the circle, acting on the advice of one of their 
number, Sister Francoise Andre, who cherished a notion to preserve the crown for 
the future reign of Louis XVII., and thus gave rise to that multitude of stories 
connected with the so-called &quot;Saviours&quot; of the youthful&quot; 
Capet.&quot; This sect, or a portion of it, became notorious under the 
leadership of Vintras (q.v.), when its meetings degenerated into the most 
dreadful debauchery. The appearance of Mlle. Lenormand as a prophetess at the 
end of the eighteenth century may be said to close the occult history of that 
age. With the beginning of the nineteenth century we find the craze for 
magnetism rampant. In his works <I>The Reform of Philosophy </I>and <I>Yes or 
No, </I>Wronski pretended to have discovered the first theorems of the Kabala, 
and later beguiled rich persons of weak intellect into paying him large sums in 
return for knowledge of the Absolute. The Saviours of Louis XVII. were formally 
condemned in <B>1853</B> by the Pope as practitioners of black magic, but they 
in turn condemned the Pope, and their leader, Vintras, constituted himself 
Sovereign Pontiff, but he was arrested on the charge of roguery and after five 
years' imprisonment, found an asylum in England.</P>
<P>The Baron du Potet did much to advance the science of Mesmer and by this time 
was being seriously followed by Cahagnet and others <I>(See </I>Mesmerism). In 
the middle of the nineteenth century all sorts of absurdities swayed occult 
Paris. The tale of Alphonse Esquiros (q.v.) entitled <I>The Magician </I>founded 
a school of magic phantasy, which was assiduously nursed by Henri Delaage 
(q.v.), who was said to have the gift of ubiquity, and who made a collection of 
processes from the old magicians for acquiring physical beauty.</P><I>
<P>Spiritualism. </I>The Comte d'Ourches was the first to introduce into 
<I>France </I>automatic writing and table-writing. Baron Guldenstubbe, in his 
<I>Practical Experimental Pneumatology or, the Reality of Spirits and the 
Marvellous Phenomena of their Direct Writing, </I>gives an account of his 
discovery as follows:</P>
<P>&quot;It was in the course of the year <B>1850</B>, or about three years 
prior to the epidemic of table-rapping, that the author sought to introduce into 
<I>France </I>the circles of American spiritualism, the mysterious Rochester 
knockings and the purely automatic writings of mediums. Unfortunately he met 
with many obstacles raised by other mesmerists. Those who were committed to the 
hypothesis of a magnetic fluid, and even those who styled themselves Spiritual 
Mesmerists, but who were really inferior inducers of somnambulism, treated the 
mysterious knockings of American spiritualism as visionary follies. It was 
therefore only after more than six months that the author was able to form his 
first circle on the American plan, and then thanks to the zealous concurrence of 
M. Rousaan, a former member of the <I>Societe des Magnetiseurs Spiritualistes, 
</I>a simple man who was full of enthusiasm for the holy cause of spiritualism. 
We were joined by a number of other persons, amongst whom was the Abbe Chatel, 
founder of the Eglise Francaise, who, despite his rationalistic tendencies, 
ended by admitting the reality of objective and supernatural revelation, as an 
indispensable condition of spiritualism and all practical religions. Setting 
aside the moral conditions which are equally requisite, it is known that 
American circles are based on the distinction of positive and electric or 
negative magnetic currents.</P>
<P>&quot;The circles consist of twelve persons, representing in equal 
proportions the positive and negative or sensitive elements. This distinction 
does not follow the sex of the members, though generally women are negative and 
sensitive, while men are positive and magnetic. The mental and physical 
constitution of each individual must be studied before forming the circles, for 
some delicate women have masculine qualities, while some strong men are, morally 
speaking, women. A table is placed in a clear and ventilated spot the medium is 
seated at one end and entirely isolated; by his calm and contemplative quietude 
he serves as a conductor for the electricity, and it may be noted that a good 
somnambulist is usually an excellent medium. The six electrical or negative 
dispositions, which are generally recognised by their emotional qualities and 
their sensibilty, are placed at the right of the medium, the most sensitive of 
all being next him. The same role is followed with the positive personalities, 
who are at the left of the medium, with the most positive next to him. In order 
to form a chain, the twelve persons each place their right hand on the table. 
Observe that the medium or mediums, if there be more than one, are entirely 
isolated from those who form the chain.</P>
<P>&quot;After a number of seances, certain remarkable phenomena have been 
obtained, such as simultaneous shocks, felt by all present at the moment of 
mental evocation on the part of the most intelligent persons. It is the same 
with mysterious knockings and other strange sounds many people, including those 
least sensitive, have had simultaneous visions, though remaining in the ordinary 
waking state. Sensitive persons have acquired that most wonderful gift of 
mediumship, namely, automatic writing, as the result of an invisible attraction 
which uses the non-intelligent instrument of a human arm to express its ideas. 
For the rest, non-sensitive persons experience the mysterious influence of an 
external wind, but the effect is not strong enough to put their limbs in motion. 
All these phenomena, obtained according to the mode of American spiritualism, 
have the defect of being more or less indirect, because it is impossible in 
these experiments to dispense with the mediation of a human being or medium. It 
is the same with the table-turning which invaded Europe in the middle of the 
year <B>1853</B>.</P>
<P>&quot;The author has had many table experiences with his honourable friend, 
the Comte d'Ourches, one of the most instructed persons in Magic and the Occult 
Sciences. We attained by degrees the point when tables moved, apart from any 
contact whatever, while the Comte d'Ourches has caused them to rise, also 
without contact. The author has made tables rush across a room with great 
rapidity, and not only without contact but without the magnetic aid of a circle 
of sitters. The vibrations of piano-chords under similar circumstances took 
place on January <B>20</B>, <B>1856</B>, in the presence of the Comte de Szapary 
and Comte d'Ourches. Now all such phenomena are proof positive of certain occult 
forces, but they do not demonstrate adequately the real and substantial 
existence of unseen intelligences, independent of our will and imagination, 
though the limits of these have been vastly extended in respect of their 
possibilities. Hence the reproach made against American spiritualists, because 
their communications with the world of spirits are so insignificant in 
character, being confined to mysterious knockings and other sound vibrations. As 
a fact, there is no direct phenomenon at once intelligent and material, 
independent of our will and imagination, to compare with the direct writing of 
spirits, who have neither been invoked or evoked, and it is this only which 
offers irrefutable proof as to the reality of the supernatural world.</P>
<P>&quot;The author, being always in search of such proof at once intelligent 
and palpable, concerning the substantial reality of the supernatural world, in 
order to demonstrate by certain facts the immortality of the soul, has never 
wearied of addressing fervent prayers to the Eternal, that He might vouchsafe to 
indicate an infallible means for strengthening that faith in immortality which 
is the eternal basis of religion. The Eternal, Whose mercy is infinite, has 
abundantly answered this feeble prayer. On August <B>1</B>st, <B>1856</B>, the 
idea came to the author of trying whether spirits could write directly, that is, 
apart from the presence of a medium. Remembering the marvellous direct writing 
of the Decalogue, communicated to Moses, and that other writing, equally direct 
and mysterious, at the feast of Belshazzar, recorded by Daniel ; having further 
heard about those modern mysteries of Stratford in America, where certain 
strange and illegible characters were found upon strips of paper, apparently 
apart from mediumship, the author sought to establish the actuality of such 
important phenomena, if indeed within the limits of possibility.</P>
<P>&quot;He therefore placed a sheet of blank letter paper and a sharply pointed 
pencil in a box, which he then locked, and carried the key about him, imparting 
his design to no one. Twelve days he waited in vain, but what was his 
astonishment on August <B>13</B>th, <B>1856</B>. when he found certain 
mysterious characters traced on the paper. He repeated the experiment ten times 
on that day, placing a new sheet of paper each time in the box, with the same 
result invariably. On the following day he made twenty experiments but left the 
box open, without losing sight of it. He witnessed the formation of characters 
and words in the Esthonian language with no motion of the pencil. The latter 
being obviously useless he decided to dispense with it and placed blank paper 
sometimes on a table of his own, sometimes on the pedestals of old statues, on 
sarcophagi, on urns, etc., in the Louvre, at St. Denis, at the Church of St. 
Etienne du Mont, etc., Similar experiments were made in different cemetries of 
Paris, but the author has no liking for cemetries, while most saints prefer the 
localities where they have lived on earth to those in which their mortal remains 
are laid to rest.&quot;</P>
<P>We are now launched upon the sea of modern spiritualism in <I>France, 
</I>which occupied the entire activities of occultists in that country for 
several decades, and which it will be better to trace from the period of its 
importation into the country.</P>
<P>Very soon after public attention had been drawn to the subject of magnetism 
in <I>France </I>by Mesmer and d'Eslon, several men distinguished for learning 
and scientific attainments, followed up their experiments with great success. 
Amongst these was the Baron Dupotet, whose deep interest in the subject of 
magnetism induced him to publish a periodical which, under the title of 
<I>Journal de Magnitisme-</I>still forms a complete treasury of well collated 
facts, and curious experiments in occult force. From this work we learn that the 
Baron's investigations commenced in the year <B>1836</B>, since which period up 
to <B>1848</B>, he chronicled the production of the following remarkable phases 
of phenomena, the occurrence of which is testified to by numerous scientific and 
eminent witnesses. Through the Baron's magnetized subjects was evolved, 
clairvoyance, trance-speaking, and healing ; <I>stigmata </I>or raised letters 
and figures on the subject's body; elevation of somnambulists into the air ; 
insensibility to fire, injury or touch. In the presence of the magnetized 
objects also, heavy bodies were moved without human contact, and objects were 
brought from distant places through walls and closed doors. Sometimes the 
Lucides &quot; described scenes in the spirit world, found lost property, 
prophesied and spoke in foreign languages.</P>
<P>In <B>1840</B>, Baron Dupotet writes that he had 'rediscovered in magnetism 
the magic of antiquity.&quot; &quot; Let the <I>savants,&quot; </I>he says, 
&quot; reject the doctrine of spiritual appearances the enquirer of to-day is 
compelled to believe it ; from an examination of undeniable facts.&quot; If the 
knowledge of ancient magic is lost, all the facts remain on which to reconstruct 
it.&quot;</P>
<P>But of all the revealers to whom French Spiritualism is indebted for 
indubitable proof of super-mundane intercourse, none stands more prominent in 
truthfulness and worth, than M. Cahagnet, the well-known author of <I>'The 
Celestial Telegraph,&quot; </I>a work translated into English in 
<B>1848</B>.</P>
<P>M. Cahagnet was an unlearned mechanic, a man of the people and though a 
sensible and interesting writer, was neither well read, nor highly educated. He 
affirms that he was a materialist &quot; when first his attention was attracted 
to the subject of animal magnetism, but being of a thoughtful nature, he 
determined to devote all the leisure he could spare to a thorough examination of 
its possibilities. When he found that he possessed the power to induce the 
magnetic sleep in others, he proceeded on the plan then generally adopted by 
mesmerists, namely, to try how far he could succeed in biologizing his subjects, 
that is to say, to substitute his own senses, mind, and will, for those of the 
sleeper.</P>
<P>In the course of these experiments M. Cahagnet discovered that he could 
effect remarkable cures of disease, and being naturally of a benevolent 
disposition, he determined to bend all his energies in this desirable direction. 
He soon found, however, that he was destined to realize the aphorism, &quot;he 
builded wiser than he knew.&quot; A new and most perplexing obstacle arose to 
confound his philosophy and scatter his theories to the winds; this was the 
fact, that some of his subjects, instead of representing what simply he willed, 
or manifesting-in accordance with his views of biology-merely the influence of 
his mind, began to transcend both will and mind, and wander off in space, to 
regions they persisted in calling the land of spirits,&quot; and to describe 
people, whom they emphatically affirmed to be the souls of those whom the world 
called dead.</P>
<P>For a long time M. Cahagnet strove vehemently to combat what he termed these 
&quot;wild hallucinations,&quot; but when he found them constantly recurring, 
and vast numbers of those who had come to witness the experiments in magnetism 
recognising in the descriptions given by the somnambulists the spirits of those 
whom they had known on earth, and mourned as dead, conviction became inevitable, 
and the magnetizer, like his visitors, was compelled to admit a new and 
wonderful phase of lucidity, and one which carried the vision of the clairvoyant 
from earth to heaven, and pierced the veil which separated the mortal from the 
realms of immortality. It was after a long series of carefully conducted 
experiments of the above description, that M. Cahagnet was finally persuaded to 
give the results of his wonderful seances to the world, under the name and style 
of <I>The Celestial Telegraph, </I>or, <I>Secrets of the Life to Come.</I></P>
<P>The author of <I>Art Magic </I>says: &quot; The narrow conservatism of the 
age, and the pitiful jealousy of the Medical Faculty, rendered it difficult and 
harassing to conduct magnetic experiments openly in Europe within several years 
of Mesmer's decease. Still such experiments were not wanting, and to show their 
results, we give a few excerpts from the correspondence between the famous 
French Magnetists, MM. Deleuze and Billot, from the years <B>1829</B> to 
<B>1840</B>. By these letters, published in <B>1836</B>, it appears that M. 
Billot commenced his experiments in magnetizing as early as <B>1789</B>, and 
that during forty years, he had an opportunity of witnessing facts in 
clairvoyance, ecstasy, and somnambulism, which at the time of their publication 
transcended the belief of the general mass of readers. On many occasions in the 
presence of entranced subjects, spirits recognised as having once lived on earth 
in mortal form-would come <I>in bodily presence </I>before the eyes of an 
assembled multitude and at request bring flowers, fruits, and objects, removed 
by distance from the scene of the experiments.</P>
<P>&quot;M. Deleuze frankly admits that his experience was more limited to those 
phases of somnambulism in which his subjects submitted to amputations and severe 
surgical operations without experiencing the slightest pain. In a letter dated 
<B>1831</B> M. Billot writing to Deleuze says: -</P>
<P>&quot;&rsquo;I repeat, I have seen and known all that is permitted to man. I 
have seen the stigmata arise on magnetized subjects ; I have dispelled 
obsessions of evil spirits with a single word. I have seen spirits bring those 
material objects I told you of, and when requested. make them so light that they 
would float, and, again, a small <I>boiteau de bonbons </I>was rendered so heavy 
that I failed to move it an inch until the power was removed.</P>
<P>&quot;&rsquo;To those who enjoyed the unspeakable privilege of listening to 
the somnambules&quot; of Billot, Deleuze, and Cahagnet, another and yet more 
striking feature of unanimous revelation was poured forth. Spirits of those who 
had passed away from earth strong in the faith of Roman Catholicism-often 
priests and dignitaries of that conservative Church, addressing prejudiced 
believers in their former doctrine, asserted that there was no creed in 
Heaven-no sectarian worship, or ecclesiastical dogmatism there prevailing.</P>
<P>&quot;&rsquo;They taught that God was a grand Spiritual Sun-life on earth a 
probation-the spheres, different degrees of comprehensive happiness or states of 
retributive suffering-each appropriate to the good or evil deeds done on earth. 
They described the ascending changes open to every soul in proportion to his own 
efforts to improve.</P>
<P>&quot;&rsquo;They all insisted that man was his own judge, incurred a penalty 
or reward for which there was no substitution. They taught nothing of Christ, 
absolutely denied the idea of vicarious atonement-and represented man as his own 
Saviour or destroyer.</P>
<P>&quot;&rsquo;They spoke of arts, sciences, and continued activities, as if 
the life beyond was but an extension of the present on a greatly improved scale. 
Descriptions of the radiant beauty, supernal happiness, and ecstatic sublimity 
manifested by the blest spirits who had risen to the spheres of Paradise, 
Heaven, and the glory of angelic companionships melts the heart, and fills the 
soul with irresistible yearning, to lay down life's weary burdens and be at rest 
with them.'</P>
<P>Having shown that Spiritualism arose in <I>France </I>as in Germany from the 
awakening of psychic powers evolved by magnetism, and traced the footprints of 
the great temple builders who have laid the foundation stones of the spiritual 
edifice in the human system and steadily worked upwards from matter to force, 
and from thence to spirit in every gradation of sphere, life and progress, we 
recall the pithy words of the Baron de Potet, who, in addressing the would-be 
leaders of public opinion in his essay on the Philosophical Teaching of 
Magnetism,&quot; says:</P>
<P>&quot;You <I>savants </I>of our country; you have not shown yourselves better 
informed than the Siamese.</P>
<P>&quot;For these sixty years it has been shouted in your ears:</P><I>
<P>The Magnetisers march to the discovery of a moral wand; </I>all the phenomena 
they produce indisputably proves its existence.</P>
<P>&quot;You have declared that they were impostors, imbeciles, and the most 
illustrious amongst you have only pronounced a verdict which will attest to 
future ages your ignorance or, your insincerity.</P>
<P>&quot;Before the soul is disengaged from matter, it can, and does, converse 
with pure spirits. Already it can gaze prophetically on its own future destiny, 
by regarding the condition of those who have gone before - but a step - yet one 
which the eye of spirit alone can measure, and if men are spirits already, who 
can stay the eagle glance of the soul into the land of its own inheritance ?</P>
<P>In following up the history of Spiritualism in <I>France, </I>although we 
find it has gained an immense foothold, and exerted a wide-spread influence upon 
the popular mind, it is nevertheless evident, that one of the chief obstacles to 
its general acceptance has been its lack of internal unity, and the antagonistic 
sentiments which have prevailed amongst its acknowledged leaders.</P>
<P>Two of those who have figured most prominently in the grand drama of French 
Spiritualism, and in all probability exerted more influence upon public opinion 
than any other members of its <I>dramatis personae, </I>were MM. Allan Kardec 
and Pierart, the respective editors of the two leading Spiritual journals, 
entitled <I>La Revue Spirite </I>and <I>La Revue Spiritualiste. </I>These may 
also be regarded as the representatives of the two opposing factions known as 
Spiritualists and Spiritists, the former teaching that the soul of man undergoes 
but one mortal birth, and continues its progress through eternity in spiritual 
states, the latter affirming the doctrine of lie-incarnation, and alleging that 
the one spirit in man can and does undergo many incarnations in different mortal 
forms.</P>
<P>M. Kardec and his followers represented the &quot;Spiritists&quot; or 
Reincarnationists-M. Pierart leading the ranks of the opposing faction most 
commonly called Spiritualists.</P>
<P>In respect to the question of testimony, it must be remembered that M. Kardec 
derived his communications chiefly from those writing and trance mediums who 
might have proved the most susceptible to his influence, and is said to have 
persistently banished from his circles, not only Mr. Home, M. Bredif and other 
physical mediums, but all those who did not endorse his favourite dogma through 
their communications.</P>
<P>Says the author of <I>Nineteenth Century Miracles: </I>It must not be 
supposed that the schism which divided the two leaders of French Spiritualism 
was confined to the immediate sphere of action in which they moved. Scattered 
sympathisers with the writings of Allan Kardec, may be found all over the 
Continent of Europe, and in small numbers in America also. Few people who read 
works put forward with authoritative pretentions have the faculty of thoroughly 
digesting what they read, hence, when M. Kardec's books were translated into the 
English language, and it became the publisher's interest to aid in their 
circulation, they found more readers than thinkers, and their plausible style 
attracted more admiration than sincere conviction. In <I>France, </I>no doubt M. 
Kardec's personal influence, and strong psychological power, admirably fitted 
him for a propagandist, and when we remember how readily any doctrines 
eloquently advocated will command adherents, especially among restless and 
excitable natures, we need be at no <B>1055</B> to discover why M. Kardec's 
writings have become so popular and his opinions so generally accepted by his 
readers. Little or no spiritual literature was disseminated in the French 
language when Allan Kardec's works were first published. He possessed that 
indomitable energy and psychological influence in which his much harassed rival 
Pierart was wanting. Thus in a measure, the field of Continental spiritual 
propagandism was his own, nor did he fail to make use of his opportunities.</P>
<P>&quot;The successes achieved by Kardec's journal, <I>La Revue Spirite, 
</I>communicated a wave of influence also, which propagated journals of a 
similar character all over the country. Thus in <B>1864</B>, there were no less 
than ten spiritualistic periodicals published in <I>France, </I>under the 
following titles : <I>La Revue Spirite, La Revue Spiritualiste, </I>and 
<I>L'Avenir, </I>Paris; four <I>Spiritist </I>journals published in Bordeaux, 
which, in <B>1865</B>, became merged into <I>L' Union Spirite Bordelalse; La 
Medium Evangelique, </I>Toulouse <I>; L'Echo d'autre Tombe, </I>Marseilles; and 
<I>La Verite, </I>Lyons. The editors of these journals are said to have been all 
followers of Allan Kardec, with the exception of M. Pierart, editor of <I>La 
Revue Spiritualiste.&quot;</I></P>
<P>It must be remarked that the doctrines of the Re-incarnationists, although 
defended with great ability by their propagandists, who included many of the 
most capable minds of France, were not suffered to pass without severe 
castigation on the part of their English neighbours; and it becomes necessary to 
note how the French spiritual schism was received on the other side of the 
Channel. In the <I>London Spiritual Magazine </I>of <B>1865</B>, the editor, in 
commenting on the ominous silence of the <I>Spirite </I>journals concerning Dr. 
Maldigny's opera of Swedenborg says :-</P>
<P>&quot;It is worthy of note that the journals of the Kardec school, so far as 
we have seen them, do not take the least notice of this opera. The <I>Avenir 
</I>of Paris, which appears weekly, but greatly wants facts, has not a word to 
say about it. It is greatly to be regretted that the main object of the 
Kardecian journals seems to be, not the demonstration of the constantly 
recurring facts of Spiritualism, but the deification of Kardec's doctrine of 
Re-incarnation.</P>
<P>&quot;To this doctrine - which has nothing to do with Spiritualism, even if 
it had a leg of reason or fact to stand on-all the strength, and almost all the 
space of these journals is devoted.</P>
<P>These are the things which give the enemies of Spiritualism a real handle 
against it, and bring it into contempt with sober minds. Re-incarnation is a 
doctrine which Cuts up by the roots all individual identity in the future 
existence. It desolates utterly that dearest yearning of the human heart for 
reunion with its loved ones in a permanent world. If some are to go back into 
fresh physical bodies, and bear new names, and new natures, if they are to 
become respectively Tom Styles, Ned Snooks, and a score of other people, who 
shall ever hope to meet again with his friends, wife, children, brothers and 
sisters ? When he enters the spirit-world and enquires for them, lie will have 
to learn that they are already gone back to earth, and are somebody else, the 
sons and daughters of other people, and will have to become over and over the 
kindred of a dozen other families in succession Surely, no such most cheerless 
crochet could bewitch the intellects of any people, except under the most 
especial bedevilment of the most sarcastic and mischievous of devils.&quot;</P>
<P>In the January number for <B>1866</B>, a still stronger article on this 
subject appears from the pen of Wm. Howitt, who writes the following fearless 
words of protest against the doctrine of Re-incarnation</P>
<P>&quot;In the <I>Avenir </I>of November <B>2</B>nd, M. Pezzani thinks he has 
silenced M. Pierart, by asserting that without Reincarnation all is chaos and 
injustice in God's creation. &lsquo;In this world there are rich and poor, 
oppressed and oppressors, and without Re-incarnation, God's justice could not be 
vindicated.' That is to say, in M. Pezzani's conception, God has not room in the 
infinite future to punish and redress every wrong, without sending back souls 
again and again into the flesh. M. Pezzani's idea, and that of his brother 
Re-incarnationists is, that the best way to get from Paris to London is to 
travel any number of times from Paris to Calais and back again. We English, that 
the only way is to go on to London at once. . As to M. Pezzani's notions of 
God's injustice without Reincarnation, if souls were re-incarnated a score of 
times, injustice between man and man, riches and poverty, oppression and wrong, 
all the enigmas of social inequality would remain just then as now.</P>
<P>&quot;In noticing these movements in the Spiritist camp in <I>France, </I>we 
should be doing a great injustice if we did not refer to the zealous, eloquent, 
and unremitting exertions of M. Pierart in the <I>Revue Spiritualists, </I>to 
expose and resist the errors of the <I>Spirits </I>to which we have alluded. The 
doctrine of Re-incarnation, M. Pierart has persistently resisted and denounced 
as at once false, unfounded on any evidence, and most pernicious to the 
character of Spiritualism.&quot;</P>
<P>Allan Kardec died on March <B>31</B>st, <B>1869</B>.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the fact that the experimental method of receiving 
communications through physical mediumship was not in favour with M. Allan 
Kardec and his followers, there as an abundant amount of phenomena of all kinds 
recorded in M. Pierart's excellent journal, <I>La Revue Spiritualiste, </I>also 
in many other European journals devoted to the subject. From this we are about 
to select such facts of a representative character as will give a general view 
of French Spiritualism in the nineteenth century.</P>
<P>The celebrated &quot;Cure D'Ars,&quot; the founder of the D'Ars 
Providence,&quot; and many other noble works of charity, Jean Baptiste Vianney, 
was born in the vicinity of Lyons, in <B>1786</B>, in a humble sphere of life. 
His natural capacity was by no means remarkable, and at school he was only 
remembered as a somewhat dull scholar. Circumstances having opened up the way 
for his becoming a priest, although he had only Latin enough to say mass, and no 
learning beyond the routine of his profession, yet his amiable nature and 
unaffected piety won him friends wherever lie went. After some changes of 
fortune and the rejection of two good offers of rich positions, which in his 
extreme humility he did not deem himself fit for, he accepted the pastoral 
charge of tile little agricultural village of D'Ars, now in the arrondisement of 
Trevoux.</P>
<P>Very soon his reputation for beneficence drew round him a much larger circle 
of poor dependents than he could provide for, and then it was that he commenced 
his extraordinary life of faith, supplicating in fervent prayer for whatever 
means were necessary to carry out his divine mission of blessing to his 
unfortunate fellow creatures. In this way the sphere of his benevolence, and the 
wonderful results of the means he employed to maintain it, reached proportions 
that could scarcely he credited</P>
<P>But now a still more wonderful thing was to happen in the enchanted region of 
D'Ars. Persons afflicted with disease began to experience sudden cures whilst 
praying before the altar, or making confessions to the Cure. The fame of this 
new miracle soon spread abroad, until the Abbe Monnin declares that upwards of 
<B>20</B>,<B>000</B> persons annually came from Germany, Italy, Belgium, and all 
parts of <I>France, </I>and even from England, and thar in less than six years 
this number increased to an average of <B>80</B>,<B>000</B>. Diseases of every 
kind that had been pronounced incurable, were dissipated at once. The 
indefatibagle Cure gave himself up to the work, heart and soul. His church stood 
open day and night, and the immense crowds that surrounded it, were obliged to 
wait for hours and sometimes days, to reach the good healer. No one was allowed 
to take precedence of the rest, except in cases of extreme poverty or extreme 
suffering. Princes, nobles, and great ladies, often drove up as near as they 
could to the church ill grand carriages, and manifested the utmost astonishment 
when informed that notwithstanding their rank, they could not be admitted except 
in turn. The Cure only permitted himself to take four hours sleep, namely from 
eleven to three, and when he came to the confessional again, the church and all 
the approaches to it were crowded with those who had waited all night to secure 
their places. Omnibuses were established to convey patients from Lyons to D'Ars, 
and the Saone was covered with boats full of anxious pilgrims.</P>
<P>There can be no doubt that the first well marked impulse which experimental 
spiritualism received through the invocatory processes of the circle, in 
<I>France, </I>as in many other countries of Europe, was due to the visits of 
Mr. D.D. Home, the celebrated non-professional physical medium, and subsequently 
to the large influx of professional mediums, who found in <I>France </I>an 
excellent field for the demonstration of their peculiar gifts.</P>
<P>Of Mr. Home's seances it would be superfluous to write, he himself having 
related them in two volumes published at different periods of his career, and 
his many admiring friends having sufficiently described the marvels of which 
they were witnesses in numerous magazines and newspaper articles.</P>
<P>Mr. Home's manifestations were given in <I>France </I>almost exclusively to 
personages of rank, or those distinguished by literary fame. He was a guest of 
royalty, the nobility, and persons of the highest position. During his residence 
in Paris, under the Imperial <I>regime, </I>he was a frequent and ever-welcome 
visitor at the court of the late Emperor Louis Napoleon. A record of the 
manifestations produced through his mediumship was kept by command of the 
Empress, and frequently read to her favoured friends. Amongst these memoranda is 
one which went the round of the papers at the time of its occurrence, hence 
there can be no impropriety in alluding to it now. It stated that on one 
occasion a seance was held at the Tuileries, when none were present save the 
Emperor, the Empress, the Duchess de Montebello, and Mr. D. D. Home.</P>
<P>On the table were placed pen, ink, and paper, and presently a spirit band was 
seen, which dipped the pen in the ink and deliberately wrote the name of the 
first Napoleon, in a perfect facsimile of that monarch's handwriting. The 
Emperor asked if he might be permitted to kiss this wonderful hand, when it 
instantly rose to his lips, subsequently passing to those of the Empress, and 
Mr. Home. The Emperor carefully preserved this precious autograph, and inscribed 
with it a memorandum to the effect that the hand was warm, soft, and resembled 
exactly that of his great predecessor and uncle.</P>
<P>As an evidence of the wide popularity to which the subject of Spiritualism 
had attained in <B>1869</B>, M. Pierart quotes in one of his numbers of that 
year, an article from the <I>Siecle, </I>a leading paper, but one which has 
hitherto contained many notices inimical to Spiritualism. The writer, M. Eugene 
Bonnemere, says:-</P>
<P>&quot;Although somnambulism has been a hundred times annihilated by the 
Academy of Medicine, it is more alive than ever in Paris; in the midst of all 
the lights of the age, it continues, right or wrong, to excite the multitude. 
Protean in its forms, infinite in its manifestations, if you put it out of the 
door, it knocks at the window; if that be not opened, it knocks on the ceiling, 
on the walls; it raps on the table at which you innocently seat yourselves to 
dine or for a game of whist. If you close your ears to its sounds, it grows 
excited, strikes the table, whirls it about in a giddy maze, lifts up its feet, 
and proceeds to talk through mediumship, as the dumb talk with their 
fingers.</P>
<P>&quot;You have all known the rage for table-turning. At one time we ceased to 
ask after each other's health, but asked how your table was. Thank you, mine 
turns beautifully; and how goes yours on? Everything turned; hats and the heads 
in them. One was led almost to believe that a circle of passengers being formed 
round the mainmast of a ship of great tonnage, and a magnetic chain thus 
established, they might make the vessel spin round till it disappeared in the 
depth of the ocean, as a gimlet disappears in a deal board. The Church 
interfered; it caused its thunders to roar, declaring that it was Satan himself 
who thus raised the devil in the tables, and having formally forbade the world 
to turn, it now forbade the faithful to turn tables, hats, brains, or ships of 
huge size. But Satan held his own. The sovereign of the nether world passed into 
a new <B>0110</B>, and that is the reason that America sends us mediums, 
beginning so gloriously with the famous Home, and ending with the Brothers 
Davenport. One remembers with what a frenzy everyone precipitated him-sell in 
pursuit of mediums. Everyone wished to have one of his own; and when you 
introduced a young man into society, you did not say, He is a good waltzer,' 
but, He is a medium.' Official science has killed and buried this Somnambulism a 
score of times; but it must have done it very badly. for there it is as alive as 
afresh with a new name.&quot; ever, only christened afresh with a new name.</P>
<P>Amongst the many distinguished adherents of Spiritualism in the department of 
French literature, none have more bravely asserted and defended their belief 
than Camille Flammarion, the celebrated astronomer; Victor Hugo, Alexandre 
Dumas, and Victorien Sardou, the renowned writer of French comedy. M. Sardou was 
himself a medium of singularly happy endowments. He executed a number of curious 
drawings, purporting to represent scenes in the spirit world, amongst which was 
an exquisite and complex work of art entitled, &quot;The House of 
Mozart.&quot;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Fraud :</B> A very large part is played by <I>fraud </I>in spiritualistic 
practices, both in the physical and psychical, or automatic, phenomena, but 
especially in the former. The frequency with which mediums have been convicted 
of <I>fraud </I>has, indeed, induced many people to abandon the study of 
psychical research, judging the whole bulk of the phenomena to be fraudulently 
produced. Yet the question of <I>fraud </I>is itself an interesting and 
complicated one, not unworthy of the attention of the student, for we find in 
connection with spiritualism not only simple deception practised with a view to 
gaining pecuniary advantages, but also many instances of systematic and 
apparently deliberate trickery where there is no evident reward to be obtained. 
and even cases where the medium is, so far as can be judged, entirely innocent 
and ignorant of the <I>fraud </I>he obviously practises. And it may be added 
that after all precautions have been taken which science and commonsense can 
suggest, there remains a portion of the phenomena which still continues to be 
inexplicable, and which justifies the interest now so widely shown in psychic 
science..</P>
<P>In considering the important factor of <I>fraud, </I>we must distinguish 
between conscious and unconscious <I>fraud, </I>though, as will be shown 
hereafter, it is at times possible for the one to shade imperceptibly into the 
other. Conscious <I>fraud </I>most often appears in connection with the physical 
phenomena. Almost at the outset of the spiritualistic movement, <I>i.e., </I>in 
<B>1851</B>, three doctors, professors of the University of Buffalo, N.Y., 
demonstrated that the rappings which attended the Sisters Fox were produced by 
the manipulation of the knee and toe joints, a fact which was shortly afterwards 
corroborated by Mrs. Cluver, a relative of the Fox family. Since that time many 
mediums have at one time or another been convicted of <I>fraud, </I>and every 
phase of physical mediumship been discredited. Slate-writing, spirit 
photography, materialisation, have all in turn been exposed, though the latter, 
at least, seems able to survive any number of exposures. Time and again, sitters 
have beheld the form and features of the medium in the materialised spirit; 
shadowy figures in filmy draperies, have been shown to be mannikins wrapped in 
muslin, and false beards and white draperies have been found about the person of 
the medium. Apports have been smuggled into the seance-room-jewels, flowers, 
perfumes, <I>objets d'art-in </I>order to be showered upon the sitters by 
generously-disposed &quot;spirits.&quot; Threads and human hairs have been used 
to move furniture and other objects. Sometimes more elaborate and complicated 
machinery is provided, but more often the medium depends upon sleight of hand 
and skilful suggestion to accomplish his ends. Conjurers have frequently been 
admitted to seances, and have failed to discover the <I>modus operandi </I>of 
the various feats, but this fact, though a great deal has been made of it by 
spiritualists, cannot be taken to have any significance, since conjurers are 
often quite mystified by each other's performances.</P>
<P>Another phase of <I>fraud </I>is that illustrated by many instances of 
<I>soi-disant </I>clairvoyance, where the medium acquires her information by 
muscle-reading, or by judicious enquiry previous to the seance. <I>Fraud </I>of 
this kind may be either conscious or unconscious.</P>
<P>Under the heading of unconscious <I>fraud </I>must be classed a large group 
of automatic phenomena. In many of the more pronounced cases of automatism, the 
normal consciousness of the agent is not responsible for his acts, while, on the 
other hand, there is a slighter degree of automatism, where the agent may be 
partly conscious of, and responsible for, his productions. This latter state, if 
it be frequently induced, and if the wilt power of the automatist be somewhat 
relaxed, may pass into the more profound stage; so <I>that fraud </I>which is at 
first conscious and voluntary may in time become unconscious and spontaneous. 
And thus it is extremely difficult to know just when aft accusation <I>of fraud 
</I>may with justice be brought against a medium. There is evidence that many 
trance mediums reproduce in their discourses information subconsciously acquired 
at some more or less remote period ; the trance utterances of Mrs. Piper, Mrs. 
Thomson, and others, reveal this peculiarity. It is true that extensive and 
apparently fraudulent arrangements are sometimes made before a seance, but may 
it not be possible that, previous to a &quot;physical&quot; or psychical&quot; 
dance, such preparations may be made automatically in a state approximating to 
the mediumistic trance ? If the hypnotic subject is not responsible or is only 
partly so-for the fulfillment of a post-hypnotic promise, would it not be within 
reason to suppose that the medium, in gaining information concerning possible 
sitters, in secreting apports about the person, is the victim of a similar 
dissociation of consciousness? There are facts not a few which would support 
such a conclusion.</P>
<P>Spiritualists themselves are, from time to time, called upon to face 
exposures of undoubted <I>fraud, </I>and on these occasions various apologies of 
a morn or less ingenious nature, are offered for the erring medium. Sometimes it 
is said that the medium is controlled by mischievous spirits <I>(diakka), 
</I>who make use of his physical organism to perform tricks and deceptions. 
Again, it is stated that the medium feels an irresistible impulse to perform the 
action which he knows is in the mind of the control. Thus Eusapia Palladino 
would extend her hand involuntarily in the direction in which movement of 
furniture was to take place, though without actual contact-that is, perceiving 
that the spirits desired to move the object, she herself was impelled to attempt 
a physical (and fraudulent) forestalling of the action. Certain of the 
investigators who examined the phenomena in connection with the latter medium 
have also declared that their production costs Eusapia a great deal of pain and 
fatigue, and that she therefore seizes readily upon an opportunity of producing 
them easily and without trouble. Such an opportunity, they held, only presented 
itself when their rigorous precautions were relaxed. The same has also been 
stated in connection with other mediums. In the case of a materialisation 
seance, when the spirit form is grasped and found to be the medium herself, 
these apologists offer an explanation, as follows: A certain amount of the 
medium's physical energy is imparted to the spirit. If the latter be roughly 
handled, spirit and medium will unite for their joint benefit, either within or 
without the cabinet-if the medium possesses most energy, she will draw the 
spirit to her, if the most of the energy is with the materialised spirit, it is 
the medium who will instantly be attracted to the spirit. That it is the latter 
alternative which invariably takes place is a fact which has no significance for 
good spiritualists. Or they may insist, as did Sergeant Cox, on one occasion, 
that the medium is controlled to impersonate a spirit. But whatever be the 
reason for <I>fraud, </I>it is clear that not the most ingenuous medium is to be 
trusted for a moment, though his character in normal life be blameless, and no 
object in committing <I>fraud </I>be apparent; and that investigators must rely 
only on the strictest vigilance and the most up-to-date scientific methods and 
apparatus.</P>

<P>Freemasonry-History and Origin :</B> Though it would not be exactly correct 
to say that the history of <I>Freemasonry </I>was lost in the mists of 
antiquity, it is competent to remark that although to a certain degree 
traceable, its records are of a scanty nature, and so crossed by the trails of 
other mystical brotherhoods, that disentanglement is an extremely difficult 
process. The ancient legend of its foundation at the time of the building of the 
Temple at Jerusalem is manifestly traditional. If one might hazard an opinion, 
it would seem that at a very early epoch in the history of civilization, a caste 
of builders in stone arose, who jealously guarded the secret of their craft. In 
all probability this caste was prehistoric. It is not unreasonable to assume 
this when we possess plenty of proof that an ancient caste of bronze-workers 
flourished in every country in Europe and Asia; and if this be admitted, and it 
cannot well be refuted in the light of recent researches,-(see <I>Journal of the 
Gypsy Lore Society </I>for <B>1913</B>)-there is nothing absurd or impossible in 
the contention that a similar school of workers in stone should have arisen at a 
like early period. We know that it is probable that the old caste of 
bronze-workers had an esoteric language of their own, which has come down to us 
as the Shelta Than (q.v.) spoken generally by the tinkler people of Great 
Britain and Ireland. If such a caste can elaborate a secret language and cling 
jealously to the &quot; mysteries&quot; of metal-working, there is no reason to 
doubt the existence of a similar caste of masons. We tender this theory for what 
it is worth, as it is unsupported by any great authority on the subject. Where 
such, a caste of operative masons arose is altogether a separate question, and 
cannot be dealt with here; but it must obviously have been in a country where 
working in stone was one of the principal arts. It is also almost certain that 
this early brotherhood must have been hierophantic. Its principal work to begin 
with would undoubtedly consist in the raising of temples and similar structures, 
and as such it would come into very close contact with the priesthood, if indeed 
it was not wholly directed by it. In early civilization but two classes of 
dwelling receive the attention of the architect,-the temple and the palace. For 
example, among the ruins of Egypt and Babylon, remains of the private house are 
rare, but the temple and the royal residence are everywhere conspicuous, and we 
know that among the ruins of Central America temples and palaces alone 
remain-the huts of the surrounding dwellers having long ago disappeared. The 
temple is the nucleus of the early city. Around the worship of the gods 
crystallises commerce, agriculture, and all the affairs of life. All roads lead 
to the temple. Striding for a moment over the gap of years between early Babylon 
and Egypt and medieval Britain, we find the priesthood in close touch with the 
masons. A medieval cathedral took more than one generation to erect, and in that 
time many masons came and went around the fane. The lodge was invariably founded 
hard by the rising cathedral or abbey, and apprentices and others were entered 
as opportunity offered : indeed a man might serve his apprenticeship and labour 
all through his life upon the one building, without ever seeing any work 
elsewhere. The evidence as to whether the master-masons were also architects is 
very conflicting, and it has been held that the priests were the architects of 
the British cathedrals,-the master-masons and operatives merely carrying out 
their designs. There is good evidence however that this is not wholly true. 
Authorities are at one in declaring that of all arts architecture is by far the 
most intricate. It is undoubtedly the one which requires a long and specific 
training. Questions of stress and strain of the most difficult description 
arise, and it seems incredible that anyone with the most superficial knowledge 
of the subject should believe that ecclesiastics, who had not undergone any 
special training should be qualified to compose plans of the most perfect and 
intricate description for the most noble and remarkable edifices ever raised in 
this country.</P>
<P>We know that professional architects existed at a very early period; and why 
the priesthood should be credited with their work, it is difficult to 
understand; but instances are on record where the priests of a Certain locality 
have taken to themselves the credit of planning the cathedral of the diocese. Be 
this as it may, the &quot;mystery &quot; of building was sufficiently deep to 
require extensive knowledge and experience and to a great extent this justifies 
the jealousy with which the early masons regarded its secrets. Again, this 
jealousy with which it was kept from the vulgar gaze may have been racial in its 
origin, and may have arisen from such considerations as the following ' Let no 
stranger understand this craft of ours. Why should we make it free to the 
heathen and the foreigner ? &quot; This also smacks of priest-craft, but if 
masonry originated hierophantically, it certainly did not continue a preserve of 
any religion, and is nowadays probably the chiefest abomination of the Roman 
Catholic hierarchy, which has not hesitated to publish and disseminate the 
grossest libels regarding it. It is to Britain that we must look for evidence as 
to the evolutionary line of masonry. Before the founding of the Grand Lodge, we 
find that York and the North of England in general was regarded as the most 
ancient seat of the fraternity in this island. Indeed without stretching 
probabilities too far, the line oi evolution so far as York is concerned is 
quite remarkable. We know for example that in the early days of that city a 
temple of Serapis existed there, which was afterwards a monastery of the Begging 
Friars, and the mysteries of this god existed beside the Roman Collegia or 
Craftsmen's Society,. it is also Considered that the crypt of York Minster 
affords evidence of the progress of masonry from Roman to Saxon times.. It is 
stated that it has a mosaic pavement of blue and white tables laid in the form 
employed in the first degree of masonry, and is said to show the sites of three 
seats used by the master and his wardens during the construction of the 
building. It is also an undoubted fact that the craft occasionally met in this 
crypt during last century. There is thus reason to believe even though the 
evidence be of a scanty nature (but the foregoing does not embrace ah of it) 
that the early masons of Britain were probably influenced by Romano-Egyptian 
mystical societies, and that their own craft societies drew some of their 
practices and constitutions from these alien schools. Masonic tradition goes to 
show that even in the beginning of the fourteenth Century masonry in Britain was 
then regarded as a thing of great antiquity. Lodge records for the most part 
only date back to the sixteenth century in the oldest instances, but ancient 
manuscripts are extant which undoubtedly relate to masonry. Thus the old charges 
embodied in the Regius MS. which was unearthed in <B>1839</B> by Mr. Halliwell 
Phillips are dated at <B>1390</B>. and contain a curious legend of the craft, 
which tells how the necessity of finding work of some description drove men to 
consult Euclid, who recommended masonry as a craft to them. It goes on to tell 
how masonry was founded in Egypt, and how it entered England in the time of 
Athelstan. The necessity for keeping close counsel as regards the secrets of the 
craft is insisted upon in rude verse. The Cooke MS. dates from the first part of 
the fifteenth century, and likewise contains versions of the old charges. Egypt 
is also regarded here as the mother-land of masonry, and Athelstan is the medium 
for' the introduction of the craft into the island of Britain. But that this 
manuscript was used among masons at a later date was proved by the discovery of 
a more modern version dated about <B>1687</B>, in <B>1890</B>, and known as the 
William Watson MS. In all about seventy of these old charges and 
pseudo-histories have been discovered since <B>1860</B>. They have all much in 
common and are of English origin.</P>
<P>A great deal has been written to attempt to prove that British freemasonry 
borrowed extensively from continental secret societies, such as the Steinmetzin 
of Germany, the Rosicrucians (q.v.) and similar fellowships. The truth probably 
lies however in the circumstance that the coming and going of students of 
occultism throughout Europe was so constant, and so frequent were their 
communications that practically all those societies were in touch with one 
another. Again many persons belonged to several of them at once, and imported 
the rules and constitution of one body into another. No student of occultism can 
fail to be struck with the close resemblance of the constitutions of nearly all 
the mystical fellowships of the middle ages, and the resemblance of the verbiage 
employed by their founders and protagonists. It must also ho insisted that the 
speculative or mystic part of masonry was in the middle ages merely a tradition 
with the brotherhood, whatever it may have been in earlier times, and whatever 
close connection the craft may have had with hierophantic or mystic philosophy. 
The speculative element, we repeat, was merely traditional and symbolical as at 
present, and not practical ; but this tradition was to serve to keep alight the 
flame of speculative mysticism which was to be aroused again at the end of the 
medieval period. When political freedom awoke in Europe, the necessity for the 
existence of secret Societies vanished, but the persons who delighted in their 
formation and management still remained. The <I>raison d'etre </I>of these 
fellowships had disappeared, but the love of mysticism, not to say the 
mysterious, was per-haps stronger than ever. that then occurred ? Simply this: 
that all those persons who found the occupation of floating and managing real 
secret societies gone, cast about for anything in the shape of a mystical 
fellowship that they could find. They soon discovered the craft of masonry which 
although operative possessed mystical traditions. The attraction was mutual, and 
astrologers, alchemists and others soon crowded the lodges, to such purpose that 
at the lodges held in <B>1646</B> in London, there was not an operative mason 
present, and at that held in <B>1682</B>, the speculative branch was 
overwhelming in its numbers. Harking back a little it is noteworthy that the 
freemasons in medieval times formed a fellowship or guild closely resembling in 
its Constitution that of similar trade guilds both in Britain and the continent 
such as the Weavers, Tailors, Fishmongers, and so forth. But although these 
guilds preserved their mysteries,&quot; where they possessed them, with 
considerable jealousy, they do not appear to have embedded in their 
constitutions the same ancient practices and ritual which go to show so strongly 
that masonry is undoubtedly an institution of great antiquity.</P>
<P>It has also been suggested that freemasonry as introduced into Europe by the 
Knights Templar. It would be difficult to discover a similar institution which 
in the opinion of some authorities had not been founded by that order and it is 
difficult to believe that the haughty chivalry of Norman times would have 
claimed any connection whatsoever with an operative craft. There are, however, 
many connections between alchemy and masonry. For example in the <I>Ordinall of 
Alchymy </I>compiled by Thomas Norton, (q.v.), the freemasons are alluded to as 
workers in it. In <B>1630</B>, we find Fludd (q.v.) using language which smacks 
strongly of freemasonry. His society was divided into degrees, and the Masons' 
Company of London had a copy of the masonic charges presented by him. Vaughan 
also appears to have been a freemason, and many masons of the middle of the 
seventeenth century, such as Robert Moray and Elias Ashmole, were diligent 
students of occult science. and Sir Christopher Wren was a student of hermetic 
art.</P>
<P>It has often been put forward that Scotland was the original home of 
freemasonry in these islands, but although the craft was undoubtedly ancient in 
that country, there does not appear to be any adequate proof that it was older 
than in England. Some of the Scottish lodges, such as No. I Edinburgh, 
Kilwinning, and Aberdeen, possess very ancient records, and it is probable that 
this has led to the assumption that the brotherhood was of greater antiquity in 
North Britain than in England. But the circumstance that the craft was probably 
introduced into England in Roman times, where it has in all likelihood 
flourished ever since, tends to dispose of such a theory. The history of modern 
freemasonry begins with the formation of the Grand Lodge of England, which was 
inaugurated on St. John the Baptist's Day <B>1717</B> by several old lodges. 
This represented the first central governing body of the fraternity, and before 
this time each lodge had been self-governing. Many lodges speedily came under 
its aegis, and Ireland formed a Grand lodge of her own in <B>1725</B> but 
Scotland did not follow till <B>1736</B>, and even then many lodges held aloof 
from the central body, only <B>33</B> out of Ion falling into line. From one or 
other of these three governing bodies all the regular lodges throughout the 
world have arisen, so that modern masonry may truthfully be said to be of 
entirely British origin. This is not the place to enter into an elaborate 
discussion of the history and affairs of modern masonry, and we are chiefly 
exercised regarding its mystical position and tendencies. Regarding these we 
must be brief. As regards the lower ranks of the craft, it consists almost 
entirely in these islands at least of persons who have in great measure treated 
it as a mere friendly society, and it is only in the higher ranks that any real 
idea of the true significance of the mystical tenets preserved and taught is 
retained. The ordinary mason, who preserves a cryptic and mysterious silence 
when the affairs of his craft are alluded to, merely serves as a laughing-stock 
to the modern well-equipped mystic. Certain signs and handgrips are in use 
amongst masons, and the possession of these, and of a ritual the significance of 
which he rarely comprehends, the average brother fondly imagines renders him 
somewhat superior to the layman It is extremely doubtful if among even the 
higher ranks of masonry, the deepest significance of the tradition of the craft 
is thoroughly realised, and if the absurd works which every now and then emanate 
from eminent masons reading the history of their craft be accepted as criteria 
of their higher knowledge, it must indeed be of slight proportions Regarding the 
grand secret, or secrets, of masonry the layman may rest comfortably assured 
that if he has failed to join the brotherhood, he has missed no fact of supreme 
importance by so doing. There is no &quot; secret&quot; at all. The original 
secrets in connection with the craft were those of operative masons, who were 
jealous of their position as workmen, and who rightly enough did not believe in 
giving away business secrets to all and sundry but the so-called &quot;secrets 
&quot; of modern speculative masonry are merely such as have brought alchemy, 
astrology, and the kindred sciences into unthinking disrepute among those who do 
not recognise their significance in the history of human thought This is not to 
say that masonry as a whole consists of mere claptrap. The trend of its entire 
constitution is nowadays frankly mystical, but it is a mysticism which is only 
half understood by the lower ranks of the craft, and which is imperfectly 
recognised by its higher officers. Its tenets are unquestionably mystic and 
lofty, but masonic transcendentalism has scarcely kept in line with the more 
modern forms of mysticism. From time to time new degrees have been formed which 
have in some measure rectified this, but the number of masons qualified to 
understand the nature of the vast and mighty truths conveyed in these, is 
naturally extremely small, and it is as a friendly society that the brotherhood 
effects its greatest good.</P>
<P>As has been said, continental masonry is undoubtedly the offspring of British 
systems. This is not to say that in France and Germany there were no masonic 
lodges in existence before the formation of the English Grand Lodge; but all 
modern lodges in these countries undoubtedly date from the inception of the 
English central body. French masonry possessed and possesses many rites which 
differ entirely from those accepted by the British craft. We find the beginnings 
of modern French masonry in the labours of Martinez Pasqually (q.v.), St. Martin 
(q.v.), and perhaps to a great extent in those of Cagliostro (q.v.) who toiled 
greatly to found his Egyptian rite in France. It is noticeable, however, that he 
had become a member of a London lodge before attempting this. In <I>France, 
</I>masonry has always had more or less a political complexion, and nowadays the 
extreme enmity existing between it and the Roman Catholic church in that country 
favours the inclusion in its ranks of persons possessing ideals by no means in 
consonance with the very upright standard of British masonry. In Germany, it has 
been said that the Steinmetzin approximated very strongly in mediaeval times to 
the British masons, if they were not originally one and the same; but the later 
lodges in Germany all date from that founded in <B>1733</B>.</P>
<P>The entrance of masons into the various degrees involves an elaborate system 
of symbolic ritual, of which the essence is uniform throughout all lodges. The 
members are classified in numerous degrees, of which the first three are entered 
apprentice, fellow-craft, and master-mason. Each lodge possesses its own 
bye-laws, subject to the Book of Constitution of the Grand Lodge.</P>
<P>Wild stories have been circulated, chiefly by the Roman Catholic enemies of 
masonry, regarding the practice of diabolic occultism in the higher ranks of the 
craft. To begin with, it is extremely unlikely that more than three or four 
persons connected with it possess the requisite knowledge to thus offend against 
the Christian proprieties, and the childish asseverations of French writers on 
the subject may be dismissed with a smile. The &quot; occultism and 
transcendentalism&quot; of the majority of zealous brethren are usually of the 
mildest character possible, and are in some measure related to the mysterious 
attitude of the average mason, when dark hints as to lodge doings are whispered 
of among his admiring relatives.</P>

he soon grew interested in the quest of gold-making, and, when the celebrated 
alchemist, Lascaris, came to Germany, Martin hastened to his presence with a 
view to gleaning his secrets. Along with several other young men, the Hessian 
was allowed to witness numerous experiments, and while he watched them, it 
seemed to him that the great secret lay open before him; but afterwards, when he 
made attempts on his own account, he found that Lascaris had duped him 
shamefully, and had even taken advantage of his ignorance. Thereupon, in
