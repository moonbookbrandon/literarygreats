<P>Napellus : </B>A plant with narcotic properties,<B> </B>with which Van 
Helmont experimented. He says that, having on one occasion roughly prepared the 
root, he tasted it with his tongue, and in a very short time found that the 
centre of thought and intellect was situated in the pit of his stomach. An 
unusual clarity and distinctness of thought rendered the experience a pleasant 
one, and he sought on future occasions to repeat it by the same means, but 
without success. After about two hours he felt a slight dizziness and thereupon 
thought in the normal fashion with his brain. But throughout the strange- 
experience he was conscious that his soul still remained in the brain as a 
governing power.</P>

its walls are formed of wreathed snakes, and their venom is ever falling like

great dragon, who dwells beneath the central root of Ygdrassil, torments and 
gnaws the dead. Here it is that Loki is chained to a splintered rock, where the

<P>Nature Spirits or Elementals</B> <B>:</B> according to theosophy<B> </B>have 
bodies composed of the finer kinds of matter. There are countless hosts of them, 
divided into seven classes, which allowing for two unmanifested, belong to the 
ether, air, fire, water, and earth,-the last four being called by the Kabalists, 
sylphs, salamanders, undines, and gnomes respectively; and at the head of each 
class is a deva or inferior god. <I>Nature spirits </I>work in unsuspected ways, 
sometimes lending their aid to human beings in the form of certain faculties, 
and those in the astral world are engaged in the creation of form out of the 
matter which the outpouring of the Logos has quickened, hence it is they who 
form minerals, flowers, and so on. These <I>nature spirits </I>of the astral 
worlds of course have bodies of astral matter, and they frequently from 
mischievous or other impulses, change the appearance of these bodies. They are 
just without the powers of ordinary vision, and many people of more acute vision 
can see them, while the action of drugs also may make them visible,</P>

<P>Naylor, James :</B> An English impostor of the seventeenth century, born in 
the diocese of York. He served for a time in the army, then joined the Quakers 
where his discourses gained for him a reputation for sanctity. Trading on the 
good opinion of the people, he resolved to set himself up for a sort of deity, 
and entered Bristol in <B>1656</B>, mounted on a horse led by a man and a woman, 
while others ran behind chanting&quot; Holy, holy, holy, is the god of 
Sabaoth.&quot; He was duly punished by having his tongue pierced with a hot 
iron, and his forehead marked with the letter &quot; B&quot; (blasphemer). This 
done, he was forced to ride into Bristol in disgrace, his face turned towards 
the horse's tail.</P><B>

<P>Ndembo, The : </B>Or<B> </B><I>Kita </I>is a secret society which has 
widespread ramifications on the lower Congo, and especially in the districts 
lying to the south of that river. Initiation is made through the ganga, or 
chief, who instructs the neophyte at a given signal suddenly to lie down as if 
dead. A shroud is spread over him, and he is carried off to an enclosure outside 
the village called <I>vela, </I>and is pronounced to have died a <I>Ndembo. 
</I>Perhaps twenty, thirty, or even fifty candidates ' die&quot; at the one 
time. It is then assumed that. persons &quot;dying&quot; in this manner decay 
until only a single bone remains, and this the ganga takes charge of. The 
process varies from three months to as many years, and the ganga is supposed by 
art magic to bring every one of the dead back to life within that period. On a 
festival day of the <I>Ndembo, </I>the members march through the village in a 
grand procession amidst universal joy, carrying with them the persons who are 
supposed to have died. The neophytes who are supposed to have perished, comport 
themselves as if in reality they had come from another world. They take new' 
names, pretend that everything in the terrestrial sphere is new to them, turn a 
deaf ear to their parents and relatives. and even affect not to know how to eat. 
They further desire to have everything they set eyes on, and if it is not 
granted to them immediately, they may fall upon the unhappy owner and beat and 
even kill him without any Consequence to themselves; as it is assumed that they 
are mere children in the affairs of the terrestrial sphere, and therefore know 
no better.</P>
<P>Those who have gone through this rite are called Nganga, or the&quot; knowing 
ones,&quot; while the neophytes are designated <I>Vanga. </I>During their 
occupation of the <I>vela </I>they learn an esoteric language, which they 
constantly employ. Perhaps the best picture of their cult has been given by 
Bastian, who says:-</P>
<P>&quot;The Great Nkissi (who here replaces the fetish) lives in the interior 
of the woodlands where nobody can see him. When he dies the Nganga carefully 
collect his bones in order to bring them back to life, and nourish them that 
they may again put on flesh and blood. But it is not well to speak about it. In 
the Ambamba country everybody must have died once, and when the Nganga 
(replacing the fetish-priest) shakes his calabash against a village, those men 
and youths whose hour is come fall into a state of lifeless torpor, from which 
they generally rise up in three days. But the man whom the Nkissi loves he 
carries off to the bush and often buries him for a series of years. When he 
again awakens to life, he begins to eat and drink as before, but his mind is 
gone, and the Nganga must himself educate him and instruct him in every 
movement, like the smallest child. At first that can only be done with the rod, 
but the senses gradually return, so that you can speak with him. and when his 
education is finished the Nganga takes him back to his parents. These would 
seldom recognise him but for the positive assurance of the Nganga, who at the 
same time reminds them of earlier occurrences. Whoever has not yet undergone the 
experience in Ambamba is universally despised. and is not allowed to join in the 
dances.&quot;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Necromancy :</B> Or divination by means of the spirits of the dead, from the 
Greek words <I>nekros, </I>dead; and <I>manteia, </I>divination. It is through 
its Italian form nigromancia that it came to be known as the &quot;Black 
Art.&quot; With the Greeks it originally signified the descent into Hades in 
order to consult the dead rather than summoning the dead into the mortal sphere 
again. The art is of almost universal usage. Considerable difference of opinion 
exists among modern adepts as to the exact methods to be properly pursued in the 
necromantic art, and it must be borne in mind that <I>necromancy, </I>which in 
the Middle Ages was called sorcery, shades into modern spiritualistic practice. 
There is no doubt however, that <I>necromancy </I>is the touch-stone of 
occultism, for if, after careful preparation the adept can carry through to a 
successful issue, the raising of the soul from the other world, he has proved 
the value of his art. It would be fruitless in this place to enter into a 
psychological discussion as to whether this feat is possible of accomplishment 
or not, and we will confine ourselves to the material which has been placed at 
our disposal by the sages of the past, who have left full details as to how the 
process should be approached.</P>
<P>In the case of a compact existing between the conjuror and the devil, no 
ceremony is necessary, as the familiar is ever at hand to do the behests of his 
masters. This, however, is never the case with the true sorcerer, who preserves 
his independence, and trusts to his profound know-ledge of the art and his 
powers of command ; his object therefore is to &quot; constrain&quot; some 
spirit to appear before him, and to guard himself from the danger of provoking 
such beings. The magician, it must be understood always has an assistant, and 
every article flamed is prepared according to rules well known in the black art. 
In the first place they are to fix upon a spot proper for such a purpose; which 
must be either in a subterraneous vault, hung round with black, and lighted by a 
magical torch; or else in the centre of some thick wood or desert, or upon some 
extensive unfrequented plain, where several roads meet. or amidst the ruins of 
ancient castles, abbeys, monasteries, etc., or amongst the rocks on the sea 
shore, in some private detached churchyard, or any other solemn, melancholy 
place between the hours of twelve and one in the night, either when the moon 
shines very bright, or else when the elements are disturbed with storms of 
thunder, lightning, wind, and rain; for, in these places, times, and seasons, it 
is contended that spirits can with less difficulty manifest themselves to mortal 
eyes, and continue visible with the least pain, in this elemental external 
world.</P>
<P>When the proper time and place is fixed on, a magic circle is to be formed, 
within which, the master and his associate are carefully to retire. The 
dimensions of the circle are as follow -A piece of ground is usually chosen, 
nine feet square, at the full extent of which parallel lines are drawn one 
within the other, having sundry crosses and triangles described between them, 
close to which is formed the first or outer circle, then, about half-a-foot 
within the same, a second circle is described, and within that another square 
correspondent to the first, the centre of which is the seat or spot where the 
master and associate are to be placed &quot;The vacancies formed by the various 
lines and angles of the figure are filled up with the holy names of God, having 
crosses and triangles described between them. The reason assigned by magicians 
and others for the institution and use of circles, is, that so much ground being 
blessed and consecrated by such holy words and ceremonies as they make use of in 
forming it, hath a secret force to expel all evil spirits from the bounds 
thereof, and, being sprinkled with pure sanctified water, the ground is purified 
from all uncleanness; besides, the holy names of God being written over every 
part of it, its force becomes so powerful that no evil spirit hath ability to 
break through it, or to get at the magician or his companion, by reason of the 
antipathy in nature they bear to these sacred names. And the reason given for 
the triangles is, that if the spirit be not easily brought to speak the truth, 
they may by the exorcist be conjured to enter the same, where, by virtue of the 
names of the essence and divinity of God, they can speak nothing but what is 
true and right. The circle, therefore, according to this account of it, is the 
principal fort and shield of the magician, from which he is not, at the peril of 
his life, to depart, till he has completely dismissed the spirit, particularly 
if he be of a fiery or infernal nature. Instances are recorded of many who 
perished by this means; particularly &quot; Chiancungi,&quot; the famous 
Egyptian fortune-teller, who was so famous in England in the <B>17</B>th 
century. He undertook for a wager, to raise up the spirit &quot; Bokim,&quot; 
and having described the circle, he seated his sister Napula by him as his 
associate. After frequently repeating the forms of exorcism, and calling upon 
the spirit to appear, and nothing as yet answering his demand, they grew 
impatient of the business, and quitted the circle, but it cost them their lives 
; for they were instantaneously seized and crushed to death by that infernal 
spirit, who happened not to be sufficiently constrained till that moment, to 
manifest himself to human eyes.&quot;</P>
<P>There is a prescribed form of consecrating the magic circle, which we omit as 
unnecessary in a general illustration. The proper attire or&quot; 
pontificalibus&quot; of a magician. is an ephod made of fine white linen, over 
that a priestly robe of black bombazine, reaching to the ground, with the two 
seals of the earth drawn correctly upon virgin parchment, and affixed to the 
breast of his outer vestment. Round his waist is tied a broad consecrated 
girdle, with the names Ya, Ya,-Aie, Aaie,-Elibra,-Elchim,-Sadai,-Pah Adonai,-tuo 
robore,-Cinctus sum. Upon his shoes must be written Tetragrammaton, with crosses 
round about; upon his head a high-crowned cap of sable silk, and in his hand a 
Holy Bible, printed or written in pure Hebrew. Thus attired, and standing within 
the charmed circle, the magician repeats the awful form of exorcism; and 
presently, the infernal spirits make strange and frightful noises, howlings, 
tremblings, flashes, and most dreadful shrieks and yells, as the forerunner of 
their becoming visible. Their first appearance is generally in the form of 
fierce and terrible lions or tigers, vomiting forth fire, and roaring hideously 
about the circle; all which time the exorcist must not suffer any tremour of 
dismay; for, in that case, they will gain the ascendency, and the consequences 
may touch his life. On the contrary, he must summon up a share of resolution, 
and continue repeating all the forms of constriction and confinement, until they 
are drawn nearer to the influence of the triangle, when their forms will change 
to appearances less ferocious and frightful, and become more submissive and 
tractable. When the forms of conjuration have in this manner been sufficiently 
repeated, the spirits forsake their bestial shapes, and enter the human form, 
appearing like naked men of gentle countenance and behaviour, yet is the 
magician to be warily on his guard that they deceive him not by such mild 
gestures, for they are exceedingly fraudulent and deceitful in their dealings 
with those who constrain them to appear without compact, having nothing in view 
- but to suborn his mind, or accomplish his destruction. With great care also 
must the spirit be discharged after the ceremony is finished, and he has 
answered all the demands made upon him. The magician must wait patiently till he 
has passed through all the terrible forms which announce his coming, and only 
when the last shriek has died away, and every trace of fire and brimstone has 
disappeared, may he leave the circle and depart home in safety. If the ghost of 
a deceased person is to be raised, the grave must be resorted to at midnight, 
and a different form of conjuration is necessary. Still another, is the infernal 
sacrament for &quot;any corpse that hath hanged, drowned, or otherwise made away 
with itself;&quot; and in this case the conjurations are performed over the 
body, which will at last arise, and standing upright, answer with a<B> </B>faint 
and hollow voice the questions that are put to it.</P>
<P>Eliphas Levi, in his <I>Ritual of Transcendent Magic </I>says that 
'evocations should always have a motive and a becoming end, otherwise they are 
works of darkness and folly, dangerous for health and reason.&quot; The 
permissible motive of an evocation may be either love or intelligence. </P>
<P>Evocations of love require less apparatus and are in every respect easier. 
The procedure is as follows &quot;We must, in the first place, carefully collect 
the memorials of him (or her) whom we desire to behold, the articles he used, 
and on which his impression remains; we must also prepare an apartment in which 
the person lived, or otherwise one of a similar kind, and place his portrait 
veiled in white therein, surrounded with his favourite flowers, which must be 
renewed daily. A fixed date must then be observed, either the birthday of the 
person, or that day which was most fortunate for his and our own affection, one 
of which we may believe that his soul, however blessed elsewhere, cannot lose 
the remembrance ; this must be the day for the evocation, and we must provide 
for it during the space of fourteen days. Throughout this period we must refrain 
from extending to anyone the same proofs of affection which we have the right to 
expect from the dead; we must observe strict chastity, live in retreat, and take 
only one modest and light collation daily. every evening at the same hour we 
must shut ourselves in the chamber consecrated to the memory of the lamented 
person, using only one small light, such as that of a funeral lamp or taper. 
This light should be placed behind us, the portrait should be uncovered and we 
should remain before it for an hour, in silence; finally, we should fumigate the 
apartment with a little good incense, and go out backwards. On the morning of 
the day fixed for the evocation, we should adorn ourselves as if for a festival, 
not salute anyone first, make but a single repast of bread; wine, and roots, or 
fruits ; the cloth should be white, two covers should be laid, and one portion 
of the bread broken should be set aside; a little wine should also be placed in 
the glass of the person we design to invoke. The meal must be eaten alone in the 
chamber of evocations. and in presence of the veiled portrait; it must be all 
cleared away at the end, except the glass belonging to the dead person, and his 
portion of bread, which must be placed before the portrait. In the evening, at 
the hour for the regular visit, we must repair in silence to the chamber, light 
a clear fire of cypress-wood, and cast incense seven times thereon, pronouncing 
the name of the person whom we desire to behold. The lamp must then be 
extinguished, and the fire permitted to die out. On this day the portrait must 
not be unveiled. When the flame is extinct, put more incense on the ashes, and 
invoke God according to the forms of the religion to which the dead person 
belonged, and according to the ideas which he himself possessed of God. While 
making this prayer we must identify ourselves with the evoked person, speak as 
he spoke, believe in a sense as he believed ; then, after a silence of fifteen 
minutes, we must speak to him as if he were present, with affection and with 
faith, praying him to manifest to us. Renew this prayer mentally, covering the 
face with both hands; then call him thrice with a loud voice; tarry on our 
knees, the eyes closed and covered, for some minutes; then call again thrice 
upon him in a sweet and affectionate tone, and slowly open the eyes. Should 
nothing result, the same experiment must be renewed in the following year, and 
if necessary a third time, when it is certain that the desired apparition will 
be obtained, and the longer it has been delayed the more realistic and striking 
it will be. </P>
<P>&quot;Evocations of knowledge and intelligence are made with more solemn 
ceremonies. If concerned with a celebrated personage, we must meditate for 
twenty-one days upon his life and writings, form an idea of his appearance, 
converse with him mentally, and imagine his answers; carry his portrait, or at 
least his name, about us; follow a vegetable diet for twenty-one days, and a 
severe fast during the last seven. We must next construct the magical oratory. 
This oratory must be invariably darkened; but if we operate in the daytime, we 
may leave a narrow aperture on the side where the sun will shine at the hour of 
the evocation, and place a triangular prism before the opening, and a crystal 
globe, filled with water, before the prism. If the operation be arranged for the 
night the magic lamp must be so placed that its single ray shall upon the altar 
smoke. The purpose of the preparations is to furnish the magic agent with 
elements of corporeal appearance, and to ease as much as possible the tension of 
imagination, which could not be exalted without danger into the absolute 
illusion of dream. For the rest, it will be easily understood that a beam of 
sunlight, or the ray of a lamp, coloured variously, and falling upon curling and 
irregular smoke, can in no way create a perfect image. The chafing-dish 
containing the sacred fire should be in the centre of the oratory, and the altar 
of perfumes close by. The operator must turn towards the east to pray, and the 
west to invoke; he must be either alone or assisted by two persons preserving 
the strictest silence ; he must wear the magical vestments, which we have 
described in the seventh chapter, and must be crowned with vervain and gold. He 
should bathe before the operation, and all his under garments must be of the 
most intact and scrupulous cleanliness. The ceremony should begin with a prayer 
suited to the genius of the spirit about to be invoked and one which would be 
approved by himself if he still lived. For example, it would be impossible to 
evoke Voltaire by reciting prayers in the style of St. Bridget. For the great 
men of antiquity, we may see the hymns of Cleanthes or Orpheus, with the 
adjuration terminating the Golden Verses of Pythagoras. In our own evocation of 
Apollonius, we used the magical philosophy of Patricius for the ritual, 
containing the doctrines of Zoroaster and the writings of Hermes Trismegistus. 
We recited the Nuctemeron of Apollonius in Greek with a loud voice and added the 
following conjuration :- </P>
<P>&quot;Vouchsafe to be present, O Father of All, and thou Thrice Mighty 
Hermes, Conductor of the Dead. Asclepius son of Hephaistus, Patron of the 
Healing Art; and thou Osiris, Lord of strength and vigour, do thou thyself be 
present too. Arnebascenis, Patron of Philosophy, and yet again Asclepius, son of 
Imuthe, who presidest over poetry.</P>
<P>&quot;Apollonius, Apollonius, Apollonius, Thou teachest the Magic of 
Zoroaster, son of Oromasdes; and this is the worship of the Gods.&quot;</P>
<P>For the evocation of spirits belonging to religions issued from Judaism, the 
following kabalistic invocation of Solomon should be used, either in Hebrew, or 
in any other tongue with which the spirit in question is known to have been 
familiar</P>
<P>&quot;Powers of the Kingdom, be ye under my left foot and in my right hand! 
Glory and Eternity, take me by the two shoulders, and direct me in the paths of 
victory Mercy and Justice, be ye the equilibrium and splendour of my life ! 
Intelligence and Wisdom, crown me ! Spirits of <I>Malchuth, </I>lead me betwixt 
the two pillars upon which rests the whole edifice of the temple ! Angels of 
<I>Netsah </I>and <I>Hod, </I>strengthen me upon the cubic stone of <I>Jesod! 
</I>O <I>Gedulael ! </I>O <I>Geburael ! </I>O <I>Tiphereth ! Binael, </I>be thou 
my love ! <I>Ruach Hochmael, </I>be thou my light ! Be that which thou art and 
thou shalt be, O <I>Ketheriel ! </I>Tschim, assist me in the name of <I>Saddai 
</I>Cherubim, be my strength in the name of <I>Adonai ! </I>Bemi-Elohim, be my 
brethren in the name of the Son, and by the power of <I>Zebaoth </I>! Eloim, do 
battle for me in the name of <I>Tetragrammation </I>! Malachim, protect me in 
the name of <I>Jod He Vau He ! </I>Seraphim, cleanse my love in the name of 
<I>Elvoh </I>! Hasmalim, enlighten me with the splendours of <I>Eloi </I>and 
Shechinah ! Aralim, act! Ophanim, revolve and shine! Hajoth a Kadosh, cry, 
speak, roar, bellow Kadosh, Kadosh, Kadosh, <I>Saddai, Adonai, Jotchaveh, 
Eieazereie </I>: Hallelu-jah, Hallelu-jah, Hallelu-jah. Amen.'</P>
<P>It should be remembered above all, in conjurations, that the names of Satan, 
Beelzebub, Adramelek, and others do not designate spiritual unities, but legions 
of impure spirits.</P>
<P>&quot;Our name is legion, for we are many,&quot; says the spirit of darkness 
in the Gospel. Number constitutes the law, and progress takes place inversely in 
hell-that is to say, the most advanced in Satanic development, and consequently 
the most degraded, are the least intelligent and feeblest. Thus, a fatal law 
drives the demons downward when they wish and believe themselves to be 
ascending. So also those who term themselves chiefs are the most impotent and 
despised of all. As to the horde of perverse spirits, they tremble before an 
unknown, invisible, incomprehensible, capricious, implacable chief, who never 
explains his law, whose arm is ever stretched out to strike those who fail to 
understand him. They give this phantom the names of Baal, Jupiter, and even 
others more venerable, which cannot, without profanation, be pronounced in hell. 
But this Phantom is only a shadow and remnant of God, disfigured by their 
willful perversity, and persisting in their imagination like a vengeance of 
justice and a remorse of truth.</P>
<P>&quot;When the evoked spirit of light manifests with dejected or irritated 
countenance, we must offer him a moral sacrifice, that is, be inwardly disposed 
to renounce whatever offends him; and before leaving the oratory, we must 
dismiss him, saying: &quot; May peace be with thee! I have not wished to trouble 
thee; do thou torment me not. I shall labour to improve myself as to anything 
that vexes thee. I pray, and will still pray, with thee and for thee. Pray thou 
also both with' and for me, and return to thy great slumber, expecting that day 
when we shall wake together. Silence and adieu!&quot;</P>
<P>Christian, in his <I>Historie de le magie </I>(Paris, <B>1871</B>) says:-</P>
<P>&quot;The place chosen for the evocation is not an unimportant point. The 
most auspicious is undoubtedly that room which contains the last traces of the 
lamented person. If it be impossible to fulfil this condition, we must go in 
search of some isolated rural retreat which corresponds in orientation and 
aspect, as well as measurement, with the mortuary chamber.</P>
<P>&quot;The window must be blocked with boards of olive wood, hermetically 
joined, so that no exterior light may penetrate. The ceiling, the four interior 
walls, and the floor must be draped with tapestry of emerald green silk, which 
the operator must himself secure with copper nails, invoking no assistance from 
strange hands, because, from this moment, he alone may enter into this spot set 
apart from all, the arcane Oratory of the Magus. The furniture which belonged to 
the deceased, his favourite possessions and trinkets, the things on which his 
final glance may be supposed to have rested-all these must be assiduously 
collected and arranged in the order which they occupied at the time of his 
death. If none of these souvenirs can be obtained, a faithful likeness of the 
departed being must at least be procured, it must be full length, and must be 
depicted in the dress and colours which he wore during the last period of his 
life. This portrait must be set up on the eastern wall by means of copper 
fasteners, must be covered with a veil of white silk, and must be surmounted 
with a crown of those flowers which were most loved by the deceased.</P>
<P>&quot;Before this portrait there must be erected an altar of white marble, 
supported by four columns which must terminate in bull's feet. A five-pointed 
star must be emblazoned on the slab of the altar, and must be composed of pure 
copper plates. The place in the centre of the star, between the plates, must be 
large enough to receive the pedestal of 'a cup-shaped copper chafing-dish, 
containing dessicated fragments of ,,'laurel wood and alder. By the side of the 
chafing-dish must be placed a censer full of incense. The skin of a 'white and 
spotless ram must be stretched beneath the alter, and on it must be emblazoned 
another pentagram drawn with parallel lines of azure blue, golden yellow, 
emerald green, and purple red.</P>
<P>&quot;A copper tripod must be erected in the middle of the Oratory; it must 
be perfectly triangular in form, it must be surmounted by another and similar 
chafing-dish, which must likewise contain a quantity of dried olive wood.</P>
<P>&quot;A high candelabrum of copper must be placed by the wall on the southern 
side, and must contain a single taper of purest white wax, which must alone 
illuminate the mystery of the evocation.</P>
<P>&quot;The white colour of the altar, of the ram's skin, and of the veil, is 
consecrated to Gabriel, the planetary archangel of the moon, and the Genius of 
mysteries ; the green of the copper and the tapestries is dedicated to the 
Genius of Venus.</P>
<P>&quot;The altar and tripod must both be encompassed by a magnetized iron 
chain, and by three garlands composed of the foliage and blossoms of the myrtle, 
the olive, and the rose.</P>
<P>&quot;Finally, facing the portrait, and on the eastern side, there must be a 
canopy, also draped with emerald silk, and supported by two triangular columns 
of olive wood, plated with purest copper. On the North and South sides, between 
each of these columns and the wall, the tapestry must fall in long folds to the 
ground, forming a kind of tabernacle; which must be open on the eastern side. At 
the foot of each column there must be a sphinx of white marble, with a cavity in 
the top of the head to receive spices for burning. It is beneath this canopy 
that the apparitions will manifest, and it should be remembered that the Magus 
must turn to the east for prayer, and to the west for evocation.</P>
<P>&quot;Before entering this little sanctuary, devoted to the religion of 
remembrance, the operator must be clothed in a vestment of azure, fastened by 
clasps of copper, enriched with a single emerald. He must wear upon his head a 
tiara surrounded by a floriated circle of twelve emeralds, and a crown of 
violets. On his breast must be the talisman of Venus depending from a ribbon of 
azure silk. On the annular finger of his left hand must be a copper ring 
containing a turquoise. His feet must be covered with shoes of azure silk, and 
he must be provided with a fan of swan <B>5</B> feathers to dissipate, if 
needful, the smoke of the perfumes.</P>
<P>&quot;The Oratory and all its objects must be consecrated on a Friday, during 
the hours which are set apart to the Genius of Venus. This consecration is 
performed by burning violets and roses in a fire of olive wood. A shaft must be 
provided in the Oratory for the passage of the smoke, but care must be taken to 
prevent the admission of light through this channel.</P>
<P>&quot;When these preparations are finished, the operator must impose on 
himself a retreat of one-and -twenty days, beginning on the anniversary of the 
death of the beloved being. During this period he must refrain from conferring 
on any one the least of those marks of affection which he was accustomed to 
bestow on the departed he must be absolutely chaste, alike in deed and thought; 
he must take daily but one repast, consisting of bread, wine, roots, and fruits. 
These three conditions are indispensable to success in evocation, and their 
accomplishment requires complete isolation.</P>
<P>&quot;Every day, shortly before mid-night, the Magus must assume his 
consecrated dress. On the stroke of the mystic hour, - he must enter the 
Oratory, bearing a lighted candle in his right hand, and in the other an 
hour-glass. The candle must be fixed in the candelabra, and the hour-glass on 
the altar to register the flight of time. The operator must then proceed to 
replenish the garland and the floral crown. Then he shall unveil the portrait, 
and erect it immovable in front of the altar, being thus with his face to the 
East, he shall softly go over in his mind the cherished recollections he 
possesses of the beloved and departed being.</P>
<P>&quot;When the upper reservoir of the hour-glass is empty the time of 
contemplation will be over. By the flame of the taper the operator must then 
kindle the laurel wood and alder in the chafing-dish which stands on the altar; 
then, taking a pinch of incense from the censer, let him cast it thrice upon the 
fire, repeating the following words Glory be to the Father of life universal in 
the splendour of the infinite altitude, and peace in the twilight of the 
immeasurable depths to all Spirits of good will</P>
<P>&quot;Then he shall cover the portrait, and taking up his candle in his hand, 
shall depart from the Oratory, walking backward at a slow pace as far as the 
threshold. The same ceremony must be fulfilled at the same hour during every day 
of the retreat, and at each visit the crown which is above the portrait, and the 
garlands of the altar and tripod must be carefully renewed. The withered leaves 
and flowers must be burnt each evening in a room adjoining the Oratory.</P>
<P>&quot;When the twenty-first day has arrived, the Magus must do his best to 
have no communication with any one, but if this be impossible, he must not be 
the first to speak, and he must postpone all business till the morrow. On the 
stroke of noon, he must arrange a small circular table in the Oratory, and cover 
it with a new napkin of unblemished whiteness. It must be garnished with two 
copper chalices, an entire loaf, and a crystal flagon of the purest wine. The 
bread must be broken and not cut, and the wine emptied in equal portions into 
the two cups. Half of this mystic communion. which must be his sole nourishment 
on this supreme day, shall be offered by the operator to the dead, and by the 
light of the one taper he must eat his own share, standing before the veiled 
portrait. Then he shall retire as before, walking backward as far as the 
threshold, and leaving the ghost's share of the bread and wine upon the 
table.</P>
<P>&quot;When the solemn hour of the evening has at length arrived the Magus 
shall carry into the Oratory some well-dried cypress wood, which he shall set 
alight on the altar and the tripod. Three pinches of incense shall be cast on 
the altar flame in honour of the Supreme Potency which manifests itself by Ever 
Active Intelligence and by Absolute Wisdom. When the wood of the two 
chafing-dishes has been reduced to embers, he must renew the triple offering of 
incense on the altar, and must cast some seven times on the fire in the tripod ; 
at each evaporation of the consecrated perfume he must repeat the previous 
doxology, and then turning to the East, he must call upon God by the prayer of 
that religion which was professed by the person whom he desires to evoke.</P>
<P>&quot;When the prayers are over he must reverse his position and with his 
face to the West, must enkindle the chafing-dishes on the head of each sphinx, 
and when the cypress is fully ablaze he must heap over it well-dried violets and 
roses. Then let him extinguish the candle which illuminates the Oratory, and 
falling on his knees before the canopy, between the two columns, let him 
mentally address the beloved person with a plenitude of faith and affection. Let 
him solemnly entreat it to appear and renew this interior adjuration seven 
times, under the auspices of the seven providential Genii, endeavouring during 
the whole of the time to exalt his soul above the natural weakness of humanity. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Finally, the operator, with closed eyes, and with hands covering his 
face, must call the invoked person in a loud but gentle voice, pronouncing three 
times all the names which he bore.</P>
<P>&quot;Some moments after the third appeal, he must extend his arms in the 
form of a cross, and lifting up his eyes, he will behold the beloved being, in a 
recognisable manner, in front of him. That is to say, he will perceive that 
ethereal substance separated from the perishable terrestrial body, the fluidic 
envelope of the soul, which Kabalistic initiates have termed the <I>Perispirit. 
</I>This substance preserves the human form but is emancipated from human 
infirmities, and is energised by the special characteristics whereby the 
imperishable individuality of our essence is manifested. Evoked and Evoker can 
then inter-communicate intelligibly by a mutual and mysterious 
thought-transmission.</P>
<P>&quot;The departed soul will give counsel to the operator; it will 
occasionally reveal secrets which may be beneficial to those whom it loved on 
earth, but it will answer no question which has reference to the desires of the 
flesh; it will discover no buried treasures, nor will it unveil the secrets of a 
third person ; it is silent on the mysteries of the superior existence to which 
it has now attained. In certain cases, it will, however, declare itself either 
happy or in punishment. If it be the latter, it will ask for the prayer of the 
Magus, or for some religious observance, which we must unfailingly fulfill. 
Lastly, it will indicate the time when the evocation may be renewed.</P>
<P>&quot;When it has disappeared, the operator must turn to the East, rekindle 
the fire on the altar, and make a final offering of incense. Then he must detach 
the crown and the garlands, take up his candle, and retire with his face to the 
West till he is out of the Oratory. His last duty is to burn the final remains 
of the flowers and leaves. Their ashes, united to those which have been 
collected during the time of retreat, must be mixed with myrtle seed, and 
secretly buried in a field at a depth which will secure it from disturbance of 
the ploughshare.&quot;</P>
<P>The last two examples are, of course, those of white&quot; <I>necromancy. 
</I>The procedure followed by savage tribes is of course totally different. 
Among certain Australian tribes the necromants are called Birraark. It is said 
that a Birraark was supposed to be initiated by the &quot; mrarts&quot; (ghosts) 
when they met him wandering in the bush. It was from the ghosts that he obtained 
replies to questions concerning events passing at a distance, or yet to happen, 
which might be of interest or moment to his tribe. An account of a spiritual 
stance in the bush is given in Kamilaroi and Kurnai&quot; (p. <B>254</B>) The 
fires were let down the Birraark uttered the cry Coo-ee' at intervals. At length 
a distant reply was heard, and shortly afterwards the sound as of persons 
jumping on the ground in succession. A voice was then heard in the gloom asking 
in a strange intonation What is wanted ? ' At the termination of the stance, the 
spirit voice said, We are going.' Finally, the Birraark was found in the top of 
an almost inaccessible tree, apparently asleep.&quot; </P><I>
<P>(See also </I><B>New Zealand.</B>)</P>
<P>In Japan, ghosts can be raised in various ways. One mode is to &quot;put into 
an andon&quot; (a paper lantern in a frame), &quot; a hundred rushlights, and 
repeat an incantation of a hundred lines. One of these rushlights is taken out 
at the end of each line, and the would-be ghost-seer then goes out in the dark 
with one light still burning, and blows it out, when the ghost might to appear. 
Girls who have lost their lovers by death often try that sorcery.&quot;</P>
<P>The mode of procedure as practised in Scotland was thus. The haunted room was 
made ready. Re, who was to do the daring deed, about nightfall entered the room, 
bearing with him a table, a chair, a candle, a compass, a crucifix if one could 
be got, and a Bible. With the compass he cast a circle on the middle of the 
floor, large enough to hold the chair and the table. He placed within the circle 
the chair and the table, and on the table he laid the Bible and the crucifix 
beside the lighted candle. If he had not a crucifix, then he drew the figure of 
a cross on the floor within the circle. When all this was done, he rested 
himself on the chair, opened the Bible, and waited for the coming of the spirit. 
Exactly at midnight the spirit came. Sometimes the door opened slowly, and there 
glided in noiselessly a lady sheeted in white, with a face of woe and told her 
story to the man on his asking her in the name of God what she wanted. What she 
wanted was done in the morning, and the spirit rested ever after. Sometimes the 
spirit rose from the floor, and sometimes came forth from the wall. One there 
was who burst into the room with a strong bound, danced wildly round the circle, 
and flourished a long whip round the man's head, but never dared to step within 
the circle. During a pause in his frantic dance he was asked, in God's name, 
what he wanted. He ceased his dance and told his wishes. His wishes were carried 
out, and the spirit was in peace.&quot;</P>
<P>In Wraxall's &quot; Memoirs of the Courts of Berlin, Dresden, Warsaw, and 
Vienna&quot; there is an amusing account of the raising of the ghost of the 
Chevalier de Saxe. Reports had been circulated that at his palace at Dresden 
there was secreted a large sum of money, and it was urged that if his spirit 
could be compelled to appear, interesting secrets might be extorted from him. 
Curiosity, combined with avarice, accordingly prompted his principal heir, 
Prince Charles, to try the experiment. and, on the appointed night, Schrepfer 
was the operator in raising the apparition. He commenced his proceedings by 
retiring into the corner of the gallery, where, kneeling down with many 
mysterious ceremonies, lie invoked the spirit to appear. At length a loud 
clatter was heard at all the windows on the outside, resembling more the effect 
produced by a number of wet fingers drawn over the edge of glasses than anything 
else to which it could well be compared. This sound announced the arrival of the 
good spirits, and was shortly followed by a yell of a frightful and unusual 
nature, which indicated the presence of malignant spirits. Schrepfer continued 
his invocations, when &quot; the door suddenly opened with violence, and 
something that resembled a black ball or globe rolled into the room. It was 
enveloped in smoke or cloud, in the midst of which appeared a human face, like 
the countenance of the Chevalier de Saxe, from which issued a loud and angry 
voice, exclaiming in German, Carl, was wollte du mit mich ? &quot;- Charles, 
what would thou do with me ? By reiterated exorcisms Schrepfer finally dismissed 
the apparition, and the terrified spectators dispersed fully convinced of his 
magical powers.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Neoplatonism :</B> A mystical philosophic system initiated by Plotinus of 
Alexandria A.D. <B>233, </B>which combined the philosophy of ancient Greece with 
more modern spiritual cravings. Although to some extent founded on the teach-log 
of Plato, it was undoubtedly' sophisticated by a deep mysticism, which in all 
probability emanated from the traditions of the land in which it originated. To 
a great extent it coloured the thought of medieval mysticism and magic. 
Plotinus, its founder, commenced the study of philosophy in Alexandria at the 
age of <B>28</B>. He early experienced an earnest desire to reach the truth 
concerning existence, and to that end made a deep study of the dialogues of 
Plato and the metaphysics of Aristotle. He practised the most severe 
austerities, and attempted to live what he called the angelic &quot; life, or 
the life of the disembodied in the body. He was greatly drawn to Apollonius of 
Tyana by reading his <I>Life </I>by Philostratus, and gave credence to many of 
the marvels recorded therein. The union of philosopher and priest in the 
character of Apollonius fired the imagination of Plotinus, and in his 
Pythagorean teachings the young student discovered the elements of both 
Orientalism and Platonism,-for both Pythagoras and Plato strove to escape the 
sensuous, and to realise in contemplative abstraction that tranquility superior 
to desire and passion which made men approach the gods; but in the hands of the 
later Pythagoreans and Platonists, the principles of the Hellenic masters 
degenerated into a species of theurgic freemasonry. Many of the Pythagoreans had 
joined the various Orphic associations, and indeed had sunk to be mere itinerant 
vendors of charms.</P>
<P>It is probable that at Alexandria Plotinus heard from Orientals the 
principles of eastern theosophy, which he did not find in Plato. But everywhere 
he found a growing indifference to religion as known to the more ancient Greeks 
and Egyptians. By this time, the Pantheons of Greece, Rome and Egypt, had become 
fused in the worship of Serapis, and this fusion had been forwarded by the works 
of Plutarch, Apuleius, and Lucian. The position of philosophy at this time was 
by no means a strong one. In fact speculation had given place to ethical 
teaching. and philosophy was regarded more as a branch of literature, or an 
elegant recreation. Plotinus persuaded himself that philosophy and religion 
should be one; that speculation should be a search after God. It was at this 
time that he first heard of Ammonius Saccas, who shortly before had been a 
porter in the streets of Alexandria, and who lectured upon the possibilities of 
reconciling Plato and Aristotle. &quot;Scepticism,&quot; said Ammonius, 
&quot;was death.&quot; He recommended men to travel back across the past, and 
out of the whole bygone world of thought to construct a system greater than any 
of its parts. This teaching formed an epoch in the life of Plotinus, who was 
convinced that Platonism, exalted into a species of illuminism and drawing to 
itself like a magnet all the scattered truth of the bygone ages. could alone 
preserve mankind from scepticism. He occupied himself only with the most 
abstract questions concerning knowledge and being. &quot;Truth,&quot; according 
to him, &quot;is not the agreement of our comprehension of an external object 
with the object itself, but rather the agreement of the mind with itself. For 
the philosopher the objects we contemplate, and that which comtemplates are 
identical: both are thought.&quot; All truth is then easy. Reduce the soul to 
its most perfect simplicity, and we find it is capable of exploration into the 
infinite; indeed it becomes one with the infinite. This is the condition of 
ecstasy, and to accomplish it a stoical austerity and asceticism was necessary. 
The Neoplatonists were thus ascetics and enthusiasts. Plato was neither. 
According to Plotinus, the mystic contemplates the divine perfection in himself; 
all worldly things and logical distinctions vanishing the period of ecstasy. 
This, of course, is purely Oriental and not Platonic at all. Plotinus regards 
the individual existence as phenomenal and transitory, and subordinates reason 
to ecstasy where the Absolute is in question. It is only at the end of his chain 
of reasoning that he introduces the supernatural. He is flist a rationalist, 
afterwards a mystic, and only a mystic when he finds that he cannot employ the 
machinery of reason. The letter of Plotinus, written about <B>200</B> A.D. well 
embodies his ideas on these beads, and is as follows:-</P><I>
<P>&quot;Plotinus to Flaccus.-I </I>applaud your devotion to philosophy; I 
rejoice to hear that your soul has set sail, like the returning Ulysses.;...for 
its native land-that glorious, that only real country-the world of unseen truth. 
To follow philosophy, the senator Rogatianus, one of the noblest of my 
disciples, gave up the other day all but the whole of his patrimony, set free 
his slaves, and surrendered all the honours of his station.</P>
<P>&quot;Tidings have reached us that Valerian has been defeated and is now in 
the hands of Sapor. The threats of Franks and Allemanni, of Goths and Persians, 
are alike terrible by turns to our degenerate Rome. In days like these, crowded 
with incessant calamities, the inducements to a life of contemplation are more 
than ever strong. Even my quiet existence seems now to grow somewhat sensible of 
the advance of years. Age alone I am unable to debar from my retirement. I am 
weary already of this prison-house, the body, and calmly await the day when the 
divine nature within me shall. be set free from matter.</P>
<P>&quot;The Egyptian priests used to tell me that a single touch with the wing 
of their holy bird could charm the crocodile into torpor; it is not thus 
speedily, my dear friend, that the pinions of your soul will have power to still 
the untamed body. The creature will yield only to watchful, strenuous constancy 
of habit. Purify your soul from all undue hope and fear about earthly things, 
mortify the body, deny self,-affections as well as appetites, and the inner eye 
will begin to exercise its clear and solemn vision.</P>
<P>&quot;You ask me to tell you how we know, and what 'is our criterion of 
certainty. To write is always irksome to me. But for the continual solicitations 
of Porphyry, I should not have left a line to survive me. For your own sake, and 
for your father's, my reluctance shall be overcome.</P>
<P>&quot;External objects present us only with appearances. Concerning them, 
therefore, we may be said to posses opinion rather than knowledge. The 
distinctions in the actual world of appearance are of import only to ordinary 
and practical men. Our question lies within the ideal reality which exists 
behind appearance. How does the mind perceive these ideas? Are they without us, 
and is the reason, like sensation, occupied with objects external to itself? 
What certainty could we then have, what assurance that our perception was 
infallible ? The object perceived would be a something different from the mind 
perceiving it. We should have then an image instead of reality. It would be 
monstrous to believe for a moment that the mind was unable to perceive ideal 
truth exactly as it is, and that we had not certainty and real knowledge 
concerning the world of intelligence. It follows, therefore, that this region of 
truth is not to be investigated as a thing external to us, and so only 
imperfectly known. It is <I>within </I>us. Here the objects we contemplate and 
that which contemplates are identical,-both are thought. The subject cannot 
surely <I>know </I>an object different from itself. The world of ideas lies 
within our intelligence. Truth, therefore, is not the agreement of our 
apprehension of an external object with the object itself. It is the agreement 
of the mind with itself Consciousness, therefore, is the sole basis of 
certainty. The mind is its own witness. Reason sees in itself that which is 
above itself as its source and again, that which is below itself as still itself 
once more.</P>
<P>&quot;Knowledge has three degrees - Opinion, Science, Illumination. The means 
or instrument of the first is sense; of the second, dialectic; of the third 
intuition. To the last I subordinate reason. It is absolute knowledge founded on 
the identity of the mind knowing with the object known. </P>
<P>&quot;There is a raying out of all orders of existence, an external emanation 
from the ineffable One (prudos). There is again a returning impulse, drawing all 
upwards and inwards towards the centre from whence all came (epistrophe). Love, 
as Plato in the <I>Banquet </I>beautifully says, is the child of Poverty and 
Plenty. In the amorous quest of the soul after the Good, lies the painful sense 
of fall and deprivation. But that Love is blessing, is salvation, is our 
guardian genius; without it the centrifugal law would overpower us, and sweep 
our souls out far from their source toward the cold extremities of the Material 
and the Manifold. The wise man recognises the idea of the Good within him. This 
he develops by withdrawal into the Holy Place of his own soul. He who does not 
understand how the soul contains the Beautiful within itself, seeks to realize 
beauty without, by laborious production. His aim should rather be to concentrate 
and simplify, and so to expand his being; instead of going out into the 
Manifold, to forsake it 'for the One, and so to float upwards towards the divine 
fount of being whose stream flows within him.</P>
<P>&quot;You ask, how can we know the Infinite? I answer, not by reason. It is 
the office of reason to distinguish and define. The Infinite, therefore, cannot 
be ranked among its objects. You can only apprehend the Infinite by a faculty 
superior to reason, by entering into a state in which you are your finite self 
no longer, in which the Divine Essence is communicated to you. This is Ecstasy. 
It is the liberation of your mind from its finite consciousness. Like only can 
apprehend like; when you thus cease to be finite, you become one with the 
Infinite. In the reduction of your soul to its simplest self (aplosis), its 
divine essence, you realize this Union, this Identity (enosin)</P>
<P>&quot;But this sublime condition is not of permanent duration. It is only now 
and then that we can enjoy this elevation (mercifully made possible for us) 
above the limits of the body and the world. I myself have realized it but three 
times as yet, and Porphyry hitherto not once. All that tends to purify and 
elevate the mind will assist you in this attainment, and facilitate the approach 
and the recurrence of these happy intervals. There are, then, different roads by 
which this end may be reached. The love of beauty which exalts the poet; that 
devotion to the One and that ascent of science which makes the ambition of the 
philosopher; and that love and those prayers by which some devout and ardent 
soul tends in its moral purity towards perfection. These are the great highways 
conducting to that height above the actual and the particular where we stand in 
the immediate presence of the Infinite, who shines out as from the deeps of the 
soul.&quot;</P>
<P>Plotinus appears to have been greatly indebted to Numenius for some of the 
ideas peculiar to his system. Numenius attempted to harmonise Pythagoras and 
Plato, to elucidate and confirm the opinions of both by the religious dogmas of 
the Egyptians, the Magi and the Brahmans; and he believed that Plato was 
indebted to the Hebrew as well as to the Egyptian theology for much of his 
wisdom. Like Plotinus he was puzzled that the immutable One could find it 
possible to create the Manifold without self-degradation, and he therefore 
posited a Being whom he calls the Demi-urge, or Artificer, who merely carried 
out the will of God in constructing the universe.</P>
<P>Taken in a nutshell, the mysticism of Plotinus is as follows: One cannot know 
God in any partial or finite manner; to know him truly we must escape from the 
finite, from all that is earthly, from the very gifts of God to God Himself, and 
know him in the infinite way by receiving, or being received into him directly. 
To accomplish this, and to attain this identity, we must withdraw into our 
inmost selves, into our own essence, which alone is Susceptible of blending with 
the Divine Essence. Hence inmost is the highest, and as with all systems of 
mysticism introversion is ascension, and God is found within.</P>
<P>Porphyry entered the school of Plotinus when it had become an institution' of 
some standing. At first he strongly opposed the teachings of his master, but 
soon became his most devoted scholar. He directed a fierce assault on 
Christianity, and at the same time launched strictures at Paganism; hot both 
forces were too strong for him. The attempt of the school to combine religion 
and philosophy robbed the first of its only power, and the last of its only 
principle. Religion in the hands of the Neoplatonists lost all sanctity and 
authoritativeness, and philosophy all scientific precision, and the attempt to 
philosophise superstition ended in mere absurdity. But they succeeded in one 
thing, and that was in making philosophy superstitious-no very difficult 
task.</P>
<P>Porphyry modified the doctrine of Plotinus regarding ecstasy, by stating that 
in that condition the mind does not lose its consciousness of personality. He 
calls it a dream in which the soul, dead to the world, rises to a species of 
divine activity, to an elevation above reason, action and liberty. He believed 
in a certain order of evil genii, who took pleasure in hunting wild beasts, and 
others of whom hunted souls that had escaped from the fetters of the body; so 
that to escape them, the soul must once more take refuge in the flesh. 
Porphyry's theosophic conceptions, based on those of Plotinus, were strongly and 
ably traversed by the theurgic mysteries of lamblichus, to whom the priest was a 
prophet full of deity. Criticising Porphyry, lamblichus says:-</P>
<P>&quot;Often, at the moment of inspiration, or when the afflatus has subsided, 
a fiery Appearance is seen,-the entering or departing Power. Those who are 
skilled in this wisdom can tell by the character of this glory the rank of 
divinity who has seized for the time the reins of the mystic's soul, and guides 
it as he will. Sometimes the body of the man subject to this influence is 
violently agitated, sometimes it is rigid and motionless. In some instances 
sweet music is heard, in others, discordant and fearful sounds. The person of 
the subject has been known to dilate and tower to a superhuman height; in other 
cases, it has been lifted up into the air. Frequently, not merely the ordinary 
exercise of reason, but sensation and animal life would appear to have been 
suspended; and the subject of the afflatus has not felt the application of fire, 
has been pierced with spits, cut with knives, and been sensible of no pain. Yea, 
often, the more the body and the mind have been alike enfeebled by vigil and by 
fasts, the more ignorant or mentally imbecile a youth may be who is brought 
under this influence, the more freely and unmixedly will the divine power be 
made manifest. So clearly are these wonders the work, not of human skill or 
wisdom, but of supernatural agency l Characteristics such as these I have 
mentioned, are the marks of the true inspiration.</P>
<P>&quot;Now, there are, O Agathocles, four great orders of spiritual 
existence,-Gods, Daemons, Heroes or Demi-gods, and Souls. You will naturally be 
desirous to learn how the apparition of a God or a Daemon is distinguished from 
those of Angels, Principalities, or Souls. Know, then, that their appearance to 
man corresponds to their nature, and that they always manifest themselves to 
those who invoke them in a manner consonant with their rank in the hierarchy of 
spiritual natures. The appearances of Gods are uniform, those of Daemons 
various. The Gods shine with a benign aspect. When a God manifests himself, he 
frequently appears to hide sun or moon, and seems as he descends too vast for 
earth to contain. Archangels are at once awful and mild; Angels yet more 
gracious; Daemons terrible. Below the four leading classes I have mentioned are 
placed the malignant Daemons, the Anti-gods.</P>
<P>&quot;Each spiritual order has gifts of its own to bestow on the initiated 
who evoke them. The Gods confer health of body, power and purity of mind, and, 
in short, elevate and restore our natures to their proper principles. Angels and 
Archangels have at their command only subordinate bestowments. Daemons, however, 
are hostile to the aspirant,-afflict both body and mind, and hinder our escape 
from the sensuous. Principalities, who govern the sublunary elements, confer 
temporal advantages. Those of a lower rank, who preside over matter, often 
display their bounty in material gifts. Souls that are pure are, like Angels, 
salutary in their influence. I heir appearance encourages the soul in its upward 
efforts. Heroes stimulate to great actions. All these powers depend, in a 
descending chain, each species on that immediately above it<B>. </B>Good Daemons 
are seen surrounded by the emblems of blessing, Daemons who execute judgment 
appear with the instruments of punishment.</P>
<P>&quot;There is nothing unworthy of belief in what you have been told 
concerning the sacred sleep, and divination by dreams. I explain it thus :-</P>
<P>&quot;The soul has a two-fold life, a lower and a higher. In sleep that soul 
is freed from the constraint of the body, and enters, as one emancipated, on its 
divine life of intelligence. Then, as the noble faculty which beholds the 
objects that truly are--the objects in the world of intelligence - stirs within, 
and awakens to its power, who can be surprised that the mind, which contains in 
itself the principles of all that happens, should, in this its state of 
liberation, discern the future in those antecedent principles which will make 
that future what it is to be? The nobler part of the soul is thus united by 
abstraction to higher natures, and becomes a participant in the wisdom and 
foreknowledge of the Gods.</P>
<P>&quot;Recorded examples of this are numerous and well-authenticated; 
instances occur, too, every day. Numbers of sick, by sleeping in the temple of 
AEsculapius, have had their cure revealed to them in dreams vouchsafed by the 
god. Would not Alexander's army have perished but for a dream- in which 
Dionysius pointed out the means of safety ? Was not the siege of Aphutis raised 
through a dream sent by Jupiter Ammon to Lysander? The nighttime of the body is 
the day-time of the soul.&quot;</P>
<P>We thus see how in the process of time the principles on which the system of 
Plotinus rested were surrendered little by little, while divination and 
evocation were practised with increasing frequency. Plotinus had declared the 
possibility of the absolute identification of the divine 'with human nature-the 
broadest possible basis for mysticism. Porphyry took up narrower ground and 
contended that in the union which takes place in ecstasy, we still retain 
consciousness of personality. lamblichus diminished the real principle of 
mysticism still farther in theory, and denied that man has a faculty, eternally 
active and in accessible, to passion: so that the intellectual ambition. so 
lofty in Plotinus subsided among the followers of lamblichus into magical 
practice.</P>
<P>Proclus was the last of the Greek Neoplatonists. He elaborated the Trinity of 
Plotinus into a succession of impalpable triads, and surpassed lamblichus in his 
devotion to the practice of theurgy. With him, theurgy was the art which gives 
man the magical passwords that carry him- through barrier after barrier, 
dividing species from species of the upper existences, till at the summit of the 
hierarchy he arrives at the highest. Above all being is God, the Non-Being, who 
is apprehended only by negation. When we are raised out of our weakness and on a 
level with God, it seems as though reason were silenced for then we are above 
reason. In short we become intoxicated with God. Proclus was an adept in the 
ritual of invocations among every people in the world, and a great magical 
figure. With the advance of Byzantinism, he represented the old world of Greek 
thought, and even those who wrote against him as a heathen show the influence he 
exercised on their doctrines. Thus Dionysius attempted to accommodate the 
philosophy of Proclus to Christianity, and greatly admired his asceticism. The 
theology of the Neoplatonists was always in the first instance a mere matter of 
logic. They confounded Universals with Causes. The highest became with them 
merely the most comprehensive. As has been said <I>Neoplatonism </I>exercised 
great power among the scholiasts and magicians of the middle ages. In fact all 
that medievalism knew of Plato was through the medium of the Neoplatonists. In 
Germany in the fourteenth century it became a vivifying principle; for although 
its doctrine of emanation was abandoned, its allegorical explanation, its 
exaltation of the spirit above the letter was retained, and Platonism and 
mysticism together created a party in the church-the sworn foes of scholasticism 
and mere lifeless orthodoxy.</P><B>

<P>New Motor, The : </B>A<B> </B>strange machine constructed in <B>1854</B> 
by<B> </B>John Murray Spear (q.v.) at the instigation of the&quot; Association 
of Electricizers,&quot; one of the bands of spirits by whom he was controlled. 
It was to derive its motive power from the magnetic store of nature, and was 
therefore to be as independent of artificial sources of energy as was the human 
body. The machine was hailed as a god-the &quot;Physical Saviour of the 
race,&quot; the &quot;New Messiah &quot;-and a certain lady, in obedience to a 
vision, went to the High Rock (Lynn, Mass.) whereon stood the New <I>Motor', 
</I>and for two hours suffered &quot;birth-pangs,&quot; whereby she judged that 
the essence of her spiritual being was imparted to the machine. At the end of 
that time it was averred that pulsations were apparent in the <I>motor. </I>A. 
J. Davis expressed the belief that the design was the work of spirits of a 
mechanical turn of mind, but was of no practical value. The <I>New Motor </I>was 
finally smashed by the inhabitants of Randolph (N.Y.) whither it had been taken. 
In all it cost its builder some two thousand dollars. In common fairness to the 
Spiritualists it may be said that the majority had no sympathy whatever with 
such an absurd scheme,</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>New Thought :</B> A present-day religion which in some of its tenets is akin 
to Christian Science, or faith-healing. Unlike Christian Science, however, it 
does not affect entirely to dispense with all material aids, as drugs, the 
setting of broken bones, and so on. Nor does it give the whole credit for the 
cure to the imagination of the patient, as does hypnotism. But striking a point 
midway between the two it gives considerable prominence to the mind in the 
healing process, while not altogether despising the doctor. Mind is considered 
as highly refined matter, and therefore the &quot; mind&quot; cure is in a 
measure a material cure. It is clear that that part of the <I>New Thought 
</I>which deals with bodily healing has its roots in the Animal Magnetism and 
Mesmerism of bygone times. So much have they in common that it is needless to 
trace mental-healing further back than Dr. Phineas Parkhurst Quimby 
(<B>1802</B>-<B>1866</B>) the first to make use of the terms ' 
mental-healing&quot; and Christian Science.&quot; Dr. Quimby was the son of a 
New Hampshire blacksmith, and was himself apprenticed to a clockmaker, having 
had but little education. At the age of thirty-six he attended a lecture on 
Mesmerism, and thereafter practised for himself. With the aid of a clairvoyant 
youth lie cured diseases, and so successful was his treatment that he soon 
adopted magnetic healing as a profession. At length, however, he got a glimpse 
of the true reason for his success-the expectation of the patient. The diagnoses 
of his clairvoyant he attributed to the latter's telepathic reading of the 
patient's own thoughts, and he judged that the treatment prescribed depended for 
its efficacy on the confidence it inspired rather than on its intrinsic merits. 
From this point he gradually evolved his doctrine that disease was a mere 
delusion, a traditional error that had fixed itself in men's minds, which it 
behoved them to be rid of as soon as might be. The way to cure disease, 
therefore, was to destroy the error on which it rested. Besides Christian 
Science, Quimby called his doctrine the Science of Health, or the Science of 
Health and Happiness. He had many disciples, among whom were Mrs. Mary Baker G. 
Eddy, the founder of the Christian Science Church. Others whose influence was 
felt more in the direction of the <I>New Thought </I>movement were the Rev. W. 
F. Evans and Mr. and Mrs. Julius Dresser, whose son, Horatio W. Dresser, remains 
one of the ablest exponents of the <I>New Thought </I>As has been said, the 
method of healing practised by this school is not considered to be entirely 
immaterial. It is no longer believed, of course, that a fluid emanates from the 
finger-tips of the operator, or that he radiates a luminous odic force; but Mr. 
Dresser himself states that the communication is of a vibratory character, made 
up of ethereal undulations directed and concentrated by the thought of the 
healer. The power is equally efficacious at a distance and may be used without 
the patient's knowledge or even against his will. This belief in action at a 
distance is something of a bug-bear to the New Thinker, who fears the ascendency 
of an evil influence as the superstitious of the Middle Ages feared bewitchment. 
But there is a spiritual aspect of the <I>New Thought </I>as well as a physical 
one. The health of the soul is as fully considered as the health of the body. 
Spiritual sanity, then, is to be procured by lifting oneself to a higher plane 
of existence, by shutting out the things of the earth and living ' in tune with 
the infinite.&quot; We must realise our own identity with the Infinite Spirit 
and open our lives to the Divine inflow. Ralph Waldo Trine, himself a New 
Thinker, says in an expressive metaphor, &quot; To recognise our own divinity 
and our intimate relation to the Universal, is to attach the belt of our 
machinery to the power-house of the Universe.&quot; In short, we must have 
sufficient self-confidence to cast our fears aside and rise unfettered into the 
Infinite.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>New Zealand :</B> Maori superstitions. Amidst the mythological personages of 
<I>New Zealand </I>&quot;the spirits of the dead&quot; ever play a very 
prominent part, and our chief interest in noticing the Maoris, lies in the fact, 
that belief in, and open communion with these spirits, still exist. The priests 
or &quot;Tohungas&quot; are unmistakably &quot;Mediums,&quot; in the modern 
sense of the term. Sometimes they are born with their gift, and sometimes they 
are devoted to the priestly office by their parents and acquire their power 
after the fashion of Eastern ecstatics, by prayer, fasting and contemplation. 
That good prophets exist amongst the Maoris has been abundantly proved. During 
the time when Great Britain busied herself in colonizing <I>New Zealand, </I>her 
officials frequently wrote home, that the Maori. would never be conquered 
wholly; information of the parties sent out to attack them; the very colour of 
the boats, and the hour when they would arrive; the number of the enemy, and all 
particulars essential to their safety, being invariably communicated to the 
tribes beforehand by their prophets or Tohungas.</P>
<P>The best natural prophets and seers amongst the Maoris are of the female sex; 
and although the missionaries try to account for the marvellous powers they 
exhibit, above all for the sound of the Spirit voice, which is a common phase in 
their communion with the dead - on the hypothesis that the women who practise ' 
the arts of sorcery,&quot; are ventriloquists - this attempted explanation 
rarely covers the ground of the intelligence which is received.</P>
<P>In his <I>Old New Zealand </I>General Cummings cites an interesting case of 
Tohungaism. A certain young chief had been appointed Registrar of births and 
deaths, then he suddenly came to a violent end. The book of registries was lost, 
and much inconvenience ensued. The man's relatives notified their intention of 
invoking his spirit, and invited General Cummings to be present at the ceremony, 
an invitation which he accepted. &quot;The appointed time came. Fires were lit. 
The Tohunga repaired to the darkest corner of the room. All was silent, save the 
sobbing of the sisters of the deceased warrior-chief. There were thirty of us, 
sitting on the rush-strewn floor, the door shut and the fire now burning down to 
embers. Suddenly there came a voice out from the partial darkness, ' Salutation, 
salutation to my family. to my tribe, to you, pakeha, my friend! ' Our feelings 
were taken by storm. The oldest sister screamed, and rushed with extended arms 
in the direction from whence the voice came. Her brother, seizing, restrained 
her by main force. Others exclaimed. &lsquo;Is it you ? Is it you ? Truly it is 
you! aue! aue! and fell quite insensible upon the floor. The older women and 
some of the aged men were not moved in the slightest degree, though believing it 
to be the spirit of the chief.</P>
<P>&quot;Whilst reflecting upon the novelty of the scene, the darkness visible' 
and the deep interest manifest, the spirit spoke again, ' Speak to me my family; 
speak to me, my tribe : speak to me, the pakeha!' At last the silence gave way, 
and the brother spoke: ' How is it with you? Is it well with you in that 
country?' The answer came, though not in the voice of the Tohunga-medium, but in 
strange sepulchral sounds : ' It is well with me; my place is a good place. I 
have seen our friends; they are all with me I' A woman from another part of the 
room now anxiously cried out, ' Have you seen my sister ? Yes, I have seen her; 
she is happy in our beautiful country.' ' Tell her my love so great for her will 
never cease. Yes, I will bear the message.' Here the native woman burst into 
tears, and my own bosom swelled in sympathy.</P>
<P>&quot;The spirit speaking again, giving directions about property and 
keepsakes, I thought I would more thoroughly test the genuineness of all this : 
and I said, ' We cannot find your book with the registered names; where have you 
concealed it ? ' The answer came instantly, ' I concealed it between the tahuhu 
of my house, and the thatch; straight over you, as you go in at the door.' The 
brother rushed out to see. All was silence. In five minutes he came hurriedly 
back, with the book in his hand I it astonished me.</P>
<P>&quot;It was now late, and the spirit suddenly said, ' Fare-well my family, 
farewell, my tribe; I go.' Those present breathed an impressive farewell, when 
the spirit cried out again, from high in the air, ' Farewell!</P>
<P>&quot;This, though seemingly tragical, is in every respect literally true. 
But what is that ? ventriloquism, the devil, or what!&hellip;&quot;</P>
<P>Mrs. Britten, in her <I>Nineteenth Century Miracles </I>says:- </P>
<P>&quot;The author has herself had several proofs of the Mediumistic power 
possessed by these 'savages' but as her experiences may be deemed of too 
personal a character, 'Se shall select our examples from other sources. One of 
these is furnished by a Mr. Marsden, a person who was well-known in the early 
days of <I>New Zealand's </I>colonial history. as a miner, who grew rich ' 
through spiritual communications.' Mr. Marsden was a gentleman who had spent 
much time amongst the Manna, and who still keeps a residence in the King 
country,' that is - the district of which they hold control. Mr. Marooned 
informed the author, that his success as a gold miner, was entirely due to a 
communication he had received through a native Woman who claimed to have the 
power of bringing down spirits-the Maoris, be it remembered, always insisting 
that the spirits descend through the air to earth to visit mortals. Mr. Marsden 
had long been prospecting unsuccessfully in the gold regions. He had a friend in 
partnership with him, to whom he was much attached, but who had been 
accidentally killed by a fall from a cliff. The Spirit of this man came 
unsolicited, on an occasion when Mr. Marsden was consulting a native seeress, 
for the purpose of endeavouring to trace out what had become of a valuable watch 
which he had lost. The voice of the spirit was first heard in the air, 
apparently above the roof of the hut in which they sat, calling Mr. Marsden by 
his familiar name of ' Mars.' Greatly startled by these sounds, several times 
repeated, at the Medium's command, he remained perfectly still until the voice 
of his friend speaking in his well-remembered Scotch accent sounded close to his 
ear, whilst a column of grey misty substance reared itself by his side. This 
apparition was plainly visible in the subdued light of the hut, to which there 
was only one open entrance, but no window'. Though he was much startled by what 
he saw and heard, Mr. Marsden had presence of mind enough to gently put his hand 
through the misty column which remained intact, as if its substance offered no 
resistance to the touch. Being admonished by an earnest whisper from the Maori 
woman, who had fallen on her knees before the apparition, to keep still, he 
obeyed, when a voice - seemingly from an immense distance off-yet speaking 
unmistakably in his friend's Scotch accents, advised him to let the watch alone 
- for it was irreparably gone-but to go to the stream on the banks of which they 
had last had a meal together trace it up for six miles and a half, and then, by 
following its course amidst the forest, he would come to a pile, which would 
make him rich, if he chose to remain so. Whilst he was waiting and listening 
breathlessly to hear more, Mr. Marsden was startled by a slight detonation at 
his side. Turning his head he observed that the column of mist was gone, and in 
its place, a quick flash, like the reflection of a candle, was all that he 
beheld. Here the stance ended, and the astonished miner left the hut, convinced 
that he had heard the Spirit of his friend talking to him. He added, that he 
followed the directions given implicitly, and came to a mass of surface gold 
lying on the stones at the bottom of the brook in the depth of the forest. This 
he gathered up, and though he prospected for several days in and about that 
spot, he never found another particle of this precious metal. That which he had 
secured he added, with a deep sigh. was indeed enough to have made him 
independent for life, had it not soon been squandered in fruitless 
speculations.&quot;</P>
<P>So deeply has the Maori mind been saturated with ages of superstition that 
among the civilised, well-educated classes there may to-day be observed numerous 
expressions and actions which have their origin in an instinctive dread of the 
supernatural. Many degrees of superstition exist among the Maoris of the present 
day, says a writer in the <I>Pall Mall Gazette. </I>In the recesses of the 
Urewera country for example, diablerie has lost little of its early potency the 
<I>tohunga </I>there remains a power in the land. Among the more enlightened 
natives a precautionary policy is generally followed; it is always wiser and 
safer, they say, to avoid conflict with the two mysterious powers <I>tapu 
</I>and <I>makuta. </I>Tapu is the less dangerous of the two; a house, an 
individual, or an article may be rendered tapu, or sacred, and if the tapu be 
disregarded harm will befall someone. But makuta is a powerful evil spell cast 
for the deliberate purpose of accomplishing harm, generally to bring about 
death. The <I>tohunga </I>is understood to be in alliance with the spirits of 
the dead. The Maori dreads death, and he fears the dead. Places of burial are 
seldom approached during the day, never at night. The spirits of the dead are 
believed to linger sometimes near places of burial. Without going to experts in 
Maori lore, who have many and varied theories to set forth, a preferable course 
is to discover what the average Maori of to-day thinks and believes respecting 
the strange powers and influences he deems are at work in the world around 
him.</P>
<P>A Maori of this type who can read and write, is under forty years of age, and 
fairly intelligent-was drawn into a lengthy conversation with the writer. He 
believed, magistrates notwithstanding, that tohungas, somehow, had far more 
power than ordinary men. He did not think they got that power from the 
&quot;tiapo&quot; (the devil?) they just were able to make themselves masters of 
men and of many things in the world. There are many degrees of Tohungaism. An 
ordinary man or woman was powerless against a <I>tohunga, </I>but one <I>tohunga 
</I>could overcome another. The speaker knew of an instance of one <I>tohunga 
</I>driving the tohunga power entirely out of a weaker rival. It was a fairly 
recent east coast occurrence. Three Maoris had accidentally permitted their pigs 
to trespass into the tohunga's potato paddock, and much damage and loss was the 
result. The <I>tohunga </I>was one of the dangerous type, and being very wroth, 
he <I>mekutued </I>the three men, all of whom promptly died. Nobody was brave 
enough to charge the <I>tohunga </I>with causing the death of the men; they were 
all afraid of this terrible <I>makuta. </I>At length another <I>tohunga </I>was 
heard of, one of very great power. This oracle was consulted, and he agreed to 
deal effectively with <I>tohunga </I>number one, and punish him for killing the 
owner of the pigs. So, following his instructions, the first-mentioned 
individual was seized, and much against his will, was conveyed to the home of 
the greater magician. Many Maoris, it should be known, stand in awe of hot 
water, they will not handle it, even for purposes connected with cooking or 
cleaning. Into a large tub of hot water the minor <I>tohunga </I>struggling 
frantically, was placed, then he was given a page torn from a Bible, which he 
was ordered to chew' and swallow. The hot water treatment, combined with the 
small portion of the white man's sacred volume, did the expected work; the man 
was no longer a <I>tohunga, </I>and fretting over his lost powers, he soon 
afterwards died.&quot;</P><I>
<P>Spiritualism.-Amongst </I>the earliest investigators in Dunedin, was a Mr. 
John Logan. Before he had become publicly identified with the cause of 
Spiritualism, an association had been formed, the members of which steadily 
pursued their investigations in private circles and semi-public gatherings. One 
of the most marked events in connection with the early development of 
Spiritualism in Dunedin, however, was the arraignment and church trial of Mr. 
Logan, the circumstances of which may be briefly summed up as follows. This 
gentleman, although holding a high position in the first Presbyterian church of 
the city, had attended circles and witnessed Spiritualistic phenomena and it was 
currently reported that one of his own near relatives was a very remarkable 
Medium. On the <STRONG>19</STRONG>th of March, <B>1873</B>, Mr. Logan was 
summoned to appear before a Church Convocation, to be held for the purpose of 
trying his case, and if necessary, dealing with his&quot; delinquency.' Mr. 
Logan was in the event deprived of his church membership.</P>
<P>In many of the principal towns besides Dunedin, circles held at first in mere 
idle curiosity, have produced their usual fruit of mediumistic power, and this 
again has extended into associative action, and organisation into local 
societies. For over a year, the Spiritualists and Liberalists of Dunedin secured 
the services of Mr. Charles Bright as their lecturer. This gentleman had once 
been attached to the editorial staff of the <I>Melbourne Argus, </I>and had 
obtained a good reputation as a capable writer, and liberal thinker. Mr. 
Bright's lectures in Dunedin were highly appreciated, and by their scholarly 
style and attractive manner, served to band together the liberal element in the 
city. In Auckland, the principal town of the North Island, the same good service 
was rendered to the cause of religious thought, by the addresses of the Rev. Mr. 
Edgar, a clergyman whose Spiritualistic doctrines, had tended to sever him from 
sectarian organisations, and draw around him, the Spiritualists of the town. 
Besides the good work effected by these gentlemen, the occasional visits of 
Messrs. Peebles, Walker, J. Tyerman, and the effect of the many private circles 
held in every portion of the islands, tended to promote a general, though quiet, 
diffusion of Spiritual thought and doctrine, throughout <I>New Zealand.</I></P>

<P>Nicolai, Christoph Friedrich : </B>(<B>1733</B>-<B>1811</B>), A German author 
and bookseller of Berlin, is interesting from the occult point of view because 
of the peculiar experiences which befell him, and of which he treats in his 
personal account read before the Royal Society of Berlin. It would be impossible 
to present the circumstances of his case, which is one of the most celebrated in 
the annals of psychology, better than in his own words.</P>
<P>&quot;In the first two months of the year <B>1791</B>,&quot; he says, &quot; 
I was much affected in my mind by several incidents of a very disagreeable 
nature; and on the <B>24</B>th of February a circumstance occurred which 
irritated me extremely. At ten o'clock in the forenoon my wife and another 
person came to console me; I was in a violent perturbation of mind, owing to a 
series of incidents which had altogether wounded my moral feelings, and from 
which I saw no possibility of relief, when suddenly I observed at the distance 
of ten paces from me a figure-the figure of a deceased person. I pointed at it, 
and asked my wife whether she did not see it. She saw nothing, but being much 
alarmed, endeavoured to compose me, and sent for the physician The figure 
remained some seven or eight minutes, and at length I became a little more calm; 
and as I was extremely exhausted, I soon afterwards fell into a troubled kind of 
slumber, which lasted for half an hour. The vision was ascribed to the great 
agitation of mind in which I had been, and it was supposed I should have nothing 
more to apprehend from that cause; but the violent affection had put my nerves 
into some unnatural state. From this arose further consequences, which require a 
more detailed description.</P>
<P>&quot;In the afternoon, a little after four o'clock, the figure which I had 
seen in the morning again appeared. I was alone when this happened, a 
circumstance which, as may be easily conceived, could not be very agreeable. I 
went therefore to the apartment of my wife, to whom I related it. But thither 
also the figure pursued me. Sometimes it was present, sometimes it vanished, but 
it was always the same standing figure. A little after six o'clock several 
stalking figures also appeared; but they had no connection with the standing 
figure. I can assign no other cause for this apparition than that, though much 
more composed in my mind, I had not been able so soon entirely to forget the 
cause of such deep and distressing vexation, and had reflected on the 
consequences of it, in order, if possible, to avoid them; and that this happened 
three hours after dinner, at the time when digestion just begins.</P>
<P>&quot;At length I became more composed with respect to the disagreeable 
incident which had given rise to the first apparition; but though I had used 
very excellent medicines and found myself in other respects perfectly well, yet 
the apparitions did not diminish, but on the contrary rather increased in 
number, and were transformed in the most extraordinary manner.</P>
<P>&quot;The figure of the deceased person never appeared to me after the first 
dreadful day, but several other figures shewed themselves afterwards very 
distinctly, sometimes such as I knew, mostly, however, of persons I did not 
know, and amongst those known to me, were the semblance of both living and 
deceased persons, but mostly the former, and I made the observation, that 
acquaintance with whom I daily conversed never appeared to me as phantasms; it 
was always such as were at a distance.</P>
<P>&quot;It is also to be noted, that these figures appeared to me at all times, 
and under the most different circumstances, equally distinct and clear. Whether 
I was alone, or in company, by broad day-light equally as in the night-time, in 
my own as well as in my neighbour's house; yet when I was at another person's 
house, they were less frequent, and when I walked the public street they very 
seldom appeared. When I shut my eyes, sometimes the figures disappeared, 
sometimes they remained even after I had closed them. If they vanished in the 
former case, on opening my eyes again, nearly the same figures appeared which I 
had seen before.</P>
<P>&quot;I sometimes conversed with my physician and my wife concerning the 
phantasms which at the time hovered around me; for in general the forms appeared 
oftener in motion than at rest. They did not always continue present-they 
frequently left me altogether, and again appeared for a short or longer space of 
time, singly or more at once; but, in general, several appeared together. For 
the most part I saw human figures of both sexes; they commonly passed to and fro 
as if they had no connection with each other, like people at a fair where all is 
bustle; sometimes they appeared to have business with one another. Once or twice 
I saw amongst them persons on horseback, and dogs and birds; these figures all 
appeared to me in their natural size, as distinctly as if they had existed in 
real life, with the several tints on the uncovered parts of the body, and with 
all the different kinds and colours of clothes. But I think, however; that the 
colours were somewhat <I>paler </I>than they are in nature.</P>
<P>&quot;None of the figures had any distinguishing characteristic, they were 
neither terrible, ludicrous, nor repulsive most of them were ordinary in their 
appearance,-some were even agreeable.</P>
<P>&quot;On the whole, the longer I continued in this state, the more did the 
number of the phantasms increase, and the apparitions became more frequent. 
About four weeks afterwards I began to hear them speak sometimes the phantasms 
spoke with one another, but for the most part they addressed themselves to me, 
these speeches were in general short, and never contained anything disagreeable. 
Intelligent and respected friends often appeared to me, who endeavoured to 
console me in my grief, which still left deep traces on my mind. This speaking I 
heard most frequently when I was alone; though I sometimes heard it in company, 
intermixed with the conversation of real persons; frequently in single phrases 
only, but sometimes even in connected discourse.</P>
<P>&quot;Though at this time I enjoyed rather a good state of health both in 
body and mind, and had become so very familiar with these phantasms. that at 
last they did not excite the least disagreeable emotion, but on the contrary 
afforded me frequent subjects for amusement and mirth yet as the disorder 
sensibly increased, and the figures appeared to me for whole days together, and 
even during the night, if I happened to awake, I had recourse to several 
medicines.&quot;</P>
<P>He then recounts how the apparitions vanished upon blood being let.</P>
<P>&quot;This was performed on the <B>20</B>th of April, at eleven o'clock in 
the forenoon. I was alone with the surgeon; but during the operation, the room 
swarmed with human forms of every description, which crowded fast one on 
another. This continued till half-past four o'clock, exactly the time when the 
digestion commences. I then observed that the figures began to move more slowly; 
soon afterwards the colours became gradually paler; every seven minutes they 
lost more and more of their intensity, without any alteration in the distinct 
figure of the apparitions. At about half-past six o'clock all the figures were 
entirely white, and moved very little; yet the forms appeared perfectly distinct 
; by degrees they became visibly less plain, without decreasing in number, as 
had often formerly been the case. The figures did not move off, neither did they 
vanish, which also had usually happened on other occasions. In this instance 
they dissolved immediately into air; of some even whole pieces remained for a 
length of time, which also by degrees were lost to the eye. At about eight 
o'clock there did not remain a vestige of any of them, and I have never since 
experienced any appearance of the same kind. Twice or thrice since that time I 
have felt a propensity. if I may be allowed to express myself, or a sensation as 
if I saw something which in a moment again was gone. I was even surprised by 
this sensation whilst writing the present account, having, in order to render it 
more accurate, perused the papers of <B>1791</B>, and recalled to my memory all 
the circumstances of that time. So little are we sometimes, even in the greatest 
composure of mind, masters of our imagination.&quot;</P>

<P>Night, Mystical, of the Sufis :</B> It was believed by the <I>Sufis </I>that 
to attain to the coveted state of mystical contemplation, it was necessary to 
close the gateway of the physical senses, so that the inner or spiritual senses 
might operate more freely. This injunction was sometimes taken literally, as by 
the Brahmin Yogis, who carefully closed eyes, ears, nose and mouth, in order to 
attain to visionary ecstasy. The <I>Mystical Night </I>is thus a shutting out of 
all external sense-impressions, of hope, fear, consciousness of self, and every 
human emotion, so that the interior light may be more clearly perceived.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Nightmare :</B> (Old English <I>night </I>and <I>mara, </I>a spectre), A 
disorder of the digestive functions during sleep, inducing the temporary belief 
that some animal or demon is sitting on the chest. Among savages and primitive 
people it is thought that the affection proceeds from the attentions of an evil 
spirit. Keysler in his very curious work, <I>Antiquitates selectae 
Septentrionales et Celticae, </I>has collected many interesting particulars 
concerning the nightmare. <I>Nachtmar, </I>he says, is from <I>Mair, </I>an old 
woman, because the spectre which appears to press upon the breast and impede the 
action of the lungs is generally in that form. The English and Dutch words 
coincide with the German. The French <I>cochemar </I>is <I>Mulier incumbens 
</I>or <I>Incuba. </I>The Swedes use <I>Mara </I>alone, as we learn from the 
<I>Historia Seucorum Gothorumque </I>of Eric Olaus, where he states that 
Valender, the son of Suercher, succeeded to the throne of his father, who was 
suffocated by a daemon in his sleep, of that kind which by the scribes is called 
<I>Mara. </I>Others,&quot; we suppose Germans,&quot; continues Keysler, 
&quot;call <B>it </B><I>Hanon Tramp. </I>The French peasantry call it <I>Dianus 
</I>which is a corruption either of Diana or of <I>Daemonium Meridianum </I>for 
it seems there is a belief (which Keysler, not improbably thinks may be derived 
from a false interpretation of an expression in the <B>91</B>st Psalm ('the 
destruction that wasteth at noon-day') that persons are most exposed to such 
attacks at that time and, therefore, women in childbed are then never left 
alone. But though the <I>Daemonium Meridianum </I>is<B> </B>often used for the 
Ephialtes, nevertheless it is more correctly any sudden and violent attack which 
deprives. the patient of his senses. In some parts of Germany, the name given to 
this disorder is <I>den alp, </I>or <I>des Alp-dructen, </I>either from the 
'mass' which appears to press on the sufferer or from <I>Alp </I>or <I>A If 
</I>(elf). In Franconia it is <I>die Drud </I>or <I>das Druddructen, </I>from 
the Druid or Weird Women, and there is a belief that it may not only be chased 
away, but be made to appear on the morrow in a human shape, and lend something 
required of it by the following charm</P>
<P>&quot;Druid to-morrow </P>
<P>So will I borrow.&quot;</P>
<P>These Druids, it seems, were not only in the habit of riding men, but horses 
also, and in order to keep them out of the stables, the salutary <I>pentalpha 
</I>(which bears the name of <I>Druden-fuss, </I>Druid's foot) should be written 
on the stable doors, in consecrated chalk, on the night of St. Walburgh. We must 
not omit that our English familiar appellation ' Trot' is traced up to ' Druid' 
&quot; a decrepit old woman such as the Sagas might be,&quot; and the same may 
perhaps be said of a Scottish Saint, Triduana or Tredwin.</P>
<P>In Ihre's Glossary, a somewhat different account of the <I>Mara </I>is given. 
Here again, we find the 'witch-riding' of horses, against which a stone amulet 
is provided by Aubrey, similar to one which we are about to notice immediately 
below.</P>
<P>Among the incantations by which the <I>nightmare </I>may be chased away, 
Reginald Scot has recorded the following in his <I>Discovery of 
Witchcraft.</I></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&quot;St. George, St. George, our lady's knight,</P>
<P>He walked by day so did he by night:</P>
<P>Until such times as. he her found,</P>
<P>He her beat and he her bound,</P>
<P>Until her troth to him plight,</P>
<P>He would not come to her that night.&quot;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&quot;Item,&quot; continues the same ingenious author, &quot;hang a stone 
over the afflicted person's bed, which stone bath naturally such a bole in it, 
as wherein a string may be put through it, and so be hanged over the diseased or 
bewitched party, be it man, woman, or horse.&quot;</P>
<P>Every reader of the above lines will be reminded of the similar charm which 
Shakespeare has put into the mouth of Edgar as Mad Tom in <I>King Lear.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P></I>
<P>&quot;Saint Withold footed thrice the Wold</P>
<P>He met the night-mare and her ninefold</P>
<P>Bid her alight,</P>
<P>And her troth plight</P>
<P>And aroint thee, witch, aroint thee.&quot;</P>
<P><B></B>&nbsp; 
<P>Another charm of earlier date occurs in Chaucer's <I>Miller's Tale. </I>When 
the simple Carpenter discovers the crafty Nicholas in his feigned abstraction, 
he thinks he may perhaps be hag-ridden, and addresses him thus:-</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&quot;I crouch the fro Elves and fro wikid wightes</P>
<P>And therewith the night-spell he seide arightes,</P>
<P>On four halvis of the house about,</P>
<P>And on the dreshfold of the dore without,</P>
<P>'Jesu Christ, and Seint Benedight,.</P>
<P>Blesse this house from evrey wikid wight,</P>
<P>Fro the night's mare, the wite paternoster,</P>
<P>Where wennist thou Seint Peter's sister.&quot;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A more modern author has pointed to some other formularies, and has noticed 
that Asmodeus was the fiend of most evil repute on these occasions. In the 
<I>Otia Imperiala </I>of Gervase of Tilbury, some other protecting charms are 
said to exist. To turn to the medical history of the Incubus Pliny has 
recommended two remedies for this complaint; one sufficiently simple, wild paeny 
seed. Another, which it would not be easy to discover in any modern 
pharmacopoeia, is a decoction in wine and oil of the tongue, eyes, liver, and 
bowels of a dragon, wherewith, after it has been left to cool all night in the 
open air, the patient should be anointed every morning and evening.</P>
<P>Dr. Bond, a physician, who tells us that he himself was much afflicted with 
the <I>nightmare, </I>published an <I>Essay on the Incubus </I>in <B>1753</B>. 
At the time at which he wrote, medical attention appears to have been very 
little called to the disease, and some of the opinions hazarded were 
sufficiently wild and inconclusive. Thus Dr. Willis said it was owing to some 
incongruous matter which is mixed with the nervous fluid in the cerebellum 
<I>(de Anima Brutorum) </I>; and Bellini thought it imaginary, and to be 
attributed to the idea of some demon which existed in the mind the day before. 
Both of these writers might have known better if they would have turned to 
Fuchsius (with whom Dr. Bond appears to be equally acquainted) who in his work 
<I>de Curandi Ratione, </I>published as early as <B>1548</B>, has an excellent 
chapter (I., <B>31</B>) on the causes, symptoms, and cure of <I>nightmare, 
</I>in which he attributes it to repletion and indigestion, and recommends the 
customary discipline.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Norton, Thomas : </B>The<B> </B>exact date of this alchemist's birth is 
wrapped in mystery, while comparatively little is recorded about his life in 
general. But at least it is known that Bristol was his native place, and that, 
in the year <B>1436</B>, he was elected to represent that town in Parliament. 
This points to his having been an upright and highly-esteemed person, and the 
conjecture is buttressed in some degree by the fact that Edward IV. made him a 
member of his privy council, and employed him repeatedly as an ambassador. At an 
early age <I>Norton </I>showed himself curious concerning alchemy and the like, 
demonstrating his predilection herein by attempting to make the personal 
acquaintance of George Ripley (q.v.), who, sometime Canon of Bridlington, was 
reputed a man of extraordinary learning, and was author of numerous alchymical 
works. For many months <I>Norton </I>sought this person in vain, but at length 
the Canon, yielding to the other's importunity, wrote to him in the following 
manner I shall not longer delay; the time is come; you shall receive this grace. 
Your honest desire and approved virtue, your love of truth, wisdom, and long 
perseverance, shall accomplish your sorrowful desires. It is necessary that, as 
soon as convenient, we speak together face to face, lest I should by writing 
betray my trust. I will make you my heir and brother in this art, as I am 
setting out to travel in foreign countries. Give thanks to God, Who next to His 
spiritual servants, honours the sons of this sacred science.&quot;</P>
<P>After receiving this very friendly and encouraging letter, <I>Norton 
</I>hurried straightway to Ripley's presence, and thereafter for upwards of a 
month the two were constantly together, the elder man taught the novice many 
things, while he even promised that, if he showed himself an apt and worthy 
pupil, he would impart to him the secret of the medicinal stone. And in due 
course this promise was fulfilled, yet it is reported that <I>Norton's </I>own 
chymical researches met with various signal disappointments. On one occasion, 
for instance, when he had almost perfected a certain tincture, his servant 
absconded with the crucible containing the precious fluid; while at a later 
time, when the alchemist was at work on the same experiment, and thought he was 
just about to reach the goal. his entire paraphernalia was stolen by a Mayoress 
of Bristol. And this defeat must have been doubly galling to the unfortunate 
philosopher, for soon afterwards the Mayoress became very wealthy, presumably as 
a result of her theft.</P><I>
<P>Norton </I>himself does not appear to have reaped pecuniary benefit at any 
time from his erudition, but to have been a comparatively poor man throughout 
the whole of his life; and the fact is a little surprising. for his <I>Ordinall 
of Alchimy </I>was a popular work in the middle ages, and was repeatedly 
published. The original edition was anonymous, but the writer's identity has 
been determined because the initial syllables in the first six lines of the 
seventh chapter compose the following couplet</P><I>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&quot;Thomas Norton </I>of Briseto</P>
<P>A parfet master you may him trow.&quot;</P><I>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Norton </I>died in <B>1477</B>, and his predilections descended to one of his 
grandsons. This was Samuel Norton, who was born in <B>1548</B>, studied science 
at St. John's College. Cam-bridge, and afterwards became a Justice of the Peace 
and Sheriff of Somersetshire. He died about <B>1604</B>, and in <B>1630</B> a 
collection of his alchemistic tracts was published at Frankfort.</P>
