the world (f. &quot;Microcosm&quot;). A six-pointed star, formed of two 
triangles, and the sacred symbol of Solomon's seal. It represents the infinite 
and the absolute - that is, the most simple and complete abridgment of the 
science of all things. Paracelsus states that every magical figure and

<P>Madre Natura :</B> An old and powerful secret society, of Italy, who 
worshipped and idealised nature, and which seems to have been founded by members 
of the ancient Italian priesthood. It had a tradition that one of the Popes as 
Cardinal de Medici became a member of the fraternity, and for this there is good 
documentary evidence. It accepted the allegorical interpretation which the 
Neo-Platonists had placed upon the Pagan creeds during the first ages of 
Christianity.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Magi :</B> Priests of ancient Persia, and the cultivators of the wisdom of 
Zoroaster. They were instituted by Cyrus when he founded the new Persian empire, 
and are supposed to have been of the Median race. Schlegel says <I>(Philosophy 
of History), </I>&quot;they were not so much a hereditary sacerdotal caste as an 
order or association, divided into various and successive ranks and grades, such 
as existed in the mysteries - the grade of apprenticeship-that of 
mastership--that of perfect mastership.&quot; In short, they were a theosophical 
college ; and either its professors were indifferently&quot; magi,&quot; or 
magicians, and &quot; wise men&quot; or they were distinguished into two classes 
by those names. Their name pronounced &quot;Mogh&quot; by the modern Persians, 
and &quot;Magh&quot; by the ancients signified &quot; Wise,&quot; and such is 
the interpretation of it given by the Greek and Roman writers. Stobaeus 
expressly calls the science of the <I>magi, </I>the service of the gods, so 
Plato. According to Ennemoser, &quot; Magiusiah, Madschusie, signified the 
office and knowledge of the priest, who was called &quot; Mag, Magius, 
Magiusi,&quot; and afterwards <I>magi </I>and &quot; Magician.&quot; Brucker 
maintains that the primitive meaning of the word is ' fire worshipper,&quot; 
worship of the light,&quot; an erroneous opinion. In the modern Persian the word 
is &quot; Meg,&quot; and &quot; Mogbed&quot; signifies high priest. The high 
priest of the Parsees at Surat, even at the present day, is called, &quot; 
Mobed.&quot; Others derive the word from ' Megh,&quot; &quot; Meb-ab&quot; 
signifying something which is great and noble, and Zoroaster's disciples were 
called &quot; Meghestom.&quot; Salverte states that these Mobeds are still named 
in the Pehivi dialect &quot; They were divided into three classes :-Those who 
abstained from all animal food ; those who never ate of the flesh of any tame 
animals; and those who made no scruple to eat any kind of meat. A belief in the 
transmigration of the soul was the foundation of this abstinence. They professed 
the science of divination, and for that purpose met together and consulted in 
their temples. They professed to make truth the great object of their study; for 
that alone, they said, can make man like God &quot;whose body resembles light, 
as his soul or spirit resembles truth.&quot; They condemned all images, and 
those who said that the gods are male and female; they had neither temples nor 
altars, but worshipped the sky, as a representative of the Deity, on the tops of 
mountains; they also sacrificed to the sun, moon, earth, fire, water, and winds, 
says Herodotus, meaning, no doubt that they adored the heavenly bodies and the 
elements. This was probably before the time of Zoroaster, when the religion of 
Persia seems to have resembled that of ancient India. Their hymns in praise of 
the Most High exceeded, according to Dio Chrysostom, the sublimity of anything 
in Homer or Hesiod. They exposed their dead bodies to wild beasts. It is a 
question &quot;whether the old Persian doctrine and wisdom or tradition of light 
did not undergo material alterations in the hands of its Median restorer, 
Zoroaster or whether this doctrine was preserved in all its purity by the order 
of the magi.&quot; He then remarks that on them devolved the important trust of 
the monarch's education, which must necessarily have given them great weight and 
influence in the state. They were in high credit at the Persian gates &quot;-for 
that was the Oriental name given to the capital of the empire, and the abode of 
the prince-and they took the most active part in all the factions that 
encompassed the throne, or that were formed in the vicinity of the court. In 
Greece, and even in Egypt, the sacerdotal fraternities and associations of 
initiated, formed by the mysteries, had in general but an indirect, though not 
unimportant influence on affairs of state; but in the Persian monarchy they 
acquired a complete political ascendency. Religion, philosophy, and the sciences 
were all in their bands, they were the universal physicians who healed the sick 
in body and in spirit, and, in strict consistency with that character, 
ministered to the state, which is only the man again in a larger sense. The 
three grades of the <I>magi </I>alluded to are called by Herber the &quot; 
disciples,'.' the&quot; professed,&quot; and the&quot; masters.&quot; They were 
originally from Bactria, where they governed a little state by laws of their own 
choice, and by their incorporation in the Persian empire, they greatly promoted 
the consolidation of the conquests of Cyrus, Their fall dates from the reign of 
Darius Hystaspes, about <B>500</B> B.C., by whom they were fiercely persecuted; 
this produced an emigration which extended to Cappadocia on the one hand, and to 
India on the other, but they were still of so much consideration at a later 
period, as to provoke the jealousy of Alexander the Great. <I>(See

<P>Magia Posthuma : </B>A short treatise on Vampirism published at Olmutz in 
<B>1706</B>, and written by Ferdinand de Schertz. Reviewing it Calmet (q.v.) 
says in his <I>Dissertation on Vampires: </I>&quot;The author relates a story of 
a woman that died in a certain village, after having received all the 
sacraments, and was buried with the usual ceremonies, in the Churchyard. About 
four days after her death, the inhabitants of the village were affrighted with 
an uncommon noise and outcry, and saw' a spectre, sometimes in the shape of a 
dog, and sometimes in that of a man, which appeared to great multitudes of 
people, and put them to excessive pain by squeezing their throats, and pressing 
their breasts, almost to suffocation. There were several whose bodies he bruised 
all over, and reduced them to the utmost weakness, so that they grew pale, lean, 
and disfigured. His fury was sometimes so great as not to spare the very beasts, 
for cows were frequently found beat to the earth, half dead ; at other times 
with their tails tied to one<B> </B>another, and their hideous lowings 
sufficiently expressed the pain they felt. Horses were often found almost 
wearied to death, foaming with sweat, and out of breath, as if they had been 
running a long and tiresome race; and these calamities continued for several 
months.&quot;</P>
<P>The author of the treatise examines into the subject in the capacity of a 
lawyer, and discusses both the matter of fact and the points of law arising from 
it. He is clearly of opinion that if the suspected person was really the author 
of these noises, disturbances, and acts of cruelty, the law will justify the 
burning of the body, as is practised in the case of other spectres which come 
again and molest the living. He relates also several stories of apparitions of 
this sort, and particularises the mischiefs done by them. One, among others, is 
of a herdsman of the village of Blow near the town of Kadam in Bohemia, who 
appeared for a considerable time together, and called upon Several persons, who 
all died within eight days. At last, the inhabitants of Blow dug up the 
herdsman's body, and fixed it in the ground, with a stake driven through it. The 
man, even in this condition, laughed at the people that were employed about him, 
and told them they were very obliging to furnish him with a stick to defend 
himself from the dogs. me same night he extricated himself from the stake, 
frightened several persons by appearing to them, and occasioned the death of 
many more than he had hitherto done. He was then delivered into the hands of the 
hang-man, who put him into a cart, in order to burn him without the town. As 
they went along, the carcass shrieked in the most hideous manner, and threw 
about its arms and legs, as if it had been alive, and upon being again run 
through with a stake, it gave a loud cry, and a great quantity of fresh, florid 
blood issued from the wound. At last the body was burnt to ashes, and this 
execution put a final stop to the spectres appearing and infesting the 
village.</P>
<P>The same method has been practised in other places, where these apparitions 
have been seen and upon taking them out of the ground, their bodies have seemed 
fresh and florid, their limbs pliant and flexible, without any worms or 
putrefaction, but not without a great stench. The author quotes several other 
writers, who attest what he relates concerning these spectres, which, he says, 
still appear in the mountains of Silesia and Moravia. They are seen, it seems, 
both by day and night, and the things which formerly belonged to them are 
observed to stir and change their place, without any person's being seen to 
touch them. And the only remedy in these cases, is to cut off the head, and burn 
the body of the persons that are supposed to appear.</P>

<P>Magic :</B> Short for &quot; magic art,&quot; from Greek <I>magein </I>the 
science and religion of the priests of Zoroaster ; or, according to Skeat, from 
Greek <I>megas, </I>great, thus signifying the &quot;great &quot; 
science.</P><I>
<P>History.-The </I>earliest traces of magical practice are found in the 
European caves of the middle Paleolithic Age. These belong to the last 
interglacial period of the Pleistocene period, which has been named the 
Aurignacian, after the cave-dwellers of Aurignac, whose skeletons, artifacts and 
drawings link them with the Bushmen of South Africa. In the cave of Gargas, near 
Bagneres de Luchon, occur, in addition to spirited and realistic drawings of 
animals, numerous imprints of human hands in various stages of mutilation. Some 
hands had been first smeared with a sticky substance and then pressed on the 
rock; others had been held in position to be dusted round with red ochre, or 
black pigment. Most of the imprinted hands have mutilated fingers; in some cases 
the first and second joints of one or more fingers are wanting; in others the 
stumps only of all fingers remain. A close study of the hand imprints makes it 
evident that they are not to be regarded as those of lepers. There can be little 
doubt that the joints were removed for a specific purpose, and on this point 
there is general agreement among anthropologists. A clue to the mystery is 
obtained by the magical custom among the Bushmen of similarly removing finger 
joints. Mr. G. W. Stow in his <I>The Native Races of South Africa </I>makes 
reference to this strange form of sacrifice. He once came into contact with a 
number of Bushmen who &quot;had all lost the first joint of the little 
finger&quot; which had been removed with a &quot; stone knife&quot; with purpose 
to ensure a safe journey to the spirit world. Another writer tells of an old 
Bushman woman whose little fingers of both hands had been mutilated, three 
joints in all having been removed. She explained that each joint had been 
sacrificed as a daughter died to express her sorrow. No doubt, however, there 
was a deeper meaning in the custom than she cared to confess. F. Boas in his 
<I>Report on the N. W. Tribes of Canada </I>gives evidence of the custom among 
these peoples. When frequent deaths resulted from disease, the Canadian Indians 
were wont to sacrifice the joints of their little fingers so as, they explained, 
&quot;to cut off the deaths.&quot; Among the Indian Madigas (Telugu Pariahs) the 
evil eye is averted by sacrificers who dip their hands in the blood of goats or 
sheep and impress them on either side of a house door. This custom is not 
unknown even to Brahmans. Impressions of hands are also occasionally seen on the 
walls of Indian Mohammedan mosques. As among the N.W. Canadian tribes, the hand 
ceremony is most frequently practised in India when epidemics make a heavy toll 
of lives. The Bushmen also remove finger joints when stricken with sickness. In 
Australia, where during initiation ceremonies the young men have teeth knocked 
out and bodies scarred, the women of some tribes mutilate the little fingers of 
daughters with purpose to influence their future careers. Apparently the finger 
chopping customs of Paleolithic times had a magical significance. On some of the 
paintings in the Aurignacian caves appear symbols which suggest the slaying with 
spears and cutting up of animals. Enigmatical signs are another feature. Of 
special interest are the figures of animal-headed demons, some with hands 
upraised in the Egyptian attitude of adoration, and others apparently dancing 
like the animal-headed dancing gods of the Bushmen. In the Marsonlas Paleolithic 
cave there are semi-human faces of angry demons with staring eyes and monstrous 
noses. In the Spanish Cave at Cogul several figures of women wearing half-length 
skirts and shoulder shawls, are represented dancing round a nude male. So 
closely do these females resemble such as usually appear in Bushmen paintings 
that they might well, but for their location, be credited to this interesting 
people. Religious dances among the Bushman tribes are associated with marriage, 
birth and burial ceremonies ; they are also performed to exorcise demons in 
cases of sickness. &quot; Dances are to us what prayers are to you,&quot; an 
elderly Bushman once informed a European. whether the cave drawings and wood, 
bone and ivory carvings of the Magdalenian, or late Paleolithic period at the 
close of the last ice epoch, are of magical significance is a problem on which 
there is no general agreement. It is significant to find, however, that several 
carved ornaments bearing animal figures or enigmatical signs are perforated as 
if worn as charms. On a piece of horn found at Lorthet, Hautes Pyrenees, are 
beautiful incised drawings of reindeer and salmon, above which appear mystical 
symbols. An ape-like demon carved on bone was found at Mas d'Azil: on a reindeer 
horn from Laugerie Basse a prostrate man with a tail is creeping up on all fours 
towards a grazing bison. These are some of the instances which lend colour to 
the view that late Paleolithic art had its origin in magical beliefs and 
practices-that hunters carved on the handles of weapons and implements, or 
scratched on cave walls, the images of the animals they desired to 
capture-sometimes with the secured co-operation of demons, and sometimes with 
the aid of magical spells.</P>
<P>Coming to historic times we know that the ancient Egyptians <I>(See 
</I>Egypt) possessed a highly-developed magical system, as did the Babylonians 
<I>(See </I>Semites), and other pristine civilisations. Indeed from these the 
medieval European system of <I>magic </I>was finally evolved. Greece and Rome 
(both of which see) also possessed distinct national systems, which in some 
measure were branches of their religions; and thus like the Egyptian and 
Babylonian were preserves of the priesthood.</P><I>
<P>Magic </I>in early Europe was, of course, merely an appendage of the various 
religious systems which obtained throughout that continent ; and it was these 
systems which later generated into witchcraft (q.v.) But upon the foundation of 
Christianity, the church soon began to regard the practice of <I>magic </I>as 
foreign to the spirit of its religion. Thus the Thirty-sixth Canon of the 
(Ecumenical Council held at Laodicea in <B>364</B> A.D. forbids clerks and 
priests to become magicians, enchanters, mathematicians or astrologers. It 
orders. moreover, that the Church shall expel from its bosom those who employ 
ligatures or phylacteries. because it says phylacteries are the prisons of the 
soul. The Fourth Canon of the Council of Oxia, A.D. <B>525</B>, prohibited the 
consultation of sorcerers, augurs, diviners, and divinations made with wood or 
bread; and the Sixtieth Canon of the Council of Constantinople A.D. <B>692</B>, 
excommunicated for a period of six years diviners, and those who had recourse to 
them. The prohibition was repeated by the Council of Rome in <B>721</B>. The 
Forty-second Canon of the Council of Tours in <B>613</B> is to the effect that 
the priests shall teach to the people the inefficacy of magical practices to 
restore the health of men or animals, and later Councils practically endorsed 
the church's earlier views.</P>
<P>It does not appear, however, that what may be called &quot; medieval 
magic&quot; took final and definite shape until about the twelfth century. 
Modelled upon the systems in vogue among the Byzantines and Moors of Spain, 
which were evolved from the Alexandrian system <I>(See </I><B>Neoplatonism</B>), 
what might be called the &quot; oriental&quot; type of <I>magic </I>gained 
footing in Europe, and quite superseded the earlier and semi-barbarian systems 
in use among the various countries of that continent, most of which, as has been 
said, were the relics of older pagan practice and ritual. To these relics clung 
the witch and the wizard and the professors of lesser magic ; whereas among the 
disciples of the imported system we find the magician-black and white,-the 
necromancer and the sorcerer. The manner in which the theosophy and the magic of 
the East was imported was probably two-fold ; first, there is good evidence that 
it was imported into Europe by persons returning from the Crusades; and 
secondly, we know that in matters of wisdom, Byzantium fell heir to Alexandria, 
and that from Constantinople <I>magic </I>was disseminated throughout Europe. 
along with other sciences. It is not necessary to deal in the course of this 
article with the history of witchcraft and lesser sorcery, as that has already 
been done in the article witchcraft &quot; (q.v.) ; and we will confine 
ourselves strictly to the history of the higher branches of <I>magic. </I>But it 
is competent to remark that Europe had largely obtained its pneumotology from 
the orient through Christianity, from Jewish and early Semitic sources; and it 
is an open question how far eastern demonology coloured that of the Catholic 
Church.</P>
<P>Medieval <I>magic </I>of the higher type has practically no landmarks save a 
series of great names. Its tenets experienced but Little alteration during six 
centuries. From the eighth to the thirteenth century. there does not appear to 
have been much persecution of the professors of <I>magic. </I>but after that 
period the opinions of the church underwent a radical change, and the life of 
the magus was fraught with considerable danger. However, it is pretty clear that 
he was not victimised in the same manner as his lesser brethren, the sorcerers 
and wizards; but we find Paracelsus consistently baited by the medical 
profession of his day, Agrippa constantly persecuted, and even mystics like 
Boehme imprisoned and ill-used. It is difficult at this distance to estimate the 
enormous vogue that <I>magic </I>experienced, whether for good or evil during 
the middle ages. Although severely punished, if discovered or if its professors 
became sufficiently notorious to court persecution, the power it seems to have 
conferred upon them was eagerly sought by scores of people-the majority of whom 
were quite unfitted for its practice, and clumsily betrayed themselves into the 
hands of the authorities. In the article entitled &quot; Black Magic,&quot; we 
have outlined the history of that lesser <I>magic </I>known as sorcery or&quot; 
black magic,&quot; and there have shown what persecutions overtook those who 
practised it.</P>
<P>As has already been mentioned, the history of higher <I>magic </I>in Europe 
is a matter of great names, and these are somewhat few. They do not include 
alchemists, who are strictly speaking not magicians, as their application of 
arcane laws was particular and not universal; but this is not to say that some 
alchemists were not also magicians. The two great names which stand out in the 
history of European <I>magic </I>are those of Paracelsus and Agrippa, who 
formulated the science of medieval <I>magic </I>in its entirety. They were also 
the greatest practical magicians of the middle ages, as apart from pure mystics, 
alchemists and others, and their thaumaturgic and necromantic experiences were 
probably never surpassed. With these medieval magic comes to a close and the 
further history of the science in Europe will be found outlined in the division 
of this article entitled &quot; Modern Magic.&quot;</P><I>
<P>Scientific Theories regarding the Nature of Magic.-</I>General agreement as 
to the proper definition of <I>magic </I>is wanting, as it depends upon the view 
taken of religious belief. According to Frazer, <I>magic </I>and religion are 
one and the same thing, or are so closely allied as to be almost identical. This 
may be true of peoples in a savage or barbarian condition of society, but can 
scarcely apply to <I>magic </I>and religion as fully fledged, as for example in 
medieval times, however fundamental may be their original unity. The objective 
theory of <I>magic </I>would regard it as entirely distinct from religion, 
possessed of certain well-marked attributes, and traceable to mental processes 
differing from those from which the religious idea springs. Here and there the 
two have become fused by the superimposition of religious upon magical practice. 
The objective idea of <I>magic, </I>in short, rests on the belief that it is 
based on magical laws which are supposed to operate with the regularity of those 
of natural science. The subjective view, on the other hand, is that many 
practices seemingly magical are in reality religious. and that no rite can be 
called magical which is not so designated by its celebrant or agent. It has been 
said that religion consists of an appeal to the gods, whereas <I>magic </I>is 
the attempt to force their compliance. Messrs. Hubert and Mauss believe that 
<I>magic </I>is essentially traditional. Holding as they do that the primitive 
mind is markedly unoriginal, they have satisfied themselves that <I>magic </I>is 
therefore an art which does not exhibit any frequent changes amongst primitive 
folk, and is fixed by its laws. Religion, they say, is official and organised, 
<I>magic </I>prohibited and secret. Magical power appears to them to be 
determined by the contiguity. similarity and contrast of the object of the act, 
and the object to be effected. Mr. Frazer believes all <I>magic </I>to<B> </B>be 
based on the law of sympathy - that is the assumption that things act on one 
another at a distance because of their being secretly linked together by 
invisible bonds. He divides sympathetic <I>magic </I>into homeopathic <I>magic 
</I>and contagious <I>magic. </I>The first is imitative or mimetic, and may be 
practised by itself ; but the latter usually necessitates the application of the 
imitative principle. Well-known instances of mimetic magic are the forming of 
wax figures in the likeness of an enemy, which are destroyed in the hope that he 
will perish. Contagious magic may be instanced by the savage anointing the 
weapon which caused a wound instead of the wound itself, in the belief that the 
blood on the weapon continues to feel with the blood on the body. Mr. L. 
Marillier divides <I>magic </I>into three classes the <I>magic </I>of the word 
or act; the <I>magic </I>of the human being independent of rite or formula ; and 
the <I>magic </I>which demands a human being of special powers and the use of 
ritual. Mr. A. Lehmann believes <I>magic </I>to be a practice of superstition, 
and founds it in illusion. The fault of all these theories is that they strive 
after too great an exactness, and that they do not allow sufficiently for the 
feeling of wonder and awe which is native to the human mind. Indeed they 
designate this strained attention.&quot; We may grant that the attention of 
savages to a magical rite is &quot; strained,&quot; so strained is it in some 
cases that it terrifies them into insanity; and it would seem therefore as if 
the limits of &quot; attention&quot; were overpassed. and as if it shaded into 
something very much deeper. Moreover it is just possible that in future it may 
be granted that so-called sympathetic magic does not partake of the nature of 
magic at all, but has greater affinities (owing to its strictly natural and 
non-supernatural character) with pseudo-science.</P><I>
<P>Magic </I>is recognised by many savage peoples as a force rather than an 
art,-a thing which impinges upon the thought of man from outside. It would 
appear that many barbarian tribes believe in what would seem to be a great 
reservoir of magical power, the exact nature of which they are not prepared to 
specify. Thus amongst certain American-Indian tribes we find a force called 
<I>Orenda </I>or spirit-force. Amongst the ancient Peruvians, everything sacred 
was <I>huaca </I>and possessed of magical power. In Melanesia, we find a force 
Spoken of called <I>mana, </I>transmissible and contagious, which may be seen in 
the form of flames or even heard. The Malays use the word <I>kramat </I>to 
signify the same thing; and the Malagasy the term <I>hasma. </I>Some of the 
tribes round Lake Tanganyika believe in such a force, which they call <I>ngai, 
</I>and Australian tribes have many similar terms, such as <I>churinga </I>and 
<I>boolya. </I>To hark back to America, we find in Mexico the strange creed 
named <I>nagualism, </I>which partakes of the same conception-every-thing 
<I>nagual </I>is magical or possesses an inherent spiritual force of its 
own.</P><I>
<P>Theories of the Origin of Magic-Many </I>theories have been advanced 
regarding the origin of magic-some authorities believing that it commenced with 
the idea of personal superiority ; others through animistic beliefs <I>(See 
</I>Animism); and still others through such ideas as that physical pains, for 
which the savage could not account, were supposed to be inflicted by invisible 
weapons. This last theory is. of course, in itself, merely animistic. It does 
not seem, however, that writers on the subject have given sufficient attention 
to the great influence exerted on the mind of man by odd or peculiar 
occurrences. We do not for a moment desire to advance the hypothesis that 
<I>magic </I>entirely originated from such a source, but we believe that it was 
a powerful factor in the growth of magical belief. To which, too, <I>animism 
</I>and <I>taboo </I>contributed their quota. Toe cult of the dead too and their 
worship would soon become fused with magical practice, and a complete demonology 
would thus speedily arise.</P><I>
<P>The Dynamics of </I>Magic..-Magical practice is governed by well-marked laws 
limited in number. It possesses many classes of practitioner ; as, for example, 
the diviner or augur, whose duties are entirely different from those of the 
witch-doctor. Chief among these laws, as has been already hinted, is that of 
sympathy. which, as has been said, must inevitably be sub-divided into the laws 
of similarity, contiguity and antipathy. The law of similarity and homeopathy is 
again divisible into two sections: (<B>1</B>)-the assumption that like produces 
like-an illustration of which is the destruction of a model in the form of an 
enemy ; and (<B>2</B>) the idea that like cures like-for instance, that the 
stone called the bloodstone can staunch the flow of bleeding. The law dealing 
with antipathy rests on the assumption that the application of a certain object 
or drug expels its contrary. There remains contiguity, which is based on the 
concept that whatever has once formed part of an object continues to form part 
of it. Thus if a magician can obtain a portion of a person's hair, he can work 
woe upon him through the invisible bonds which are supposed to extend between 
him and the hair in the sorcerer's possession. It is well-known that if the 
animal familiar of a witch be wounded, that the wound will react in a 
sympathetic manner on the witch herself. This is called repercussion.&quot;</P>
<P>Another widespread belief is that if the magician procures the name of a 
person that he can gain magical dominion over him. This, of course, arose from 
the idea that the name of an individual was identical with himself. The doctrine 
of the Incommunicable Name, the hidden name of the god or magician, is well 
instanced by many legends in Egyptian history,-the deity usually taking 
extraordinary care to keep his name secret, in order that no one might gain 
power over him. The spell or incantation is connected with this concept, and 
with these, in a lesser degree, may be associated magical gesture, which is 
usually introduced for the purpose of accentuating the spoken word. Gesture is 
often symbolic or sympathetic ; it is sometimes the reversal of a religious 
rite, such as marching against the sun, which is known as walking 
&quot;widdershins.&quot; The method of pronouncing rites is, too, one of great 
importance. Archaic or foreign expressions are usually found in spells ancient 
and modern ; and the tone in which the incantation is spoken, no less than its 
exactness, is also important. To secure exactness rhythm was often employed. 
which had the effect of aiding memory.</P><I>
<P>The Magician.-In </I>early society, the magician, which term includes the 
shaman, medicine-man, piage, witch-doctor, <I>et cetera, </I>may hold his 
position by hereditary right; by an accident of birth, as being the seventh son 
of a seventh son; to revelation from the gods; or through mere mastery of 
ritual. In savage life we find the shaman a good deal of a medium, for instead 
of summoning the powers of the air at his bidding as did the magicians of 
medieval days, he seems to find it necessary to throw himself into a state of 
trance and seek them in their own sphere. The magician is also often regarded as 
possessed by an animal or supernatural being. The duties of the priest and 
magician are often combined in primitive society, but it cannot be too strongly 
asserted that where a religion has been superseded, the priests of the old cult 
are, for those who have taken their places, nothing but magicians. We do not 
hear much of beneficent <I>magic </I>among savage peoples, and it is only in 
Europe that White Magic may be said to have gained any hold.</P><I>
<P>Medieval Definition of Magic.-The </I>definitions of <I>magic </I>vouchsafed 
by the great magicians of medieval and modern times naturally differ greatly 
from those of anthropologists.</P>
<P>For example Eliphas Levi says in his <I>History of Magic: &quot;Magic 
</I>combines in a single science that which is most certain in philosophy with 
that which is eternal and infallible in religion. It reconciles perfectly and 
incontestably those two terms so opposed on the first view-faith and reason, 
science and belief, authority and liberty. It furnishes the human mind with an 
instrument of philosophical and religious certainty, as exact as mathematics, 
and even accounting for the infallibility of mathematics 
themselves.&hellip;There is an incontestable truth, and there is an infallible 
method of knowing that truth; while those who attain this knowledge and adopt it 
as a rule of life, can endow their life with a sovereign power, which can make 
them masters of all inferior things, of wandering spirits, or in other words, 
arbiters and kings of the world.&quot; Paracelsus says regarding <I>magic: 
</I>&quot;The magical is a great hidden wisdom, and reason is a great open 
folly. No armour shields against <I>magic </I>for it strikes at the inward 
spirit of life. Of this we may rest assured, that through full and powerful 
imagination only can we bring the spirit of any man into an image. No 
conjuration, no rites are needful; circle-making and the scattering of incense 
are mere humbug and jugglery. The human spirit is so great a thing that no man 
can express it; eternal and unchangeable as God Himself is the mind of man; and 
could we rightly comprehend the mind of man, nothing would be impossible to us 
upon the earth. Through faith the imagination is invigorated and completed, for 
it really happens that every doubt mars its perfection. Faith must strengthen 
imagination, for faith establishes the will. Because man did not perfectly 
believe and imagine, the result is that arts are uncertain when they might be 
wholly certain.&quot; Agrippa also regarded <I>magic </I>as the true road to 
communion with God-thus linking it with mysticism.</P><I>
<P>Modern Magic: </I>With the death of Agrippa in <B>1535</B> the old school of 
magicians may be said to have ended. But that is not to say that the traditions 
of magic were not handed on to others who were equally capable of preserving 
them. We must carefully discriminate at this juncture between those 
practitioners of magic whose minds were illuminated by a high mystical ideal, 
and persons of doubtful occult position, like the Comte de Saint-Germain and 
others. At the beginning of the seventeenth century we find many great 
alchemists in practice, who were also devoted to the researches of 
transcendental magic, which they carefully and successfully concealed under the 
veil of hermetic experiment. These were Michael Meyer, Campe, Robert Flood, 
Cosmopolite, D'Espagnet, Samuel Norton, Baron de Beausoleil, and Van Helmont; 
another illustrious name is also that of Philalethes. The eighteenth century was 
rich in occult personalities, as for example the alchemist Lascaris (q.v.) 
Martines de Pasqually, and Louis de Saint-Martin (q.v.) who founded the 
Martinist school, which still exists under the grand-mastership of Papus. After 
this magic merges for the moment into mesmerism, and many of the secret magical 
societies which abounded in Europe about this period practised animal magnetism 
as well as astrology, Kabalism and ceremonial magic. Indeed mesmerism powerfully 
influenced mystic life in the time of its chief protagonist, and the mesmerists 
of the first era are in direct line with the Martinist and the mystical 
magicians of the late eighteenth century. Indeed mysticism and magnetism are one 
and the same thing, in the persons of some of these occultists <I>(See 
</I>Secret Tradition) the most celebrated of which were Cazotte, Ganneau, Comte. 
Wronski, Du Potet, Hennequin, Comte d'Ourches, and Baron de Guidenstubbe, and 
last of the initiates known to us, Eliphas Levi (all of which see)</P>
<P>That Black Magic and sorcery are still practised is a well-known fact, which 
requires no amplification in this place <I>(See </I><B>Devil Worship</B>)<B> : 
</B>but what of that higher magic which has, at least in modern times, attracted 
so many gifted minds ? We cannot say that the true line of magical adapts ended 
with Levi, as at no time in the world's history are these known to the vulgar; 
but we may be certain that the great art is practised in secret as sedulously as 
ever in the past, and that men of temperament as exalted as in the case of the 
magicians of older days still privately pursue that art, which, like its sister 
religion, is none the less celestial because it has been evolved from lowly 
origins in the mind of man, whose spirit with the march of time reflects ever 
more strongly the light of heaven, as the sea at first dimly reddened by the 
dawn, at length mirrors the whole splendour of day.</P><I>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Magic Darts : </B>The<B> </B>Laplanders, who passed at one time for great 
magicians, were said to launch lead darts, about a finger-length, against their 
absent enemies, believing that with the <I>magic darts </I>they were sending 
grevious pains and maladies. <I>(See </I>Magic.)</P><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Magic Squares <I>:</B> (See<B> </I>Abraham the Jew.</B>)</P><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Magical Diagrams : </B>These<B> </B>were geometrical designs, representing 
the mysteries of deity and creation, therefore supposed to be of special virtue 
in rites of evocation and conjuration.</P>
<P>The chief of these were the Triangle, the Double Triangle, forming a 
six-pointed star and known as the Sign or Seal of Solomon; the Tetragram a 
four-pointed star formed by the interlacement of two pillars; and the Pentagram, 
a five-pointed star.</P>
<P>These signs were traced on paper or parchment. or engraved on metals and 
glass and consecrated to their various uses by special rites.</P>
<P>The Triangle was based on the idea of trinity as found in all things, in 
deity, time and creation. The triangle was generally traced on the ground with 
the magic sword or rod, as in circles of evocation where the triangle was drawn 
within it and according to the position of the magician at its point or base so 
the spirits were conjured from heaven or hell.</P>
<P>The Double Triangle, the Sign of Solomon, symbolic of the Macrocosm, was 
formed by the interlacement of two triangles, thus its points constituted the 
perfect number six. The magicians wore it, bound on their brows and breasts 
during the ceremonies and it was engraved on the silver reservoir of the magic 
lamp.</P>
<P>The Tetragram was symbolic of the four elements and used in the conjuration 
of the elementary spirits-sylphs of the air, undines of the water, the fire 
salamanders and gnomes of the earth. In alchemy it represented the magical 
elements, salt, sulphur, mercury and azoth; in mystic philosophy the ideas 
Spirit, Matter, Motion and Rest; in hieroglyphs the man, eagle, lion and 
bull.</P>
<P>The Pentagram, the sign of the Microcosm, was held to be the most powerful 
means of conjuration in any rite. It may represent evil as well as good, for 
while with one point in the ascendant it was the sign of Christ, with two points 
in the ascendant it was the sign of Satan. By the use of the pentagram in these 
positions the powers of light or darkness were evoked. The pentagram was said to 
be the star which led the Magi to the manger where the infant Christ was 
laid.</P>
<P>The preparation and consecration of this sign for use in <I>magical </I>rites 
is prescribed with great detail. It might be composed of seven metals, the ideal 
form for its expression or traced in pure gold upon white marble, never before 
used for any purpose. it might also be drawn with</P>
<P>vermilion upon lambskin without a blemish prepared under the auspices of the 
Sun. The sign was next consecrated with the four elements ; breathed on five 
times ; dried by the smoke of five perfumes, incense, myrrh, aloes, sulphur and 
camphor. The names of five genii were breathed above it, and then the sign was 
placed successively at the north, south, east and west and centre of the 
astronomical cross pronouncing the letters of the sacred tetragram and various 
Kabalistic names.</P>
<P>It was believed to be of great efficacy in terrifying phantoms if engraved 
upon glass, and the magicians traced it on their doorsteps to prevent evil 
spirits from entering and the good from departing.</P>
<P>This symbol has been used by all secret and occult societies, by the 
Rosicrucians, the Illuminati, down to the Freemasons of to-day. Modern 
Occultists translate the meaning of the pentagram as symbolic of the human soul 
and its relation to God.</P>
<P>The symbol is placed with one point in the ascendant. That point represents 
the Great Spirit, God. A line drawn from there to the left-hand angle at base is 
the descent of spirit into matter in its lowest form, whence it ascends to 
right-hand angle typifying matter in its highest form, the brain of man. From 
here a line is drawn across the figure to left angle representing man's 
development in intellect, and progress in material civilization, the point of 
danger, from which all nations have fallen into moral corruption, signified by 
the descent of the line to right angle at base. But the soul of man being 
derived from God cannot remain at this point, but must struggle upward, as is 
symbolised by the line reaching again to the apex, God, whence it issued.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Magical Instruments and Accessories :</B> In <I>magical </I>rites these were 
considered of the utmost importance. Indispensable to the efficacy of the 
ceremonies were the altar, the chalice, the tripod, the censer; the lamp, rod, 
sword, and magic fork or trident; the sacred fire and consecrated oils; the 
incense and the candles.</P>
<P>The altar might be of wood or stone, but if of the latter, then of stone that 
has never been worked or hewn or even touched by the hammer.</P>
<P>The chalice might be of different metals, symbolic of the object of the 
rites. Where the purpose was evil, a black chalice was used as in the profane 
masses of sorcerers and witches. In some talismans the chalice is engraved as a 
symbol of the moon.</P>
<P>The tripod and its triangular stand was also made in symbolic metals.</P>
<P>The censer might be of bronze, but preferably of silver.</P>
<P>In the construction of the lamp, gold, silver, brass and iron must be used, 
iron for the pedestal, brass for the mirror, silver for the reservoir and at the 
apex a golden triangle. Various symbols were traced upon it, including an 
androgynous figure about the pedestal, a serpent devouring its own tail, and the 
Sign of Solomon.</P>
<P>The rod must be specially fashioned of certain woods and then consecrated to 
its magical uses. A perfectly straight branch of almond or hazel was to be 
chosen. This was cut before the tree blossomed, and cut with n golden sickle in 
the early dawn. Throughout its length must be run a long needle of magnetized 
iron; at one end there should be affixed a triangular prism, to the other, one 
of black resin, and rings of copper and zinc bound about it. At the new moon it 
must be consecrated by a magician who already possesses a consecrated rod.</P>
<P>The secret of the construction and consecration of <I>magical </I>rods was 
jealously guarded by all magicians and the rod itself was displayed as little as 
possible, being usually concealed in the flowing sleeve of the magician's 
robe.</P>
<P>The sword must be wrought of unalloyed steel, with copper handle in the form 
of a crucifix. Mystical signs were engraved on guard and blade and its 
consecration took place on a Sunday in full rays of the sun, when the sword was 
thrust into a sacred fire of cypress and laurel, then moistened with the blood 
of a snake, polished, and next, together with branches of vervain, swathed in 
silk. The sword was generally used in the service of Black Magic.</P>
<P>The magic fork or trident used in necromancy was also fashioned of hazel or 
almond, cut from the tree at one blow with an unused knife, from whose blade 
must be fashioned the three prongs. Witches and sorceresses are usually depicted 
using the trident in their infernal rites.</P>
<P>The fire was lit with charcoal on which were cast branches of trees, symbolic 
of the end desired. In Black Magic these generally consisted of cypress, 
alderwood, broken crucifixes and desecrated hosts.</P>
<P>The oil for anointing was compounded of myrrh, cinnamon, galingale and purest 
oil of Olive. Unguents were used by sorcerers and witches, who smeared their 
brows, breasts and wrists with a mixture composed of human fat and blood of 
corpses, combined with aconite, belladonna and poisonous fungi, thinking thereby 
to make themselves invisible.</P>
<P>Incense might be of any odoriferous woods and herbs, such as cedar, rose, 
citron, aloes, cinnamon, sandal, reduced to a fine powder, together with incense 
and storax. In Black Magic, alum, sulphur and assafoetida were used as 
incense.</P>
<P>The candles, belonging solely to practices of Black Magic were moulded from 
human fat and set in candlesticks of ebony carved in the form of a crescent.</P>
<P>Bowls also were used in these ceremonies, fashioned of different metals, 
their shape symbolic of the heavens. In necromantic rites skulls of criminals 
were used, generally to hold the blood of some victim or sacrifice.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Magical Numbers :</B> Certain <I>numbers </I>and their combinations were held 
to be of <I>magical </I>power, by virtue of their representation of divine and 
creative mysteries.</P>
<P>The doctrines of Pythagoras furnished the basis for much of this belief. 
According to his theory <I>numbers </I>contained the elements of all things, of 
the natural and spiritual worlds and of the sciences. The real numerals of the 
universe are the primaries one to ten and in their combination the reason of all 
else may be found. To the Pythagoreans One represented unity, therefore God; Two 
was duality, the Devil; Four was sacred and holy, the number on which they swore 
their most solemn oaths; Five was their symbol of marriage. They also attributed 
certain <I>numbers </I>to the gods, planets and elements; one represented the 
Sun, two the Moon; while five was fire, six the earth, eight the air, and twelve 
water.</P>
<P>Cornelius Agrippa in his work <I>Occult Philosophy </I>published in 
<B>1533</B>. discourses upon <I>numbers </I>as those characters by whose 
proportion all things were formed. He enumerates the virtues of numerals as 
displayed in nature, instancing the herb cinquefoil, which by the power of the 
number five exorcises devils, allays fever and forms an antidote to poisons. 
Also the virtue of seven as in the power of the seventh son to cure king's 
evil.</P>
<P>One was the origin and common measure of all things. It is indivisible ; not 
to be multiplied. In the universe there is one God ; one supreme intelligence in 
the intellectual world, man; in the sidereal world, one Sun; one potent 
instrument and agency in the elementary world, the philosopher's Stone; one 
chief member in the human world, the heart; and one sovereign prince in the 
nether world, Lucifer.</P>
<P>Two was the number of marriage. charity and social communion. It was also 
regarded sometimes as an unclean number; beasts of the field went into the Ark 
by twos. Three had a mysterious value as shown in Time's trinity - Past, Present 
and Future; in that of Space-length, breadth and thickness; in the three 
heavenly virtue - faith, hope and charity; in the three worlds of man-brain, the 
intellectual ; heart, the celestial ; and body, elemental.</P>
<P>Four signifies solidity and foundation. There are four seasons, four 
elements, four cardinal points, four evangelists.</P>
<P>Five, as it divides ten, the sum of all <I>numbers, </I>is also the number of 
justice. There are five senses ; the Stigmata, the wounds of Christ were five ; 
the name of the Deity the Pentagram is composed of five letters ; it also is a 
protection against beasts of prey.</P>
<P>Six is the sign of creation, because the world was completed in six days. It 
is the perfect number, because it alone by addition of its half, its third and 
its sixth reforms itself. It also represents servitude by reason of the Divine 
injunction Six days shalt thou labour.&quot;</P>
<P>Seven is a miraculous number, consisting of one, unity, and six, sign of 
perfection. It represents life because it contains body, consisting of four 
elements, spirit, flesh, bone and humour; and soul, made up of three elements, 
passion, desire and reason. The seventh day was that on which God rested from 
his work of creation.</P>
<P>Eight represents justice and fullness. Divided, its halves are equal; twice 
divided, it is still even. In the Beatitude eight is the number of those 
mentioned-peace-makers, they who strive after righteousness, the meek, the 
persecuted, the pure, the merciful, the poor in spirit, and they that mourn.</P>
<P>Nine is the number of the muses and of the moving spheres.</P>
<P>Ten is completeness because one cannot count beyond it except by combinations 
formed with other <I>numbers. </I>In the ancient mysteries ten days of 
initiation were prescribed. In ten is found evident signs of a Divine 
principle.</P>
<P>Eleven is the number of the commandments, while Twelve is the number of signs 
in the Zodiac, of the apostles, of the tribes of Israel, of the gates of 
Jerusalem.</P>
<P>This theory of <I>numbers </I>Agrippa applied to the casting of horoscopes. 
Divination by <I>numbers </I>was one of the favourite methods employed in the 
Middle Ages.</P>
<P>In <I>magical </I>rites, <I>numbers </I>played a great part. The instruments, 
vestments and ornaments must be duplicated. The power of the number three is 
found in the magic triangle: in the three prongs of the trident and fork; and in 
the threefold repetition of names in conjurations. Seven was also of great 
influence, the seven days of the week each representing the period most suitable 
for certain evocations and these corresponded to the seven magical works ; 
<B>1</B>.-works of light and riches; <B>2</B>.-works of divination and mystery; 
<B>3</B>.-works of skill, science and eloquence; <B>4</B>.-works of wrath and 
chastisement; <B>5</B>.-works of love; <B>6</B>.-works of ambition and intrigue; 
<B>7</B>.-works of malediction and death.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Magical Union of Cologne :</B> A society stated in a MS. of the Rosicrucians 
at <I>Cologne </I>to have been founded in that city in the year <B>1115</B>. In 
the <I>Rosenkreutzer in seiner blosse </I>of Weise it is stated that the 
initiates wore a triangle as symbolising power, wisdom and love. The more 
exalted orders among them were called Magos, and these held the greater 
mysteries of the fraternity.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Magical Vestments and Appurtenances :</B> These were prescribed needful 
adjuncts to magical rites, whose colour, name, form and substance, symbolic of 
certain powers and elements, added, it was supposed, greater efficacy to the 
evocations.</P>
<P>Abraham the Jew. a magician of the Middle Ages, prescribed a tunic of white 
linen, with upper robe ofscarlet and girdle of white silk. A crown or fillet of 
silk and gold was to be worn on the head and the perfumes cast on the fire might 
be incense, aloes, storax, cedar, citron or rose.</P>
<P>According to other authorities on the subject it was advisable to vary colour 
of robe and employ certain jewels and other accessories according to the 
symbolism of the end desired. A magician of the nineteenth century, Eliphas 
Levi, gives a detailed description of ritual, from which the following is 
taken.</P>
<P>If the rites were those of White Magic and performed on a Sunday, then the 
vestment should be of purple, the tiara, bracelets and ring of gold, the latter 
set with a chrysolith or ruby. Laurel, heliotrope and sunflowers are the 
symbolic flowers, while other details include a carpet of lion-skins and fans of 
sparrow-hawk feathers. The appropriate perfumes are incense, saffron, cinnamon 
and red sandal.</P>
<P>If, however, the ceremonial took place on a Monday, the Day of the Moon, then 
the robe must be of white embroidered with silver and the tiara of yellow silk 
emblazoned with silver characters ; while the wreaths were to be woven of 
moonwort and yellow ranunculi. The jewels appropriate to the occasion were 
pearls, crystals and selenite the perfumes, camphor, amber, aloes, white sandal 
and seed of cucumber.</P>
<P>In evocations concerning transcendent knowledge, green was the colour chosen 
for the vestment, or it might be green shot with various colours. The chief 
ornament was a necklace of pearls and hollow glass beads enclosing mercury. 
Agate was the symbolic jewel; narcissus, lily, herb mercury, fumitory, and 
marjoram the flowers; whilst the perfumes must be benzoin, mace and storax.</P>
<P>For operations connected with religious and political matters, the magician 
must don a robe of scarlet and bind on his brow a brass tablet inscribed with 
various characters. His ring must be studded with an emerald or sapphire, and he 
must burn for incense, balm, ambergris, grain of paradise and saffron. For 
garlands and wreaths, oak, poplar, fig and pomegranate leaves should be 
entwined.</P>
<P>If the ceremonial dealt with amatory affairs, the vestment must be of 
sky-blue, the ornaments of copper, and the crown of violets. The magic ring must 
be set with a turquoise, while the tiara and clasps were wrought of lapis-lazuli 
and beryl. Roses, myrtle and olive were the symbolic flowers, and fans must be 
made of swan-feathers.</P>
<P>If vengeance was desired on anyone, then robes must be worn whose colour was 
that of blood, flame or rust, belted with steel, with bracelets and ring of the 
same metal. The tiara must be bound with gold and the wreaths woven of absinthe 
and rue.</P>
<P>To bring misfortune and death on a person, the vestment must be black and the 
neck encircled with lead. The ring must be set with an onyx and the garlands 
twined of cypress, ash and hellebore; whilst the perfumes to be used were 
sulphur, scammony, alum and assafoetida.</P>
<P>For purposes of Black Magic, a seamless and sleeveless robe of black was 
donned, while on the head was worn a leaden cap inscribed with the signs of the 
Moon, Venus and Saturn. The wreaths were of vervain and cypress; and the 
perfumes burned were aloes, camphor and storax.</P>

<P>Maginot, Adele :</B> One of the mediums whose trance utterances have been 
recorded by the French spiritualist Alphonse Cahagnet, who published his 
<I>Arcanes de la vie future devoiles </I>in <B>1848</B>. Her <I>seances, </I>of 
which Cahagnet strove to obtain a written account from as many as possible of 
those present, are among the most valuable evidence which spiritualism can 
produce. Her descriptions of absent or deceased friends of the sitters were 
singularly accurate, though her supposed conversations with their spirits would 
appear to be fictitious. At the least her <I>seances </I>are excellent examples 
of telepathic communication.</P>

<P>Maier, Michael :</B> A German alchemist born at Rindsburg in Holstein about 
the year <B>1858</B>. He was one of the principal figures in the Rosicrucian 
Controversy in Germany and the greatest adept of his time. He diligently pursued 
the study of medicine in his youth and settling at Rostock practised with such 
success that the Emperor Rudolph appointed him as his physician, ennobling him 
later for his services. Some adepts eventually succeeded in luring him from the 
practical work he followed so long into the mazy and tortuous paths of alchemy. 
In order to confer with those whom he suspected were possessed of the 
transcendent mysteries he travelled all over Germany. The <I>Biographie 
Universelle </I>states that in pursuit of these ruinous absurdities &quot; he 
sacrificed his health, fortune and time. On a visit to England he became 
acquainted with Robert Fludd the Kentish Mystic.</P>
<P>In the controversy which convulsed Germany on the appearance of his 
Rosicrucian Manifestoes, he took a vigorous and enthusiastic share and wrote 
several works in defence of the mysterious society. He is alleged to have 
travelled in order to seek for members of the &quot; College of Teutonic 
Philosophers R.C.,&quot; and failing to find them formed a brotherhood of his 
own, based on the form of the <I>Fama Fraternibus. </I>There is no adequate 
authority for this statement, but it is believed that he eventually, towards the 
end of his life, was initiated into the genuine order. A posthumous pamphlet of 
<I>Maier's </I>called <I>Ulysses </I>was published by one of his personal 
friends in <B>1624</B>. There was added to the same volume the substance of two 
pamphlets already published in German but which in view of their importance were 
now translated into Latin for the benefit of the European literati. The first 
pamphlet was entitled <I>Colloquium Rhodostauroticum trium personarium per Famem 
et Confessionem quodamodo revelatam de Fraternitate Rosae Crucis. </I>The second 
was an <I>Echo Colloquii </I>by Hilarion on behalf of the Rosicrucian 
Fraternity. From these pamphlets it appears that <I>Maier </I>was admitted as a 
member of the mystical order. He became the most profuse writer on alchemy of 
his time. He died in the year <B>1622</B>. Most of his works, many of which are 
adorned with curious plates, are obscure with the exception of his Rosicrucian

mysticism.</P>

<P>Malays :</B> Magic among the <I>Malays </I>is for the most part of that type 
known as &quot;sympathetic&quot; <I>(See </I>Magic), that is, it possesses more 
of the nature of pseudo-science than that of wonder. Says Clifford:-</P>
<P>&quot;The accredited intermediary between men and spirits is the <I>Pawang; 
</I>the <I>Pawang </I>is a functionary of great and traditional importance in a 
<I>Malay </I>village, though in places near towns the office is falling into 
abeyance. In the inland districts, however, the <I>Pawang </I>is still a power, 
and is regarded as part of the constituted order of Society, without whom no 
village community would be complete. It must be clearly understood that he had 
nothing whatever to do with the official Muhammadan religion of the mosque; the 
village has its regular staff of elder- the <I>Imam, Khatio, </I>and 
<I>Bilal-for </I>the mosque service. But the <I>Pawang </I>is quite outside this 
system and belongs to a different and much older order of ideas; he may be 
regarded as the legitimate representative of the primitive medicine-man,' or 
village-sorcerer,' and his very existence in these days is an anomaly, though it 
does not strike <I>Malays </I>as such </P>
<P>&quot;The <I>Pawang </I>is a person of very real significance. In all 
agricultural operations, such as sowing, reaping, irrigation works, and the 
clearing of jungle for planting, in fishing at sea, in prospecting for minerals, 
and in- cases of sickness, his assistance is invoked. He is entitled by custom 
to certain small fees; thus, after a good harvest he is allowed in some villages 
five <I>gantangs </I>of padi, one <I>gantang </I>of rice <I>(beras), </I>and two 
<I>chupaks </I>of <I>emping </I>(a preparation of rice and cocoa-nut made into a 
sort of sweetmeat) from each householder.&quot;</P>
<P>The Pawang regulates taboos, and employs a familiar spirit known as <I>hantu 
pusaka-a </I>hereditary demon. He also acts as a medium and divines through 
trance. To become a magician &quot; You must meet the ghost of a murdered nian. 
Take the midrib of a leaf of the ' ivory cocoa-nut palm <I>(pelepah niyor 
gading), </I>which is to be laid on the grave, and two midribs, which are 
intended to represent canoe-paddles, and carry them with the help of a companion 
to the grave of the murdered man at the time of the full moon (the <B>55</B>th 
day of the lunar month) when it falls upon a Tuesday. Then take a cent's worth 
of incense, with glowing embers in a censer, and carry them to the head-post of 
the grave of the deceased. Fumigate the grave, going three times round it, and 
call upon the murdered man by name :-</P>
<P>'Hearken, So-and-so, And assist me</P>
<P>I am taking (this boat) to the saints of God, </P>
<P>And I desire to ask for a little magic.'</P>
<P>Here take the first midrib, fumigate it, and lay it upon the head of the 
grave, repeating:- </P><I>
<P>' Kur Allah' (' </I>Cluck, Cluck, God !') seven times. You and your companion 
must now take up a sitting posture, one at the head and the other at the foot of 
the grave, facing the grave post, and use the canoe-paddles which you have 
brought. In a little while the surrounding scenery will change and take upon 
itself the appearance of the sea, and finally an aged man will appear, to whom 
you must address the same request as before.&quot;</P><I>
<P>Malay </I>magic may be sub-divided into preparatory rites, sacrificial, 
lustration, divination and possession. Sacrifice takes the form of a simple 
gift, or act of homage to the spirit or deity. Lustration is </P>
<P>magico-religious and purificatory, principally taking place after 
child-birth. It may be performed by fire or water. Divination consists for the 
most part of the reading of dreams, and is, as elsewhere, drawn from the acts of 
men or nature. Omens are strongly believed in, &quot;When a star is seen in 
apparent proximity to the moon, old people say there will be a wedding 
shortly.</P>
<P>&quot;The entrance into a house of an animal which does not generally seek to 
share the abode of man is regarded by the <I>Malays </I>as ominous of 
misfortune. If a wild bird flies into a house it must-be carefully caught and 
smeared with oil, and must then be released in the open air, a formula being 
recited in which it is bidden to fly away with all the ill-luck and misfortunes 
<I>(sial jambalang) </I>of the occupier. An iguana, a tortoise, and a snake, are 
perhaps the most dreaded of these unnatural visitors. They are sprinkled with 
ashes, if possible to counteract their evil influence.</P><B>
<P></B>&quot; A swarm of bees settling near a house is an unlucky omen, and 
prognosticates misfortune.&quot;</P>
<P>So, too, omens are taken either from the flight or cries of certain birds, 
such as the night-owl, the crow, some kinds of wild doves, and the bird called 
the &quot; Rice's Husband&quot; <I>(laki padi.)</P>
<P>Astrology. Divination </I>by astrology is, however, the most common method of 
forecasting the future. The native practitioners possess long tables of lucky 
and unlucky periods and reasons. These are mostly translations from Indian and 
Arabic sources. The oldest known of these systems of propitious and unpropitious 
seasons is known as <I>Katika Lime, </I>or the Five Times. Under it the day is 
divided into five parts, and five days form a cycle. To each division is given a 
name as follows: Maswara, Kala, S'ri, Brahma, Bisnu (Vishnu) names of Hindu 
deities, the last name in the series for the first day being the first in that 
of the second day, and so on until the five days are exhausted. Each of these 
has a colour, and according to the colour first seen or noticed on such and such 
a day will it be fortunate to ask a boon of a certain god. Another version of 
this system, known as the &quot; Five Moments&quot; is similar in origin, but 
possesses a Mohammedan nomenclature. Another scheme <I>Katiha Tujoh </I>is based 
on the seven heavenly bodies, divides each day into seven parts, each of which 
is distinguished by the Arabic name for the sun, moon, and principal planets. 
The astrology proper of the <I>Malays </I>is purely Arabic in origin, but a 
system of Hindu invocation is in vogue by which the lunar month is divided into 
parts called <I>Rejang, </I>which resembles the <I>Nacshatras </I>or lunar 
houses of the Hindus. Each division has its symbol, usually an animal. Each day 
is propitious for something, and the whole system has been committed to verse 
for mnemonic purposes.</P><I>
<P>Demonology.- The </I>demoniac form common to Malaysia is that of the Jinn, 
with some leaven of the older Hindu spirit. They are one hundred and ninety in 
number. They are sometimes sub-divided into &quot; faithful&quot; and 
&quot;infidel,&quot; and further into the Jinns of the royal musical 
instruments, of the state, and of the royal weapons. The Afrit is also known. 
Angels also abound, and are purely of Arabic origin. Besides these the principal 
supernatural beings are as follows -the <I>Po/ong, </I>or familiar; the <I>Hantu 
Pemburu, </I>or spectre Huntsman; the <I>Jadi-jadian, </I>or wer-tiger; the 
<I>Huntu, </I>or ghost of the murdered ; the <I>Jemalang, </I>or 
earth-spirit.</P><I>
<P>Minor Sorcery.-The </I>rites of minor sorcery and witchcraft, as well as 
those of the shaman, are widely practised among the <I>Malays, </I>and are 
practically identical in character with those in use among other peoples in a 
similar state of culture.</P><I>

<P>Malleus Maleficarum :</B> A large volume published in Germany at the end of 
the fifteenth century, written by two inquisitors under the papal bull against 
witchcraft of <B>1484</B>,-Jacob Sprenger and Henricus Institor. Says Wright 
concerning it : &quot; In this celebrated work, the doctrine of witchcraft was 
first reduced to a regular system, and it was the model and groundwork of all 
that was written on the subject long after the date which saw its first 
appearance. Its writers enter largely into the much-disputed question of the 
nature of demons ; set forth the causes which lead them to seduce men in this 
manner; and show why women are most prone to listen to their proposals, by 
reasons which prove that the inquisitors had but a mean estimate of the softer 
sex. The inquisitors show the most extraordinary skill in explaining all the 
difficulties which seemed to beset the subject ; they even prove to their entire 
satisfaction that persons who have become witches may easily change themselves 
into beasts, particularly into wolves and cats; and after the exhibition of such 
a mass of learning, few would venture any longer to entertain a doubt. They 
investigate not only the methods employed to effect various kinds of mischief, 
but also the counter-charms and exorcisms that may be used against them. They 
likewise tell, from their own experience, the dangers to which the inquisitors 
were exposed, and exult in the fact that they were a class of men against whom 
sorcery had no power. These writers actually tell us, that the demon had tried 
to frighten them by day and by night in the forms of apes, dogs, goats, etc. ; 
and that they frequently found large pins stuck in their night-caps, which they 
doubted not came there by witchcraft. When we hear these inquisitors asserting 
that the crime of which the witches were accused, deserved a more extreme 
punishment than all the vilest actions of which humanity is capable, we can 
understand in some degree the complacency with which they relate how, by their 
means, forty persons had been burnt in one place, and fifty in another, and a 
still greater number in a third. From the time of the publication of the 
<I>Malleus Maleficarum, </I>the continental press during two or three 
generations teemed with publications on the all-absorbing subject of 
sorcery.</P>
<P>&quot;One of the points on which opinion had differed most was, whether the 
sorcerers were carried bodily through the air to the place of meeting, or 
whether it was an imaginary journey, suggested to their minds by the agency of 
the evil one. The authors of the <I>Malleus </I>decide at once in favour of the 
bodily transmission. One of them was personally acquainted with a priest of the 
diocese of Frisingen, who declared that he had in his younger days been carried 
through the air by a demon to a place at a very great distance from the spot 
whence he had been taken. Another priest, Iris friend, declared that he had seen 
him carried away, and that he appeared to him to be borne up on a kind of cloud. 
At Baldshut, on the Rhine, in the diocese of Constance, a witch confessed, that 
offended at not having been invited to the wedding of an acquaintance, she had 
caused herself to be carried through the air in open daylight to the top of a 
neighbouring mountain, and there, having made a hole with her hands and filled 
it with water, she had, by stirring the water with certain incantations caused a 
heavy storm to burst forth on the heads of the wedding-party; and there were 
witnesses at the trial who swore they had seen her carried through the air. The 
inquisitors, however, confess that the witches were some-times carried away, as 
they term it, in the spirit ; and they give the instance of one woman who was 
watched by her husband; she appeared as if asleep, and was insensible, but he 
perceived a kind of cloudy vapour arise out of her mouth, and vanish from the 
room in which she lay-this after a time returned, and she then awoke, and gave 
an account of her adventures, as though she had been carried bodily to the 
assembly. </P><B>
<P></B>&quot; The witches of the <I>Malleus Maleficarum </I>appear to have been 
more injurious to horses and cattle than to mankind. A witch at Ravenspurg 
confessed that she had killed twenty-three horses by sorcery. We are led to 
wonder most at the ease with which people are brought to bear witness to things 
utterly beyond the limits of belief. A man of the name of Stauff in the 
territory of Berne, declared that when pursued by the agents of justice, he 
escaped by taking the form of a mouse; and persons were found to testify that 
they had seen him perform this transmutation.</P>
<P>&quot;The latter part of the work of the two inquisitors gives minute 
directions for the mode in which the prisoners are to be treated, the means to 
be used to force them to a confession, the degree of evidence required for 
conviction of those who would not confess, and the whole process of the trials. 
These show sufficiently that the unfortunate wretch who was once brought before 
the inquisitors of the holy see on the suspicion of sorcery, however slight 
might be the grounds of the charge, had very small chance of escaping out of 
their claws.</P>
<P>&quot;The <I>Malleus </I>contains no distinct allusion to the proceedings at 
the Sabbath. The witches of this period differ little from those who had fallen 
into the hands of the earlier inquisitors at the Council of Constance. We see 
plainly how, in most countries, the mysteriously indefinite crime of sorcery had 
first been seized on to ruin the cause of great political offenders, until the 
fictitious importance thus given to it brought forward into a prominent 
position, which they would, perhaps, never otherwise have held, the miserable 
class who were supposed to be more especially engaged in it. It was the judicial 
prosecutions mid the sanguinary executions which followed, that stamped the 
character of reality on charges of which it required two or three centuries to 
convince mankind of the emptiness and vanity. One of the chief instruments in 
fixing the belief in sorcery, and in giving it that terrible hold on society 
which it exhibited in the following century, was the compilation of Jacob 
Sprenger and his fellow inquisitor. In this book sorcery was reduced to a system 
but it was not yet perfect; and we must look forward, some half a century before 
we find it clothed with all the horrors which cast so much terror into every 
class of society.&quot;</P>

colour-changing cloak would flap gaily as he marched with heavy tread round the 
camp of the hostile force invading Erin. He is comparable with the Cymric 
Manawiddan and resembles the Hellenic Proteus.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Mandragoras :</B> Familiar demons who appear in the figures of little men 
without beards. Delrio states that one day a <I>mandragora, </I>entering at the 
request of a sorcerer, who was being tried before a court for wizardry, was 
caught by the arms by the judge, who did not believe in the existence of the 
spirit, to convince himself of its existence, and thrown into the fire, where of 
course it would escape unharmed. <I>Mandragoras </I>are thought to be little 
dolls or figures given to sorcerers by the Devil for the purpose of being 
consulted by them in time of need; and it would seem as if this conception had 
sprung directly from that of the fetish, which is nothing else than a 
dwelling-place made by a shaman or medicine-man for the reception of any 
wandering spirit who chooses to take up his abode therein. The author of the 
work entitled <I>Petit Albert </I>says that on one occasion, whilst travelling 
in Flanders and passing through the town of Lille, he was invited by one of his 
friends to accompany him to the house of an old woman who posed as being a great 
prophetess. This aged person conducted the two friends into a dark cabinet lit 
only by a single lamp, where they could see upon a table covered with a cloth a 
kind of little Statue or <I>mandragora, </I>seated upon a tripod and having the 
left hand extended and holding a hank of silk very delicately fashioned, from 
which was suspended a small piece of iron highly polished. Placing under this a 
crystal glass so that the piece of iron was suspended inside the goblet, the old 
woman commanded the figure to strike the iron against the glass in such a manner 
as she wished, saying at the same time to the figure: &quot; I command you, 
<I>Mandragora, </I>in the name of those to whom you are bound to give obedience, 
to know if the gentleman present will be happy in the journey which he is about 
to make. If so, strike three times with the iron upon the goblet.&quot; The iron 
struck three times as demanded without the old woman having touched any of the 
apparatus, much to the surprise of the two spectators. The sorceress put several 
other questions to the <I>Mandragora, </I>who struck the glass once or thrice as 
seemed good to him. But, as the author shows, the whole was an artifice of the 
old woman, for the piece of iron suspended in the goblet was extremely light and 
when the old woman wished it to strike against the glass, she held in one of her 
hands a ring set with a large piece of magnetic stone, the virtue of which drew 
the iron towards the glass.</P>
<P>The ancients attributed great virtues to the plant called <I>mandragoras 
</I>or mandrake, which was supposed to be somewhat in the shape of a man, and 
when plucked from the earth to emit a species of human cry. It was also worn to 
ward off various diseases. <I>(See </I><B>Exorcism.</B>)</P><B>

musical instruments, touchings by invisible hands, and all the more familiar 
forms. A writer in <I>All the Year Round, </I>July <B>28</B>th, <B>1860</B>,

<P>Martian Language :</B> A <I>language </I>purporting to be that of the

professor of psychology at Geneva, had in <B>1892</B> joined a spiritualistic 
circle, where she developed marvellous mediumistic powers. In <B>1896</B>, after 
Professor Flournoy had begun his investigations, she was spirited during a 
trance to the planet Mars, and thereafter described to the circle the manners 
and customs and appearance of the <I>Martians. </I>She learned their 
<I>language, </I>which she wrote and spoke with ease and consistency. Unlike 
most of the &quot; unknown tongues&quot; automatically produced the <I>Martian 
language </I>was intelligible, its words were used consistently, and on the 
whole it had every appearance of a genuine <I>language. </I>That it was in any 
way connected with Mars is out of the question. The descriptions of that planet 
and its inhabitants are quite impossible. And the <I>language </I>itself bears a 
remarkable resemblance to French, the native tongue of the medium. The grammar 
and construction of both languages are the same, and even the vowel-sounds are 
identical, so that the source of the <I>Martian language </I>is not fat to 
seek.</P>

<P>Martin, Saint (exorcist) :</B> <I>(circa </I><B>316</B>-<B>400</B>). Most of 
the pristine luminaries of the Christian Church are credited with working 
miracles, and indeed the great majority of them maintained that, would the rude 
populace be won for Christ, the one sure way was to show them extraordinary 
marvels. Even Columba, most engaging of saints, was not averse to practising 
deception with a view to making converts'; and it has often been suggested, not 
without considerable reason, that some of these early thaumaturgists brought 
science to their aid. Perhaps <I>St. Martin </I>was among those who essayed this 
practice, and certainly the muster-roll of his miracles is formidable, for he is 
traditionally credited with considerably over two hundred.</P><I>
<P>Martin </I>was born about the year <B>316</B> at Sabaria, in Pannonia. His 
parents were heathen, yet he very soon came into contact with Christians, and 
their teaching impressed him greatly. As a young man he entered the army, and it 
was soon after this step that, while stationed with his regiment at Amiens, he 
performed his famous act of charity, dividing his cloak with a beggar who was 
shivering with cold. The night after this generous act he was vouchsafed a 
vision, Christ appearing to him and giving him his blessing; and thereupon 
<I>Martin </I>espoused the Christian faith formally, he was baptised and 
renounced soldiering once and for all. Going to Poitiers, he then made the 
acquaintance of Hilary, who wished to make him a deacon, but at his own request 
ordained him to the humbler office of an exorcist; and a little later, during a 
visit to his home, <I>Martin </I>experienced the joy of winning his mother from 
heathendom to the new faith. However, his open zeal in opposing the Arians 
raised persecution against him, and for a considerable space he found it 
advisable to live at the island of Gallinaria, near Genoa, in which quiet 
retreat he had ample leisure for scientific researches and theological studies; 
but by the year <B>365</B> he was back with Hilary at Poitiers, when he founded 
the Monasterium Locociagense. Then, in <B>371</B>, the people of Tours chose him 
as their bishop, and for some time subsequently he showed great activity in 
trying to extirpate idolatry in his diocese, and in extending the monastic 
system. Nevertheless, he was anything but a fierce proseletyser, and at Treves, 
in <B>385</B>, he entreated that the lives of the Priscillianist heretics should 
be spared, while he ever afterwards refused to have anything to do with those 
bishops who had sanctioned their execution. Meanwhile, being anxious for another 
period of quiet study, <I>Martin </I>had established the monastery of Marmontier 
les Tours, on the banks of the Loire; and here much of his remaining life was 
spent, yet it was at Candes that his death occurred about the year

<P>Martin </I>left no writings behind him, the <I>Confessio </I>with which he is 
sometimes credited being undoubtedly spurious. His life was written by his 
ardent disciple, Sulpicius Severus, and a curious document it is, filled with 
accounts of the miracles and marvels worked by the quondam bishop. Thanks to his 
triumphs herein, <I>Martin </I>was duly sanctified by the church, and he is 
commemorated on the <B>11</B>th of November; but the feast of Martinmas, which 
occurs on that date, and which of course derives its name from him, is, 
nevertheless, a survival of an old pagan festival; and it inherited certain 
usages thereof, this accounting for the fact that <I>Martin </I>is regarded as 
the patron saint of deep potations. Certain of his miracles, and other incidents 
in his life, were figured by numerous painters of note, perhaps the finest 
picture of him being one by the Flemish master, Hugo van der Goes, which is now 
in the Municipal Museum at Glasgow; while it behoves to add that the term 
Martinet, signifying a severe and punctilious person, is not derived from the 
saint's name, but from one Jean Martinet, a French soldier who, during the reign 
of Louis XIV., won fame by his ardour in promoting discipline in his 
regiment.</P>

<P>Materialisatlon :</B> A term denoting the formation by a spirit of a 
temporary physical organisation, visible and palpable, by means of which it can 
come into touch with material objects. <I>Materialisation </I>is the most 
important of the physical phenomena of spiritualism, and in its earlier stages 
was confined to the materialising of heads and hands, or vague luminous figures. 
In common with much of the physical phenomena, it had its origin in America, 
where it was known at a comparatively early period in the history of the 
movement. So early as <B>1860</B> stances were held with the Fox sisters by 
Robert Dale Owen and others, at which veiled and luminous figures were witnessed 
One sitter, Mr. Livermore, saw and recognised the spirit of his dead wife many 
times during a series of stances with Kate Fox, extending over some six years. 
In this case, however, there were no other sitters, and the stances were held in 
the dark, the whole atmosphere being peculiarly favourable to fraud. In 
<B>1871</B> another American medium, Mrs. Andrews, held sittings at which 
materialised forms were seen, and in the following year Mrs. Guppy and another 
medium attempted the production of a similar phenomenon in England, but without 
marked success. The mediums, Herne and Williams, succeeded a few months later in 
materialising shadowy forms and faces in a dark stance-room. It was, however, 
Miss Florence Cook, to whose phenomena Sir William Crookes has so abundantly 
testified, who was to give the most remarkable demonstration of this form of 
spirit manifestation. Miss Cook was, at the commencement of her spiritualistic 
career, a young girl of sixteen or seventeen years, described by a contemporary 
writer as a pretty, Jewish-like little girl.&quot; She was at that time a 
private medium, though at the outset she held some <I>materialisation 
</I>stances with Herne. From her childhood, it was said, she had been attended 
by a spirit-girl, who stated that her name on earth had been Annie Morgan, but 
that her name in the spirit-world was Katie King. Under the latter name Miss 
Cook's control was destined to become very famous in spiritualistic circles. 
Usually the medium was put in a sort of cupboard, or cabinet, tied to her chair, 
and the cords sealed. A short interval would ensue, during which the sitters 
sang spiritualistic hymns, and at length there would emerge from the cabinet a 
form clad in flowing white draperies, and not to be distinguished from an 
ordinary human being. On one occasion a stance was held at Mr. Cook's house, at 
which several distinguished spiritualists were present. Among the invited guests 
was Mr. W. Volckman, who thought to test for himself the good faith of the 
medium and the genuineness of Katie.&quot; After some forty minutes close 
observance of the materialised spirit Mr. Volckman concluded that Miss Cook and 
Katie were one and the same, and just as the white-robed figure was about to 
return to the cabinet he rushed forward and seized her. His indignant 
fellow-sitters released the &quot;spirit,&quot; the light was extinguished, and 
in the confusion that followed the spirit disappeared. Miss Cook was found a few 
minutes later bound as when she was placed in the cabinet, the cords unbroken, 
the seal intact, She wore a black dress, and there was no trace of white 
draperies in the cabinet. Sir William Crookes, whose investigations into the 
phenomena of this medium extended over a period of some years, had better 
opportunity of examining Katie's pretensions than Mr. Volckman had, and he had 
le it on record that the spirit form was taller than the medium, had a larger 
face and longer fingers; and whereas Florence Cook had black hair and a dark 
complexion, Katie's complexion was fair, and her hair a light auburn. Moreover 
Sir William, enjoying as he did the complete confidence of Katie, had on more 
than one occasion the privilege of seeing her and Miss Cook at the same time. 
But Miss Cook was not the only medium who was controlled by Katie King, who, 
with her father, John King, became in time a most popular spirit with 
<I>materialisation </I>mediums. From that time onwards <I>materialisation 
</I>was extensively practised both by private and professional mediums, among 
the number being Mrs. Showers and her daughter, Rita, Miss Lottie Fowler, 
William Eglinton and D. D. Home; while in recent years <I>materialisations 
</I>are stated to have occurred in the presence of Eusapia Palladino. Many 
sitters claimed to see in these draped figures and veiled faces the form and 
features of deceased relatives and friends, though frequently there was but the 
smallest ground for such a claim--parents recognised their daughter by her hair, 
a man recognised his mother by the Sort of cap she wore, and so on. There is no 
doubt that fraud entered, and still enters, very largely into <I>materialisation 
</I>stances. Lay figures, muslin draperies, false hair, and similar properties 
have been found in the possession of mediums; accomplices have been smuggled 
into the stance-room; lights are frequently turned low or extinguished 
altogether.. Add to this the fact that other spirits besides Katie have on being 
grasped resolved themselves into the person of the medium, and it will be seen 
that scepticism is not altogether. unjustified. Then, as already mentioned, the 
rash and premature recognition of deceased friends in draped forms whose 
resemblance to the medium is patent to the less-interested observer, has also 
done much to ruin the case for genuine spirit <I>moterialisation, </I>Yet that 
there is a case we must believe on the assertion of some of the most 
distinguished of modern investigators, men fully alive to the possibilities of 
fraud, trained to habits of correct observation. M. Flammarion felt constrained 
to attribute the <I>materialisations </I>he had witnessed in the presence of 
Eusapia Palladino to fluidic emanations from the medium's person,. while judging 
the recognition accorded to them the result of illusion.' Others state that the 
physical organisation formed by the spirit is composed of fine particles of 
matter drawn from the material world. By way of explaining the numerous 
exposures that have been made from time to time various theories of a more or 
less ingenious character have been advanced by spiritualists. In a case of 
obvious fraud they declare that the spirits have controlled the medium to 
secrete wigs and draperies in the cabinet. If a spirit on being held by a sitter 
proves to be the medium herself an explanation is also forthcoming. The medium, 
it is said, imparts to the spirit a certain portion of her vital energy, so that 
the spirit may &quot; manifest.&quot; When the latter is ruthlessly grasped 
these two portions of the medium's vital spirits tend to re-unite, so that 
either the medium will draw the spirit into the cabinet, or the spirit will draw 
the medium out, the reason that the union generally takes place without the 
cabinet is that the medium has imparted to the control more of her energy than 
she had retained.</P><B>

its teachings, Before the Fall, Adam was a pure spirit, a celestial being, 
surrounded by a mystic covering which rendered him incapable of being affected 
by any poison of nature, or by the power of the elements. The physical body, 
therefore, is but a coarse husk in which, having lost his primitive 
invulnerability, man shelters from the elements. In his condition of perfect 
glory and perfect happiness Adam was a natural king, ruling all things visible 
and invisible, and showing forth the power of the Almighty. He also bore &quot;a

powers within itself, and by means of which he could perform all things.</P>

<P>Medea :</B> An enchantress, daughter of the king of Colchis, who fell in love 
with Jason when he came to that country, and enabled him to slay the sleepless 
dragon that guarded the golden fleece. She fled from Colchis with Jason who made 
her his wife, and from whom she exacted a pledge never to love another woman. 
Her young brother, having been found on board the ship they sailed in, she tore 
him in pieces and flung him into the sea. She accompanied Jason to Greece, where 
she was looked on as a barbarian, but having conciliated King Peleus who was now 
a very old man, she induced him to try to regain youth by bathing in a magic 
cauldron of which she was to prepare the contents. So great was his faith in her 
powers, that the old man unhesitatingly plunged into her cauldron and was boiled 
alive. Her reason for this frightful act of cruelty was to hasten the succession 
to the throne of Jason, who in due course would have succeeded Peleus; but now 
the Greeks would have none of either him or <I>Medea, </I>and he was forced to 
leave Iolcos. Growing tired of the formidable enchantress to whom he had bound 
himself, Jason sought to contract an alliance with Glauce, a young princess. 
Dissembling her real intentions, <I>Medea </I>feigned friendship with the 
bride-elect and sent her as a wedding present a garment. which as soon as Glauce 
put it on, caused her to die in the greatest agony. She - Medea - parted from 
Jason; having murdered her two children by him, she fled from Corinth in her car 
drawn by dragons, to Athens, where she married Argeus, by whom she had a son, 
Medus. But the discovery of an attempt on the life of Theseus, forced her to 
leave Athens. Accompanied by her son, she returned to Colchis, and restored her 
father to the throne, of which he had been deprived by his own brother Perses. A 
great amount of literature has been written around <I>Medea: </I>Euripides, 
Ennius, Aeschylus, and later, Thomas Corneille having made her the theme of 
tragedies. <I>(See </I><B>Greece.)</P>

<P>Medicine, Occult :</B> &quot; The whole power of the occult physician,&quot; 
says Eliphas Levi, &quot; is in the conscience of his will, while his whole art 
consists in exciting the faith of his patient. ' If you have faith,' says the 
Master, 'all things are possible to him who believes.' The confidence must be 
dominated by expression, tone, gesture; confidence must be inspired by a 
fatherly manner, and cheerfulness stimulated by seasonable and sprightly 
conversations. Rabelais, who was a greater magician than he seemed, made 
pantagruelism his special panacea. He compelled his patients to laugh, and all 
the remedies be subsequently gave them succeeded better in consequence; he 
established a magnetic sympathy between himself and them, by means of which he 
communicated to them his own confidence and good humour; he flattered them in 
his prefaces, termed them his precious, most illustrious patients, and dedicated 
his books to them. So are we convinced that Gargantua and Pantagruel cured more 
black humours, more tendencies to madness, more atrabilious whims, at that epoch 
of religious animosities and civil wars, than the whole Faculty of medicine 
could boast. <I>Occult medicine </I>is essentially sympathetic. Reciprocal 
affection, or at least real good will, must exist between doctor and patient. 
Syrups and juleps have very little inherent virtue; they are what they become 
through the mutual opinion of operator and subject hence homeopathic medicines 
dispenses with them and no serious inconvenience follows. Oil and wine, combined 
with salt or camphor, are sufficient for the healing of all afflictions, and for 
all external frictions or soothing applications, oil and wine, are the chief 
medicaments of the Gospel tradition. They formed the balm of the Good Samaritan, 
and in the Apocalypse. when describing the last plagues, the prophet prays the 
avenging powers to spare these substances, that is, to leave a hope and a remedy 
for so many wounds. What we term extreme unction was the pure and simple 
practice of the Master's traditional medicine, both for the early Christians and 
in the mind of the apostle Saint James, who has included the precept in his 
epistle to the faithful of the whole world. Is any man sick among you,' he 
writes, ' let him call in the priests of the church, and let them pray over him, 
anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.' This divine therapeutic science 
was lost gradually, and Extreme Unction came to be regarded as a religious 
formality necessary as a preparation for death. At the same time, the 
thaumaturgic virtue of consecrated oil could not be altogether effaced from 
remembrance by the traditional doctrine, and it is perpetuated in the passage of 
the catechism which refers to Extreme Unction. Faith and charity were the most 
signal healing powers among the early Christians. The source of most diseases is 
in moral disorders; we must begin by healing the soul, and then the cure of the 
body will follow quickly.&quot;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Medieval Magic :</B> In the belief of the medieval professors of the science 
of <I>magic, </I>it conferred upon the adept power over angels, demons, 
elementary spirits and the souls of the dead, the possession of esoteric wisdom, 
and actual knowledge of the discovery and use of the latent forces and 
undeveloped energies resident in man. This was supposed to be accomplished by a 
combination of will and aspiration. which by sheer force germinate a new 
intellectual faculty of psychological perception, enabling the adept to view the 
wonders of a new world and communicate with its inhabitants. To accomplish this 
the ordinary faculties were almost invariably heightened by artificial means. 
The grandeur of the magical ritual overwhelmed the neophyte, and wondrously 
quickened his senses. Ceremonial <I>magic </I>was a marvellous spur to the 
latent faculties of man's psychic nature, just as were the rich concomitants of 
religious mysticism. In the <I>medieval </I>mind, as in other periods of man's 
history, it was thought that <I>magic </I>could be employed both for good and 
evil purposes,-its branches being designated &quot;white,&quot; and &quot; 
black,&quot; as it is used for benevolent or wicked ends. The term &quot; red 
&quot; <I>magic </I>is also occasionally employed. as indicating a more exalted 
type of the art, but the designation is fanciful. White <I>magic, </I>to a great 
extent, concerned itself with the evocation of angelic forces and of the spirits 
of the elements. The angelology of the Catholic Church was undoubtedly derived 
from the ancient faith of Israel, which in turn was indebted to Egypt and 
Babylon; and the Alexandrian system of successive emanations from the one and 
eternal substance, evolved a complex hierarchy of angels, all of whom appear to 
have been at the bidding of him who was in possession of<B> </B>the 
Incommunicable Name,-a concept borrowed purely from that of the Name of Power so 
greatly made use of in Egyptian <I>magic (See </I>Egypt.) The letters which 
composed this name were thought to possess a great measure of occult 
significance, and a power which in turn appears to have been reflected upon the 
entire Hebrew alphabet <I>(See </I>Kabala), which was thus endowed with mystical 
meaning, each of the letters representing a vital and creative number. Just as a 
language is formed from the letters of its alphabet, so from the secret powers 
which resided in the Hebrew alphabet, were evolved magical variations. From the 
letter ' aleph &quot; to that of &quot; jod &quot; the angelical world was 
symbolised. From &quot; caf&quot; to &quot; tsed ' were represented the several 
orders of angels who inhabited the various spheres, each of which 'gas under the 
direction of a particular intelligence. From &quot; tsed &quot; to &quot; than 
&quot; is in secret correspondence with the elemental world ; so that there were 
intelligences in correspondence with each of the Hebrew letters,- 
&quot;aleph&quot; with the Haioth-ha-kodesch of the seraphim, the first and 
supreme angelical rank; beth &quot; the second letter with the ophanim or angels 
of the second order; &quot; gimel &quot; with the aralim or angels of the third 
order, and so on to the tenth letter&quot; jod,&quot; which com pletes the 
enumeration of the angelical spheres. The rest of the Hebrew alphabet, however, 
corresponds to individual principalities and powers-all of whom hold an 
important place in the mystical universe. Thus caf the eleventh letter is in 
correspondence with Mettatron who belongs to the first heaven of the astronomic 
world. Final &quot; caf,&quot; the next letter, corresponds to the intelligences 
of the secret order whose supreme chief is Raziel ; &quot;and lamed &quot; the 
twelfth letter corresponds to those of the third sphere, that of Saturn, whose 
lord is Schebtaiel: and so on : these intelligences under their queen, with the 
sixteenth letter am and &quot; pe&quot; the seventeenth of the Hebrew alphabet, 
refer to the first of the mystical elements-that of Fire, which is ruled over by 
the seraphim. Final &quot;pe &quot; corresponds to the air where dwell the 
sylphs, who are presided over by Ariel. </P>
<P>&quot;Tsade&quot; refers to water where dwell the nymphs under their queen 
Tharsis; and koph&quot; corresponds to earth, the sphere of the gnomes, ruled 
over by the cherubim. The twentieth letter &quot;resh&quot; applies to the 
animal kingdom, including man. &quot;Shin&quot; corresponds to the vegetable 
world. 'Tau&quot; the last symbol of the Hebrew alphabet refers to the world of 
minerals. There are besides these many other species of angels and powers, as 
will be seen from reference to the articles on ' Angels&quot; and ' 
Kabala.&quot; More exalted intelligences were conjured by rites to be found in 
the ancient book known as the <I>Key of Solomon, </I>and perhaps the most 
satisfactory collection of formulae for the invocation of the higher angels is 
that included in the anonymous <I>Theosophia Pneumatica, </I>published at 
Frankfort in <B>1686</B>, which bears a strong family resemblance to the 
<I>Treatise on Magic </I>by Arbatel. The names in this work do not tally with 
those which have been already given, but as it is admitted by occult students 
that the names of all unseen beings are really unknown to humanity, this does 
not seem of such importance as it might at first sight. It would seem that such 
spiritual knowledge as the <I>medieval magus </I>was capable of attaining was 
insufficient to raise him above the intellectual limitations of his time, so 
that the work in question possesses all the faults of its age and type. But that 
is not to say that it is possessed of no practical value: and it may be taken as 
well-illustrating the white <I>magic </I>of <I>medieval </I>times. It classifies 
the names of the angels under the title of Olympic or Celestial Spirits, who 
abide in the firmament and constellations they administer inferior destinies and 
accomplish and teach whatever is portended by the several stars in which they 
are insphered. They are powerless to act without a special command from the 
Almighty. The stewards of Heaven are seven in number-Arathron, Bethor, Phaleg, 
Och, Hagith, Ophiel, and Phul. Each of them has a numerous host at his command, 
and the regions in which they dwell are <B>196</B> in all. Arathron appears on 
Saturday at the first hour, and answers for his territory and its inhabitants; 
as do the others, each at his own day and hour and each presides for a period of 
<B>490</B> years. The functions of Bethor began in the fiftieth year before the 
birth of Christ <B>430</B>. Phagle reigned till A.D. <B>920</B>; Och till the 
year <B>1410</B>; Hagith governed until A.D. <B>1900</B>. The others follow in 
succession. These intelligences are the stewards of all the elements, energising 
the firmament and, with their armies, depending from each other in a regular 
hierarchy. The names of the minor Olympian spirits are interpreted in divers 
ways, but those alone are powerful which they themselves give, which are adapted 
to the end for which they have been summoned. Generically, they are called 
Astra, and their power is seldom prolonged beyond one hundred and forty years. 
The heavens and their inhabitants come voluntarily to man and often serve 
against even the will of man, but how much more if we implore their ministry. 
That evil and troublesome spirits also approach men is accomplished by the 
cunning of the devil, at times by conjuration or attraction, and frequently as a 
penalty for sins therefore, shall he who would abide in familiarity with 
celestial intelligences take pains to avoid every serious sin; be shall 
diligently pray for the protection of God to vanquish the impediments and 
schemes of Diabolus, and God will ordain that the devil himself shall work to 
the direct profit of the Theosophist. Su<SUP>b</SUP>ject to Divine Providence, 
some spirits have power over pestilence and famine, some are destroyers of 
cities, like those of Sodom and Gomorrah, some are rulers over kingdoms, some 
guardians of provinces, some of a single person. The spirits are the ministers 
of the word of God, of the Church and its members, or they serve creatures in 
material things, sometimes to the salvation of soul and body, or, again, to the 
ruin of both. But nothing, good or bad, is done without knowledge, order, and 
administration.</P>
<P>It is unnecessary to follow the angelical host farther here, as we have 
outlined it elsewhere. Many preparations, however, are described by the author 
of the <I>Theosophia Pneumatica </I>for the successful evocation of these 
exalted beings. The magus must ponder during his period of initiation on the 
method of attaining the true knowledge of God, both by night and day. He must 
know the laws of the cosmos, and the practical secrets which may be gleaned from 
the study of the visible and invisible creatures of God. He must further know 
himself, and be able to distinguish between his mortal and immortal parts, and 
the several spheres to which they belong. Both in his mortal and immortal 
natures, he shall strive to love God, to adore and to fear him in spirit and in 
truth. He must sedulously attempt to find out whether he is fitted for the 
practice of <I>magic, </I>and if so to what branch he should turn his talents, 
experimenting in all to discover in which be is most naturally gifted. He must 
hold inviolate such secrets as are communicated to him by spirits, and he must 
accustom himself to their evocation. He must keep himself, however, from the 
least suspicion of diabolical <I>magic, </I>which has to do with Satan, and 
which is the perversion of the theurgic power concealed in the word of God. When 
he has fulfilled these conditions, and before he proceeds to the practice of his 
art, he should devote a prefatory period to deep contemplation on the high 
business which he has voluntarily taken in hand, and must present himself before 
God with a pure heart, undefiled mouth and innocent hands. He must bathe 
frequently and wear clean garments, confess his sins and abstain from wine for 
the space of three days. On the eve of operation, he must dine sparely at noon, 
and sup on bread and water, and on the day he has chosen for the invocation he 
must seek a retired and uncontaminated spot, entirely free from observation. 
After offering up prayer, he compels the spirit which he has chosen to appear: 
that is, he has passed into a condition, when it is impossible that the spirit 
should remain invisible to him. On the arrival of the angel, the desire of the 
magus is briefly communicated to him, and his answer is written down. More than 
three questions should not be asked, and the angel is then dismissed into his 
special sphere. Besides having converse with angels, the magus had also power 
over the spirits of the elements. The reader is referred to the special article 
upon these, and we shall confine ourselves in this place to describing the 
manner of their evocation. To obtain power over the salamanders for example, the 
<I>Comte de Gabalis </I>gives the following receipt: If you would recover empire 
over the salamanders, purify and exalt the natural fire that is within you. 
Nothing is required for this purpose but the concentration of the Fire of the 
World by means of concave mirrors in a globe of glass. In that globe is formed 
the &lsquo;solary&rsquo; powder, which being of itself purified from the mixture 
of other elements, and being prepared according to Art be-comes in a very short 
time a sovereign process for the exaltation of the fire that is within you, and 
transmutes you into an igneous nature.&quot; There is very little matter extant 
to show in what manner the evocation of Elementary spirits was undertaken, and 
no ritual has survived which will acquaint us with the method of communicating 
with them. In older writers it is difficult to distinguish between angels and 
elementary spirits, and it is probable that the lesser angels of the older 
magicians were the sylphs of Paracelsus, and the more modern professors of the 
art. The lower hierarchies of the elementary spirits were also frequently 
invoked by the black magician. Eliphas Levi provides a method for the 
interrogation and government of elementary spirits ; but he does not acquaint us 
with its source, and it is merely fragmentary. It is necessary,&quot; he says, 
in order to dominate these intelligences, to undergo the four trials of ancient 
initiation, and as these are unknown, their room must be supplied by similar 
tests. To approach the salamanders, therefore, one must expose himself in a 
burning house. To draw near the sylphs he must cross a precipice on a plank, or 
ascend a lofty mountain in a storm; and he who would win to the abode of the 
undines must plunge into a cascade or whirlpool. Thus power being acquired 
through courage and indomitable energy this fire, earth and water must be 
consecrated and exorcised.&quot;</P>
<P>The air is exorcised by the sufflation of the four cardinal points, the 
recitation of the prayer of the sylphs, and by the following formula -The Spirit 
of God moved upon the water, and breathed into the nostrils of man the breath of 
life. Be Michael my leader, and be Sabtabiel my servant, in the name and by the 
virtue of light. Be the power of the word in my breath, and I will govern the 
spirits of this creature of Air, and by the will of my soul, I will restrain the 
steeds of the sun,, and by the thought of my mind, and by the apple of my right 
eye. I exorcise thee O creature of Air, by the Petagrammaton, and in the name 
Tetragrammaton, wherein are steadfast will and well-directed faith. Amen. Sela. 
So be it.</P>
<P>Water is exorcised by the laying on of hands, by breathing and by speech, and 
by mixing sacred salt with a little of the ash which is left in an incense pan. 
The aspergillus is made of branches of vervain, periwinkle, sage, mint, ash, and 
basil, tied by a thread taken from a virgin's distaff, with a handle of 
hazelwood which has never borne fruit. and on which the characters of the seven 
spirits must be graven with the magic awl. The salt and ashes of the incense 
must be separately consecrated. The prayer of the undines should follow.</P>
<P>Fire is exorcised by casting salt, incense, white resin, camphor and sulphur 
therein, and by thrice pronouncing the three names of the genii of fire-Michael, 
Samael, and Anael, and then by reciting the prayer of the salamanders.</P>
<P>The Earth is exorcised by the sprinkling of water, by breathing, and by fire, 
and the prayer of the gnomes. Their signs are the hieroglyphs of the Bull for 
the Gnomes who are commanded with the magic sword ; of the Lion for the 
Salamanders, who are commanded with the forked rod, or <I>magic </I>trident; of 
the Eagle for the Slyphs, who are ruled by the holy pentacles; and, finally, of 
Aquarius for the Undines, who are evoked by the cup of libations. Their 
respective sovereigns are Gob for the Gnomes, Djin for the Salamanders, Paralda 
for the Sylphs, and Necksa for the Undines. These names, it will be noticed, are 
borrowed from folklore.</P>
<P>The &quot; laying &quot; of an elementary spirit is accomplished by its 
adjuration by air, water, fire, and earth, by breathing, sprinkling, the burning 
of perfumes, by tracing on the ground the' Star of Solomon and the sacred 
Pentagram, which should be drawn either with ash of consecrated fire or with a 
reed soaked in various colours, mixed with pure loadstone. The Conjuration of 
the Four should then be repeated, the magus holding the pentacle of Solomon in 
his hand and taking up by turns the sword, red and cup,-this operation being 
preceded and terminated by the Kabalistic sign of the cross. In order to 
subjugate an elementary spirit, the magus must be himself free of their 
besetting sins; thus a changeful person cannot rule the sylphs, nor a fickle one 
the undines, an angry man the salamanders, or a covetous one the gnomes. We have 
given elsewhere <I>(See </I>Necromancy) the formula for the evocation of 
spirits, so there is no necessity to repeat it in this place. The white magician 
did not concern himself as a rule with such matters as the raising of demons, 
animal transformations and the like, his whole desire being the exaltation of 
his spiritual nature; and the questions put by him to the spirits he evoked were 
all directed to that end. <I>(See </I><STRONG>Magic.</STRONG>)</P>

<P>Medium :</B> A person supposed to be qualified in some special manner to form 
a link between the dead and the living Through him the spirits of the departed 
may communicate with their friends still on earth, either by making use of the 
material organism of the <I>medium </I>himself (&quot; automatic 
phenomena&quot;) or by producing in the physical world certain manifestations 
which cannot be explained by known physical laws. The essential qualification of 
a <I>medium </I>is an abnormal sensitiveness, which enables him to be readily 
controlled &quot; by disembodied spirits. For this reason <I>mediums </I>are 
also known as <I>sensitives. </I>There is some doubt as to whether mediumship is 
an inherent faculty, or whether it may be acquired; and among some spiritualists 
at least, the belief is held that all men are <I>mediums, </I>though in varying 
degrees, and consequently that all are in communication with the spirits, from 
whom proceeds what we call inspiration.&quot; Those who are ordinarily 
designated mediums&quot; are but gifted with the common faculty in a higher 
degree than their fellows.</P>
<P>Mediumship, like all the central doctrines of spiritualism, dates back to 
very early times. Demoniac possession affords an excellent instance ; so also 
does witchcraft, while the <I>somnambule </I>of the mesmerists was identical 
with the modern <I>medium. </I>In its usual application, however, the term 
<I>medium </I>is used only of those sensitives who belong to the modern 
spiritualistic movement, which had its<B> </B>origin in America in <B>1848</B> 
<I>(See </I><B>Spiritualism.) </B>In this<B> </B>sense, then, Mrs. Fox and her 
daughters, the heroines of the Rochester Rappings, were the earliest <I>mediums. 
</I>The phenomena of their stances consisted mainly of knockings, by means of 
which messages were conveyed from the spirits to the sitters. Other <I>mediums 
</I>rapidly sprang up, first in America, and later in Britain and the Continent. 
Their mediumship was of two kinds, physical&quot; and automatic. These phases 
were to be found either separately or combined in one person, as in the case of 
the Rev. Stainton Moses (q.v.) Indeed, it was practically impossible to find a 
trance speaker who did not at one time or another practise the physical 
manifestations, until the time of Mrs. Piper, whose phenomena were purely 
subjective. The early rappings speedily developed into more elaborate 
manifestations. For a few years an epidemic of table-turning (q.v.) caused 
wide-spread excitement, and the motions of the table became a favourite means of 
communicating with the spirits. The playing of musical instruments without 
visible agency was a form of manifestation which received the attention of 
<I>mediums </I>from an early date, as was also the bringing into the stance-room 
of &quot;apports&quot; of fruit, flowers, perfume, and all manner of portable 
property. Darkness was found to facilitate the spirit-manifestations, and as 
there are certain physical processes, such as those in photography, to which 
darkness is essential, no logical objection could be offered to the dimness of 
the stance-room. The members of the circle were generally seated round a table, 
holding each other's hands, and they were often enjoined to sing or talk pending 
the materialisation of a spirit. All this, though offering grounds of suspicion 
to the incredulous, was plausibly explained by the spiritualists. As time went 
on, and the demand for physical manifestations increased, these became more 
daring and more varied. The moving of objects without contact, the levitation of 
heavy furniture, and of the persons of <I>medium </I>or sitters, the elongation 
of the human body, the fire-ordeal, were all practised by the <I>medium 
</I>Home. At the stances of the Davenport Brothers musical instruments were 
played and moved about the room, and objects moved without being touched, while 
the <I>mediums </I>were bound hand and foot in a small cabinet. The 
slate-writing of &quot; Dr.&quot; Slade and William Eglinton had a considerable 
vogue. The tying of knots in endless cords, the passage of solids, through 
solids, were commonplaces of the mediumistic circle. The crowning achievement, 
however, was the materialisation of the spirit-form. Quite early in the history 
of spiritualism hands were materialised, then faces, and finally the complete 
form of the ' control.&quot; Thereafter the materialised spirits allowed 
themselves to be touched, and even condescended, on occasion, to hold 
conversations with the sitters. Further proof of the actuality of the spirit 
&quot; control &quot; was offered by spirit photography (q.v.).</P>
<P>To those for whom spiritualism was a religion, however, much the most 
important part of the mediumistic performances is the trance-utterances and the 
like which come under the heading of automatic,&quot; or psychological 
phenomena. These dealt largely with the conditions of life on the other side of 
the grave, and in style they tended to be verbose and incoherent. The 
spirit-drawings, also, were lacking in depths and distinction. Clairvoyance and 
crystal vision are included in tile psychological phenomena, and so also are the 
pseudo-prophetic utterances of <I>mediums, </I>and the speaking in unknown 
tongues. According to the spiritualistic hypothesis already referred to, that 
all men are <I>mediums,&quot; </I>it would be necessary to class inspiration, 
not only the inspiration of genius, but all good or evil impulses-as spiritual 
phenomena, and that in turn suggests that the every-day life of the normal 
individual is to some extent directed by spirit &quot; controls.&quot; And 
therein lies the responsibility of mediumship, for if he would be con trolled by 
pure spirits from the higher spheres, it behoves the <I>medium </I>to live a 
well-conducted and principled life. Misuse of the divine gift of mediumship 
carries with it its own punishment, for the <I>medium </I>becomes the sport of 
base human spirits and elementals (q.v.), his will is sapped, and his whole 
being degraded. Likewise he must be wary of a up his personality to the first 
spirit who comes his way, for the low and earth-bound spirits have least 
difficulty in communicating with the living, having still more affinity with the 
things of the earth than with those of the spirit.</P>
<P>Of the physical <I>mediums </I>perhaps the most successful was Daniel Dunglas 
Home (<B>1833</B>-<B>1886</B>), who claimed to be of Scottish birth. He went to 
America, however, at an early age. and it was there that his mediumistic powers 
were first developed, though not until he came to Britain in <B>1855</B> did he 
rise to fame. It is worthy of note that Home was never detected in fraud-as the 
bulk of physical <I>mediums </I>have been at one time or another-though his 
performances were similar in kind to those of other <I>mediums. </I>This may be 
due in part to the fact that he did not act as a professional <I>medium, </I>and 
his sitters, being either his guests or his hosts, were doubtless restrained by 
courtesy from a too close enquiry into his methods. Again, all who came into 
contact with him were impressed by his simple manners, and frank and 
affectionate disposition, so that he possessed the most valuable asset of a 
<I>medium-the </I>ability to inspire confidence in his sitters. <I>Mediums 
</I>of a different stamp, though widely popular in their day, were the brothers 
Davenport. Their performance consisted of allowing themselves to be securely 
bound in a cabinet by the sitters, and while thus handicapped producing the 
usual mediumistic phenomena. The Davenports were shown to be mere conjurers. 
however, and when Maskelyne and Cook successfully imitated their feats the 
exposure was complete. Slate-writing, which proved one of the most 
widely-accepted forms of psychic phenomena, had as its principal exponents Henry 
Slade and William Eglinton. The best argument which can be advanced against 
their feats is to be found in the pseudo-stances of Mr. S. J. Davey, given in 
the interests of the Society for Psychical Research. Mr. Davey's slate-writing 
exhibitions were so like to those of the professional <I>mediums </I>that the 
spiritualists refused to believe that he was conjuring, and hailed him as a 
renegade <I>medium! </I>Automatic drawing was principally represented by David 
Duguid, a Glasgow <I>medium </I>who attained considerable success in that line. 
Prominent trance speakers and writers were Duguid, J. J. Morse, Mrs. Hardinge 
Britten, and Mrs. Cora L. V. Tappan-Richmond. One of the best-known and most 
respected of private <I>mediums </I>was the Rev. Stainton Muses 
(<B>1839</B>-<B>92</B>), a clergyman and schoolmaster, whose normal life, at 
least, was beyond reproach. He produced both automatic and physical 
manifestations, the former including the writing of a work <I>Spirit Teachings, 
</I>dictated from time to time by his spirit controls,&quot; while the latter 
comprised levitations, lights. &quot;apports,&quot; and so on. His position, 
character, and education gave to his support of spiritualism a stability of 
considerable value.</P>
<P>It is to later <I>mediums, </I>however, that we must look for proof worthy of 
scientific consideration, and of these the most important are Eusapia Palladino 
and Mrs. Piper. Eusapia Palladino, an Italian <I>medium, </I>was born in 
<B>1854</B>, and for a good many years had acted as <I>medium </I>for scientific 
investigators. In <B>1892</B> stances were held at Milan, at which were present 
Professors Schiaparelli, Brofferio, Lobmroso, Richet, and others. In <B>1894</B> 
Professor Richet conducted some experiments with Eusapia at his house in the Ile 
Roubaud, to which he invited Professor Lodge, Mr.Myers, and Dr. Ochorowiez. The 
phenomena occurring in Eusapia's presence were the ordinary manifestations of 
the mediumistic seance, but their interest lay in the fact that all the 
distinguished investigators professed themselves satisfied that the <I>medium, 
</I>with her hands, head, and feet controlled by the sitters, could not of 
herself produce the phenomena. Credible witnesses asserted that Eusapia 
possessed the ability to project false or psychic limbs from her person. 
Professor Lodge and Mr. Myers were disposed to look for a new force (ectenic 
force) emanating from the <I>medium. </I>In <B>1895</B>, however, some seances 
with Eusapia were held at Mr. Myers' house at Cambridge, where it became 
apparent that she habitually freed a hand or a foot-in short, habitually 
resorted to fraud. Yet even these exposures were not conclusive for in 
<B>1898</B>, after a further series of experiments, Mr. Myers and Professors 
Lodge and Richet once more declared their belief in the genuineness of this 
<I>medium's </I>phenomena.</P>
<P>Mrs. Piper, the Boston <I>medium </I>whose trance utterances and writings 
contain the best evidence forthcoming in recent years for the truth of 
spiritualism, first fell into a spontaneous trance in <B>1884</B>, and in the 
following year was observed by Professor James of Harvard. Thereafter her case 
was carefully studied by the Society for Psychical Research. Her first important 
&quot; control&quot; was a French physician, Dr. Phinuit, who was probably a 
fiction, but in <B>1892</B> she was controlled by George Pelham, a young author 
who had died in February of that year. So complete was her impersonation of 
Pelham that more than thirty of his friends claimed to recognise him, and so 
well did he establish his identity by the mention of many private matters, known 
only to himself and a few of his friends that the hypothesis of spirit-control 
was almost inevitable. In <B>1896</B> George Pelham gave place to&quot; 
Imperator,&quot; &quot; Rector,&quot; and other spirits, who had formerly 
controlled Stainton Moses. From that time, and especially after <B>1900</B>, the 
interest of the sittings declined, and they offered less material for the 
investigator. Another automatic <I>medium, </I>Hele'ne Smith, came under the 
observation of Professor Flournoy. Helene's trance utterances were spoken in the 
Martian language,&quot; a variant of the &quot; unknown tongue&quot; of the 
early ecstatics, and she claimed to be a re-incarnation of Marie Antoinette and 
a Hindu princess.</P>
<P>Of the various theories advanced to explain the mediumistic manifestations 
the most important is the spiritualistic explanation, which claims that the 
phenomena are produced by the spirits of the dead acting on the sensitive 
organism of the <I>medium. </I>The evidence for such a theory, though some 
investigators of the highest distinction have found it satisfactory, is 
nevertheless generally acknowledged to be inconclusive. Conscious fraud, though 
it is no longer considered to cover the whole ground, yet plays a definite part 
in the phenomena of both &quot;physical&quot; and trance <I>mediums, </I>for it 
has been shown that the latter frequently collect, through private enquiry 
agents, information anent possible sitters which is later retailed by the &quot; 
controls.&quot; The spiritualist's explanation of these lapses into fraud is 
that they are instigated by the spirits themselves. And it does not seem 
impossible that a genuine <I>medium </I>might have resort to fraud during a 
temporary failure of his psychic powers. Automatism. covers a still wider field. 
That automatic utterances, writing, drawing, etc., may be quite involuntary, and 
without the sphere of the <I>medium's </I>normal consciousness, is no longer to 
be doubted The psychological phenomena may be met with in small children, and in 
private <I>mediums </I>whose good faith is beyond question, and the state is 
recognised as being allied to hypnotism and hysteria. Besides automatism and 
fraud there are some other factors to be considered ere the possibility of 
transcendental faculties be touched upon.</P>
<P>On the part of the sitter as well as of the <I>medium </I>some deception may 
be practised. It has been said that the ability to inspire confidence in his 
sitters is essential to a successful <I>medium, </I>and if at the same time the 
sitters be predisposed to believe in the supernatural nature of the 
manifestations, it is easy to imagine a lessening of the attention and 
observation so necessary to the investigator. The impossibility of continued 
observation for even a short period is a fact that can only be proved by 
experiment. Memory defects and proneness to exaggeration are also accountable 
for many of the marvels of the seance-room, and possible hallucination must be 
considered. When the <I>medium </I>is in a trance, with its accompanying 
hyperaesthesia, unconscious suggestion on the part of the sitters might offer a 
rational explanation of so-called &quot;clairvoyance.&quot; But when all these 
factors are removed the root problems of mediumship still remain. In the case of 
Mrs. Piper for instance, the least that can be said for her trance utterances is 
that they were telepathic that she gathered information from the minds of her 
sitters, or through them from other living minds. To not a few, however, they 
presented definite proof of spirit communication. To meet such instances Mr. 
Myers formulated his doctrine of transcendental faculties, crediting the 
<I>medium </I>with clairvoyance and pre-vision. But no really conclusive test 
has ever been complied with. Psychical researchers have left sealed letters, 
whose contents are known only to themselves, instructing that after their deaths 
the letters be submitted to a <I>medium, </I>but in no case have the contents 
been correctly revealed. Again, in the case of Eusapia Palladino, Mr. Myers, Sir 
Oliver Lodge, and others have inclined to the belief in a force emanating from 
the <I>medium </I>herself by which the physical manifestations are produced. 
Here, also, the evidence cannot be considered conclusive. Skilled and scientific 
investigators have from time to time been deceived by what has actually proved 
to be sleight of hand, and, in fact, the only trustworthy evidence possible 
would be that of automatic records.</P>
<P>At the same time the testimony of such distinguished gentlemen as Professor 
Richet, Sir O. Lodge, and others makes it evident that judgment must not be 
hastily pronounced on the <I>medium, </I>but rather that an earnest endeavour be 
made to solve the problems in that connection.</P><I>
<P>Healing Mediums.-The </I>diagnosis and cure of disease have been extensively 
practised by spiritualistic <I>mediums, </I>following in the path of the older 
somnambules and magnetic subjects. These latter were wont not only to trace the 
progress of their own diseases, but also to diagnose and to prescribe a mode of 
treatment. At the outset it was not prescribed for the diseases of those with 
whom they were in <I>rapport </I>and likewise the <I>medium, </I>having 
established <I>rapport </I>between his control and the patient, was influenced 
to prescribe a mode of treatment At the outset it was not considered proper for 
the <I>healing medium </I>to accept any remuneration for his services, but later 
healers usually demanded a fee. It is true that <I>healing mediums, </I>like 
Christian Scientists, mesmerists, magnetists, and others, have effected a 
considerable proportion of <I>bone fide </I>cures, but whether by spirit 
influence or suggestion is a point on which there is too much diversity of 
opinion for it to be discussed here. It is claimed for many <I>mediums </I>that 
they have cured diseases of long standing, which were pronounced incurable-heart 
disease, consumption, cancers, paralysis, and many more. Some also have been 
credited with the power to heal instantaneously, as did the Cure d'Ars and other 
miraculous healers. The marvellous potency of the waters at Lourdes is 
considered by spiritualists to be the gift of discarnate beings, having been in 
the first instance revealed to a child by her spirit guide, in the form of a 
white angel.</P><B>

<P>Melusina :</B> The most famous of the fays of France. Being condemned to turn 
into a serpent from the waist downwards every Saturday, she made her husband, 
Count Raymond of Lusignan, promise never to come near her on a Saturday. This 
prohibition finally exciting his curiosity and suspicion, he hid himself and 
witnessed his wife's transformation. Melusina was now compelled to quit her 
mortal husband and destined to wander about as a spectre till the day of doom. 
It is said also that the count immured her in the dungeon of his castle.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Mental World :</B> Formerly known as the Manas Plane-is in the theosophic 
scheme of things, the third lowest of the seven worlds. It is the world of 
thought into which man passes on the death of the astral body, and it is 
composed of the seven divisions of matter in common with the other worlds. It is 
observed that the <I>mental world </I>is the world of thought, but it is 
necessary to realise that it is the world of good thoughts only, for the base 
have all been purged away during the soul's stay in the astral world. According 
as these thoughts are, is the power to perceive the <I>mental world. 
</I>Perfected man would be free of the whole of it, but the ordinary man has in 
his past imperfect experience, gathered only a comparatively small amount of 
thought and he is, therefore. unable to perceive more than a comparatively small 
part of his surroundings. It follows from this that though his bliss is 
inconceivably great, his sphere of action is very limited,-this limitation, 
however, becoming less and less with his abode there after each fresh 
incarnation. In the Heaven world-division into which he awakes after dying in 
the astral world, he finds vast, unthought-of means of pursuing what has seemed 
to him good, art, science, philosophy and so forth. Here, all those come to a 
glorious fruition of which we can have no conception, and at last the time 
arrives when he casts aside his mental body and awakens in his casual body to 
the still greater bliss of the higher division of the <I>mental world. </I>At 
this stage he has done with the bodies which form his mortal personality, and 
which form his home in successive incarnations, and he is now truly himself, a 
spirit, immortal and unchangeable except for increasing development and 
evolution. Into his casual body is worked all that he has experienced in his 
physical, astral and mental bodies, and when he still finds that experience 
insufficient for his needs, he descends again into grosser matter in order that 
he may learn yet more and more.</P>

believed that nature formed all metals of <I>mercury, </I>and that it is a 
living and feminine principle. It went through many processes, and the metal 
evolved was pure or impure according to the locality of its production.</P>

<P>Merlin :</B> An enchanter of Britain who dwelt at the court of King Arthur. 
His origin is obscure, but early legends concerning him agree that he was the 
offspring of Satan. He was probably an early Celtic god, who in process of time 
came to be regarded as a great sorcerer. There appears to have been more than 
one <I>Merlin, </I>and we must discriminate between the Merlin of Arthurian 
romance and Merlin Caledonius; but it is probable that originally the two 
conceptions sprang from the one idea.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Mesmer, Franz Antoine : </B>An Austrian doctor, born at Weil about the year 
<B>1733</B>. In <B>1766</B> he took a degree in medicine at Vienna, the subject 
of his inaugural thesis being <I>De planetarum Influxu </I>(De l'influence des 
Planettes sur le corps humain) The influence of the planets he identified with 
magnetism. On seeing the remarkable cures of Gassner he supposed that the 
magnetic force must also reside in the human body, and thereupon dispensed with 
magnets. In <B>1778</B> he went to Paris where he was very favourably 
received-by the public, that is, for the medical authorities there, as 
elsewhere, refused to countenance him. His method was to seat his patients round 
a large circular vat on <I>baquet, </I>in which various substances were mixed. 
Each patient held one end of an iron rod, the other end of which was in the 
baquet. In due time the crisis ensued. Violent convulsions, cries, laughter, and 
various physical symptoms followed, these being in turn superseded by lethargy. 
Many claimed to have been healed by this method. In <B>1784</B> the government 
appointed a commission of members of the <I>Faculte de Medecine, </I>the 
<I>Societe Royale de Medecine, </I>and the Academy of Sciences, the 
commissioners from the latter body including Franklin, Bailly, and Lavoisier. 
The report of the Committee stated, in effect, that there was no such thing as 
animal magnetism, and referred the facts of the crisis to the imagination of the 
patient. It had the effect of quenching to a considerable extent the public 
interest in mesmerism, as animal magnetism was called, for the time at least, 
though it was afterwards to be revived. <I>Mesmer </I>died in 
<B>1815</B>.</P><B>

<P>Metals in Animal Magnetism : </B>It<B> </B>is recorded by the magnetists that 
the various <I>metals </I>exercised a characteristic influence on their 
patients. Physical sensations of heat and cold numbness, drowsiness, and so on 
were experienced by the somnambules on contact with <I>metals, </I>or even when 
<I>metals </I>were secretly introduced into the room. Dr. Elliotson, especially, 
gave much prominence to the alleged power of <I>metal </I>to transmit the 
magnetic fluid. Gold, silver, platinum, and nickel were good conductors, though 
the magnetism conveyed by the latter was of a highly dangerous character. 
Copper, tin, pewter, and zinc were bad conductors. Elliotson found that a 
magnetised sovereign would throw into the trance his sensitives the sisters 
Okey, and that though iron would neutralise the magnetic properties of the 
sovereign, no other metal would do so. When Baron von Reichenbach propounded his 
theory of odylic force his sensitives saw a luminous emanation proceed from 
metals-silver and gold shone white ; lead, blue nickle, red, and so on. All 
these phenomena may be referred to suggestion.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Metempsychosis, or Transmigration :</B> The passing of the soul at death into 
another body than the one it has vacated. The belief in <I>metempsychosis 
</I>was very wide-spread in ancient times, and still survives in Braminism and 
Buddhism, as well as in European folk-tales and superstitions. The Brahmins and 
Buddhists believe that the soul may enter another human body) or that of one of 
the lower anima[s, or even a plant or tree, according to its deserts in the 
previous incarnation. Thus it is doomed to successive- incarnations, till by the 
suppression of all desires and emotions it loses itself in the Supreme Being. 
Very similar was the idea of Pythagoras and the Greeks, who believed that all 
material existence was a punishment for sins committed in a former incarnation. 
Indeed it is probable that Pythagoras derived his theory from the Brahminical 
doctrine. The ancient Egyptians would also seem to have believed in 
metempsychosis. Among certain savage tribes of Africa and America 
<I>transmigration </I>is generally subscribed to at the present day. These 
savages imagine the discarnate spirit very much out of its element till it has 
found another body to dwell in, which it does as speedily as possible. Totemism 
may perhaps facilitate a belief in the passing of the soul into the body of an 
animal. In Europe also in early times the belief in <I>metempsychosis 
</I>flourished, and several popular folk-tiles, such as that known in Scotland 
as <I>The Milk-white Doo, </I>of which variants are found in many lands, contain 
references to the souls of the dead entering into beasts, birds, or fishes. In 
some places it is thought that witches are at death transformed into hares, and 
for this reason the people of those localities refuse to eat a hare. The Jewish 
Kabalists also believed in the doctrine of <I>metempsychosis, </I>and traces of 
it are to be found in the writings of Swedenborg.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Metratton :</B> According to Jewish rabbinical legend, <I>Metratton, </I>the 
angel, is one of the agents by whom God the Father works. He receives the pure 
and simple essence of the divinity and bestows the gift of life upon all. He 
dwells in one of the angelic hierarchies.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Mexico and Central America :</B> Occult science among the ancient Mexicans 
may be said to have been in that stage between the savage simplicities of 
medicine-men and the more sophisticated magical practices of the medieval 
sorcerer. The sources which inform us regarding it are unfortunately of a most 
scanty description and are chiefly gleaned from the works of the early 
missionaries to the country, and from the legends and myths of the people 
themselves. Writing upon the sorcerers of <I>Mexico, </I>Sahagun, an early 
Spanish priest, states that the <I>naualli </I>or magician among the Mexicans is 
one who enchants men and sucks the blood of infants during the night. This would 
seem as if the writer had confounded the sorcerer with the vampire,-a mistake 
occasionally made by continental writers on magic. He proceeds to say that among 
the Mexicans this class is ignorant of nothing which appertains to sorcery, and 
possesses great craft and natural address ; that they hire themselves out to 
people to work evil upon their enemies, and to cause madness and maladies.</P>
<P>&quot;The necromancer,&quot; he says, is a person who has made pact with a 
demon, and who is capable of transforming himself into various animal shapes. 
Such people appear to be tired of life and await death with complaisance. The 
astrologer practises among the people as a diviner, and has a thorough knowledge 
of the various signs of the calendar, from which he is able to prognosticate the 
fortunes of those who employ him. This he accomplishes by weighing the power of 
one planet against that of another, and thus discovering the resultant applies 
it to the case in point. These men were called into consultation at births and 
deaths, as well as upon public occasions, and would dispute with much nicety on 
their art.&quot; The astrological system of the Mexicans was like that of their 
calendar of the most involved description possible, and no mere summary of it 
could convey anything but a hazy notion of the system, for which the reader is 
referred to the author's <I>Civilisation of Ancient </I>Mexico, Sahagun's 
<I>Historia, </I>and Bulletin <B>28</B> of the United States <I>Bureau of 
Ethnology. </I>In connection with the astrological science of the Aztecs, 
however, it is worthy of note that the seventh calendric sign, was that under 
which necromancers, sorcerers and evil-doers were usually born. Says Sahagun: 
&quot; These work their enchantments in obscurity for four nights running, when 
they choose a certain evil sign. They then betake themselves in the night to the 
houses where they desire to work their evil deeds and sorceries For the rest 
these sorcerers never know contentment, for all their days they live evilly and 
know no peace.&quot;</P>
<P>The myths of the Mexicans give us a good working idea of the status of the 
enchanter or sorcerer in Aztec society. For example we find that the Toltec god, 
Quetzalcoatl, who in early times was regarded as a description of culture-hero, 
was bewitched by the god of the incoming and rival race, Tezcatlipoca, who 
disguised himself as a physician and prescribed for an illness of his enemy's an 
enchanted draught, which made him long for the country of his origin-that is, 
the home of the rains. From this we may judge that potions or philtres were in 
vogue amongst Mexican sorcerers. In their efforts to rid themselves of the 
entire Toltec race, the traditional aborigines of <I>Mexico, </I>Tezcatlipoca is 
pictured as performing upon a magical drum in such a manner as to cause frenzy 
amongst the Toltecs, who leaped by thousands into a deep ravine hard by their 
city; and similar instances of the kind are occasionally to be met with. 
Wonderful stories are told of the feats of the Huaxteca, a people of Maya race, 
dwelling on the Gulf of Mexico. Sahagun relates that they could produce from 
space a spring with fishes, burn and restore a hut, and dismember and resurrect 
themselves. The Ocuiltec of the Toluca Valley also possessed a wide-spread 
reputation as enchanters and magicians.</P><I>
<P>Divination and A</I>ugury.-As has been said, divination was practised among 
the Aztecs by means of astrology; but there were other and less-intricate 
methods in use. There was in existence a College of Augurs corresponding in 
purpose. to the Auspices of Ancient Rome, the members of which occupied 
themselves with observing the flight and listening to the songs of birds, from 
which they drew their conclusions, and pretended to interpret the speech of all 
winged creatures. The <I>Calmecac, </I>or training college of the priests, had a 
department where divination was taught in all its branches. A typical example of 
augury from birds may be found in the account of the manner in which the 
Mexicans fixed upon the spot for the foundation of their city. Halting after 
years of wandering in the vicinity of the Lake of Tezcuco, they observed a great 
eagle with wings outspread perched on the stump of a cactus, and holding in its 
talons a live serpent. Their augurs interpreted this as a good omen as it had 
been previously announced by an oracle, and upon the spot where the bird had 
alighted, they drove the first piles upon which they afterwards built the city 
of <I>Mexico,-the </I>legend of the foundation of which is still commemorated in 
the arms of modern <I>Mexico. </I>Dreams and visions played a great part in 
Mexican divination, and a special caste of augurs called <I>Teopixqui, </I>or 
<I>Teotecuhtli </I>(masters or guardians of divine things) were set apart for 
the purpose of interpreting dreams and of divining through dreams and visions, 
which was regarded as the chief route between man and the supernatural. The 
senses were even quickened and sharpened by the use of drugs and the ecstatic 
condition was induced by want of sleep, and pertinacious fixing of the mind upon 
one subject, the swallowing or inhalation of cerebral intoxicants such as 
tobacco, the maguey, coca, the snake-plant or <I>ololiuhqui, </I>and similar 
substances. As among some tribes of the American-Indians, it was probably 
believed that visions came to the prophet or seer pictorially, or that acts were 
performed before him as in a play. They also held that the soul travelled 
through space and was able to visit those places of which it desired to have 
knowledge. It is also possible that they hypnotised themselves by gazing at 
certain small highly-polished pieces of sandstone, or that they employed these 
for the same purpose as crystal-gazers employ the globe. The goddess Tozi was 
the patron of those who used grains of maize or red beans in divination.</P><I>
<P>Charms and Amulets.-The </I>amulet was regarded in <I>Mexico </I>as a 
personal fetish. The Tepitoton, or diminutive household deities of the Mexicans 
were also fetishistic. It is probable that most of the Mexican amulets were 
modelled on the various ornaments of the gods. Thus the traveller's staff carved 
in the shape of a serpent like that of Quetzalcoatl was undoubtedly of this 
nature, and was even occasionally sacrificed to. The frog was a favourite model 
for an amulet. As elsewhere, the thunder-bolts thrown by the gods were supposed 
to be flint stones, and were cherished as amulets of much virtue, and as symbols 
of the fecundating rains.</P><I>
<P>Vampirism.-As </I>has been seen, Sahagun confounds the Mexican necromancer 
with the vampire, and it is interesting to note that this folk-belief must have 
originated in America independently of any European connection. But we find 
another instance of what would seem something like vampirism in <I>Mexico. 
</I>This is found in connection with the <I>ciupipiltin </I>or ghosts of women 
who have died in childbirth. These haunt the cross-roads, crying and wailing for 
the little ones they have left behind them. But as in many other countries, 
notably in Burma, they are malevolent-their evil tendencies probably being 
caused by jealousy of the happiness of the living. Lest they should enter their 
houses and injure their children, the Mexicans at certain times of the year 
stopped up every possible hole and crevice. The appearance of these ghosts 
(Sahagun describes them as &quot; goddesses &quot;) at cross-roads is highly 
significant, for we know that the burial of criminals at such junctions was 
merely a survival of a similar disposal of the corpse of the vampire, whose head 
was cut off and laid at his side, and who was entombed at crossroads for the 
purpose of confusing him as to his whereabouts.</P><I>
<P>Nagualism.-Both </I>in Mexico and Central America a religio-magical system 
called Nagualism obtained, the purpose of which was to bring occult influence 
against the whites for their destruction. The rites of this strange cult usually 
took place in caverns and other deserted localities, and were naturally derived 
to a large extent from those of the suppressed native religion. Each native 
worshipper possessed a magical or animal spirit-guide, with which he was endowed 
early in life. This system certainly flourished as lately as half a century ago, 
and there is good reason to believe that it is not yet extinct.</P><I>
<P>Central America.-Notices </I>upon magic and sorcery amongst the Maya, Kiche, 
and other Central American peoples are even rarer than those which relate to 
<I>Mexico, </I>and we have to fall back almost solely upon the native legends to 
glean anything concerning the subject at all. The great storehouse of Central 
American legend is the <I>Popol Vuh, </I>for an account of which the reader is 
referred to the author's <I>Popol Vuh, </I>London, <B>1909</B>. We find in this 
interesting native mythi-history, that some of the elder gods are regarded as 
magicians, and the hero-twins, Xblanque and Hun-ahpu, whom they sent to earth to 
rid it of the Titan Vukub-cakix, are undoubtedly possessed of magical powers. As 
boys we find them equipped with magic tools, which enable them to get through an 
enormous amount of work in a single day, and when they descend into Xibalba, the 
Kiche Hades, for the purpose of avenging their father and uncle, they take full 
advantage of their magical propensities in combating the natives of that drear 
abode. Xibalba itself possesses sorcerers, for we find two within its borders, 
Xulu and Pacaw, who assist the hero-gods in many of their necromantic 
practices.</P>
<P>As regards divination, we find that the Maya possessed a caste of augurs, 
called <I>Cocomes </I>or the Listeners and prophecy appears to have been 
periodically practised by their priests. In the so-called books of <I>Chilan 
Balam </I>which are native compilations of events occurring in Central 
<I>America </I>previous to the Spanish Conquest, we find certain prophecies 
regarding, amongst other things, the coining of the Spaniards. These appear to 
have been given forth by a priest who bore the title, not the name, of&quot; 
Chilan Balam,&quot; whose offices were those of divination and astrology but 
these pronouncements seem to have been coloured at a later date by Christian 
thought, and hardly to be of a genuine aboriginal character. There are certain 
astrological recipes in the books, all of which are simply borrowed from 
European almanacs of the century between <B>1550</B> and <B>1650</B>. Amulets 
were in great vogue amongst the Maya, and they had the same fear of the last 
live days of the year as had the Mexicans, who regarded them as <I>nemontemi 
</I>or unlucky, and did no work of any description upon them. These days the 
Maya called <I>uyayayab, </I>and they considered that a demon entered their 
towns and villages at the beginning of this period. To avert this, they carried 
an image of him through the village in the hopes that he might afterwards avoid 
it.</P>

<P>Mezazoth, The :</B> A schedule which, when fastened on the doorpost, 
possessed talismanic qualities. It is said in the <I>Talmud </I>that whoever has 
the <I>mesas oth </I>fixed on his door, and is provided with certain personal 
charms, is protected from sin.</P><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Michael: An archangel : </B>in the Hebrew, &quot; He who is equal to 
God.&quot; In Revelation it is said : &quot;there was war in heaven. Michael and 
his angels fought against the dragon&quot; : and from this it is deduced that 
Michael was the leader of the celestial hierarchy,-as against Lucifer, the head 
of the disobedient angels. Michael is mentioned by name four other times in the 
Scriptures; in Daniel as the champion of the Jewish Church against Persia; in 
Jude as the archangel who fought with Satan for Moses' body; by Gabriel he is 
called the prince of the Jewish Church; and in the prophecy of Enoch, 
&quot;Michael who commands the nations.&quot; His design according to Randle 
Holme is a banner hanging on a cross; and he is represented as victory with a 
dart in one hand and a cross on his forehead. Bishop Horsley and others 
considered Michael as only another name for the Son of God. In one of the Jewish 
rabbinical legends he is the ruler of Mercury, to which sphere he &quot;imparts 
benignity, motion and intelligence, with elegance and consonance of 
speech.&quot;</P><B>

Paracelsus that this sign had a marvellous magical power over spirits; and that

<P>Mid-day Demons :</B> The ancients frequently made mention of certain demons 
who became visible especially towards mid-day to those with whom they had a 
pact. They appeared in the form of men or of beasts, and let themselves be 
enclosed in a character, a figure, a vial, or in the interior of a hollow 
ring.</P><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Midiwiwin, The :</B> A secret society or exclusive association of the Ojibway 
Indians of North America. The myth of the foundation of this society is as 
follows Michabo, the Creator, looking down to earth saw that the forefathers of 
the Ojibway were very helpless. . . . Espying a black object floating on the 
surface of a lake he drew near to it and saw that it was an otter-now one of the 
sacred animals of the <I>Midiwiwin. </I>He instructed it in the mysteries of 
that caste, and provided it with a sacred rattle, a sacred drum, and tobacco. He 
built a <I>Midiwigan, </I>or Sacred House of Midi, to which he took the otter 
and confided to it the mysteries of the <I>Midiwiwin. </I>In short, the society 
is one of these &quot; medicine &quot; or magical associations so common among 
the North-American Indians (q.v.). When<B> </B>a candidate is admitted to a 
grade and is prepared to pass on to the next, he gives three feasts, and sings 
three prayers to the Bear Spirit in order to be permitted to enter that grade. 
His progress through the various grades is assisted by several snake-spirits ; 
and at a later stage by the power of certain prayers or invocations,-a larger 
snake appears and raises its body, thus forming an arch under which the 
candidate takes his way to the higher grade. When the Indian belongs to the 
second grade he is supposed to receive supernatural power, to be able to see 
into the future, to hear what comes afar off, to touch friends and foes however 
far away they may be, and so on. In higher grades he can assume the form of any 
animal. The third grade confers enhanced power, and it is thought that its 
members can perform extraordinary exploits, and have power over the entire 
invisible world. The fourth is still more exalted.</P>
<P>When an Indian is ready to undergo initiation, he erects a wigwam in which he 
takes steam-baths for four days, one on each day. On the evening of the day 
before initiation he visits his teachers in order to obtain from them 
instructions for the following day. Next morning the priests approach with the 
candidate at their head, enter the <I>Midiwigan, </I>and the proceedings 
commence. The publications of the Bureau of American Ethnology contain several 
good accounts of the ritual of this society.</P><B>

<P>Mines, Haunted : </B>The belief that<B> </B><I>mines </I>are <I>haunted 
</I>is an ancient and universal one, probably arising from the many weird sounds 
and echoes which are heard in them, and the perpetual gloom. Sometimes the 
haunting spectres are gigantic creatures with frightful fiery eyes. Such was the 
German &quot;Bergmonch, a terrible figure in the garb of a monk, who could, 
however, appear in ordinary human shape to those towards whom he was 
well-disposed.', Frequently weird knockings are heard in the <I>mines. </I>In 
Germany these are attributed to the Kobolds, small black beings of a malicious 
disposition. White hares or rabbits are also seen at times. The continual danger 
attending the life underground is productive of many supernatural 
warnings,&quot; which generally take the form of mysterious voices. In the 
Midland Counties of England the &quot;Seven Whistlers&quot; are well known and 
their warnings solemnly attended to. A light blue flame settling on a full 
coal-tub was called &quot; Bluecap,&quot; and his work was to move the coal-tub 
towards the trolley-way. Bluecap did not give his services for nothing. Every 
fortnight his wages were left in a corner of the <I>mine, </I>and duly 
appropriated. A more mischievous elf was &quot;Cutty Soames,&quot; who would cut 
the traces, or soams, yoking an assistant putter to the tub. Basilisks, whose 
terrible eyes would strike the miner dead, were another source of dread to the 
worker underground. These, as well as the other mysterious foes who dealt fatal 
blows, may be traced to the dreaded, but by no means ghostly, fire-damp. 
<I>Mines </I>of the precious metals arc still more jealously guarded by the 
supernatural beings. Gnomes the creatures of the earth-element, are the special 
guardians of subterranean treasure, and they are not over-anxious that their 
province be disturbed. <I>Mines </I>containing precious stones are equally well 
looked after. The Indians of Peru declare that evil spirits haunt the emerald 
<I>mines, </I>while a <I>mine </I>in the neighbourhood of Los Esmeraldos was 
said to be guarded by a frightful dragon. It has also been stated that the 
poisonous fumes and gases which oft-times destroy the lives of miners are 
baleful influences radiated by evil spirits.</P><B>
<P>Mirabilis Liber :</B> The greater part of this book is attributed to Saint 
Cesaire. It is a collection of predictions concerning the saints and the sibyls. 
It is surprising to find in the edition of <B>1522</B> a prophecy of the French 
Revolution. The expulsion and abolition of the nobility, the violent death of 
the king and queen, the persecution of the clergy, the suppression of convents. 
are all mentioned therein, followed by a further prophecy that the eagle coming 
from distant lands would re-establish order in France.</P>

<P>Miraculum Mundi :</B> <I>(See </I><B>Clauber.</B>)</P><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Mirendola, Giacomo Picus da : </B>Italian Astrologer and Kabalist 
(<B>1463</B>-<B>1494</B>). This astrologer's family played a prominent part in a 
number of the civil wars which convulsed medieval Italy, while they owned 
extensive lands in the neighbourhood of Modena, the most valuable of their 
possessions being a castle bearing their own name of Mirendola; and it was here, 
in the year <B>1463</B>, that <I>Giacomo </I>was born. He appears to have been 
something of an Admirable Crichton, never showing any fondness for playing 
children's games, but devoting himself to study from the very outset; and, 
according to tradition, before he was out of his teens he had mastered 
jurisprudence and mathematics, he had waded far into the seas of philosophy and 
theology, and had even, dabbled in those occult sciences wherewith his name was 
destined to be associated afterwards. A boy of this kind naturally felt small 
inclination to remain at home, and so it is not surprising to find that 
<I>Giacomo </I>soon left his brothers to look after the family estates, and 
proceeded to various universities in Italy and France. While in the latter 
country his interest in astrology and the like deepened apace, thanks partly to 
his making a close study of the works of Raymond Lully; and in <B>1486</B> 
<I>Giacomo </I>went to Rome, where he delivered a series of lectures on various 
branches of science. While thus engaged his erudition won high praise from some 
of his hearers, but certain members of the clergy suspected him of heresy, 
reported his doings to the Inquisition, and even sought to have him 
excommunicated. The pope, however was of course rather averse to quarrelling 
with a member of so powerful a family as the Mirandolas, and accordingly he 
waived violent measures, instead appointing a body of Churchmen to argue with 
the scientist. A lengthy altercation ensued, and throughout it the jury 
displayed the most consummate ignorance, it being recorded, indeed that some of 
them imagined that &quot; Kabal&quot; was a man, who had written against 
Christianity, and that the Kabalists were the disciples of this hypothetic 
person. <I>Giacomo </I>must have been deeply chagrined by this stupidity on the 
part of his opponents, he must have felt that to argue with such people was 
utterly vain; yet he published a defence of the ideas and theories promulgated 
in his lectures, and in <B>1493</B> the pope, Alexander VI., brought the affair 
to a conclusion by granting the offender absolution. Thereupon <I>Mi'andole 
</I>went to live at Florence, and here he stayed until his demise in 
<B>1494</B>, occasionally essaying alchemy, but chiefly busy with further 
kabalistic studies.</P>
<P>Apart from the <I>Apologia Pici Mirandoli </I>cited above, <I>Giacomo </I>was 
author of several books of a theological nature, the most important of these 
being his <I>Conausiones Philosophicae, cabalisuca</I>e rt <I>theologicae, 
</I>published in <B>1486</B>, and his <I>Disputationes adversus Astrologiam 
Divinaticum, </I>issued in <B>1495</B>. His works appear to have been keenly 
admired by such of his contemporaries as were not averse to speculative thought, 
and it is interesting to find that a collected edition of his writings was 
printed at Boulogne in <B>1496</B>, and another at Venice two years later.</P>

<P>Mohanes :</B> Shamans or medicine-men of the Indians of the Peruvian Andes. 
Joseph Skinner writing of them in his <I>State of Peru, </I>London <B>1805</B>, 
says: &quot;These admit an evil being, the inhabitant of the centre of the 
earth, whom they consider as the author of their misfortunes, and at the mention 
of whose name they tremble. The most shrewd among them take advantage of this 
belief, to obtain respect ; and represent themselves as his delegates. Under the 
denomination of <I>Mohanes, </I>or <I>Agoreros, </I>they are consulted even on 
the most trivial occasions. They preside over the intrigues of love, the health 
of the community, and the taking of the field. Whatever repeatedly occurs to 
defeat their prognostics, falls on themselves; and they are wont to pay their 
deceptions very dearly. They chew a species of vegetable called <I>puripiri, 
</I>and throw it into the air, accompanying this act by certain recitals and 
incantations, to injure some, to benefit others, to procure rain, and the 
inundation of the rivers, or, on the other hand, to occasion settled weather, 
and a plentiful store of agricultural productions. Any such result having been 
casually verified on a single occasion, suffices to confirm the Indians in their 
faith, although they may have been cheated a thousand times. Fully persuaded 
that they cannot resist the influence of the <I>puripiri, </I>as soon as they 
know that they have been solicited by its means, they fix their eyes on the 
impassioned object, and discover a thousand amiable traits, either real or 
fanciful, which indifference had before concealed from their view.</P>
<P>&quot;But the principal power, efficacy, and. it may be said misfortune, of 
the <I>Mohanes, </I>consist in the cure of the sick. Every malady is ascribed to 
their enchantments, and means are instantly taken to ascertain by whom the 
mischief may have been wrought. For this purpose the nearest relative takes a 
quantity of the juice of <I>floripondium, </I>and suddenly falls, intoxicated by 
the violence of the plant. He is placed in a fit posture to prevent suffocation, 
and on his coming to himself, at the end of three days, the <I>Mohan </I>who has 
the greatest resemblance to the sorcerer he saw in his visions, is to undertake 
the cure, or if, in the interim, the sick man has perished, it is customary to 
subject him to the same fate. When not any sorcerer occurs in the visions, the 
first <I>Mohan </I>they encounter has the misfortune to represent his 
image.&quot;</P><I>
<P>Methods of Medicine </I>Men.-It cannot be denied, that the <I>Mohanes 
</I>have, by practice and tradition, acquired a profound knowledge of many 
plants and poisons, with which they effect surprising cures on the one hand, and 
do much mischief on the other; but the mania of ascribing the whole to a 
preternatural virtue, occasions them to blend with their practice a thousand 
charms and superstitions. The most customary method of cure is to place two 
hammocks close to each other, either in the dwelling, or in the open air: in one 
of them the patient lies extended, and in the other the <I>Mohan, </I>or 
Agorero. The latter, in contact with the sick man, begins by rocking himself, 
and. then proceeds by a strain <I>in falsetto, </I>to call on the birds, 
quadrupeds. and fishes, to give health to the patient. From time to time he 
rises on his seat, and makes a thousand extravagant gestures over the sick man, 
to whom he applies his powders and herbs, or sucks the wounded or diseased 
parts. If the malady augments. the Agorero, having been joined by many of the 
people, chants a short hymn, addressed to the soul of the patient, with this 
burden: &quot;Thou must not go, thou must not go.&quot; In repeating this he is 
joined by the people, until at length a terrible clamour is raised, and 
augmented in proportion as the sick man becomes still fainter and fainter, to 
the end that it may reach his ears.</P>

<P>Monaciello, The : </B>The<B> </B><I>Monaciello </I>or Little Monk seems to 
have lived exclusively in that portion of Southern Italy called Naples. The 
precise place where he dwelt does not appear to be accurately known, but it is 
supposed to have been in the remains of Abbeys and Monasteries. When the 
<I>Monaciello </I>appeared to mortals, it was always at the dead of night; and 
then only to those who were in sorest need, who themselves had done all that 
mortal could do to prevent or alleviate the distress that had befallen them, and 
after all humain aid had failed. Then it was that the Monk appeared, and mutely 
beckoning them to follow, he led foam to where treasure was 
concealed-stipulating no conditions for its expenditure. demanding no promise of 
repayment, exacting no duty or service in return. Men have vainly asked, was it 
actual treasure he gave, or did it merely appear so to the external senses, to 
be changed into leaves or stones when the day and the occasion of its 
requirement had' passed ? And if actual treasure, how did it come in the place 
of its concealment, and by whom was it there deposited ?</P>
<P>In Germany, the wood-spirit Rubezahl performed similar acts of beneficence 
and kindness to poor and deserving, persons and the money he gave proved to be, 
or passed for the current coin of the realm; while in Ireland, the O'Donoghue, 
who dwelt beneath the waters of an inland lake, and rode over its surface on a 
steed white as the foam of its waves, distributed treasures that proved genuine 
to the good, but spurious to the undeserving.</P><B>

<P>Monad : </B>is a theosophical term which literally means a unit (Greek 
Monas). The <I>Monad </I>is frequently described as a Divine Spark,&quot; and 
this impression is particularly apt, for it is a part of the Logos, the Divine 
Fire. The Logos has three aspects, Will, Wisdom and Activity, and, since the 
<I>Monad </I>is part of the Logos, it also has these three aspects It abides 
continually in its appropriate world, the monadic, but, that the divine 
evolutionary purposes may be carried out, its ray is borne downwards through the 
various spheres of matter when the outpouring of the third life wave takes 
place. It first passes into the Spiritual Sphere by clothing itself with an atom 
of spiritual matter and thus manifests itself in an atomic body, as a spirit 
possessing three aspects. When it passes into the next sphere, the Intuitional, 
it leaves its aspect of Will behind and in the Intuitional Sphere, appears in an 
Intuitional body as a spirit possessing the aspects of Wisdom and Activity. On 
passing in turn, from this sphere to the next the higher mental, it leaves the 
aspect of Wisdom behind, and appears in a casual body as a spirit possessing the 
aspect of activity. To put this somewhat abstruse doctrine in another form, the 
<I>Monad </I>has, at this stage, manifested itself in three spheres. In the 
spiritual it has transfused spirit with Will, in the Intuitional it has 
transfused spirit with Wisdom, and in the higher Mental it has transfused spirit 
with Activity or Intellect. and it is now a human ego, corresponding 
approximately to the common term &quot;soul,&quot; an ego which, despite all 
changes, remains the same until eventually the evolutionary purpose is fulfilled 
and it is received back again into the Logos. From the higher mental sphere the 
<I>Monad </I>descends to the lower mental sphere and appears in a mental body as 
possessing mind, then betakes itself to the astral sphere and appears in the 
astral body as possessing emotions, and finally to the physical sphere and 
appears in a physical body as possessing vitality. These three lower bodies, 
the<B> </B>mental, the astral, and the physical, constitute the human 
personality which dies at death and is renewed when the <I>Monad, </I>in 
fulfillment of the process of reincarnation, again manifests itself in these 
bodies. <I>(See </I><B>Theosophy, Evolution,</B> <B>Sphere, Life Waves, Monadic

<P>Money : </B><I>Money </I>which comes from the devil is of poor quality, and 
such wealth, like the fairy-money, generally turns to earth, or to lead, toads, 
or anything else worthless or repulsive. &quot; A youth,&quot; says Gregory of 
Tours, received a piece of folded paper from a stranger, who told him that he 
could get from it as much <I>money </I>as he wished, so long as he did not 
unfold it. The youth drew many gold pieces from the papers, but at length 
curiosity overcame him, he unfolded it and discovered within the claws of a cat 
and a bear, the feet of a toad and other repulsive fragments, while at the same 
moment his wealth disappeared.&quot; In popular superstition it is supposed that 
if a person hear the cuckoo for the first time with <I>money </I>in his pocket, 
he shall have some all the year, while if he greet the new moon for the first 
time in the same fortunate condition, he shall not lack <I>money </I>throughout 
the month.</P><B>

celebrated the rites of the gnostic Sabbath. It replaced the Kabalistic 
&quot;goat&quot; by the Hermetic &quot; dog as an object of worship. The 
candidate for the order was brought into the circle of adepts with the eyes 
bandaged in the midst of a great uproar, and after saluting the idol was 
initiated. The sign of recognition was a grimace. The whole doctrine of the 
society was that of black magic. The <I>Mopses </I>recruited only among 
Catholics, and for the oath at reception they substituted a solemn engagement on 
honour to reveal no secrets of the order,-the practices of which much resembled 
the Sabbath of medieval sorcerers.</P><B>

<P>Morien : </B>It is commonly supposed that <I>Morien, </I>or Morienus as he is 
sometimes styled, was born at Rome in the twelfth century, and it is also 
reported that, like Raymond Lully and several other early chymists, he combined 
evangelical ardour with his scientific tastes. While still a mere boy. and 
resident in his native city, <I>Morien </I>became acquainted with the writings 
of Adfar, the Arabian philosopher, and gradually the youth's acquaintance with 
these developed into tense admiration, the result being that he became filled 
with the desire to make the personal acquaintance of the author in question. 
Accordingly he bade adieu to Rome and set out for Alexandria, this being the 
home of Adfar; and, on reaching his destination, he had not to wait long ere 
gaining his desired end. The learned Arabian accorded him a hearty welcome, and 
a little while afterwards the two were living together on very friendly terms, 
the elder man daily imparting knowledge to the younger, who showed himself a 
remarkably apt pupil. For some years this state of affairs continued, but at 
length Adfar died, and thereupon <I>Morien </I>left Alexandria and went to 
Palestine, found a retreat in the vicinity of Jerusalem, and began to lead a 
hermit's life there. </P>
<P>Meanwhile the erudition of the deceased Arabian acquired a wide celebrity, 
and some of his manuscripts chanced to fall into the hands of Kalid, Soldan of 
Egypt. He was a person of active and enquiring mind, and observing that, on the 
cover of the manuscripts, it was stated that the secret of the philosopher's 
stone was written within, he naturally grew doubly inquisitive. He found, 
however, that he himself could not elucidate the precious documents and 
therefore he summoned <I>illuminati </I>from far and near to his court at Cairo, 
and offered a large reward to the man who should discover the mystery at issue. 
An endless number of people presented themselves in consequence, but the 
majority of them were mere charlatans, and thus the Soldan was duped 
mercilessly.</P>
<P>Betimes news of these doings reached the ears of <I>Morien. </I>It incensed 
him to think that his old preceptor's wisdom and writings were being made a 
laughing-stock, so he decided that he must go to Cairo himself, and not only see 
justice done to Adfar's memory, but also seize what might prove a favourable 
opportunity of converting Kalid to Christianity. The Soldan was inclined to be 
cynical when the hermit arrived, nor would he listen to the latter's attacks on 
the Mahommedan faith; yet he saw fit to grant <I>Morien </I>a house wherein to 
conduct researches, and here the alchemist worked for a long time, ultimately 
perfecting the elixir. He did not, withal, make any attempt to gain the 
preferred reward; and instead he took his leave without the Soldan's cognizance, 
simply leaving the precious fluid in a vase on which he inscribed the suggestive 
words:.&quot; He who possess all has no need of others.&quot;</P>
<P>But Kalid was at a loss to know how to proceed further, and for a long time 
he made great efforts to find <I>Morien </I>and bring him again to his court. 
Years went by, and all search for the vanished alchemist proved vain; but once, 
when the Soldan was hunting in the neighbourhood of Jerusalem, one of his 
servants chanced to hear of a hermit who was wont to create gold. Convinced that 
this must be none other than <I>Morien, </I>Kalid straightway sought him out; so 
once more the two met, and again the alchemist made strenuous efforts to win the 
other from Mahommedanism. Many discussions took place between the pair, both 
speaking on behalf of their respective religions, yet Kalid showed no 
inclination to desert the faith of his fathers. And therefore <I>Morien 
</I>relinquished the quest in despair, but it is said that, on parting with the 
Soldan, he duly instructed him in the mysteries of the transcendent science.</P>
<P>Nothing is known about <I>Morien's </I>subsequent history, and the likelihood 
is that the rest of his days were spent quietly at his hermitage. He is credited 
with sundry alchemistic writings, said to have been translated from Arabic, but 
it need hardly be said that the ascription rests on the slenderest evidence. One 
of these works is entitled <I>Liber de Distinctione Mercurii Aquarum, </I>and it 
is interesting to recall that a manuscript copy thereof belonged to Robert 
Boyle, one of the founders of the Royal Society while another is entitled 
<I>Liber de Compositione Alchemiae, </I>and this is printed in the first volume 
of <I>Bibliotheca Chemica Curiosa. </I>Yet better known than either of these, 
and more likely to be really from <I>Morien's </I>pen, is a third treatise 
styled <I>De Re Metallica, Metallorum Transumtatione, et occulta summague 
Antiquorum Medicine Libellus, </I>which was repeatedly published, the first 
edition appearing at Paris in <B>1559</B>.</P><B>

<P>Moses, Rev. William Stainton : </B>One of the best<B> </B>known mediums 
connected with modern spiritualism, and probably, after Home, one of the most 
successful. He was born in <B>1839</B>, at Donington, in Lincolnshire, the son 
of a schoolmaster, and was educated at Bedford Grammar School and Exeter 
College, Oxford. He made good progress at the University, but before his final 
examination his health broke down, and he was forced to go abroad. On his return 
he graduated Master of Arts, and in <B>1863</B> was ordained. From that time 
until <B>1870</B> he was a curate, first in the Isle of Man and afterwards in 
Dorsetshire. Again his health gave way, and he was obliged to abandon parish 
work, and seek a change of occupation. In <B>1870</B> he became tutor to the son 
of Dr. and Mrs. Stanhope Speer, with whom he resided. and who were henceforth 
among his staunchest supporters. A year or two later he was appointed English 
master in University College School, but increasing ill-health compelled him to 
retire in <B>1899</B>. Towards the close of his ijfe <I>Mr. Moses </I>suffered 
greatly from depression and kindred nervous disorders. His life as a clergyman 
and as a schoolmaster was beyond reproach, and his duties were discharged in a 
way that won respect alike for his intelligence and efficiency.</P>
<P>His attention was first directed to spiritualism by the reading of R. Dale 
Owen's book on <I>The Debatable Land, </I>in <B>1872</B>. He attended numerous 
<I>seances, </I>held by such medium&quot; as Home, and soon afterwards he 
himself developed powerful mediumistic tendencies, and gave <I>seances </I>to 
the Speers and a few select friends. The best accounts of his sittings are those 
written by Dr. and Mrs. Speers who kept separate records of the performances, 
and there are occasional accounts by others who were admitted to the circle. The 
phenomena were at first confined to raps and levitations of furniture, but 
gradually the manifestations became more varied and more pronounced. Toilet 
articles in <I>Mr. Moses' </I>room moved about of themselves and formed a cross 
on his bed, &quot;apports&quot; of perfume, pincushions, pearls, and other 
articles were brought by the spirits, and the medium himself would float about 
the room. Towards the end of the year &quot;spirit lights&quot; began to make 
their appearance, and seem to have created a profound impression on the sitters, 
though to judge from the descriptions they give, it would seem that Mr. 
Podmore's explanation of &quot;bottles of phosphorus&quot; is not far from the 
truth. Musical instruments also were heard playing in the air, besides raps, 
thuds, and other noises.</P>
<P>Perhaps his most important manifestations, however, were the automatic 
writings published under the title of <I>Spirit Teachings. </I>These purported 
to come from several spirits, &quot; Imperator,&quot; &quot; Rector,&quot; and 
others, and were mostly of a theological caste. Though of a high ethical 
tendency, they evinced a departure from Christianity, and suggested the religion 
of spiritualism as the only rational human creed. Unlike many automatic writings 
<I>Mr. Moses' </I>productions were not written in extravagantly high-flown 
language, nor were they altogether meaningless. But it must be remembered that 
he was a man of education and not likely to fall into such errors.</P>
<P>Other work done by him in connection with Spiritualism was his assistance in 
the founding of the British National Association of Spiritualism, and to serve 
on the Councils of the Psychological Society, and the Society for Psychical 
Research. He severed his connection with the latter body, however, because of 
the position they took up with regard to certain professional mediums. He was 
also president of the London Spiritual Alliance from <B>1884</B> onwards. Among 
his most popular works, besides <I>Spirit Teachings, </I>were <I>Psychography, 
Spirit Identity, </I>and <I>The Higher Aspects of Spiritualism.</I></P>
<P>Why did <I>Stainton Moses </I>become a medium? There are few questions more 
puzzling than this to the student of spiritual psychology. That professional 
mediums, and those private mediums who have anything to gain by their 
performances, should carry on deception from year to year, is comprehensible. 
But that a clergyman, who had hitherto led an uneventful and exemplary life, 
should deliberately and systematically practise a series of puerile tricks for 
the purpose of mystifying his friends, is certainly not so. We are forced to 
admit, then, either that his observers were victims to hallucination and 
self-deception, or that the phenomena he produced were genuine manifestations 
from the spirit-world.</P><B>

<P>Moss-Woman The : </B>The<B> </B>Moss or Wood Folk, dwelt in the forests of 
Southern Germany. Their stature was small and their form strange and uncouth, 
bearing a strong resemblance to certain trees with which they flourished and 
decayed. They were a simple, timid, and inoffensive race, and had little 
intercourse with mankind; approaching only at rare intervals the lonely cabin of 
the wood-man or forester, to borrow some article of domestic use, or to beg a 
little of the food which the good wife was preparing for the family meal. They 
would also for similar purposes appear to labourers in the fields which lay on 
the outskirts of the forests. A loan or gift to the Moss-people was always 
repaid manifold. But the most highly-prized and eagerly-coveted of all mortal 
gifts was a draught from the maternal breast to their own little ones; for this 
they held to be a sovereign remedy for all the ills to which their natures were 
subject. Yet was it only in the extremity of danger that they could so overcome 
their natural diffidence and timidity as to ask this boon-for they knew that 
mortal mothers turned from such nurslings with disgust and fear. It would appear 
that the Moss or Wood folk also lived in some parts of Scandinavia. Thus we are 
told that in the churchyard of Store Hedding, in Zealand, there are the remains 
of an oak wood which were trees by day and warriors by night.</P><B>

<P>Mountain Cove Community, The : </B>A spiritualistic<B> </B><I>community 
</I>founded in <I>Mountain Cove, </I>Fayette Co., Virginia, in the autumn of 
<B>1851</B>, under the leadership of the Rev. James Scott and the Rev. T. L. 
Harris. Both mediums had settled in Auburn in the previous year, and had 
obtained a considerable following. While Harris was absent in New York the 
command to form a <I>community </I>at <I>Mountain Cove </I>was given through the 
mediumship of Scott, and about a hundred persons accompanied him to Virginia. 
The members were obliged to deliver up all their possessions, again at the 
command of the spirits. Dissensions arose and pecuniary difficulties were 
experienced, and only the advent of T. L. Harris in the summer of <B>1852</B> 
saved the <I>community </I>from dissolution. However, the dissensions and 
difficulties remained, and early in <B>1853</B> the <I>community </I>finally 
broke up.</P>

<P>Muscle-reading :</B> The concentration of thought on any particular object 
produces a tendency to muscular activity. Thus if a name be thought of the 
muscles of the larynx may range themselves as if for the pronunciation of that 
name. This is known as subconscious whispering.&quot; Or there may be an 
unconscious movement towards the object in the mind. It is the interpretation of 
these involuntary movements by a second person, or percipient, that frequently 
passes for genuine telepathy. The thought reading exhibited on the public 
platform, when it is not the result of fraud, may be in reality 
<I>muscle-reading. </I>The act of reading these slight muscular indications of 
the thoughts may be unconscious or instinctive-indeed, must be so, since they 
are much too fine to be perceived by the grosser consciousness.</P>

<P>Myers, Frederic William Henry (1843-1901) :</B> Poet, essayist, and student 
of psychic science, was born at Keswick, Cumberland, and educated at Cheltenham 
and Cambridge. In <B>1865</B> he became classical lecturer there, but in 
<B>1872</B> abandoned this post for that of school inspector. He published 
several volumes of poems and essays, some of the former of considerable beauty, 
though it is chiefly as an essayist that he is known. He has done excellent work 
in the region of psychic science, being one of the original group who founded 
the Society for Psychical Research in <B>1882</B>, and remaining to the end of 
his life one of its most useful members. Though he did not belong to the 
sceptical school of which Mr. F. Podmore is the chief representative, <I>Mr. 
Myers' </I>view-point was decidedly not that of the average spiritualist. The 
evidence for the survival of the soul after death he found not in the somewhat 
puerile spirit &quot; manifestations, but in the <I>subliminal Consciousness, 
</I>that wide region that lies beneath the threshold of man's ordinary 
consciousness, wherein <I>Air. Myers </I>believed to discern traces of unused 
faculties, clairvoyance, retrocognition, precognition, telekinesia, and so on. 
All the phenomena of trance, hypnotism, automatism, and spiritualism he grouped 
together as phenomena of the subliminal consciousness. The results of his 
researches were embodied in a posthumous work entitled <I>Human Personality and 
its Survival of Bodily Death </I>(<B>1903</B>). He also wrote the introduction 
to Gurney's <I>Phantasms of the Living. </I>He died at Rome in <B>1901</B> and 
was buried at Keswick.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Myomancy :</B> was a method of divination by rats or mice and is supposed to 
be alluded to in Isaiah lxvi., <B>17</B>. Their peculiar cries, or some marked 
devastation committed by them, was taken for a prognostic of evil. AElian 
relates that Fabius Maximus resigned the dictatorship in consequence of a 
warning from these creatures; and Cassius Flaminius, according to Varro, retired 
from the command of the cavalry for no greater reason. From Herodotus we learn 
that the army of Sennacherib, when he invaded Egypt was infested by mice in the 
night, and their quivers and bows gnawed in pieces ; in the morning, therefore, 
being without arms, they fled in confusion, and many of them were slain. Such a 
foreboding of evil could not very well be questioned, or its consequences 
averted, by the commander, but very different was the case when one of Cato's 
soldiers told him in affright that the rats had gnawed one of his shoes. Cato 
replied that the prodigy would have been much greater if the shoe had gnawed a 
rat l Horapollo in his curious work on the Hieroglyphics of Egypt, describes the 
rat as a symbol of destruction, and, what is more to our purpose, the Hebrew 
name of this animal is from a root which signifies to separate, divide, or 
judge; and it has been remarked by one of the commentators on Horapollo that the 
mouse has a finely discriminating taste. An Egyptian MS. in the &quot; 
Bibliotheque Royale&quot; at Paris, contains the representation of a soul going 
to judgment, in which one of the figures is depicted with the head of a rat and 
the well-known wig. It is understood that the Lybian rats and the mouse of 
Scripture are the same as the Arabian <I>jerboa, </I>which is characterised by a 
long tail, bushy at the end, and short fore-legs. The mice and emerods of gold, 
I. Sam. v., <B>6</B>, <B>7</B> were essentially charms having a precise symbolic 
meaning.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Mysteries :</B> From the Greek work <I>muein, </I>to shut the mouth, and 
<I>mustes </I>an initiate : a term for what is secret or concealed. Although 
certain <I>mysteries </I>were undoubtedly part of the initiatory ceremony of the 
priests of ancient Egypt, we are ignorant of their exact trend, and the terra is 
usually used in connection with certain semi-religious ceremonies held by 
various cults in ancient Greece. The <I>mysteries </I>were indeed secret cults, 
to which only certain initiated people were admitted after a period of 
preliminary preparation. After this initial period of purification came the 
mystic communication or exhortation, then the revelation to the neophyte of 
certain holy things, the crowning with the garlands, and lastly the communion 
with the deity. But the <I>mysteries </I>appear to have circled round the 
semi-dramatic representation or mystery-play of the life of a deity.</P>
<P>It has often been advanced as a likely theory to account for the prevalence 
of these mystic cults in Greece, that they are of pre-Hellenic origin, and that 
the Pelasgic aboriginal people of the country strove to conceal their religions 
from the eyes of their conquerors. But against this has to be weighed the 
evidence that for the most part the higher offices of these cults were in the 
hands of aristocrats, who, it may he reasonably inferred, had but little to do 
with the inferior strata of the population which represented the Pelasgic 
peoples. Again, the divinities worshipped in the <I>mysteries </I>possess for 
the most part Greek names, and many of them are certainly gods evolved upon 
Hellenic soil at a comparatively late period. We find a number of them 
associated with the realm of the dead. The earth-god or goddess is in most 
countries often allied with the powers of darkness. It is from the underworld 
that grain arises, and therefore we are not surprised to find that Demeter, Go, 
and Aglauros, are identified with the underworld. But there were also the 
mysteries of Artemis, of Hecate, and the Cherites,-some of which may be regarded 
as forms of the great earth-mother.</P>
<P>The worships of Dionysus, Trophonious, and Zagreus were also of a mysterious 
nature. The Eleusinian and Orphic <I>mysteries </I>are undoubtedly those of most 
importance to the occult student; and from the results of archaeology, such as 
vase-painting and so forth, we have been able to glean some general idea of the 
trend of these. That is not to say that the heart of the mystery is revealed to 
us by any such illustrations, but these supplemented by what the Christian 
fathers were able to glean regarding these mystic cults, enable us to push our 
investigations in the proper quarters. Important as such matter is, however, it 
is extremely slight in character.</P><I>
<P>Eleusis.-The mysteries </I>of Eleusis had for their primal adoration Demeter, 
Kore or Persephone,-the mother and the daughter-whose myth is too well-known to 
require repetition here. Pluto, the third figure in the drama is so unimportant 
as to be relegated to the background. Other &quot;nameless&quot; divinities 
appear to have been associated with these, under the name of &quot; the gods and 
&quot;the goddesses&quot; ; hut the theory that those are supposed to descend 
from an aboriginal period, when gods were nameless, is too absurd for 
discussion. The nameless god is of no value to anyone. not even a savage, and a 
mere nodding acquaintance with mythological science is surely sufficient to show 
that such nameless gods are merely those whose higher names are hidden and 
unspoken. In Egypt, for example, the concept of the Concealed Name was extremely 
common. The &quot;name of power&quot; of a god, if discovered, bestowed on the 
discoverer sway over that deity, and we must therefore dismiss tile idea of the 
nameless divinities of Eleusis as not in accordance with mythological fact. A 
more probable view is that which would make these gods later titles of the 
married pair Pluto and Kore; but this, in view of the facts just stated, is also 
unlikely. Dionysus is also a figure of some importance in the Eleusinian 
mystery, and it has been thought that Orphic influence brought about his 
presence in the cult; but traces of Orphic doctrine have not been discovered in 
what is known of the <I>mysteries. </I>A more baffling personality in the great 
ritual drama is that of Iacchus, who appears to be none other than Dionysus 
under another name. But Dionysus or lacehus does not appear to be a primary 
figure of the mystery</P>
<P>We find in early Greek legends allusions to the sacred character of the 
Eleusinian <I>mysteries. </I>From the fifth century their organisation was in 
the hands of the Athenian city,-the royal ruler of which undertook the general 
management, along with a committee of supervision. The rites took place at the 
city of Eleusis, and were celebrated by a hereditary priesthood, the 
Eumolpedie.. They alone, or rather their high priest, could penetrate into the 
innermost holy of holies ; but there were also priestesses and female attendants 
or' the goddesses.</P>
<P>The celebration of the <I>mysteries, </I>so far as can be gleaned, was 
somewhat as follows: In the month of September, the Eleusinian Holy Things were 
taken from the sacred city to Athens, and placed in the Eleusinian. These 
probably consisted to some extent of small statues of the goddesses. Three days 
afterwards the catechumens assembled to hearken to the exhortation of one of the 
priests, in which those who were for any reason unworthy of initiation were 
solemnly warned to depart. All must be Greeks or Romans above a certain age, and 
women and even slaves were admitted; but foreigners and criminals might not 
partake. The candidates were questioned as to their purification, and especially 
as regards the food which they had eaten during that period. After this 
assembly, they betook themselves to the sea-shore and bathed in the sea, being 
sprinkled afterwards with the blood of pigs. A sacrifice was offered up, and 
several days afterwards the great Eleusinian pro-cession commenced its journey 
along the sacred 'way, its central figure being a statue of Iacchus. Many 
shrines were visited on the way to Eleusis, where, upon their arrival, they 
celebrated a midnight orgy.</P>
<P>It is difficult to come at what occurred in the inner circle; but there 
appear to have been two grades in the celebration, and we know that a year 
elapsed before a person who had achieved one grade became fit for election to 
the higher. Regarding the actual ritual in the hall of mystery, a great deal of 
controversy has taken place, but it is certain that a dramatic representation 
was the central point of interest, the chief characters in which were probably 
Demeter and Kore, and that the myth of the lost daughter and the sorrowing 
mother was enacted before a highly-impressed audience. It has been stated that 
the birth of Iacchus was announced during the ceremony; but this has not been 
handed down to us on good authority. Of scenic display, there was probably 
little or none, as excavation has proved that there was not room for it, and we 
find nothing regarding scenery in the accounts presented in many inscriptions; 
but the apparel of the actors was probably most magnificent, and was heightened 
by the Rembrandtesque effect of gloom and torchlight.</P>
<P>But certain sacred symbols were also displayed before the eyes of the elect. 
These appear to have been small idols of the goddesses. of great antiquity and 
sanctity. We know that the original symbols of deity are jealously guarded by 
many savage priesthoods. For example, the Uapes of Brazil keep careful watch 
over the symbols of Jurupari, their god, and these are shown only to the 
initiated - any woman who casts eyes on them being instantly poisoned. It is 
also stated by Hippolytus that the ancients were shown a cut corn stalk, the 
symbol of Demeter and Kore. This, however, can hardly be trusted any more than 
the theory that the Eleusinians worshipped the actual Corn as a clan totem. Corn 
as a totem is not unknown elsewhere, as for example in Peru, where the 
<I>cconopa </I>or godlings of the maize fields were probably originally totemic; 
and we know that amongst savage people totemism often carries in its train the 
concept of the full-fledged mystery. But if the Eleusinian corn was a totem, it 
was certainly the only corn totem known to Greece, and corn totems are rare. The 
totem has usually initiated with the hunting condition of man: when he arrives 
at the agricultural stage we generally find that a fresh pantheon has slowly 
evolved, in which full-fledged gods took the place of the old totemic deities. 
The corn appears to him as a living thing. It is growth, and within it resides a 
spirit. Therefore the deity which is evolved from this concept is more likely to 
be of animistic than of totemistic origin.</P>
<P>The neophyte was then made one with the deity, by partaking of holy food or 
drink. It will be recalled that when Persephone reached the dark shores of Hades 
she partook of the food of the dead-thus rendering it impossible for her to 
return. Once the human soul eats or drinks in Hades, it may not return to earth. 
This belief is universal, and it is highly probable that it was symbolised in 
the Eleusinian <I>mysteries. </I>There was nothing, however, particularly secret 
about this sacrament, as it is painted on many vases which have been brought to 
light. A great deal of the ritual undoubtedly partook of the character of 
agricultural magic, -description of sympathetic sorcery. Among barbarians the 
medicine-man sprinkles water over the soil to incite the rain-spirit to do 
likewise. It is not long ago since, in the Isle of Mull, a long carved stone in 
a certain churchyard was filled with water, until the depressions upon it 
overflowed, to symbolise a well-watered country. All sorts of imitative rites 
took place on similar occasion - most of which will be familiar to students of 
folklore, It has been thought that the token of the growing corn may have served 
as an emblem of man's resurrection, and the fact that most persons approach the 
Elenusinian <I>mysteries </I>for the purpose of ensuring themselves a happy 
immortality. would go far to prove this. M. Foucart has ingeniously put forward 
the theory that the object of the Eleusinian <I>mysteries </I>was much the same 
as that of the Egyptian <I>Book of the Dead,-to </I>provide the initiates with 
elaborate rules for avoiding the dangers of the underworld, and to instruct them 
in the necessary magical formulae. But it does not appear than any such purpose 
was attained in the <I>mysteries; </I>and we know of no magic formulae recited 
in connection with them. Friendship with the Holy Mother and Daughter was to the 
Eleusinian votary the chief assurance of immortality.</P>
<P>A great many offshoots of the Eleusinian cult were established in several 
parts of Greece.</P><I>
<P>Dionysiac.-The </I>most important cult next to the Eleusinian was the Orphic, 
which probably arose in Phrygia, and which came to be associated with the name 
of Dionysus, originally a god of vegetation, who was of course also a divinity 
of the nether world. In this case, it was also desired to enter into communion 
with him, that immortality might be assured. His celebrations were marked by 
orgies of a bacchic description, in which it was thought that the neophyte 
partook for the nonce of the character and the power of the deity himself. The 
rites of the cult of Dionysus were on a much lower grade than those of Eleusis, 
and partook more of the barbarian element, and the devouring of an animal victim 
was supposed to symbolise the incarnation, death and resurrection of the 
divinity. Later the Dionysiac <I>mysteries </I>became purified, but always 
retained something of their earlier hysteric character. The cult possessed a 
fairly wide propaganda, and does not appear to have been regarded by the sages 
of its time with great friendliness. The golden tablets relating to the Orphic 
mystery found in tombs in Greece, Crete and Italy, contain fragments of a sacred 
hymn. As early as the third century B.C. it was buried with the dead as an 
amulet to protect him from the dangers of the underworld, and the fragments bear 
upon them incantations of a magical character.</P><I>
<P>Attis and Sybele.-These mysteries </I>arrived at a later period on Hellenic 
soil. Passionate and violent in the extreme, they yet gained considerable sway 
in a more degenerate age, and communimi with the deity was usually attained by 
bathing in blood in the <I>taurobolium </I>or by the letting of blood.</P>
<P>These Phrygian <I>mysteries </I>were full of the conception of the re-birth 
of the god Attis, who was also of an agrarian character; and in brief it may be 
said of these mystic cults as a whole that they were primarily barbarian 
agricultural rites to some extent intellectualised.</P><I>
<P>Mittraic Mysteries.-The </I>Mithraic cult was of Persian origin, Mithra, a 
personification of Light being worshipped in that country some five hundred 
years before the Christian era. Carried into Asia Minor by small colonies of 
magi, it was largely influenced by the religions with which it was brought into 
contact. Chaldean Astrology contributed much of the occult traditions 
surrounding the creed of the Sun-god, while to a certain extent it became 
hellenized when the Magi strove to bring the more barbaric portion of their 
dogma and its usages into harmony with the Hellenic ideal. To the art of Greece 
also it owed that ideal representation of Mithra Tauroctonous which formed the 
central object in the temples of the cult. The wide geographical area it 
traversed and the immense influence thus exercised was, however, due to the 
Romans. The rites originally reached Rome, Plutarch tells us, through the agency 
of Cilician priates conquered and taken there by Pompey. Another source, 
doubtless, was through the large number of Asiatic slaves employed in Roman 
households. Again the Roman soldiery must have carried the Mithraic cult to Rome 
as they certainly were the means of its diffusion, as far north as the mountains 
of Scotland, and southwards to the borders of the Sahara Desert.</P>
<P>Mithraism may be said to have been the only living religion which 
Christianity found to combat. It was strong enough to exert a formative 
influence on certain Christian doctrines, such as those relative to the end of 
the world and the powers of hell. Mithra was essentially the divinity of 
beneficence. He was the genius of celestial light, endowing the earth with all 
its benefits. As in his character of the Sun he puts darkness to flight so by a 
natural transition he came to represent ethically truth and integrity, the sun 
of goodness which conquers the night of evil. To him was ascribed the character 
of Mediator betwixt God and man; his creed promised a resurrection to a future 
life of happiness and felicity. Briefly the story of Mithra is this His life he 
owed to no mortal mother. In the gloom of a cavern Mithra sprang to being from 
the heart of a rock, seen by none but humble shepherds. He grew in strength and 
courage, excelling all, and used his powers to rid the world of evil. Of all his 
deeds of prowess, however, that one became the central motive of his cult 
wherein, by slaying a bull, itself possessed of divine potentialities, he 
dowered the earth with fruitfulness and miraculous crops. From the spinal cord 
of the bull sprang the wheat of man's daily bread, from its blood the vine, 
source of the sacred drink of the <I>Mysteries, </I>and from its seed all the 
different species of useful animals. After this beneficent deed Mithra ruled in 
the heavens, yet still keeping watch and ward over mankind, granting the 
petitions asked in his name. Those who followed him, who were initiated into his 
<I>mysteries </I>passed under his divine protection, especially after death when 
he would rescue their souls from the powers of darkness which fain would seize 
upon the dead. And yet again Mithra would come, when the earth was failing in 
her life-sustaining powers, and again he would slay a divine bull and give to 
all abundant life and happiness.</P>
<P>The <I>mysteries </I>and rites inspired the votaries with awe while giving to 
their hearts hope of a future life, transcending that which they had known. The 
temples, mithraeums as they were called, were either built underground or were 
caves and grottoes in the depths of dark forests, symbolising the birthplace of 
their god. Among his worshippers were slaves and soldiery, high officials and 
dignitaries, all mingling fraternally in a religion which called them Brethren. 
The rites were of magical significance. In order to bring their lives into 
closer communion with the divinity of Mithra, the neophytes must pass through 
seven degrees of initiation successively assuming the names of Raven, Occult, 
Soldier, Lion, Persian, Runner of the Sun and Father. Each of these grades 
carried with them symbolic garments and masks, donned by the celebrants. The 
masks represented birds and animals and would seem to indicate the existence of 
belief in the doctrine of metempsychosis; or perhaps they were a remnant of 
totemic belief. An almost ascetic habit of life was demanded, including 
prolonged fasting and purification. The oath of silence regarding the rites was 
taken, and before entering the higher grades a ceremony called the Sacrament was 
held where consecrated bread and wine were partaken of. Dramatic trials of 
strength, faith and endurance were gone through by all, a stoical attitude and 
unflinching moral courage being demanded as sign of fitness in the participant. 
The drinking of the sacred wine, and the baptism of blood, were supposed to 
bring to the initiate not only material benefit but wisdom; they gave power to 
combat evil, the power to attain to an immortality such as that of their god. An 
order of priests were connected with this cult, who faithfully carried on the 
occult tradition and usages, such as that of initiation, the rites of which were 
arduous; the tending of a perpetual fire on the altars; prayers to the Sun at 
dawn, noon and evening. There were sacrifices and libations, musical rites 
including long psalmodies and mystic chants. The days of the week were each 
sacred to a Planet, the day of the Sun being held especially holy. There were 
seasonal festivals, the birth of the Sun being solemnized on the <B>25</B>th of 
December, and the equinoxes were days of rejoicing, while the initiations were 
held preferably in the spring, in March or April. It is believed that in the 
earliest days of the cult some of the rites were of a savage and barbaric 
character, especially the sacrificial element, but these, as indicated, were 
changed and ennobled as the beneficence of Mithra took precedence of his warlike 
prowess. The Mithraic brotherhoods took temporal interests as well as spiritual 
ones under their care were in fact highly organised communities, including 
trustees, councils, senates, attorneys and patrons, people of high status and 
wealth. The fact of belonging to such a body gave to the initiate, be he of 
noble birth or but a slave, a sense of brotherhood and comradeship which was 
doubtless a powerful reason of the ascendancy which the Mithraic cult gained 
over the Roman army, whose members, dispersed to the ends of the earth in lonely 
solitudes amid wild and barbaric races, would find in this feeling of 
fraternity, this sharing in the worship and ritual of the Sun-god, an infinite 
comfort and solace.</P><B>

<P>Mysticism : </B>The attempt of man to attain to the ultimate reality of 
things and enjoy communion with the Highest. <I>Mysticism </I>maintains the 
possibility of intercourse with God, not by means of revelation, or the ordinary 
religious channels, but by dint of introspection, culminating in the feeling 
that the individual partakes of the divine nature. <I>Mysticism </I>has been 
identified with pantheism by some authorities but it differs from pantheism in 
that its motive is religious. But <I>mysticism </I>is greatly more speculative 
than ordinary religion and instead of commencing its flights of thought from the 
human side, starts from the divine nature rather than from man. The name 
<I>mysticism </I>cannot be applied to any particular system. Whereas religion 
teaches submission of the will and the ethical harmonies of life, <I>mysticism 
</I>strains after the realisation of a union with God Himself. The mystic 
desires to be as close to God as possible, if not indeed part of the Divine 
Essence Itself; whereas the ordinary devotee of most religious systems merely 
desires to walk in God's way and obey His will.</P><I>
<P>Mysticism </I>may be said to have originated in the East, where it probably 
evolved from kindred philosophic concepts. The unreality of things is taught by 
most Asiatic religions, especially by Brahminism and Buddhism, and the sense of 
the worth of human personality in these is small <I>(See </I>India). The Sufis 
of Persia may be said to be a link between the more austere Indian mystics and 
those of Europe. We find Sufism first arising in the ninth century among the 
Persian Mahommedans, probably as a protest against the severe monotheism of 
their religion; but in all likelihood more ancient springs contribute to its 
revival. In the Persia of Hafiz and Saadi, pantheism abounded, and their 
magnificent poetry is read by Mahommedans as having a deep mystical 
significance, 'although for the most part it deals with love and intoxication. 
In all probability more is read into these poems than exists beneath the 
surface, but at the same time it is certain that many of them exhibit the 
fervour of souls searching for communion with the highest. The rise of 
Alexandrian Neoplatonism (q.v.) was the signal for the introduction of 
<I>mysticism </I>to a waiting Europe, and as this stage of <I>mysticism </I>has 
been fully reviewed in a special article on the subject, there is no necessity 
to follow it here. It may be mentioned, however, that Neoplatonism made a 
definite mark upon early Christianity, and we find it mirrored in many of the 
patristic writings of the sixteenth century. It was Erigena who in the ninth 
century transmitted to Europe the so-called writings of Dionysius the Areopagite 
thus giving rise to both the scholasticism and <I>mysticism </I>of the middle 
ages. Erigena based his own system upon that of Dionysius. This was the 
so-called &quot; negative theology&quot; which places God above all categories 
and designates Him as Nothing, or The Incomprehensible Essence from which the 
world of primordial causes is eternally created. This creation is the Word or 
Son of God, in Whom all substantial things exist; but God is the beginning and 
end of everything. On this system Christian <I>mysticism </I>may be said to have 
been founded with little variation. With Erigena reason and authority were 
identical, and in this he agrees with all speculative mystics; whereas 
scholasticism is characterised by the acceptance by reason of a given matter 
which is pre-supposed even when it cannot be understood. It seemed to Erigena 
that in the scholastic system religious truth was external to the mind, while 
the opposite view was fundamental to <I>mysticism. </I>That is not to say that 
<I>mysticism </I>according to Erigena is a mere subordination of reason to 
faith. <I>Mysticism </I>indeed places every confidence in human reason, and it 
is essential that it should have the unity of the human mind with the divine as 
its main tenet ; but it accepts nothing from without, and it posits the higher 
faculty of reason over the realisation of absolute truth.</P>
<P>Medieval mysticism may be said to have originated from a reaction of 
practical religion against dialectics in which the true spirit of Christianity 
was then enshrined. Thus St. Bernard opposed the dry scholasticism of Abelard. 
His <I>mysticism </I>was profoundly practical, and deals chiefly with the means 
by which man may attain the knowledge of God. This is to be accomplished through 
contemplation and withdrawal from the world. Thus asceticism is the soul of 
medieval mysticism ; but he mistakenly averred regarding self-love that it is 
proper to love ourselves for God's sake, or because God loved us; thus merging 
self-love in love for God. We must, so to speak, love ourselves in God, in Whom 
we ultimately lose ourselves. Thus St. Bernard is almost Buddhistic, and indeed 
his <I>mysticism </I>is of the universal type. Perhaps Hugh of St. Victor, a 
contemporary of St. Bernard's, did more to develop the tenets of <I>mysticism 
</I>; and his monastery of Augustinians near Paris became, under his influence, 
a great centre of <I>mysticism. </I>One of his apologists, Richard of St. 
Victor, declares that the objects of mystic contemplation are partly above 
reason, and partly, as regards intuition, contrary to reason. The protagonists 
of this theory, all of whom issued from the same monastery, were known as the 
Victorines, who put up a stout fight against the dialecticians and schoolmen. 
Bonaventura, who died in <B>1274</B>, was a disciple of this school, and 
believer in the faculty of mystic intuition. In the twelfth and thirteenth 
centuries, the worldliness of the church aroused much opposition amongst laymen, 
and its cold formalism created a reaction towards a more spiritual regime. Many 
sects arose such as the Waldenses, the Kathari, and the Beguines, all of which 
strove to infuse into their teachings a warmer enthusiasm than that which burned 
in the heart of the church of their time. In Germany, <I>mysticism </I>made 
great strides, and Machthild of Magdeburg, and Elizabeth of Thuringia, were, if 
not the originators of <I>mysticism </I>in Germany, perhaps the earliest 
supporters of it. Joachim of Flores and Amalric of Bena wrote strongly in favour 
of the reformed church, and their writings are drenched with mystical terms, 
derived for the most part from Erigena. Joachim mapped out the duration of the 
world into three ages, that of the Father, that of the Son, and that of the 
Spirit,-the first of which was to commence with the year <B>1260</B><I>, </I>and 
to be inaugurated by the general adoption of the life monastic and 
contemplative. A sect called The New Spirit, or The Free Spirit, became 
widespread through northern France, Switzerland and Germany; and these did much 
to infuse the spirit of <I>mysticism </I>throughout the German land.</P>
<P>It is with Eckhart, who died in <B>1327</B>, that we get the juncture of 
<I>mysticism </I>with scholastic theology. Of his doctrine it has been said: The 
ground of your being lies in God. Reduce yourself to that simplicity, that root, 
and you are in God. There is no longer any distinction between your spirit and 
the divine,-you have escaped personality and finite limitation. Your particular, 
creature self, as a something separate and dependent on God, is gone. So also, 
obviously, your creaturely will. Henceforth, therefore, what seems an 
inclination of yours is in fact the divine good pleasure. You are free from law. 
You are above means. The very will to do the will of God is resolved into that 
will itself. This is the Apathy, the Negation, the Poverty, he commends. With 
Eckhart personally this self-reduction and deification is connected with a 
rigorous asceticism and exemplary moral excellence Yet it is easy to see that it 
may be a merely intellectual process, consisting in a man's thinking that he is 
thinking himself away from his personality. He declares the appearance of the 
Son necessary to enable us to realize our sonship; and yet his language implies 
that this realization is the perpetual incarnation of that Son - does, as it 
were, constitute him. Christians are accordingly not less the sons of God by 
grace than is Christ by nature. Believe yourself divine, and the Son is brought 
forth in you. The Saviour and the saved are dissolved together in the blank 
absolute substance.</P>
<P>With the advent of the black death, a great spirit of remorse swept over 
Europe in the fourteenth century, and a vast revival of piety took place. This 
resulted in the foundation in Germany of a society of Friends of God, whose 
chief object was to strengthen each other in intercourse with the Creator. 
Perhaps the most distinguished of these were Tauler, and Nicolas of Basle, and 
the society numbered many inmates of the cloister, as well as wealthy men of 
commerce and others. Ruysbroeck (q.v.) the great Dutch mystic, was connected 
with them; but his <I>mysticism </I>is perhaps more intensely practical than 
that of any other visionary. It is the machinery by which the union with God is 
to be effected which most attracts him. In Ruysbroeck's life-time a mystical 
society arose in Holland called the Brethren of the Common Lot, who founded an 
establishment at which Groot dispensed the principles of <I>mysticism </I>to 
Radewyn and Thomas a Kempis.</P>
<P>The attitude of <I>mysticism </I>at the period of the Reformation is 
peculiar. We find a mystical propaganda pretending to be sent forth by a body of 
Rosicrucians denouncing Roman Catholicism in the fiercest terms, and we also 
observe the spirit of <I>mysticism </I>strongly within those bodies which 
resisted the coldness and formalism of the Roman Church. On the other hand, 
however, we find the principles of Luther strongly opposed by some of the most 
notable mystics of his time. But the Reformation past, <I>mysticism </I>went on 
its way, divided, it is true, so far as the outward theological principles of 
its votaries were concerned, but strongly united in its general principles.</P>
<P>It is with Nicholas of Kusa, who died in <B>1464</B>, that <I>mysticism 
</I>triumphs over scholasticism. Nicolas is the protagonist of super-knowledge, 
or that higher ignorance which is the knowledge of the intellect in 
contra-distinction to the mere knowledge of the understanding. His doctrines 
coloured those of Giordano Bruno and his theosophy certainly preceded that of 
Paracelsus. The next great name we meet with in <I>mysticism </I>is that of 
Boehme (q.v.), who once and for all systematised German philosophy. The Roman 
Church produced many mystics of note in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, 
notably Francis of Sales, Mme. Guyon and Molinos,-the last two of which were the 
protagonists of Quietism, which set forth the theory that there should be no 
pleasure in the practice of <I>mysticism, </I>and that God did not exist for the 
enjoyment of man. Perhaps the greatest students of Boehme were William Law 
(q.v.), <B>1686</B> to <B>1765</B>, and Saint Martin (q.v.), <B>1743</B> to 
<B>1803</B>.</P>
<P>But all <I>mysticism </I>is not necessarily identified with sect, although 
undoubtedly its strongholds in this country to-day are to be found in certain 
circles of the Church of England. There are still with us mystics who, 
professing no definite theological tenets, are yet mystics in virtue of their 
desire for unity with, or proximity to the Deity, by what they call 
&quot;magical&quot; methods. These are obscure, and are probably the result of 
personal experiences, which it is not given to everyone to comprehend ; but 
which,. nevertheless, may be very real indeed. For a good summary of such 
<I>mysticism </I>the reader is referred to Mr. A. E. Waite's <I>Azoth or the 
Star in the East ; See </I>also Evelyn Underhill's <I>Mysticism </I>and <I>The 
Mystic Way.</P>
