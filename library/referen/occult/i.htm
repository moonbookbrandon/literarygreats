<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>lao, or I-ha-ho :</B> A mystic name said by Clement of Alexandria to have 
been worn on their persons by the initiates of the Mysteries of Serapis. It is 
said to embody the symbols of the two generative principles.</P><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Ichthyomancy :</B> Divination by the inspection of the entrails of 
fish.</P><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Ideas of Good and Evil</B> <B>:</B> <I>(See </I><B>Yeats.</B>)</P><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Ifrits :</B> Hideous spectres probably of Arabian origin, now genii of 
Persian and Indian mythology. They assume diverse forms, and frequent ruins, 
woods and wild desolate places, for the purpose of preying upon men and other 
living things. They are sometimes confounded with the Jinns or Divs of 
Persia.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Ignis Fatuus :</B> A wavering luminous appearance frequently observed in 
meadows and marshy places, round which many popular superstitions cluster. Its 
folk-names, Will O' the Wisp and Jack O' Lantern, suggest a country fellow 
bearing a lantern or straw torch (wisp). Formerly these lights were supposed to 
haunt desolate bogs and moor-lands for the purpose of misleading travellers and 
drawing them to their death. Another superstition says that they are the spirits 
of those who have been drowned in the bogs, and yet another, that they are the 
souls of unbaptized infants. Science refers these ignes fatui to gaseous 
exhalations from the moist ground, or, more rarely, to night-flying insects.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Iliuminati :</B> The term used first of all in the <B>15</B>th century by 
enthusiasts in the occult arts signifying those who claimed to possess &quot; 
light&quot; directly communicated from a higher source, or due to a larger 
measure of human wisdom. We first find the name in Spain about the end of the 
<B>15</B>th century. Its origin is probably a late Gnostic one hailing from 
Italy, and we find all sorts of people, many of them charlatans, claiming to 
belong to the brotherhood. In Spain, such persons as laid claim to the title had 
to face the rigour of the Inquisition, and this is perhaps the reason that we 
find numbers of them in France in the early seventeenth century, as 
refugees.</P>
<P>Here and there small bodies of those called <I>Illuminati, </I>sometimes 
known as Rosicrucians rose into publicity for a short period. But it is with 
Weishaupt, Professor of Law at Ingolstadt, that the movement first became 
identified with republicanism. It soon secured a strong hold all through 
Germany, but its founder's object was merely to convert his followers into blind 
instruments of his supreme will. He modelled his organisation on that of the 
Jesuits, adopted their system of espionage, and their maxim that the end 
justified the means. He induced mysticism into the workings of the brotherhood, 
so that an air of mystery might prevade all its doings, adopted many of the 
classes and grades of Freemasonry, and held but hopes of the communication of 
deep occult secrets in the higher ranks.</P>
<P>Only a few of the members knew him personally, and thus although the society 
had many branches in all parts <B>6</B>f Germany, to these people alone was he 
visible, and he began to be regarded by those who had not seen him almost as a 
god. He took care to enlist in his ranks as many young men of wealth and 
position as possible, and within four or five years the power of Illuminism 
became extra-ordinary in its proportions, its members even had a hand in the 
affairs of the state, and not a few of the German princes found it to their 
interest to having dealings with the fraternity. Weishaupt's idea was to blend 
philanthropy and mysticism. He was only <B>28</B> when he founded the sect in 
<B>1776</B>. but he did not make much progress until a certain baron Von Knigge 
joined him in <B>1780</B>. A gifted person of strong imagination he had been 
admitted master of most of the secret societies of his day, among them 
Freemasonry. He was also an expert occultist and the supernatural had strong 
attractions for him. These two, rapidly spread the gospel of the Revolution 
throughout Germany. But they grew fearful that, if the authorities discovered 
the existence of such a society as theirs they would take steps to suppress it. 
With this in view they conceived the idea of grafting it on to Freemasonry, 
which they considered would protect it, and offer it means of spreading more 
widely and rapidly.</P>
<P>The Freemasons were not long in discovering the true nature of those who had 
just joined their organisation. A chief council was held with the view of 
thoroughly examining into the nature of the beliefs held by them and a 
conference of masons was held in <B>1782 </B>at which Knigge and Weishaupt 
attended and endeavoured to capture the whole organisation of Freemasonry. but a 
misunderstanding grew up between the leaders of illuminism. Knigge withdrew from 
the society; and two years later those who had reached its highest grade and had 
discovered that mysticism was not its true object, denounced it to the Bavarian 
Government as a political society of a dangerous character. Weishaupt fled, but 
the damage had been done, for the fire kindled by <I>illuminism </I>was soon to 
burst forth in the French Revolution.</P>
<P>The title <I>Illuminati </I>was later given to the French Martinists 
(q.v.)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Imhetep :</B> An Egyptian deity, son of Ptah and Nut, to whom great powers of 
exorcism were attributed. He was often appealed to in cases of demoniac 
possession.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Imperator :</B> Control of Rev. W. S. Moses. <I>(See<B> </I>Moses, William 
Stainton.</B>)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Impersonation :</B> Mediums who are controlled by the spirit of a deceased 
person frequently <I>impersonate </I>that person, imitate his voice and 
gestures, his physical peculiarities and manners, and exhibit the symptoms of 
any disease from which he may have suffered. <I>(See </I>Trance 
Personalities.)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Incense, Magical :</B> <I>(See </I><B>Magic.</B>)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Incommunicable Axiom, The :</B> It was believed that all magical science was 
embodied in knowledge of this secret. The <I>Axiom </I>is to be found enclosed 
in the four letters of the Tetragram arranged in a certain way; in the words 
&quot; Azoth&quot; and &quot; Inri&quot; written kabalistically; and in the 
monogram of Christ embroidered in the labarum. He who succeeded in elucidating 
it became humanly omnipotent from the magical standpoint.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Incubus :</B> A spirit which has intercourse with mortal women. The concept 
may have arisen from the idea of the commerce of gods with women, rife in pagan 
times. For, modern and medieval instances, we can do little more than refer to 
the pages in which they may be found, and the very names of the writers will 
sufficiently avouch their credibility. The history of Hector Boethius has three 
or four notable examples, which obtain confirmation from the pen of Cardan. One 
of these we may venture to transcribe in the quaint dress which Holinshed had 
given it. &quot; In the year <B>1480</B> it chanced as a Scottish ship departed 
out of the Forth towards Flanders, there arose a wonderful great tempest of wind 
and weather, so outragious, that the maister of the ship, with other the 
mariners, woondered not a little what the matter ment, to see such weather at 
that time of the yeare, for it was about the middest of summer. At length, when 
the furious pirrie and rage of winds still increased, in such wise that all 
those within the ship looked for present death, there was a woman underneath the 
hatches called unto them above, and willed them to throw her into the sea, that 
all the residue, by God's grace, might yet be saved; and thereupon told them how 
she had been haunted a long time with a spirit dailie comming unto hir in man's 
likenesse. In the ship there chanced also to be priest, who by the maister's 
appointment going down to this woman, and finding her like a most wretched and 
desperate person, lamenting hir great misfortune and miserable estate, used such 
wholesome admonition and comfortable advertisements, willing her to repent and 
hope for mercy at the hands of God, that, at length, she seeming right penitent 
for her grievous offences committed, and fetching snodrie sighs even from the 
bottome of her ifeart, being witnesse, as should appeare, of the same, there 
issued forth of the pumpe of the ship, a foule and evil-favoured blacke cloud 
with a mighty terrible noise, flame, smoke, and stinke, which presently fell 
into the sea. And suddenlie thereupon the tempest ceassed, and the ship passing 
in great quiet the residue of her journey, arrived in saftie at the place 
whither she was bound.&quot; ('Chronicles,' vol. v., <B>146</B>, Ed. 
<B>1808</B>). In another case related by the same author, the <I>Incubus </I>did 
not depart so quietly. In the chamber of a young gentlewoman, of excellent 
beauty, and daughter of a nobleman in the country of Mar, was found at an 
unseasonable hour, &quot;a foule monstrous thing, verie horrible to 
behold,&quot; for the love of which &quot;Deformed&quot; nevertheless, the lady 
had refused sundry wealthy marriages. A priest who was in the company began to 
repeat St. John's Gospel, and ere he had proceeded far &quot;suddenlie the 
wicked spirit, making a verie sore and terrible roaring noise, ffue his waies, 
taking the roofe of the chamber awale with him, the hangings and coverings of 
the bed being also burnt therewith.&quot;</P>
<P>Erastus, in his Tract &quot;de Laiis,&quot; Sprangerus, who assures us that 
himself and his four colleagues punished many old women of Ratisbon with death 
for this commerce, Zanchius </P>
<P>(&quot;de Operibus Dei,&quot; xvi., <B>4</B>.); Dandidas (&quot;in 
Aristotelis de Anima,&quot; ii. <B>29, 30); </B>Reussus (v., <B>6</B>); Godelman 
(ii., <B>5</B>); Valesius (&quot;de Sacra Phil.,&quot; <B>40); </B>and Delrio, 
passim,&quot; - among others, will satiate the keenest curiosity on these 
points. From Bodinus, we learn that Joan Hervilleria, at twelve years of age, 
was solemnly betrothed to Beelzebub, by her mother, who was afterwards burnt 
alive for compassing this clandestine marriage. The bridegroom was very 
respectably attired, and the marriage formulary was simple. The mother 
pronounced the following words to the bridegroom: &quot;Ecce filiam meam quam 
spospondi tibi,&quot; and then turning to the bride, &quot;Ecce amicum tuom qui 
beabit te.&quot; It appears, however, that Joan was not satisfied with her 
spiritual husband alone, but became a bigamist, by inter-marrying - with real 
flesh and blood. Besides this lady, we read of Margaret Bremont, who, in company 
with her mother, Joan Robert, Joan Guillemin, Mary, wife of Simon Agnus, and 
Wilhelma, spouse of one Grassus, were in the habit of attending diabolic 
assignations. These unhappy wretches were burnt alive by Adrian Ferreus, General 
Vicar of the Inquisition. Magdalena Crucia of Cordova, an abbess, was more 
fortunate. In <B>1545 </B>she became suspected by her nuns of magic, an 
accusation very convenient when a superior was at all troublesome. She 
encountered them with great wisdom by anticipating their charge; and going 
beforehand to the Pope, Paul III., she confessed a thirty years intimate 
acquaintance with the devil, and obtained his pardon. <I>(See

<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>India :</B> <I>Mystical Systems.-It </I>would be beyond the scope of such a 
work as this to undertake to provide any account of the several religious 
systems of India, and we must confine ourselves to a description of the 
mysticism and demonology which cluster round these systems, and an outline of 
the magic and sorcery of the native peoples of the empire.</P><I>
<P>Hinduism.-It </I>may be said that the mysticism of the Hindus was a reaction 
against the detailed and practical ceremonial of the <I>Vedas. </I>If its trend 
were summarised it might justly he said that it partakes strongly of 
disinterestedness is a pantheistic identifying of subject and object, worshipper 
and worship; aims at ultimate absorption in the Infinite; inculcates absolute 
passivity, the most minute self-examination, the cessation of the physical 
powers; and believes in the spiritual guidance of the mystical adept. For the 
Indian theosophists there is only one Absolute Being, the One Reality. True, the 
pantheistic doctrine of <I>Ekam advitiyam </I>&quot;the One without Second&quot; 
posits a countless pantheon of gods, great and small, and a rich demonology; but 
it has to be 'understood that these are merely illusions of the soul and not 
realities. Upon the soul's coming to fuller knowledge, its illusions are totally 
dispelled, but to the ordinary man the impersonality of absolute being is 
useless. He requires a symbolic deity to bridge the gulf betwixt the impersonal 
Absolute and his very material self, hence the numerous gods of Hinduism which 
are regarded by the initiated merely as manifestations of the Supreme Spirit. 
Even the rudest forms of idolatry in this way possess higher meaning. As Sir 
Alfred Lyall says.:&quot; It (Brahminism) treats all the worships as outward 
visible signs of the same spiritual truth, and is ready to show how each 
particular image or rite is the symbol of some aspect of universal divinity. The 
Hindus, like the pagans of antiquity adore natural objects and forces,- a 
mountain, a river, or an animal. The Brahmin holds all nature to be the vesture 
or cloak of indwelling divine energy which inspires everything that produces all 
or passes man's understanding.&quot;</P>
<P>The life ascetic has from the remotest times been regarded in <I>India </I>as 
the truest preparation for communion with the deity. Asceticism is extremely 
prevalent especially in connection with the cult of Siva, who is in great 
measure regarded as the prototype of this class. The Yogis or Jogis (disciples 
of the Yogi. philosophy), practise mental abstraction, and are popularly 
supposed to attain to superhuman powers. The usual results of their ascetic 
practices are madness or mental vacancy, and their so-called supernatural powers 
are mostly prophetic, or in too many cases pure jugglery and conjuring. The 
Parama-Hamsas, that is &quot;supreme swans&quot; claim to be identical with the 
world-soul, and have no occupation except meditation on Brahma. They are said to 
be equally indifferent to pleasure or pain, insensible to heat or cold, and 
incapable of satiety or want. The Sannyasis are those who renounce terrestrial 
affairs: they are of the character of monks, and are as a general rule extremely 
dirty. The Dandis or staff-bearers are worshippers of Siva in his form of 
Bhairava the Terrible. Mr. J. C. Owen in his <I>Mystics, Ascetics and Sects of 
India </I>says of these Sadhus or holy men</P>
<P>Sadhuism whether perpetuating the peculiar idea of the efficacy of asceticism 
for the acquisition of far-reaching powers over natural phenomena or bearing its 
testimony to the belief of the indispensableness of detachment from the world as 
a preparation for the ineffable joy of ecstatic communion with the Divine Being, 
has undoubtedly tended to keep before men's eyes as the highest ideal, a life of 
purity and restraint and contempt of the world of human affairs. It has also 
necessarily maintained amongst the laity a sense of the rights and claims of the 
poor upon the charity of the more opulent members of the community. Further, 
Sadhuism by the multiplicity of the independent sects which - have arisen in 
India has engendered and favoured a spirit of tolerance which cannot escape the 
notice of the most superficial observer.&quot;</P>
<P>One of the most esoteric branches of Hinduism is the Sakta cult. The Saktas 
are worshippers of the Sakti or female principle as a creative and reproductive 
agency. Each of the principal gods possesses his own Sakti, through which his 
creative acts are performed, so that the Sakta worshippers are drawn from all 
sects. But it is principally in connection with the cult of Siva that Sakta 
worship is practised. Its principal seat is the north-eastern part of 
India-Bengal, Behar and Assam. It is divided into two distinct groups. The 
original self-existent gods were supposed to divide themselves into male and 
female energies, the male half occupying the right-hand and the female the 
left-hand side. From this conception we have the two groups of 
&quot;right-hand&quot; observers and &quot;left-hand&quot; observers. In the 
<I>Tantras </I>or mystical writings, Siva unfolds in the nature of a colloquy in 
answer to questions asked by his spouse Parvati, the mysteries of Sakta 
occultism. The right-hand worshippers are by far the most numerous. Strict 
secrecy is enjoined in the performance of the rites, and only one minor caste, 
the Kanlas, carry on the mystic and degraded rites of the <I>Tantras.</P>
<P>Brahmanism - Brahmanism </I>is a system originated by the Brahmans, the 
sacerdotal caste of the Hindus, at a comparatively early date. It is the 
mystical religion of India <I>par excellence, </I>and represents the more 
archaic beliefs of its peoples. It states that the numberless individual 
existences of animate nature are but so many manifestations of the one eternal 
spirit towards which they tend as their final goal of supreme bliss. The object 
of man is to prevent himself sinking lower in the scale, and by degrees to raise 
himself in it, or if possible to attain the ultimate goal immediately from such 
state of existence as he happens to be in. The code of Manu concludes &quot;He 
who in his own soul perceives the supreme soul in all beings and acquires 
equanimity towards them all attains the highest state of bliss.&quot; 
Mortification of animal instincts, absolute purity and perfection of spirit, 
were the moral ideals of the Brahman class. But it was necessary to pass through 
a succession of four orders or states of existence ere any hope of union with 
the deity could be held out. These were: that of <I>brakmacharin, </I>or 
student. of religious matters; <I>grihastha, </I>or householder; <I>vanavasin, 
</I>or hermit; and <I>sannyasin </I>or <I>bhikshu, </I>fakir or religious 
mendicant. Practically every man of the higher castes practised at least the 
first two of these stages, while the priestly class took the entire course. 
Later, however, this was by no means the rule, as the scope of study was 
intensely exacting, often lasting as long as forty-eight years, and the neophyte 
had to support himself by begging from door to door. He was usually attached to 
the house of some religious teacher ; and after several years of his tuition was 
usually married, as it was considered absolutely essential that he should leave 
a son behind him to offer food to his spirit and to those of his ancestors. He 
was then said to have become a &quot; Householder&quot; and was required to keep 
up perpetually the fire brought into his house upon his marriage day. Upon his 
growing older, the time for him arrived to enter the third stage of life, and he 
&quot; cut himself off from all family ties except that (if she wished) his wife 
might accompany him, and went into retirement in a lonely place, carrying with 
him his sacred fire, and the instruments necessary to his daily 
sacrifices.&quot; Scantily clothed, and with hair and nails uncut, it is set 
down that the anchorite must live entirely on food growing wild in the 
forest-roots, herbs, wild grain, and so forth. The acceptance of gifts was not 
permitted him unless absolutely necessary, and his time was spent in reading the 
metaphysical portions of the <I>Veda, </I>in making offerings, and in practising 
austerities with the object of producing entire indifference to worldly desires. 
In this way he fits himself for the final and most exalted order, that of 
religious mendicant or <I>bhikshu. </I>This consists solely of meditation. He 
takes up his abode at the foot of a tree in entire solitude, and only once a day 
at the end of their labours may he go near the dwellings of men to beg a little 
food. In this way he waits for death, neither desiring extinction nor existence, 
until at length it reaches him, and he is absorbed in the eternal Brahma.</P>
<P>The purest doctrines of Brahmanism are to be found in the Vedanta philosophic 
system, which recognises the <I>Veda, </I>or collection of ancient Sanskrit 
hymns, as the revealed source of religious belief through the visions of the 
ancient <I>Risk's </I>or seers. It has been already mentioned that the Hindu 
regarded the entire gamut of animated nature as being traversed by the one soul, 
which journeyed up and down the scale as its actions in its previous existence 
were good or evil. To the Hindu the vital element in all animate beings appears 
essentially similar, and this led directly to the Brahmanical theory of 
transmigration, which has taken such a powerful hold upon the Hindu mind.</P><I>
<P>Demonology.-A </I>large and intricate demonology has clustered around Hindu 
mythology. The gods are at constant war with demons. Thus Durga slays Chanda and 
Asura, and also despatches Durga, a fiend of similar name to herself. Vishnu 
also slays more than one demon, but Durga appears to have been a great enemy of 
the demon race. The Asuras, probably a very ancient and aboriginal pantheon of 
deities, later became demons in the popular imagination, and the Rakshasas were 
cloud-demons. They are described as cannibals, could take any form, and were 
constantly, menacing the gods. They haunt cemeteries, disturb sacrifices, 
animate the dead, harry and afflict mankind in all sorts of ways. In fact they 
are almost an absolute parallel with the vampires of Slavonic countries; and 
this greatly assists the conclusions of Asikoff that the Slavonic vampires were 
originally cloud-spirits. We find the gods constantly harassed by demons; and on 
the whole we may be justified in concluding that just as the Tuatha-de-danaan 
harassed the later deities of Ireland, so did these aboriginal gods lead an 
existence of constant warfare with the divine beings of the pantheon of the 
immigrant Aryans.</P><I>
<P>Popular Witchcraft and Sorcery.-The </I>popular witch-craft and sorcery of 
<I>India </I>greatly resembles that of Europe. The Dravidian or aboriginal races 
of <I>India </I>have always been strong believers in witchcraft, and it is 
possible that here we have an example of the mythic influence of a conquered 
people. They are, however, extremely reticent regarding any knowledge they 
possess of it. It is practically confined to them, and this might lead to the 
hasty supposition that the Aryan races of <I>India </I>possess no witchcraft of 
their own. But this is strongly unlikely, and the truth probably lies quite in 
the other direction; however, the extraordinarily high demands made upon the 
popular religious sense by Brahmanism probably crushed the superstitions of the 
lower cultus of a very early period, and confined the practice of minor sorcery 
to the lower castes, who were of course of Dravidian or aboriginal blood. We 
find witchcraft most prevalent among the more isolated and least advanced races, 
like the Kols, Bhils, and Santals. The nomadic peoples are also strong believers 
in sorcery, one of the most dreaded forms of which is the <I>Jigar Khor, </I>or 
liver-eater, of whom Abul Fazl says :-One of this class can steal away the liver 
of another by looks and incantations. Other accounts say that by looking at a 
person he deprives him of his senses, and then steals from him something 
resembling the seed of a pomegranate, which he hides in the calf of his leg ; 
after being swelled by the fire, he distributes it among his fellows to be 
eaten, which ceremony concludes the life of the fascinated person. A <I>Jigar 
Khor </I>is able to communicate his art to another by teaching him incantations, 
and by making him eat a bit of the liver cake. These <I>Jigar Khors </I>are 
mostly women. It is said they can bring intelligence from a long distance in a 
short space of time, and if they are thrown into a river with a stone tied to 
them, they nevertheless will not sink. In order to deprive any one of this 
wicked power, they brand his temples and every joint of his body, cram his eyes 
with salt, suspend him for forty days in a subterranean chamber, and repeat over 
him certain incantations.&quot; The witch does not, however, devour the man's 
liver for two and a half days, and even if she has eaten it, and is put under 
the hands of an exorciser, she can be forced to substitute a liver of some 
animal in the body of the man whom she victimised. We also hear tales of witches 
taking out the entrails of people, sucking them, and then replacing them. All 
this undoubtedly illustrates, as in ancient France and Germany, and probably 
also in the Slavonic countries, the original combination of witch and vampire; 
how, in fact, the two were one and the same. In <I>India </I>the arch-witch 
<I>Ralaratri, </I>or &quot; black night&quot; has the joined eyebrows of the 
Salvonic werewolf or vampire, large cheeks, widely-parted lips, projecting 
teeth, and is a veritable vampire. But she also possesses the powers of ordinary 
witchcraft, - second-sight, the making of philtres, the control of tempests, the 
evil eye, and so forth. Witches also take animal forms, especially those of 
tigers; and stories of trials are related at which natives gave evidence that 
they had tracked certain tigers to their lairs, which upon entering they had 
found tenanted by a a notorious witch or wizard. For such witch-tigers the usual 
remedy is to knock out their teeth to prevent their doing any more mischief. 
Strangely enough the Indian witch, like her European prototype, is very often 
accompanied by a cat. The cat, say the jungle people, is aunt to the tiger. and 
taught him everything but how to climb a tree. Zalim Sinh, the famous regent of 
Kota, believed that cats were associated with witches, and imagining himself 
enchanted ordered that every cat should be expelled from his province.</P>
<P>As in Europe, witches are known by certain marks. They are believed to learn 
the secrets of their craft by eating offal of all kinds. The popular belief 
concerning them is that they are often very handsome and neat, and invariably 
apply a clear line of red lead to the parting of their hair. They are popularly 
accused of exhuming dead children, and bringing them to life to serve occult 
purposes of their own. They cannot die so long as they are witches, and until, 
as in Italy, they can pass on their knowledge of witchcraft to someone else. 
They recite charms backwards, repeating two letters and a half from a verse in 
the <I>Koran. </I>If a certain charm is repeated &quot; forwards,&quot; the 
person employing it will become invisible to his neighbour. but if he repeats it 
backwards, he will assume whatever shape he chooses. A witch can acquire power 
over her victim by getting possession of a lock of hair, the paring of nails, or 
some other part of his body, such as a tooth. For this reason natives of 
<I>India </I>are extremely careful about the disposal of such, burying them in 
the earth in a place covered with grass, or in the neighbourhood of water, which 
witches universally dislike. Some people even fling the cuttings of their hair 
into running water. Like the witches of Europe too, they are in the practice of 
making images of persons out of wax, dough, or similar substances, and torturing 
them, with the idea that the pain will be felt by the person whom they desire to 
injure. In <I>India </I>the witches' familiar is known as <I>Bir </I>or the 
&quot; hero,&quot; who aids her to inflict injury upon human beings. The power 
of the witch is greatest on the <B>14</B>th, <B>15</B>th and <B>29</B>th of each 
month, and in particular on the Feast of Lamps, and the Festival of Durga.</P>
<P>Witches are often severely punished amongst the isolated hill-folk and a 
diabolical ingenuity is shown in torturing them. To nullify their evil 
influence, they are beaten with rods of the castor-oil plant and usually die in 
the process. They are often forced to drink filthy water used by curriers in the 
process of their work, or their noses are cut off, or they are put to death. As 
has been said, their teeth are often knocked out, their heads shaved and offal 
is thrown at them. In the case of women their heads are shaved and their hair is 
attached to a tree in some public place. They are also branded; have a 
ploughshare tied to their legs; and made to drink the water of a tannery. During 
the Mutiny, when British authority was relaxed, the most atrocious horrors were 
inflicted upon witches and sorcerers by the Dravidian people. Pounded <I>chili 
</I>peppers were placed in their eyes to see if they would bring tears, and the 
wretched beings were suspended from a tree head downwards, being swung violently 
from side to side. They were then forced to drink the blood of a goat, and to 
exorcise the evil spirits that they had caused to enter the bodies of certain 
sick persons. The mutilations and cruelties practised on them are such as will 
not bear repetition, but one of the favourite ways of counteracting the spells 
of a witch is to draw blood from her, and the local priest will often prick the 
tongue of the witch with a needle, and place the resulting blood on some rice 
and compel her to eat it.</P>
<P>In Bombay, the aboriginal Tharus are supposed to possess special powers of 
witchcraft, so that the &quot; Land of Tharus&quot; is a synonym for witch-land. 
In Gorakhpur, witches are also very numerous, and the half-gypsy <I>Banjaras, 
</I>or grain-carriers, are notorious believers in witchcraft. In his interesting 
<I>Popular Religion and Folk-lore of Northern India, </I>Mr. W. Crooke, who has 
had exceptional opportunities for the study of the native character, and who has 
done much to clear up the dark places of Indian popular mythology, says 
regarding the various types of Indian witches</P>
<P>&quot;At the present day the half-deified witch most dreaded in the Eastern 
Districts of the North-western Provinces is Lona, or Nona, a <I>Chamarin </I>or 
woman of the currier caste. Her legend is in this wise. The great physician 
Dhanwantara, who corresponds to Luqman Hakim of the Muhammadans, was once on his 
way to cure King Parikshit, and was deceived and bitten by the snake king 
Takshaka. He therefore desired his son to roast him and eat his flesh, and thus 
succeed to his magical powers. The snake king dissuaded them from eating the 
unholy meal, and they let the cauldron containing it float down the Ganges. A 
currier woman, named Lona, found it and ate the contents, and thus succeeded to 
the mystic powers of Dhanwantara. She became skilful in cures, particularly of 
snake-bite. Finally she was discovered to be a witch by the extraordinary 
rapidity with which she could plant out rice seedlings. One day the people 
watched her, and saw that when she believed herself unobserved she stripped 
herself naked, and taking the bundle of the plants in her hands threw them into 
the air, reciting certain spells. When the seedlings forthwith arranged 
themselves in their proper places, the spectators called out in astonishment, 
and finding herself discovered, Nona rushed along over the country, and the 
channel which she made in her course is the Loni river to this day. So a saint 
in Broach formed a new course for a river by dragging his clothes behind him. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Another terrible witch, whose legend is told at Mathura, is Putana, the 
daughter of Bali, king of the lower world. She found the infant Krishna asleep, 
and began to suckle him with her devil's milk. The first drop would have 
poisoned a mortal child, but Krishna drew her breast with such strength that he 
drained her life-blood, and the fiend, terrifying the whole land of Bali with 
her cries of agony, fell lifeless on the ground. European witches suck the blood 
of children ; here the divine Krishna turns the tables on the witch.</P>
<P>&quot;The Palwar Rajputs of Oudh have a witch ancestress. Soon after the 
birth of her son she was engaged in baking cakes. Her infant began to cry, and 
she was obliged to perform a double duty. At this juncture her husband arrived 
just in time to see his demon wife assume gigantic and supernatural proportions, 
so as to allow both the baking and nursing to go on at the same time. But 
finding her secret discovered, the witch disappeared, leaving her son as a 
legacy to her astonished husband. Here, though the story is incomplete, we have 
almost certainly, as in the case of Nona Chamarin, one of the Melusina type of 
legend, where the supernatural wife leaves her husband and children, because he 
violated some taboo, by which he is forbidden to see her in a state of nudity, 
or the like.</P>
<P>&quot;The history of witchcraft in <I>India, </I>as in Europe, is one of the 
saddest pages in the annals of the people. Nowadays, the power of British law 
has almost entirely suppressed the horrible outrages which, under the native 
administration were habitually practised. But particularly in the more remote 
and uncivilized parts of the country this superstition still exists in the minds 
of the people and occasional indications of it, which appear in our criminal 
records, are quite sufficient to show that any relaxation of the activity of our 
magistrates and police would undoubtedly lead to its revival in some of its more 
shocking forms.&quot;</P>
<P>The aborigines of <I>India </I>live in great fear of ghosts and invisible 
spirits, and a considerable portion of their time is given up to averting the 
evil influences of these. Protectives of every description litter their houses, 
and the approaches to them, and they wear numerous amulets for the purpose of 
averting evil influences. Regarding these, Mr. Crooks says:-</P>
<P>&quot;Some of the Indian ghosts, like the <I>Ifrit </I>of the Arabian Nights, 
can grow to the length of ten <I>yojanas </I>or eighty miles. In one of the 
Bengal tales a ghost is identified because she can stretch out her hands several 
yards for a vessel. Some ghosts possess the very dangerous power of entering 
human corpses, like the Vetala, and swelling to an enormous size. The Kharwars 
of Mirzapur have a wild legend, which tells how long ago an unmarried girl of 
the tribe died, and was being cremated. While the relations were collecting wood 
for the pyre, a ghost entered the corpse, but the friends managed to expel him. 
Since then great care is taken not to leave the bodies of women unwatched. So, 
in the Panjab, when a great person is cremated the bones and ashes are carefully 
watched till the fourth day, to prevent a magician interfering with them. If he 
has a chance, he can restore the deceased to life, and ever after retain him 
under his influence. This is the origin of the custom in Great Britain of waking 
the dead, a practice which 'most probably originated from a silly superstition 
as to the danger of a corpse being carried off by some of the agents of the 
invisible world, or exposed to the ominous liberties of brute animals.' But in 
<I>India </I>it is considered the best course, if the corpse cannot be 
immediately disposed of, to measure it carefully, and then no malignant <I>Bhutt 
</I>can occupy it.</P>
<P>&quot;Most of the ghosts whom we have been as yet considering are malignant. 
There are, however, others which are friendly. Such are the German Elves, the 
Robin Goodfellow, Puck, Brownie and the Cauld Lad of Hilton of England, the 
Glashan of the Isle of Man, the Phouka or Leprechaun of Ireland. Such, in One of 
his many forms, is the <I>Brahmadaitya, </I>or ghost of a Brahman who has died 
unmarried. In Bengal he is believed to be more neat and less mischievous than 
other ghosts; the Bhuts carry him in a palanquin, he wears wooden sandals, and 
lives in a Banyan tree.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Infernal Court : </B>Wierus and others, learned in the lore of the 
<I>infernal </I>regions, have discovered therein princes and high dignitaries, 
ministers, ambassadors, and officers of state, whose names would fill much space 
to little purpose Satan is no longer the soverign of Hades, but is, so to speak, 
leader of the opposition. The true leader is Beelzebub.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Initiation :</B> The process of entry into a secret society or similar 
organisation. The idea of <I>initiation </I>was certainly inherited by the 
Egyptians and Asssyrians from older neolithic peoples, who possessed secret 
organisations or &quot;mysteries&quot; analogous to those of the Medwiwin of the 
North American Indians or those of the Australian Black-fellows. We read of 
<I>initiation </I>into the various grades of the Egyptian priesthood and the 
&quot; mysteries&quot; of Eleusis and Bacchus. <I>(See </I>Mysteries.) These 
processes probably consisted of tests of courage and fidelity (as do the savage 
<I>initiations) </I>and included such acts as sustaining a severe buffeting, the 
drinking of blood, real and imaginary, and so forth. In the <I>Popol Vuh, 
</I>the saga of the Kiche Indians of Guatemala we have a picture of the 
<I>initiation </I>tests of two hero-gods on entrance to the native Hades. 
Indeed, most of the mysteries typified the descent of man into Hell, and his 
return to earth, based on the corn-mother legend of the resurrection of the 
wheat plant.</P><I>
<P>Initiation </I>into the higher branches of mysticism, magic and theosophy has 
been largely written upon The process in regard to these is of course entirely 
symbolical, and is to be taken as implying a preparation for the higher life and 
the regeneration of the soul.</P>

<P>Insufflation :</B> says Eliphas Levi, &quot;is one of the most important 
practices of occult medicine, because it is a perfect sign of the transmission 
of life. To inspire, as a fact, means to breath upon some person or thing, and 
we know already. by the one doctrine of Hermes, that the virtue of things has 
created words, and that there is an exact proportion between ideas and speech, 
which is the first form and verbal realisation of ideas. The breath attracts or 
repels, according, as it is warm or cold. The warm breathing corresponds to 
positive electricity, and the cold breathing to negative electricity. Electrical 
and nervous animals fear the cold breathing, and the experiment may be made upon 
a cat, whose familiarities are important. By fixedly regarding a lion or tiger 
and blowing in their face, they would be so stupefied as to be forced to retreat 
before us. Warm and prolonged <I>insufflation </I>restores the circulation of 
the blood, cures rheumatic and gouty pains, re-establishes the balance of the 
humours, and dispels lassitude. When the operator is sympathetic and good, it 
acts as a universal sedative. Cold <I>insufflation </I>soothes pains occasioned 
by congestions and fluidic accumulations. The two breathings must, therefore, be 
used alternately. observing the polarity of the human organism, and acting in a 
contrary manner upon the poles, which must be treated successfully to an 
opposite magnetism. Thus. to cure an inflamed eye, the one which is not affected 
must be subjected to a warm and gentle <I>insufflation, </I>cold <I>insufflation 
</I>being practised upon the suffering member at the same distance and in the 
same proportion. Magnetic passes have a similar effect to <I>insufflations, 
</I>and are a real breathing by transpiration and radiation of the interior air, 
which is phosphorescent with vital light; slow passes constitute a warm 
breathing which fortifies and raises the spirits; swift passes are a cold 
breathing of dispersive nature, neutralising tendencies to congestion. The warm 
<I>insufflation </I>should be performed transversely. or from below upward, the 
cold <I>insufflation </I>is more effective when directed downward from 
above.&quot;</P>

<P>Ireland :</B> For information regarding ancient <I>Ireland See 
</I>Celts.&quot; Although nominally Christianised, there is little doubt that 
the early medieval Irish retained many relics of their former condition of 
paganism, especially those which possessed a magical tendency. This is made 
clear by the writings of Giraldus Cambrensis, the first account we have of Irish 
manners and customs after the invasion of the country by the Anglo-Normans. His 
description, for example, of the Purgatory of St. Patrick in Lough Derg, Co. 
Donegal, proves that the demonology of the Catholic Church had already fused 
with the animism of Irish native heathnesse. He says:-</P>
<P>&quot;There is a lake in Ulster containing an island divided into two parts. 
In one of these stands a church of especial sanctity, and it is most agreeable 
and delightful, as well as beyond measure glorious for the visitations of angels 
and the multitude of the saints who visibly frequent it. The other part, being 
covered with rugged crags, is reported to be the resort of devils only, and to 
be almost always the theatre on which crowds of evil spirits visibly perform 
their rites. This part of the island contains nine pits, and should any one 
perchance venture to spend the night in one of them (which has been done, we 
know, at times, by some rash men), he is immediately seized by the malignant 
spirits, who so severely torture him during the whole night, inflicting on him 
such unutterable sufferings by fire and water, and other torments of various 
kinds, that when morning comes scarcely any spark of life is found left in his 
wretched body. It is said that any one who has once submitted to these torments 
as a penance imposed upon him, will not afterwards undergo the pains of hell, 
unless he commit some sin of a deeper dye.</P>
<P>&quot;This place is called by the natives the Purgatory of St. Patrick. For 
he, having to argue with a heathen race concerning the torments of hell, 
reserved for the reprobate, and the real nature and eternal duration of the 
future life, in order to impress on the rude minds of the unbelievers a 
mysterious faith in doctrines so new, so strange, so opposed to their 
prejudices, procured by the efficacy of his prayers an exemplification of both 
states even on earth, as a salutary lesson to the stubborn minds of the 
people.&quot;</P>
<P>The ancient Irish believed in the possibility of the transformation of human 
beings into animals, and Giraldus in another narrative of facts purporting to 
have come under his personal notice proves that this belief had lost none of its 
significance with the Irish of the latter half of the twelfth century. The case 
is also interesting as being one of the first recorded examples of lycanthropy 
(q.v.) in the British Isles, and that must be our excuse for quoting it at some 
length.</P>
<P>&quot;About three years before the arrival of Earl John in <I>Ireland, </I>it 
chanced that a priest, who was journeying from Ulster towards Meath, was 
benighted in a certain wood on the borders of Meath. While, in company with only 
a young lad, he was watching by a fire which he had kindled under the branches 
of a spreading tree, lo l a wolf came up to them, and immediately addressed them 
to this effect : ' Rest secure, and be not afraid, for there is no reason you 
should fear, where no fear is ' The travellers being struck with astonishment 
and alarm, the wolf added some orthodox words referring to God. The priest then 
implored him, and adjured him by Almighty God and faith in the Trinity, not to 
hurt them, but to inform them what creature it was in the shape of a beast 
uttered human words. The wolf, after giving catholic replies to all questions, 
added at last: 'There are two of us, a man and a woman, natives of Ossory, who, 
through the curse of Natalis, saint and abbot, are compelled every seven years 
to put off the human form, and depart from the dwellings of men. Quitting 
entirely the human form, we assume that of wolves. At the end of the seven 
years, if they chance to survive, two others being substituted in their places, 
they return to their country and their former shape. And now, she who is my 
partner in this visitation lies dangerously sick not far from hence, and, as she 
is at the point of death, I beseech you, inspired by divine-charity, to give her 
the consolations of your priestly office.'</P>
<P>&quot;At this wood the priest followed the wolf trembling, as he led the way 
to a tree at no great distance, in the hollow of which he beheld a she-wolf, who 
under that shape was pouring forth human sighs and groans. On seeing the priest, 
having saluted him with human courtesy, she gave thanks to God, who in this 
extremity had vouchsafed to visit her with such consolation. She then received 
from the priest all the rites of the church duly performed, as far as the last 
communion. This also she importunately demanded, earnestly supplicating him to 
complete his good offices by giving her the viaticum. The priest stoutly 
asserting that he was not provided with it, the he-wolf who had withdrawn to a 
short distance, came back and pointed out a small missal-book, containing some 
consecrated wafers, which the priest carried on his journey, suspended from his 
neck, under his garment, after the fashion of the country. He then intreated him 
not to deny them the gift of God, and the aid destined for them by Divine 
Providence; and, to remove all doubt, using his claw for a hand, he tore off the 
skin of the she-wolf from the head down to the navel, folding it back. Thus she 
immediately presented the form of an old woman. The priest, seeing this, and 
compelled by his fear more than his reason, gave the communion; the recipient 
having earnestly implored it, and devoutly partaking of it. Immediately 
afterwards the he-wolf rolled back the skin and fitted it to its original 
form.</P>
<P>&quot;These rites having been duly, rather than rightly performed, the 
he-wolf gave them his company during the whole night at their little fire, 
behaving more like a man than a beast. When morning came, he led them out of the 
wood, and, leaving the priest to pursue his journey pointed out to him the 
direct road for a long distance. At his departure, he also gave him many thanks 
for the benefit he had conferred, promising him still greater returns of 
gratitude, if the Lord should call him back from his present exile, two parts of 
which he had already completed.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It chanced, about two years afterwards, that I was passing through 
Meath, at the time when the bishop of that land had convoked a synod, having 
also invited the assistance of the neighbouring bishops and abbots, in order to 
have their joint counsels on what was to be done in the affair which had come to 
his knowledge by the priest's confession. The bishop, hearing that I was passing 
through those parts, sent me a message by two of his clerks, requesting me, if 
possible, to be personally present when a matter of so much importance was under 
consideration; but if I could not attend he begged me at least to signify my 
opinion in writing. The clerks detailed to me all the circumstances, which 
indeed I had heard before from other persons; and, as I was prevented by urgent 
business from being present at the synod, I made up for my absence by giving 
them the benefit of my advice in a letter. The bishop and synod, yielding to it, 
ordered the priest to appear before the pope with letters from them, setting 
forth what had occurred, with the priest's concession, to which instrument the 
bishops and abbots who were present at the synod affixed their seals.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;In our own time we have seen persons who, by magical arts, turned any 
substance about them into fat pigs, as they appeared (but they were always red), 
and sold them in the markets. However, they disappeared as soon as they crossed 
any water, returning to their real nature and with whatever care they were kept, 
their assumed form did not last beyond three days. It has also been a frequent 
complaint, from old times as well as in the present, that certain hags in Wales, 
as well as in Ireland and Scotland changed themselves into the shape of hares, 
that, sucking teats under this counterfeit form, they might stealthily rob other 
people's milk.&quot;</P>
<P>In Anglo-Norman times sorcery was widely practised but notices are scarce. It 
is only by fugitive passages in the works of English writers who constantly 
animadvert against the superstitious nature and practices of the Irish that we 
glean any information concerning the occult history of the country. The great 
<I>cause celebre </I>of the Lady Alice Kyteler (q.v.) shook the entire 
Anglo-Norman colony during several successive years in the first half of the 
fourteenth century. The party of the Bishop of Ossory the relentless opponent of 
the Lady Alice, boasted that by her prosecution they had rid <I>Ireland </I>of a 
nest of sorcerers, but there is reason to believe that <I>Ireland </I>could have 
furnished numerous similar instances of black magic had the actors in them been 
of similar rank to the ill-fated lady-that is of sufficient importance in the 
eyes of chroniclers.</P>
<P>In this connection a work on <I>Irish Witchcraft and Demonology </I>by Mr. 
St. John D. Seymour <B>(1913), </B>is of striking and pregnant interest. We do 
not gather from it that Mr. Seymour had any previous general knowledge of the 
subject he handles before writing this book, and he appears to take it for 
granted that witchcraft in <I>Ireland </I>is purely an alien system, imported 
into the island by the Anglo-Normans and Scottish immigrants to the north. This 
undoubtedly is the case so far as the districts of the Pale and of Ulster are 
concerned, but surely it cannot be applied to the Celtic districts of 
<I>Ireland. </I>Regarding these Mr. Seymour is silent, but it will occur to most 
readers that the analogy of Celtic Scotland, which abounded in witches and 
witch-customs, is powerful evidence that a system similar to that in vogue in 
the Highlands obtained in the aboriginal districts of <I>Ireland. </I>Early 
Irish works contain numerous references to sorcery, and practices are chronicled 
in them which bear a close resemblance to those of the shamans and medicine-men 
of savage tribes all over the world. Animal transformation, one of the most 
common feats of the witch, is alluded to again and again in the ancient Irish 
cycles, and there are few heroes in Hibernian legend who have not a fair stock 
of working magic at their finger-ends. Wonder-working druids, too, abound. Mr. 
Seymour will have it that In Celtic <I>Ireland </I>dealings with the unseen were 
not regarded with such abhorrence, and indeed had the sanction of custom and 
antiquity.&quot; He also states that &quot; the Celtic element had its own 
superstitious beliefs, but these never developed in this direction&quot; (the 
direction of Witchcraft). This is very difficult to believe. The lack of records 
of such a system is no criterion that it never existed, and we have not the 
least hesitation in saying that a thorough examination of the subject would 
prove that a veritable system of witchcraft obtained in Celtic <I>Ireland </I>as 
elsewhere, although it may not have been of &quot;Celtic&quot; origin.</P>
<P>Be that as it may, Mr. Seymour's book is most interesting as dealing with 
those Anglo-Norman and Scottish portions of <I>Ireland </I>where the belief in 
witchcraft followed the lines of those in vogue in the mother-countries of the 
immigrant populations. He sketches the <I>cause celebre </I>of the Kyteler case 
(q.v.), touches on the circumstances connected with the Earl of Desmond and 
notes the case of the Irish prophetess who insisted upon warning the ill-fated 
James I. of Scotland on the night of his assassination at Perth. It is not 
stated by the ancient chronicler, quoted by Mr. Seymour, from what part of 
<I>Ireland </I>the witch in question emanated-for a witch she undoubtedly was as 
she possessed a familiar spirit, Huthart, whom she alleged had made her 
cognisant of the coming catastrophe. Mr. Seymour does not seem to be aware of 
the history of this spirit. He is the Teutonic <I>Hudekin </I>(q.v.) or 
<I>Hildekin, </I>the wearer of the hood, sometimes also alluded to as 
<I>Heckdekin, </I>well known throughout Germany and Flanders as a species of 
house-spirit or brownie. Trithemius alludes to him as a &quot;spirit known to 
the Saxons who attached himself to the Bishop of Hildesheim&quot; and we find 
him cropping up here and there in occult history. From this circumstance it 
might with justice be inferred that the witch in question came from some part of 
<I>Ireland </I>which had been settled by Teutonic immigrants, and more probably 
from Ulster, but the data is insufficient to permit us to conclude this 
definitely.</P>
<P>From the most scanty materials, Mr. Seymour has compiled a book of 
outstanding interest. He passes in review the witchcraft trials of the XVI. 
century, the burning of Adam Dubh, of the Leinster trial of O&rsquo;Toole and 
College Green in <B>1327 </B>for heresy, and the passing of the statute against 
witchcraft in <I>Ireland </I>in <B>1586</B>. The prevalence of witchcraft in 
<I>Ireland </I>during the sixteenth century is proved by him to have been very 
great indeed, but a number of the authorities he cites, as to the existence of 
sorcerers in the Green Isle, almost certainly refer to the more Celtic portions 
of it; for example Rich and Stanihurst. He has an excellent note upon the 
enchantments of the Earl of Desmond who demonstrated to his young and beautiful 
wife the possibilities of animal transformation by changing himself into a bird, 
a hag, a vulture, and a gigantic serpent. Human relations with the Devil are 
dwelt upon at length by Mr. Seymour in a racy chapter, and we are told how he 
was cheated by a doctor of divinity and raised on occasion by certain sorcerers. 
Florence Newton, the witch of Youghal claims an entire chapter to herself, and 
worthily, for her case is one of the most absorbing in the history of 
witchcraft. At any rate, whatever her occult powers, she splendidly succeeded in 
setting a whole community by the ears. Ghostly doings and apparitions, fairy 
possession, and dealings with the &lsquo;wee folk' are also included in the 
volume; and Mr. Seymour has not confined himself to <I>Ireland, </I>but has 
followed one of his countrywomen to America, where he shows how she gave 
congenial employment to the fanatic Cotton Mather (q.v.). Witchcraft notices of 
the seventeenth century in Antrim and Island Magee comprise the eighth chapter; 
and the ninth and last bring down the affairs of sorcery in <I>Ireland </I>from 
the year <B>1807</B> to the present day. The last notice is that of a trial for 
murder in <B>1911, </B>when a wretched woman was tried for killing another-an 
old-age pensioner-in a fit of insanity. A witness deposed that he met the 
accused on the road on the morning of the crime holding a statue or figure in 
her hand, and repeating three times &quot;I have the old witch killed. I got 
power from the Blessed Virgin to kill her.&quot; It appears that the witch 
quoted in question threatened to plague the murderess with rats and mice; a 
single rodent had evidently penetrated to her abode, and was followed by the 
bright vision of a lady who told the accused that she was in danger, and further 
informed her that if she received the old pensioner's pension-book without 
taking off her clothes and cleaning them and putting out her bed and cleaning up 
the house, she would receive dirt for ever and rats and mice.&quot; This is not 
an isolated case, and shows how hard such superstitions die in the more remote 
portions of civilised countries.</P>
<P>We have reviewed Mr. Seymour's book at some length because it represents 
practically all that exists on the subject in question. But it would be 
interesting to see him further his researches by an examination into such of the 
native Irish records as exist. Such a course would most probably result in the 
rescue of a considerable amount of detail which would enable him to complete the 
occult history of his country.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Iron :</B> Its occult virtues are thus described by Pliny, according to 
Holland .-&quot; As touching the use of Yron and steele in Physicke, it serveth 
otherwise than for to launce, cut, and dismember withal for take the knife or 
dagger, an make an ymaginerie circle two or three times round with the point 
thereof upon a young child or an elder bodie. and then goe round withall about 
the partie as often, it is a singular preservative against all poysons, 
sorceries, or enchantments. Also to take any yron naile Out of the coffin or 
sepulchre wherein man or woman lieth buried, and to sticke the same fast to the 
lintle or side post of a dore, leading either to the house or bed-chamber where 
any dooth lie who is haunted with Spirits in the night, lie or she shall be 
delivered and secured from such phanasticall illusions. Moreover, it is said, 
that if one be lightly pricked with the point of sword or dagger, which hath 
been the death of a man, it is an excellent remedy aga'nst the pains of sides or 
breast, which come with sudden prickes or stitches.&quot;</P>
<P>In certain parts of Scotland and the North of Ireland, there is a belief in 
the potency of iron tor warding off the attacks of fairies. An iron poker, laid 
across a cradle, will, it is believed. keep the fairies away until the child is 
baptised. The Rev. John G. Campbell in his <I>Superstitions of the Scottish 
Highlands </I>relates how when a child, he and another boy were believed to be 
protected from a fairy which had been seen at a certain spot by the possession, 
the one of a knife, and the other of a nail. This was at Appin in 
Argylishire.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Irving's Church, Speaking with Tongues in :</B> In <B>1831</B> an outbreak of 
speaking with tongues occurred in the congregation of Edward Irving, in London. 
For several years Irving had waited for such a visitation, and had instituted 
special early-morning services for the purpose of hastening it. At length. in 
July, <B>1831</B>, the&quot; visitation&quot; came, first one and then another 
of the congregation speaking with &quot;tongues&quot; and with prophetic 
utterance. <I>Irving </I>himself was not at first entirely disposed to accept 
the utterances as of divine origin. But the undoubted good faith and 
irreproachable doctrine of his flock reassured him. Robert Baxter,. who was 
absent at the commencement of the outbreak, but who was himself influenced to 
prophesy at a later date, has left an account of his experiences. The phenomena 
did not greatly differ from that of similar outbreaks. The inspired speakers 
were often attended by physical symptoms, such as convulsions, and they spoke in 
loud, somewhat unnatural tones. Baxter declares that he spoke sentences in 
Latin, French, and unknown languages. At length, however, evil spirits began to 
appear in the company. some of the congregation admitting that they had been 
possessed by false spirits. The outbreak seen afterwards died out.</P>

<P>Isaac of Holland :</B> Very little is known about the life of this alchemist, 
but he is commonly supposed to have lived and worked early in the fifteenth 
century, the principal reason for assigning his career to that period being that 
in his writings he refers to Geber, Dastin, Morien and Arnold de Villanova, but 
not to more modern authorities while again. he appears to have been acquainted 
with various chymical processes discovered towards the close of the fourteenth 
century. and hence it may reasonably be deduced that he did not live anterior to 
that time. According to tradition <I>Isaac </I>worked along with his son, whose 
name is not recorded, and the pair are usually regarded as having been the first 
men to exploit chymistry in the Netherlands. They are said to have been 
particularly skilful in the manufacture of enamels and artificial gems, and it 
is noteworthy that no less distinguished an alchemist than Paracelsus attached 
value to the Dutchmen's researches while these are also mentioned with honour by 
the seventeenth century English scientist, Robert Boyle.</P><I>
<P>Isaac </I>compiled two scientific treatises, the one entitled <I>De Triptici 
Ordine Elixiris et Lapidis Theoria, </I>and the other <I>Opera Mineralia Joannis 
Isaaci Hollandi, sive de Lapide PIiilosophico, </I>and both were published at 
the beginning of the seventeenth century The more important of the two is the 
last-named, wherein the author sets forth his ideas on the exalting of base 
metals into <I>Sot </I>and <I>Lone, </I>and shows by the aid of illustrations 
exactly what kind of vessels should be used for this purpose.</P>

<P>Italy :</B> (For Ancient <I>Italy see </I><STRONG>Rome.</STRONG>) Magic and 
sorcery in medieval <I>Italy </I>seem strangely enough to have centred round 
many great personalities of the church, and even several popes have been 
included by the historians of occult science in the ranks of Italian sorcerers 
and alchemists. There appears to have been some sort of tradition. the origin of 
which is by no means clear, that the popes had been given over to the practice 
of magic ever since the tenth century, and it was alleged that Silvester II. 
confessed to this charge on his death-bed. Levi States that Honorius III., who 
preached the Crusades, was an abominable necromancer, and author of a 
<I>grimoire </I>or book by which spirits were evoked, the use of which is 
reserved exclusively to the priesthood. Platina, quoting from Martinus Polonus, 
states that Silvester, who was a proficient mathematician and versed in the 
<I>Kabala </I>on one occasion evoked Satan himself and obtained his assistance 
to gain the pontifical crown. Furthermore he stipulated as the price of selling 
his soul to the Devil that he should not die except at Jerusalem, to which place 
lie inwardly determined he would never betake himself. He duly became Pope, but 
on one occasion whilst celebrating mass in a certain church at Rome, he felt 
extremely ill, and suddenly remembered that he was officiating in a chapel 
dedicated to the Holy Cross of Jerusalem. He had a bed set up in the chapel, to 
which he summoned the cardinals, and confessed that he had held communication 
with the powers of evil. He further arranged that when dead his body should be 
placed upon a car of green wood, and should be drawn by two horses, one black 
and the other white; that they should be started on their course, but neither 
led nor driven, and that where they halted there his remains should be entombed. 
The conveyance stopped in front of the Lateran, and at this juncture most 
terrible noises proceeded from it, which led the bystanders to suppose that the 
soul of Silvester had been seized upon by Satan in virtue of their agreement. 
There is no doubt whatsoever that must of these legends concerning papal 
necromancers are absolute inventions and can be traced through Platina and 
Polonus to Galfridus and Gervaise, the necromancer, whom Naude has rightly 
termed &quot; the greatest forger of fables, and the most notorious liar that 
ever took pea in hand ! &quot; On a par with such stories is that of Pope Joan, 
who for several years sat on the papal throne although a woman, and who was 
supposed to be one of the blackest sorceresses of all time. To her many magic 
books are attributed. Levi has an interesting passage in his <I>History of 
Magic, </I>in which he states that certain engravings in a Life of this female 
pope, purporting to represent her, are nothing else than ancient tarots 
representing Isis crowned with a tiara. &quot; It is well-known,&quot; he says, 
&quot;that the hieroglyphic figure on the second tarot card is still called 'The 
Female Pope,' being a woman wearing a tiara, on which are the points of the 
crescent moon, or the horns of Isis.&quot; It is much more possible that the 
author of the <I>grimoire </I>in question was Honorius II., the anti-pope, or 
perhaps another Honorius who is described as the son of Euclid and master of the 
Thebans. But all Italian necromancers and magicians were by no means 
churchmen-indeed medieval leafy was hardly a place for the magically inclined, 
so stringent were the laws of the church against the Black Art. Astrology, 
however, flourished to some extent, and its practitioners do not appear to have 
been unduly persecuted. A Florentine astrologer, named Basil, who flourished at 
the beginning of the fifteenth century, obtained some repute for successful 
predictions; and is said to have foretold to Cosmo de Medic that he would attain 
exalted dignity, as the same planets had been in ascendency at the hour of his 
birth, as in that of the Emperor Charles V. Many remarkable predictions were 
made by Antiochus Tibertus of Romagna, who was for some time councillor to 
Pandolpho de Maletesta, Prince of Rimini. He foretold to his friend, Guido de 
Bogni, the celebrated soldier, that he was unjustly suspected by his best 
friend, and would forfeit his life through suspicion. Of himself he predicted 
that he would die on the scaffold, and of the Prince of Rimini, his patron, that 
he would die a beggar in the hospital for the poor at Bologna. It is stated that 
the prophecies came true in every detail.</P>
<P>Although the notices of sorcery in medieval times are few and far between in 
Italian history, there is reason to suspect that although magic was not 
outwardly practised, it lurked hidden in by-paths and out-of-the-way places. We 
have an excellent portrait of the medieval Italian magician in those popular 
myths regarding Virgil the Enchanter. The fame of Virgil the Poet had waxed so 
great in ancient <I>Italy, </I>that in due course of time his name was 
synonymous with fame itself. From that it is a short step to the attribution of 
supernatural power, and Virgil the Roman poet became in the popular mind the 
medieval Enchanter. His myth is symptomatic of magic in medieval Italy as a 
whole, and it may therefore be given here at some length.</P>
<P>When the popular myth of Virgil the Enchanter first grew into repute is 
uncertain, but probably the earliest faint conception arose about the beginning 
of the tenth century, and each succeeding generation embroidered upon it some 
fantastic impossibility. Soon, in the South of Italy-for the necromancer's fame 
was of southern origin-there floated dim, mysterious legends of the enchantments 
which he had wrought. Thus he fashioned a brazen fly, and planted it on the gate 
of fair Parthenope to free the city from the inroads of the insects of 
Beelzebub. On a Neapolitan hill he built a statue of brass, and placed in its 
mouth a trumpet; and lo I when the north wind blew there came from that trumpet 
so terrible a roar that it drove back into the sea the noxious blasts of 
Vulcan's forges, which, even to this day, seethe and hiss near the city of 
Puossola. At one of the gates of Naples he raised two statues of stone, and 
gifted them respectively with the power of blighting or blessing the strangers 
who, on entering the city, passed by one or the other of them. He constructed 
three public baths for the removal of every disease which afflicts the human 
frame, but the physicians, in a wholesome dread of losing their patients and 
their fees, caused them to be destroyed. Other wonders he wrought, which in time 
assumed a connected form, and were woven into a life of the enchanter, first 
printed in French about <B>1490-1520. </B>A still fuller history appeared in 
English, the well-known &quot; Life of Virgilius,&quot; about <B>1508, 
</B>printed by Hans Doesborcke at Antwerp. It sets forth with tolerable 
clearness the popular type of the medieval magician, and will be our guide in 
the following biographical sketch.</P>
<P>Virgil was the son of a wealthy senator of Rome, wealthy and powerful enough 
to carry on war with the Roman Emperor. As his birth was heralded by 
extraordinary portents, it is no marvel that even in childhood he showed himself 
endowed with extraordinary mental powers. and his father having the sagacity to 
discern in him an embryo necromancer, sent him, while still very young, to study 
at the University of Toledo, where the &quot;art of magick&quot; was taught with 
extraordinary success.</P>
<P>&quot;There he studied diligently, for he was of great understanding, and 
speedily acquired a profound insight into the great Shemaia of the Chaldean 
lore. But this insight was due, not so much to nocturnal vigils over abstruse 
books, as to the help he received from a very valuable familiar. And this was 
the curious fashion in which he was introduced to the said familiar</P>
<P>&quot;Upon a tyme the scholers at Tolenten hadde lycence to goo to playc and 
sporte them in the fyldes after the usuance of the olde tyme; and there was also 
Virgilius therby also walkynge among the hylles all about. It fortuned he spyed 
a great hole in the syde of a great hyll, wherein he went to depe that he culde 
not see no more lyght, and than he went a lytell ferther therein, and then he 
sawe soon lyght agayne, and than wente he fourth streyghte. And within a lyteli 
wyle after he harde a voice that called, 'Virgilius, Virgilius,' and he loked 
aboute, and he colde nat see nobodye. Than Virgilius spake, and asked, 'Who 
calleth me?' Than harde he the voyce agayne, but he sawe nobodye. Than sayd he, 
'Virgilius, see ye not that lytell bourde lyinge byside you there, marked with 
that worde ?' Than answered Virgilius, I see that borde well enough.' The voyce 
said, 'Deo away that bourde, and lette me out theratte.'</P>
<P>&quot;&rsquo;Than answered Virgilius to the voyce that was under the lytell 
bourde, and sayd, ' Who art thou that talkest me so ?' Than answered the devyll, 
'I am a devyll conjured out of the body of a certeyne man, and banysshed here 
tyll the daye of jugement, without that I be delyvered by the handes of men. 
Thus, Virgilius, I pray thee delyver me out of this payn, and I shall show unto 
thee many bokes of nygromancy, and how thou shalt cum by it lytly, and shalte 
knowe the practyse therein, that no man in the science of nygromancy shall 
(sur)pass thee; and, moreover, I shall showe arid informe thee so that thou 
shalt have all thy desyre, whereby methinke it is a great gyfte for so lytell a 
donyge, for ye may also thus all your poor frendys helpen, and make ryghte your 
ennemycs unmighty.'</P>
<P>&quot;Thorough that great promise was Virgilius tempted. He badde the fynd 
showe the bokes to hym, that he myght have and occupy them at his wyll. And so 
the fynd showed hym, and then Virgilius pulled open a bourde, and there was a 
lytell hole, and thereat wrange the devyll out lyke a yeel, and cam and stode 
before Virgilius lyke a bigge man.</P>
<P>&quot;&rsquo;Thereof Virgilius was astonied, and merveyled greately thereof, 
tliat so great a man myght com out at so lytell a hole !</P>
<P>&quot;'Then sayd Virgilius, ' Shulde ye well passe into the hole that ye cam 
out of? I 'Yes, I shall well,' sayd the devyll. 'I holde the beste pledge that I 
have, ye shall not do it.' ' Well,' sayd the devyll, ' thereto I consente.'</P>
<P>And then the devyll wrange hymself into the lytell hole agen, and as he was 
therein, Virgilius kyvered the hole agen with the bourde close, and so was the 
devyll begyled, and myght not there come out agen, but there abydeth shutte 
styli therein. Than called the devyll dredefully (drearily) to Virgilius, and 
sayd, 'What have ye done?' Virgilius answered, 'Abyde there styli to your day 
apoynted.' And fro thensforth abydeth he there.'</P>
<P>Virgil's father died soon after this event, and his estates being seized by 
his former colleagues, his widow sunk into extreme poverty. Virgil accordingly 
gathered together the wealth he had amassed by the exercise of his magical 
skill, and set out for Rome, to replace his mother in a position proper to her 
rank. At Toledo, however, he was a famous student; at Rome he was a despised 
scholar, and when he besought the Emperor to execute justice and restore to him 
his estate, that potentate - ignorant of the magician's power-simply replied, 
'Methinketh that the land is well divided to them that have it, for they may 
help you in their need; what needeth you for to care for the disheriting of one 
school-master Bid him take heed, and look to his schools, for he hath no right 
to any land here about the city of Rome.'</P>
<P>Four years passed, and only such replies as this were vouchsafed to Virgil's 
frequent appeals for justice. Growing at length a-weary of the delay, he 
resolved to exercise his wondrous powers in his own behalf. When the 
harvest-time came, he accordingly shrouded the whole of his rightful inheritance 
with a vapour so dense that the new proprietors were unable to approach it, and 
under its cover his men gathered in the entire crop with perfect security. This 
done; the mist disappeared. Then a great indignation possessed the souls of his 
enemies, and they assembled their swordsmen, and marched against him to take off 
his head. Such was their power that the Emperor for fear fled out of Rome, ' for 
they were twelve senators that had all the world under them; and if Virgilius 
had had right, he had been one of the twelve, but they had disinherited him and 
his mother.' When they drew near, Virgil once more baffled their designs by 
encircling his patrimony with a rampart of cloud and shadow.</P>
<P>The Emperor, with surprising inconsistency, now coalesced with the senators 
against Virgil-whose magical powers he probably feared far more than the rude 
force of the senatorial magnates-and made war against him. But who can prevail 
against the arts of necromancy ? Emperor and senators were beaten, and from that 
moment Virgil, with marvellous generosity, became the faithful friend and 
powerful supporter of his soverign </P>
<P>It may not generally be known that Virgil, besides being the saviour of Rome, 
was the founder of Naples. This feat had its origin, like so many other great 
actions, in the power of love.</P>
<P>Virgil's imagination had been fired by the reports that reached him of the 
surpassing loveliness of the Sultan's daughter. Now the Sultan lived at Babylon 
(that is, at Cairo-the Babylon of the medieval romancers), and the distance 
might have daunted a less ardent lover and less potent magician. But Virgil's 
necromantic skill was equal to a bridge in the air-where other glowing spirits 
have often raised fair castles I-and passing over it, he found his way into the 
Sultan's palace,-into the Princess's chamber,-and speedily overcoming her 
natural modesty, bore her back with him to his Italian bower of pleasaunce. 
There having enjoyed their fill of love and pleasure, he restored to her bed in 
her father's palace. Meanwhile, her absence had been noted, but she was soon 
discovered on her return, and the Sultan repairing to her chamber, interrogated 
her respecting her disappearance. He found that she knew not who it was that had 
carried her off, nor whither she had been carried.</P>
<P>When Virgil restored the lady on the following night, she took back with her, 
by her father's instructions, some of the fruit plucked from the enchanter's 
garden; and from its quality the Sultan guessed that she had been carried to a 
southern land &quot; on the side of France.&quot; These nocturnal journeys being 
several times repeated, and the Sultan's curiosity growing ungovernable, he 
persuaded his daughter to give her lover a sleeping-draught. The deceived 
magician was then captured in the Babylonian palace, and flung into prison, and 
it was decreed that both he and his mistress should be punished for their love 
by death at the stake.</P>
<P>Necromancers, however, are not so easily outwitted. As soon as Virgil was 
apprized of the fate intended for him, he made, by force of his spells, the 
Sultan and all his lords believe that the great river of Babylon-the might 
Nilus-was overflowing in the midst of them, and that they swam and lay and 
sprang like geese; and so they took up Virgilius and the Princess, tore them 
from their prison, and placed them upon the aerial bridge. And when they were 
thus out of danger, he delivered the Sultan from the river, and all the lords; 
and lo, when they recovered their humanity, they beheld the enchanter bearing 
the beautiful Princess across the Mediterranean; and they marvelled much, and 
felt that they could not hope to prevail against his supernatural power.</P>
<P>And in this manner did Virgilius convey the Sultan's daughter over the sea to 
Rome. And he was highly enamoured of her beauty. &quot;Then he thought in his 
mind how he might marry her &quot;-apparently forgetting that he was already 
married-&quot; and thought in his mind to found in the midst of the sea a fair 
town with great lands belonging to it; and so he did by his cunning, and called 
it Naples: and the foundation of it was of eggs. And in that town of Naples he 
made a tower with four corners and on the top he set an apple upon an iron yard, 
and no man could pull away that apple without he brake it; and through that iron 
set he a bottle, and on that bottle set he an egg; and he hanged the apple by 
the stalk upon a chain, and so hangeth it still. And when the egg stirreth, so 
should the town of Naples quake; and when the egg brake. then should the town 
sink. When he had made an end, he let call it Naples.&quot;</P>
<P>After accomplishing so much for his Babylonian beauty, Virgil did not marry 
her, but endowing her with the town of Naples and its lands, gave her in 
marriage to a certain grandee of Spain. Having thus disposed of her and her 
children, the enchanter returned to Rome, collected all his treasures, and 
removed them to the city he had founded, where he resided for some years, and 
established a school which speedily became of illustrious renown. Here he lost 
his wife, by whom he had had no issue; built baths and bridges, and wrought the 
most extraordinary miracles, So passed an uncounted number of years, and Virgil 
at length abandoned Naples for ever, and retired to Rome.</P>
<P>Outside the walls of the Imperial City he built a goodly town, that had but 
one gate, and was so fenced round with water as to bar any one from approaching 
it. And the entry of its one gate was made&quot; with twenty-four iron flails, 
and on each side was there twelve men smiting with the flails, never ceasing, 
the one after the other ; and no man might come in without the flails stood 
still, but he was slain. And these flails ',ere made with such a gin 
(contrivance) that Virgilius stopped them when he list to enter in thereat, but 
no man else could find the way. And in this castle put Virgilius part of his 
treasure privily; and, when this was done, he imagined in his mind by what means 
he might make himself young again, because he thought to live longer many years, 
to do many wonders and marvellous things. And upon a time went Virgilius to the 
Emperor, and asked him of licence (of absence) by the space of three weeks. But 
the Emperor in no wise would grant it unto him for he would have Virgilius at 
all times by him.&quot;</P><I>
<P>Spiritualism.-We </I>have perhaps our first indication of the rise and spread 
of spiritualism in <I>Italy </I>in the modern acceptance of the term in an 
article published in the <I>Civitta Catholica </I>the well-known Roman organ, 
entitled &quot;Modern Necromancy.&quot; The conclusions of the article 
were:-</P>
<P>&quot;<B>1</B>st. Some of the phenomena may be attributed to imposture, 
hallucinations, and exaggerations in the reports of those who describe it, but 
there is a foundation of reality in the general sum of the reports which cannot 
have originated in pure invention or he wholly discredited without ignoring the 
value of universal testimony.</P>
<P>&quot;<B>2</B>nd. The bulk of the theories offered in explanation of the 
proven facts, only cover a certain percentage of those facts, but utterly fail 
to account for the balance.</P>
<P>&quot;<B>3</B>rd. Allowing for all that can be filtered away on mere human 
hypotheses, there are still a large class of phenomena appealing to every sense 
which cannot be accounted for by any known natural laws, and which seem to 
manifest the action of intelligent beings.&quot;</P>
<P>D. D. Home last visited the principal cities of <I>Italy </I>in <B>1852</B>, 
and had been so active in his propaganda that numerous circles were formed after 
his departure. Violent journalistic controversies arose out of the foundation of 
these societies. with the result that public interest was so aroused that it 
could only be satisfied with the publication of a paper issued from Geneva, and 
edited by Dr Pietro Suth and Signor B. E. Manieri entitled <I>Il amore del Vera. 
</I>In the journal accounts of the spiritual movements in the various countries 
of Europe, and America, were published although the Church and press levelled 
the anathemas against the journal. In the spring of <B>1863</B> a society was 
proved at Palermo entitled Il Societa Spiritual di Palermo, which had for 
president Signor J. V. Paleolozo, and for members men of the stamp of Paolo 
Morelle, professor of Latin and Philosophy.</P>
<P>It was about the autumn of <B>1864</B> that lectures were first given on 
Spiritualistic subjects in Italy. They were started in Leghorn and Messina, and 
though of a very mixed character, and often partaking largely of the lecturer's 
peculiar idiosyncrasies on religious subjects, they served to draw attention to 
the upheaval of thought going on in all directions, in connection with the 
revelations from the Spirit world. It could not be expected that a movement so 
startling and unprecedented as that which opened up a direct communication 
between the natural and the Spirit worlds could gain ground in public acceptance 
without waking up all the latent elements of enthusiasm, fanaticism, and 
bigotry, which prevailed in the Italian as in every other community.</P>
<P>In the year <B>1870</B>, there had been over a hundred different societies 
formed, with varying success, in different parts of <I>Italy. </I>Two of the 
most prominent flourishing at that date were conducted in Naples, and according 
to the French journal, the <I>Revue Spirite </I>represented the two opposing 
schools which have prevailed in Continental Spiritualism, namely, the 
&quot;Reincarnationists&quot; whom we have elsewhere classified as &quot; 
Spiritists &quot; and the &quot; Immortalists,&quot; or those known in America 
and England merely as &quot;Spiritualists.&quot; <I>(See 
</I><STRONG>France.</STRONG>)</P>
<P>About <B>1868</B>, an immense impulse was communicated to the cause of 
Spiritualism-at least in the higher strata of Italian Society-by the visit of 
Mr. and Mrs. Guppy to Naples, at which place they took up their residence for 
two or three years. Mrs. Guppy- nee Miss Nichol - of London,</P>
<P>was renowned throughout Europe for her marvellous powers as a &quot; Physical 
force Medium&quot; and as Mr. Guppy's wealth and social standing enabled him to 
place his gifted wife's services at the command of the distinguished visitors 
who crowded his salons, it soon became a matter of notoriety that the highest 
magnates of the land, including King Victor Emmanuel and many of his nearest 
friends and counsellors, had yielded conviction to the truth of the astounding 
phenomena exhibited through Mrs. Guppy's Mediumship.</P>
<P>It was about the year <B>1863</B>, that Spiritualism began to enjoy the 
advantage of fair and honourable representation in the columns of a new paper 
entitled, the <I>Annali dello Spiritisno, </I>or &quot; Annals of 
Spiritualism.&quot; This excellent journal was commenced at Turin, and published 
by Signor Niceforo Filalete, with all the liberality, energy, and talent worthy 
alike of the subject and its editor.</P>
<P>From the columns of the <I>Annali </I>we learn that a Venetian Society of 
Spiritualists, named </P>
<P>&quot;Atea&quot; elected General Giuseppe Garibaldi their honorary president, 
and received the following reply by telegraph from the distinguished hero, the 
liberator of <I>Italy: </I>&quot; I gratefully accept the presidency of the 
Society Atea. Caprera, <B>23</B>rd September.&quot;</P>
<P>The same issue of the <I>Annali </I>contains a verbatim report of a&quot; 
grand discourse, given at Florence, by a distinguished literary gentleman, 
Signor Sebastiano Fenzi, in which the listeners were considerably astonished by 
a rehearsal of the many illustrious names of those who openly avowed their faith 
in Spiritualism.</P>
<P>The years <B>1863</B>-<B>4</B> appear to have been rich in Spiritualistic 
efforts. Besides a large number of minor associations, the existence of which 
was recorded from time to time the early numbers of the <I>Annali </I>and 
<I>Revue Spirite, </I>a society which continued for a long time to exert a 
marked influence in promoting the study of occult forces and phenomena, was 
formed about this time in Florence, under the title of The Magnetic Society of 
Florence. The members of this association were withbut exception persons 
remarkable for literary and scientific attainments, or those of high influential 
position in society.</P>
<P>About this time Mr. Seymour Kirkup, a name familiar to the early initiators 
of Spiritualism, resided in Florence, and communicated many records of spiritual 
phenomena. to the <I>London </I>Spiritual <I>Magazine. </I>Nearly ten years 
after the establishment of the Magnetic Society of Florence, Baron Guitern de 
Bozzi, an eminent occultist, founded the Pneumatological Psychological Academy 
of Florence, but upon his demise it was discontinued.</P><I>
<P>Modern Sorcery.-In </I>his <I>Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches of Italy, 
</I>the late Charles Godfrey Leland gives a valuable account of the life and 
practice of the modern Italian <I>strega </I>or witch. He says: &quot; In most 
cases she comes of a family in which her calling or art has been practised for 
many generations. I have no doubt that there are instances in which the ancestry 
remounts to medieval, Roman, or it may be Etruscan times. The result has 
naturally been the accumulation in such families of much tradition. But in 
Northern <I>Italy, </I>as its literature indicates, though there has been some 
slight gathering of fairy tales and popular superstitions by scholars, there has 
never existed the least interest as regarded the strange lore of the witches, 
nor any suspicion that it embraced an incredible quantity of old Roman minor 
myths and legends, such as Ovid has recorded, but of which much escaped him and 
all other Latin writers Even yet there are old people in the Romagna of the 
North who know the Etruscan names of the Twelve Gods, and invocations to 
Bacchus, Jupiter, and Venus, Mercury, and the Lares or ancestral spirits, and in 
the cities are women who prepare strange amulets, over which they mutter spells, 
all known in the old Roman time and who can astonish even the learned by their 
legends of Latin gods, mingled with lore which may be found in Cato or 
Theocritus. With one of these I became intimately acquainted in <B>1886</B>, and 
have ever since employed her specially to collect among her sisters of the 
hidden Spell in many places all the traditions of the olden times known to them. 
It is true that I have drawn from other sources but this woman by long practice 
has perfectly learned what few understand, or just what I want, and how to 
extract it from those of her kind.</P>
<P>&quot;Among other strange relics, she succeeded, after many years, in 
obtaining the following ' Gospel,' which I have in her handwriting A full 
account of its nature with many details will be found in an Appendix. I do not 
know definitely whether my informant derived a part of these traditions from 
written sources or oral narration, but believe it was chiefly the 
latter......</P>
<P>&quot;For brief explanation I may say that witchcraft is known to its 
votaries as la <I>vecchia religione, </I>or the old religion, of which Diana is 
the Goddess, her daughter <I>Aradia </I>(or Herodias) the female Messiah, and 
that this little work sets forth how the latter was born, came down to earth, 
established witches and witchcraft, and then returned to heaven. With it are 
given the ceremonies and invocations or incantations to be addressed to Diana 
and Aradia, the exorcism of Cain, and the spells of the holy-stone, rue, and 
verbena, constituting. as the text declares, the regular church-service, so to 
speak, which is to be chanted or pronounced at the witch-meetings. There are 
also included the very curious incantations or benedictions of the honey, meal, 
and salt, or cakes of the witch-supper, which is curiously classical, and 
evidently a relic of the Roman mysteries.&quot;</P>
<P>Briefly the ritual of the Italian witches is as follows At the Sabbath they 
take meal and salt, honey and water, and say a conjuration over these, one to 
the meal, one to the salt, one to Cain, one to Diana, the moon-goddess. They 
then sit down naked to supper, men and women, and after the feast is over they 
dance, sing and make love in the darkness, quite in the manner of the medieval 
Sabbath of the sorcerers. Many charms are given connected with stones, 
especially if these have holes in them and are found by accident. A lemon stuck 
full of pins we are told is a good omen. Love-spells fill a large space in the 
little work, which for the rest recounts several myths of Diana and Endymion in 
corrupted form. (See <I>also </I>Leland's Etruscan-Roman Remains.)</P>

<P>lubdan :</B> In Ultonian romance, the King of the Wee Folk. One day he 
boasted <B>6</B>f the might of his strong man Glower, who could hew down a 
thistle at one blow. His bard Risirt retorted that beyond the sea, there existed 
a race of giants, any one of whom could annihilate a whole battalion of the Wee 
Folk. Challenged to prove his words. Risirt brought Creda, King Fergus' dwarf 
and bard. He then dared <I>Iubdan </I>to go to Fergus' palace and taste the 
king's porridge. <I>Iubdan </I>and Bebo, his queen, arrived at the palace at 
midnight, but in trying to get at the porridge so as to taste and be away before 
daybreak, <I>Iubdan </I>fell in, He was found in the pot next morning by the 
scullions, and he and Bebo were taken before Fergus, who after a while released 
them in exchange for a pair of water shoes, wearing which a man could go over or 
under water as freely as on land.</P>

<P>Iynx :</B> A Chaldean symbol of universal being, the name of which signifies 
&quot;power of transmission.&quot; It was reproduced as a living sphere or 
winged globe. The first example was perhaps put forth by mind on the plane of 
reality, to be followed by three others called paternal and ineffable, and 
latterly by hosts of Iynxs of a subordinate character, described as &quot;free 
intelligences.&quot; The <I>lynx </I>is described by Eliphas Levi as 
&quot;corresponding to the Hebrew Yod or to that unique letter from which all 
other letters were formed.&quot;</P></FONT>
