<P>Valentine, Basil :</B> This German adept in hermetic philosophy <B>is 
</B>commonly supposed to have been born at Mayence towards the close of the 
fourteenth century. As a young man he espoused holy orders, and it is recorded 
that he entered the Abbey of St. Peter, at Erfurt, and eventually became its 
Prior ; but otherwise very little is known concerning him, and even the date of 
his death is uncertain. He appears to have been a very modest person, for 
according to Olaus Borrichius, the author of <I>De Ortu et Progressu Chemiae, 
Valentine </I>imprisoned all the manuscripts of his scientific writings inside 
one of the pillars of the Abbey Church; and there they might have remained for 
an indefinite period, but a thunderstorm chanced ultimately to dislodge them 
from their curious hiding-place. It is possible, of course, that this 
incarceration was not altogether due to modesty on the writer's part, and arose 
rather from his dreading a visitation from the Inquisition in the event of their 
discovering his alchemistic proclivities but be that as it may, <I>Vatentine's 
</I>works certainly mark him as a very shrewd man and a capable scientist. In 
contradistinction to most analogous medieval literature, his treatises are not 
all couched in Latin, some of them being in high Dutch and others in the 
author's native German; and prominent among those in the latter tongue is <I>The 
Triumphal Chariot of Antimony, </I>first published at Leipsic in <B>1624</B>. 
Herein <I>Valentine </I>exalts antimony as an excellent medicine, while the 
volume likewise embodies a lengthy metrical treatise on the philosopher's stone, 
the writer contending that whoso would discover and use this must do charitable 
deeds, mortify the flesh, and pray without ceasing.</P>
<P>As regards the alchemist's further writings, it behoves to mention his 
<I>Apocalypsis Chymica, De Microcosmo degue Magno Mundi Mysterio et Medecina 
Hominis </I>and <I>Practica una cum duodecim Clavibus et Appendice. </I>All 
these were originally published in Germany at the beginning of the seventeenth 
century, and divers passages in them demonstrate that the author understood the 
distillation of brandy, and was acquainted with the method of obtaining 
chlorohydric acid from salt-water ; while moreover, reverting to his faith in 
antimony, he has been credited with having been the first to extract this from 
sulphuret.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Vampire :</B> (Russian <I>Vampir, </I>South Russian <I>upuir, </I>probably 
from the root <I>pi, </I>to drink, with the <I>prefix va, </I>or <I>av.) </I>A 
dead person who returns in spirit form from the grave for the purpose of 
destroying and sucking the blood of living persons, or a living sorcerer who 
takes a special form for the same purpose. The conception of the <I>vampire 
</I>is rifest among Slavonic peoples, and especially in the Balkan countries, 
and in Hungary, Bohemia, Moravia, and Silesia, and in these territories from 
<B>1730</B>-<B>35</B> there was a well-marked epidemic of vampirism, but it is 
by no means confined to them. In White Russia and the Ukraine it is believed 
that <I>vampires </I>are generally wizards or sorcerers, but in Bulgaria and 
Serbia it is thought that any corpse over which a cat or a dog jumps or over 
which a bird has flown is liable to become a <I>vampire. </I>In Greece (q.v.) a 
<I>vampire </I>is known as a <I>broncolaia </I>or <I>bourkabakos, </I>which has 
been identified with the Slavonic name for werewolf&quot; (q.v.), <I>vlkodlak, 
</I>or <I>vukodlak. </I>The <I>vampire, </I>too, is often supposed to steal the 
heart of his victim and to roast it over a slow fire, thus causing interminable 
amorous longings.</P><I>
<P>Marks of Vampirism.-Vampirism </I>is epidemic in character. Where one 
instance is discovered it is almost invariably followed by several others. This 
is accounted for by the circumstance that it is believed that the victim of a 
<I>vampire </I>pines and dies and becomes in turn a <I>vampire </I>himself after 
death, and so duly infects others. On the disinterment of a suspected <I>vampire 
</I>various well-known signs are looked for by experienced persons. Thus, if 
several holes about the breadth of a man's finger, are observed in the soil 
above the grave the <I>vampire </I>character of its occupant may be suspected. 
On unearthing the corpse it is usually found with wide-open eyes, ruddy and 
life-like complexion and lips and a general appearance of freshness, and showing 
no signs of corruption. It may also be found that the hair and nails have grown 
as in life. On the throat two small livid marks may be looked for, The coffin is 
also very often full of blood, the body has a swollen and gorged appearance, and 
the shroud is frequently half-devoured. The blood contained in the veins of the 
corpse is found on examination to be in a fluid condition as in life, and the 
limbs are pliant and flexible and have none of the rigidity of death.</P><I>
<P>Examples of Vampirism.-Many </I>well-authenticated examples of vampirism 
exist. Charles Ferdinand de Schertz in his work <I>Magia Posthuma </I>printed at 
Olmutz in <B>1706</B> relates several stories of apparitions of this sort, and 
particularises the mischief done by them. One, among others, is of a herdsman of 
the village of Blow near the town of Kadam in Bohemia, who appeared for a 
considerable length of time, and visited several persons, who all died within 
eight days. At last, the inhabitants of Blow dug up the herdsman's body, and 
fixed it in the ground with a stake driven through it. The man, even in this 
condition, laughed at the people that were employed about him, and told them 
they were very obliging to furnish him with a stick with which to defend himself 
from the dogs. The same night he extricated himself from the stake, frightened 
several persons by appearing to them, and occasioned the death of many more than 
he had hitherto done. He was then delivered into the hands of the hangman, who 
put him into a cart, in order to burn him without the town. As they went along, 
the carcass shrieked in the most hideous manner, and threw about its arms and 
legs, as if it had been alive; and upon being again run through with a stake, it 
gave a loud cry, and a great quantity of fresh, florid blood issued from the 
wound. At last, the body was burned to ashes, and this execution put a final 
stop to the spectres appearing and infecting the village.</P>
<P>Calmet in his <I>Dissertation on Vampires </I>appended to his <I>Dissertation 
upon Apparitions </I>(English translation, <B>1759</B>), gives several well 
authenticated instances of vampirism as follows</P>
<P>&quot;It is now about fifteen years since a soldier, who was quartered in the 
house of a Haidamack peasant, upon the frontiers of Hungary, saw, as he was at 
the table with his landlord, a stranger come in and sit down by them. The master 
of the house and the rest of the company were strangely terrified, but the 
soldier knew not what to make of it. The next day the peasant died, and, upon 
the soldier's enquiring into the meaning of it, he was told that it was his 
landlord's father, who had been dead and buried above ten years, that came and 
sat down at table, and gave his son notice of his death.</P>
<P>&quot;The soldier soon propagated the story through his regiment, and by this 
means it reached the general officers, who commissioned the count de Cabreras, a 
captain in Alandetti's regiment of foot, to make an exact enquiry into the fact. 
The count, attended by several officers, a surgeon, and a notary, came to the 
house, and took the deposition of all the family, who unanimously swore that the 
spectre was the landlord's father, and that all the soldier had said was 
strictly true. The same was also attested by all the inhabitants of the 
village.</P><B>
<P>&quot;</B>In consequence of this the body of the spectre was dug up, and 
found to be in the same state as if it has been but just dead, the blood like 
that of a living person. The count de Cabreras ordered its head to be cut off, 
and the corpse to be buried again. He then proceeded to take depositions against 
other spectres of the same sort, and particularly against a man who had been 
dead above thirty years, and had made his appearance three several times in his 
own house at meal-time. At his first visit he had fastened upon the neck of his 
own brother, and sucked his blood; at his second, he had treated one of his 
children in the same manner; and the third time, he fastened upon a servant of 
the family, and all three died upon the spot.</P>
<P>&quot;Upon this evidence, the count gave orders that he should be dug up, and 
being found, like the first, with his blood in a fluid state, as if he had been 
alive, a great nail was drove through his temples, and he was buried again. The 
count ordered a third to be burnt, who had been dead above sixteen years, and 
was found guilty of murdering two of his own children by sucking their blood. 
The commissioner then made his report to the general officers, who sent a 
deputation to the emperor's court for further directions; and the emperor 
dispatched an order for a court, consisting of officers, lawyers, physicians, 
chirurgeons, and some divines, to go and enquire into the cause of these 
extraordinary events, upon the spot.</P>
<P>&quot;The gentleman who acquainted me with all these particulars, had them 
from the count de Cabreras himself, at Fribourg in Brisgau, in the year 
<B>1730</B>.&quot;</P>
<P>Other instances alluded to by Calmet are as follows:-</P>
<P>&quot;In the part of Hungary, known in Latin by the name of <I>Oppida 
Heidonum, </I>on the other side of the Tibiscus, vulgarly called the Teyss; that 
is, between that part of this river which waters the happy country of Tockay, 
and the frontiers of Transylvania, the people named <I>Heydukes </I>have a 
notion that there are dead persons, called by them <I>vampires, </I>which suck 
the blood of the living, so as to make them fall away visibly to skin and bones, 
while the carcasses themselves, like leeches, are filled with blood to such a 
degree that it comes out at all the apertures of their body. This notion has 
lately been confirmed by several facts, which I think we cannot doubt the truth 
of, considering the witnesses who attest them. Some of the most considerable of 
these facts I shall now relate.</P>
<P>&quot;About five years ago, an Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, an inhabitant of 
Medreiga, was killed by a cart full of hay that fell upon him. About thirty days 
after his death, four persons died suddenly, with all the symptoms usually 
attending those who are killed by <I>vampires. </I>It was then remembered that 
this Arnold Paul had frequently told a story of his having been tormented by a 
Turkish <I>vampire, </I>in the neighbourhood of Cassova, upon the borders of 
Turkish Servia (for the notion is that those who have been passive <I>vampires 
</I>in their life-time become active ones after death; or, in other words, that 
those who have had their blood sucked become suckers in their turn) but that he 
had been cured by eating some of the earth upon the <I>vampire's </I>grave, and 
by rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not hinder him 
from being guilty himself after his death; for, upon digging up his corpse forty 
days after his burial, he was found to have all the marks of an arch-vampire. 
His body was fresh and ruddy, his hair, beard, and nails were grown, and his 
veins were full of fluid blood, which ran from all parts of his body upon the 
shroud that he was buried in. The <I>hadnagy, </I>or bailiff of the village, who 
was present at the digging up of the corpse, and was very expert in the whole 
business of vampirism, ordered a sharp stake to be drove quite through the body 
of the deceased, and to let it pass through his heart, which was attended with a 
hideous cry from the carcass, as if it had been alive. This ceremony being 
performed, they cut off the head, and burnt the body to ashes. After this, they 
proceeded in the same manner with the four other persons that died of vampirism, 
lest they also should be troublesome. But all these executions could not hinder 
this dreadful prodigy from appearing again last year, at the distance of five 
years from its first breaking out. In the space of three months, seventeen 
persons of different ages and sexes died of vampirism. some without any previous 
illness, and others after languishing two or three days. Among others, it was 
said, that a girl, named Stanoska, daughter of the Heyduke Jotuitzo, went to bed 
in perfect health, but awoke in the middle of the night, trembling, and crying 
nut that the son of the Heyduke Millo, who died about nine weeks before, had 
almost strangled her while she was asleep. From that time she fell into a 
languishing state, and died at three days' end. Her evidence against Millo's son 
was looked upon as a proof of his being a <I>vampire, </I>and, upon digging up 
his body, he was found to be such.</P>
<P>&quot;At a consultation of the principal inhabitants of the place, attended 
by physicians and chirurgeons, it was considered how it was possible that the 
plague of vampirism should break out afresh, after the precautions that had been 
taken some years before : and, at last, it was found out that the original 
offender, Arnold Paul, had not only destroyed the four persons mentioned above, 
but had killed several beasts, which the late <I>vampires, </I>and particularly 
the son of Millo, had fed upon. Upon this foundation a resolution was taken to 
dig up all the persons that had died within a certain time. Out of forty were 
found seventeen, with all the evident tokens of vampirism; and they had all 
stakes drove through their hearts, their heads cut off, their bodies burnt, and 
their ashes thrown into the river.</P>
<P>&quot;All these several enquiries and executions were carried on with all the 
forms of law, and attested by several officers who were in garrison in that 
country. by the chirurgeon-majors of the regiments, and by the principal 
inhabitants of the place. The original papers were all sent, in January last, to 
the Imperial council of war at Vienna, which had issued out a commission to 
several officers, to enquire into the truth of the fact.&quot;</P><I>
<P>Methods of Extirpation </I>-The commonest methods of the extirpation of 
<I>vampires </I>are-(a) beheading the suspected corpse; (b) taking out the 
heart; (c) impaling the corpse with a white-thorn stake (in Russia an aspen), 
and (d) burning it. Sometimes more than one or all of these precautions is 
taken. Instances are on record where the graves of as many as thirty or forty 
persons have been disturbed during the course of an epidemic of vampirism and 
their occupants impaled or beheaded. Persons who dread the visits or attacks of 
a <I>vampire </I>sleep with a wreath made of garlic round the neck, as that 
esculent is supposed to be especially obnoxious to the <I>vampire. </I>When 
impaled the <I>vampire </I>is usually said to emit a dreadful cry, but it has 
been pointed out that the gas from the intestines may be forced through the 
throat by the entry of the stake into the body, and that this may account for 
the sound. The method of discovering a <I>vampire's </I>grave in Serbia is to 
place a virgin boy upon a coal-black stallion which has never served a mare and 
marking the spot where he will not pass. An officer quartered in Wallachia wrote 
to Calmet as follows, giving him an instance of this method</P>
<P>&quot;At the time when we were quartered at Temeswar in Wallachia, there died 
of this disorder two dragoons of the company in which I was cornet, and several 
more who had it would have died also, if the corporal of the company had not put 
a stop to it, by applying a remedy commonly made use of in that country. It is 
of a very singular kind, and, though infallibly to be depended on, I have never 
met with it in any Dispensatory.</P>
<P>&quot;They pick out a boy, whom they judge to be too young to have lost his 
maidenhead, and mount him bare upon a coal-black stone-horse, which has never 
leaped a mare. This virgin-pair is led about the church-yard, and across all the 
graves, and wherever the animal stops. and refuses to go on, in spite of all the 
whipping they can give him, they conclude they have discovered a <I>vampire. 
</I>Upon opening the grave, they find a carcass as fleshy and fair as if the 
person were only in a slumber. The next step is to cut off his head with a 
spade, and there issues from the wound such a quantity of fresh and florid 
blood, that one would swear they had cut the throat of a man in full health and 
vigour. They then fill up the pit, and it may be depended on that the disorder 
will cease, and that all who were ill of it will gradually get strength, like 
people that recover slowly after a long illness. Accordingly this happened to 
our troopers, who were attacked with the distemper. I was at that time 
commanding officer of the troop, the captain and lieutenant being absent, and 
was extremely angry at the corporal for having made this experiment without me. 
It was with great difficulty that I prevailed with myself not to reward him with 
a good cudgel, a thing of which the officers of the emperor's service are 
usually very liberal. I would not, for the world, have been absent upon this 
occasion, but there was now no remedy.&quot;</P>
<P>A Bulgarian belief is that a wizard or sorcerer may entrap a <I>vampire 
</I>by placing in a bottle some food for which the <I>vampire </I>has a 
partiality, and on his entry in the shape of fluff or straw, sealing up the 
flask and throwing it into the fire.</P><I>
<P>Scientific Theories of Vampirism.-The </I>English custom of piercing 
suicide's bodies with a stake would appear to be a survival of the belief in 
vampirism. Such demons are also to be seen in the Polynesian <I>tii, </I>the 
Malayan <I>hantu penyardin, </I>a dog-headed water-demon, and the <I>kephn 
</I>of the Karens, which under the form of a wizard's head and stomach devours 
human souls. Tylor considers <I>vampire's </I>to be ' causes conceived in 
spiritual form to account for specific facts of wasting disease.&quot; Afanasief 
regards them as thunder-gods and spirits of the storm who during winter slumber 
in their cloud-coffins to rise again in spring and draw moisture from the 
clouds. But this theory will scarcely recommend itself to anyone with even a 
slight knowledge of mythological science. Calmet's difficulty in believing in 
<I>vampire's </I>was that he could not understand how a spirit could leave its 
grave and return thence with ponderable matter in the form of blood, leaving no 
traces showing that the surface of the earth above the grave had been stirred. 
But this view might be combated by the theory of the precipitation of 
matter.</P><I>

pretentions, which will scarcely bear a strict investigation. are that she was 
the chosen bride of Asmodeus and was on terms of intimacy with Lucifer, the 
deity worshipped by the Palladist confraternity.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Vaulderie :</B> A connection with the Satanic powers, so called from Robinet 
de Vaulse, a hermit, one of the first persons accused of the crime. In 
<B>1453</B> the Prior of St. Germainen-Laye, Guillaume de l'Allive, a doctor of 
theology, was accused of <I>Vaulderie, </I>and sentenced to perpetual 
imprisonment. Six years later there was burned at Lille a hermit named Alphonse, 
who preached heterodox doctrines. Such were the preludes of a persecution which, 
in the following year, the Vicar of the Inquisition. administrator of the 
Diocese of Arras, seconded by the Count d'Etampes, Governor of Artois, directed 
at first against loose women, but afterwards against citizens, magistrates, 
knights, and especially the wealthy. The procedures against the accused had 
almost always for their basis some accusation of sorcery. Most of the unhappy 
creatures confessed to have attended the &quot;Witch's Sabbath,&quot; and the 
strange revelations wrung from them by torture, will give some idea of the 
ceremonies which according to the popular tradition, were enacted in the lurid 
festivals presided over by Satan. Here are some extracts from the judgment 
pronounced at Arras in <B>1460</B> upon five women, a painter, and a poet, 
nick-named ' an abbe of little sense,&quot; and aged about seventy, and several 
others, who all perished in the flames kindled by a barbarous ignorance and fed 
by a cruel superstition.</P>
<P>&quot;And the said Inquisition did say and declare, that those hereinunder 
named had been guilty of <I>Vaulderei </I>in manner following, that is to say :- 
&quot;That when they wished to go to the said <I>Vaulderie', </I>they, with an 
ointment given to them by the devil, anointed a small wooden rod and their palms 
and their hands; then they put the wand between their legs, and soon they flew 
wherever they wished to go, over fair cities, woods and streams; and the devil 
carried them to the place where they should hold their assembly, and in this 
place they found others, and tables placed, loaded with wines and viands; and 
there they found a demon in the form of a goat, a dog, an ape, or sometimes a 
man; and they made their oblation and homage to the said demon, and adored him, 
and yielded up to him their souls, and all, or at least some portion, of their 
bodies; then, with burning candles in their hands, they kissed the rear of the 
goat-devil (Here the Inquisitor becomes untranslatable). And this homage done, 
they trod and trampled upon the Cross, and befouled it with their spittle, in 
contempt of Jesus Christ, and the Holy Trinity, then turned their backs towards 
heaven and the firmament in contempt of God. And after they had all eaten and 
drunk well, they had carnal intercourse all together, and even the devil assumed 
the guise of man and woman, and had intercourse with both sexes. And many other 
crimes, most filthy and detestable, they committed, as much against God as 
against nature, which the said Inquisitor did not dare to name, that innocent 
ears might not be told of such villainous enormites.'</P><B>
<P></B>The eagerness displayed by the Inquisitor and his acolytes so excited the 
public indignation, that at the close of the year <B>1460</B> the judges did not 
dare any longer to condemn to death the unfortunate wretches accused, it is said 
only <I>for </I>the purpose of depriving them of their property. As in the case 
of all great wrongs, a reaction set in-a re-action in favour of the right; and 
thirty years later, when the county of Artois had been re-united to the Crown, 
the Parliament of Paris declared, on the <B>20</B>th of May, <B>1491</B>, these 
trials &quot;abusive, void, and falsely made,&quot; and condemned the heirs of 
the duke of Burgundy and the principal judges to an amend of <B>500</B> Parisian 
livres, to be distributed as a reparation among the heirs of the victims.</P>

<P>Vehm-Gerichte :</B> A secret tribunal which during the Middle Ages exercised 
a peculiar jurisdiction in Germany and especially in Westphalia. Its origin is 
quite uncertain. The sessions were often held in secret, and the uninitiated 
were forbidden to attend them on pain of death. The most absurd stories have 
been circulated concerning them,-that they met in underground chambers and so 
forth. These have been discounted by modern research. Far from dabbling in the 
occult, these courts frequently punished persons convicted of witchcraft and 
sorcery.</P>

<P>Veleda :</B> A prophetess among the ancient Germans, of whom Tacitus says: 
&quot; She exercises a great authority, for women have been held here from the 
most ancient times to be prophetic, and, by excessive superstition, as divine. 
The fame of <I>Veleda </I>stood on the very highest elevation, for she foretold 
to the Germans a prosperous issue, but to the legions their destruction! 
<I>Veleda </I>dwelt upon a high tower, whence messengers were dispatched bearing 
her oracular counsels to those who sought them; but she herself was rarely seen, 
and none was allowed to approach her. Cercaus is said to have secretly begged 
her to let the Romans have better success in war. The Romans, as well as those 
of her own race, set great store on her prophecies, and sent her valuable gifts. 
In the reign of the Emperor Vespasian she was honoured as a goddess.&quot;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Veltis :</B> An evil spirit who assaulted St. Margaret but was overcome by 
her. On being asked by St. Margaret who be was and whence he came, he replied: 
&quot;My name is <I>Veltis, </I>and I am one of those whom Solomon by virtue of 
his spells, confined in a copper cauldron at Babylon; but when the Babylonians,

<P>Vervain : </B>A sacred herb with which the altars of Jupiter were sprinkled. 
Water containing <I>vervain </I>was also sprinkled in houses to cast out evil 
spirits. Among the druids particularly it was employed in connection with many 
forms of superstition. They gathered it at day-break, before the sun had risen. 
Later sorcerers followed the same usage, and the demonologists believe that in 
order to evoke demons it is necessary to be crowned with <I>vervain.</I></P>

<P>Villanova, Arnold de <I>:</B> Arnold de Villanova </I>was a physician by 
profession, and is reported to have been something of a theologian besides a 
skilled alchemist. His natal place has never been determined, but Catalonia, 
Milan and Montpellier have all been suggested ; while as to the precise date of 
his advent, this too is uncertain yet appears to have been about the middle of 
the thirteenth century. <I>Arnold </I>studied medicine for many years at the 
Sorbonne in Paris, which in medieval times was the principal European nursery of 
physicians; and thereafter he travelled for a long time in Italy, while 
subsequently he penetrated to Spain. Here, however, he heard that a friend of 
his was in the hands of the dreaded Inquisition and, fearing that he likewise 
might be trepanned by that body, he withdrew speedily to Italy. For a 
considerable period he lived at Naples, enjoying there the friendly patronage of 
the Neapolitan sovereign, and spending his time less in the actual practice of 
his profession than in the compilation of various scientific treatises ; while 
at a later date he was appointed physician in ordinary to Pope Clement V., so 
presumably the rest of his life was spent mainly at Rome, or possibly at 
Avignon. Meanwhile his interest in alchemy had become widely known, and indeed 
many people declared that his skill herein was derived from communications with 
the arch-fiend himself, and that the physician accordingly deserved nothing less 
than burning at the stake ; while he also elicited particular enmity from the 
clergy by sneering openly at the monastic <I>regime, </I>and by declaring boldly 
that works of charity are more acceptable to God than the repetition of 
<I>paternosters. </I>Thanks to Papal favour, nevertheless, <I>Arnold </I>went 
unscathed by his enemies; but soon after his death, which occurred about the 
year <B>1310</B>. the Inquisition decided that they had dealt too leniently with 
the deceased, and in consequence they signified their hatred of him, by ordering 
certain of his writings to be burned publicly at Tarragona.</P><I>
<P>Arnold </I>was acquainted with the preparation of oil of turpentine and oil 
of rosemary, while the marcasite frequently mentioned by him is supposed to be 
identical with bismuth. His most important treatises are his <I>Thesaurus 
Thesaurorum, Rosarium Philosophorum, Speculam Alchemiae </I>and <I>Perfectum 
Magisterum ; </I>while two others of some moment are his <I>Testamentum </I>and 
<I>Scientia Scientioe. </I>A collected edition of his works was issued in 
<B>1520</B>, while several writings from his pen are embodied in the 
<I>Bibliotheca Chemica Curiosa </I>of Mangetus, published in <B>1702</B>.</P>

<P>Villars, l'Abbe de Montfaucon de :</B> French Mystic 
(<B>1635</B>-<B>1673</B>.) This Churchman, author and mystic was what the French 
style &quot;un meridional&quot; being a native of southern Franch. He was born 
in <B>1635</B> at Toulouse, not very far from the seaport town of Bordeaux; and 
at an early age he espoused holy orders, while in <B>1667</B> he left the south 
and came to Paris, eager to win fame as a preacher. Nor did this ambition of his 
go wholly ungratified, his eloquence in the pulpit winning him numerous 
admirers; but he soon grew more interested in literature than in clerical 
affairs, and in <B>1670</B> he published his first and most important book, 
<I>Comte du Gabalis. </I>Ostensibly a novel, this volume is largely a veiled 
satire on the writings of La Calprenede, at this time very popular both in 
France and in England; but the satirical element in <I>Villars' </I>paper is 
supplemented by a curious blend of history, philosophy and mysticism; and, as 
much of the last-named is of a nature distinctly hostile to the dogmas of Rome, 
the author soon found himself in ill odour with his brother clerics. Probably it 
was for this reason that he renounced the pulpit, yet his literary activities 
were not vitiated by persecutions; and in <B>1671</B> he issued <I>De' la 
Delicetesse, </I>a speculative treatise, couched in the form of dialogues, in 
which the author takes the part of one, a priest who had lately been writing in 
opposition to Port Royal doctrines. Like its predecessor this new book made a 
considerable stir, and <I>Villars </I>began to write voluminously, at the same 
time plunging deeply into the study of various kinds of mysticism; but his 
activities were suddenly terminated in an unexpected fashion, for in <B>1673</B> 
he was murdered on the public high-Toad not far from Lyons, whither he was 
journeying from Paris. Presumably he had incurred the hatred of some one but the 
question is shrouded in mystery; and, be the solution what it may, no attempt 
appears to have been made to frustrate the posthumous publication of divers 
works from <I>Villars' </I>pen. Within the first decade succeeding his death 
three such works appeared, <I>L&rsquo; Amour sans Faiblesse, Anne de Bretague et 
Ailmanzaris, </I>and <I>Critique de la Berenice de Racine et de Corneille, 
</I>the last-named subsequently winning the enconiums of a shrewd judge, Mme. de 
Sevigne ; while so late as <B>1715</B> a further production by <I>Villars 
</I>was issued, a sequel to the <I>Comte du Gabalis, </I>bearing the significant 
title of <I>Nouveaux Entretiens sur les Sciences secretes. </I>This volume 
elicited ready and wide interest among thinkers in the eighteenth century, and 
it may be briefly defined as a treatise opposing the philosophical theories of 
Descartes, or rather, opposing the popular misapprehension and abuse of 
these.</P>

<P>Vintras, Eugene :</B> A Norman peasant of great devoutness, who in the year 
<B>1839</B> was fixed upon by the Saviours of Louis XVII. (q.v.), as a fitting 
successor to their prophet Martin who had just died. They addressed a letter to 
the pretended Louis XVII. and arranged that it should fall into the hands of 
<I>Vintras. </I>It abounded in good promises for the reign to come and in 
mystical expressions calculated to inflame the brain of a person of weak and 
excitable character such as <I>Vintras </I>was. In a letter <I>Vintras 
</I>himself describes as follows the manner in which this communication reached 
him :-</P>
<P>&quot;Towards nine o'clock I was occupied in writing, when there was a knock 
at the door of the room in which I sat, and supposing that it was a workman who 
came on business, I said rather brusquely, 'Come in.' Much to my astonishment, 
in place of the expected workman, I saw an old man in rags. I asked merely what 
he wanted. He answered with much tranquillity, ' Don't disturb yourself, Pierre 
Michel.' Now, these names are never used in addressing me, for I am known 
everywhere as <I>Eugene, </I>and even in signing documents I do not make use of 
my first names. I was conscious of a certain emotion at the old man's answer, 
and this increased when he said: 'I am utterly tired, and wherever I appear they 
treat me with disdain, or as a thief.' The words alarmed me considerably, though 
they were spoken in a saddened and even a woeful tone. I arose and placed a ten 
bus piece in his hand, saying, I do not take you for that, my good man,' and 
while speaking I made him understand that I wished to see him Out. He received 
it in silence but turned his back with a pained air. No sooner had he set foot 
on the last step than I shut the door and locked it. I did not hear him go down, 
so I called a workman and told him to come up to my room. Under some business 
pretext, I was wishing him to search with me all the possible places which might 
conceal my old man, whom I had not seen go out. The workman came accordingly. I 
left the room in his company, again locking my door. I hunted through all the 
nooks and corners, but saw nothing.</P>
<P>&quot;I was about to enter the factory when I heard on a sudden the bell 
ringing for mass, and felt glad that, notwithstanding the disturbance, I could 
assist at the sacred ceremony. I ran back to my room to obtain a prayer book 
and, on the table where I had been writing, I found a letter addressed- to Mme. 
de Generes in London; it was written and signed by M. Paul de Montfleury of 
Caen, and embodied a refutation of heresy, together with a profession of 
orthodox faith. The address notwithstanding, this letter was intended to place 
before the Duke of Normandy the most important truths of our holy Catholic, 
Apostolic and Roman religion. On the document was laid the ten sous piece which 
I had given to the old man.&quot;</P><I>
<P>Vintras </I>immediately concluded that the bringer of the letter was a 
messenger from heaven, and became devoted to the cause of Louis XVII. He became 
a Visionary. He had bloody sweats, he saw hearts painted with his own blood 
appear on hosts, accompanied by inscriptions in his own spelling. Many believed 
him a prophet and followed him, among them several priests, who alleged that 
they partook of his occult vision. Doctors analysed the fluid which flowed from 
the hosts and certified it to be human blood. His enemies referred these 
miracles to the Devil. <I>Vintras </I>followers regarded him as a new Christ. 
But one of them, Gozzoli, published scandalous accounts of his doings, alleging 
that horrible obscenities and sacrilegious masses took place in their private 
chapel at Tilly-sur-seules. The unspeakable abominations alluded to are 
contained in a pamphlet entitled <I>Le Prophete Vintras (</I><B>1851</B>). The 
sect was formally condemned by the Pope, and <I>Vintras </I>constituted himself 
sovereign Pontiff. He was arrested on a charge of exploiting his cult for money, 
was tried at Caen, and sentenced to five years imprisonment. When freed in 
<B>1845</B> he went to England. and in London resumed the head-ship of his cult 
which seems to have flourished for some time afterwards.</P>

<P>Visions :</B> (From Latin <I>visus, </I>p.p. of <I>videre, </I>to see.) The 
appearance to mortals of supernatural persons, or scenes. Of great frequency in 
early and medieval times, and among savage or semi-civilised races, <I>visions 
</I>seem to have decreased proportionately with the advance of learning and 
enlightenment. Thus among the Greeks and Romans of the classic period they were 
comparatively rare, though <I>visions of </I>demons or gods were occasionally 
seen. On the other hand, among Oriental races the seeing of <I>visions </I>was a 
common occurrence, and these took more varied shapes. In medieval Europe, again, 
<I>visions </I>were almost commonplaces, and directions were given by the Church 
to enable men to distinguish <I>visions </I>of divine origin from those false 
delusions which were the work of the Evil One. <I>Visions </I>may be roughly 
divided into two classes-those which are spontaneous, and those which are 
induced. But, indeed, the great majority belong to the latter class. Ennemoser 
enumerates the causes of such appearances thus : (<B>1</B>) Sensitive organism 
and delicate constitution; (<B>2</B>) Religious education and ascetic life 
(fasting, penance, etc.) ; (<B>3</B>) Narcotics-opium, wine, incense, narcotic 
salves (witch-salves) ; (<B>4</B>) Delirium, monomania; (<B>5</B>) Fear and 
expectation, preparatory words, songs, and prayers. Among the <I>visions 
</I>induced by prayer and fasting, and the severe self-discipline of the 
religious ascetic, must <I>be </I>included many historical or traditional 
instances - the <I>visions </I>of St. Francis of Assisi, St. Anthony, St. 
Bernard Ignatius, St. Catherine of Siena, St. Hildegarde, Joan of Arc. It may be 
noted that the convent has ever been the special haunt of religious <I>visions, 
</I>probably for the reasons above mentioned. But the most potent means for the 
inductions of visionary appearances are those made use of by the Orientals. 
Narcotics of all kinds - opium, haschish, and so on-are indulged in, and 
physical means used for this express purpose. Thus the Brahmins will gaze for 
hours at a time at the sun or moon, will remain for months in practically the 
some position, or will practise all manner of mortification of the body, so that 
they may fall at length into the visionary sleep (a species of catalepsy.) The 
narcotic salves with which they anoint themselves are said to be similar to the 
witch-salves used in the Middle Ages, which induced in the witch the 
hallucination that she was flying through the air on a goat or a broomstick. 
Opium also is said to produce a sensation of flying, as well as <I>visions 
</I>of celestial delight. Alcoholic intoxication induces <I>visions </I>of 
insects and small animals, as does also nitrogen. The vapours rising from the 
ground in some places, or those to be found in certain caverns, are said to 
exercise an effect similar to that of narcotics. The Indians of North America 
practise similar external methods of inducing <I>visions - </I>solitude, 
fasting, and the use of salves or ointments. The savages of Africa have dances 
which, by producing severe dizziness, help them towards the desired visionary 
ecstasy. The northern savages attain the same end by the use of drums and noisy 
music. Spontaneous <I>visions, </I>though less common, are yet sufficiently 
numerous to merit attention here. The difficulty is, of course, to know just how 
far &quot; fear and expectation&quot; may have operated to induce the <I>vision. 
</I>In many cases, as in that of Swedenborg, the <I>visions </I>may have 
commenced as &quot; <I>visions </I>of the night,&quot; hardly to be 
distinguished from dreams, and so from <I>vision </I>of an&quot; internal&quot; 
nature to clearly externalised apparitions. Swedenborg himself declares that 
when seeing visions of the latter class he used his senses exactly as when 
awake, dwelling with the spirits as a spirit, but able to return to his body 
when he pleased. An interesting case of spontaneous <I>vision </I>is that of 
Benvenuto Cellini (q.v.). <I>Visions </I>are by no means confined to the sense 
of sight. Taste, hearing, smelling, touch, may all be experienced in a 
<I>vision. </I>Joan of Arc, for instance, heard voices encouraging her to be the 
deliverer of her country. Examples may be drawn from the Bible, as the case of 
the child Samuel in the Temple, and instances could be multiplied from all ages 
and all times. The <I>visions </I>of Pordage and the&quot; Philadelphia Society, 
or, as they called themselves later, the Angelic Brethren &quot;-in <B>1651</B> 
are noteworthy in this respect because they include the taste of &quot; 
brimstone, salt, and soot.&quot; In the presence of the &quot; Angelic Brethren 
pictures were drawn on the window-panes by invisible hands, and were seen to 
move about.</P>
<P>Physiological explanations of <I>visions </I>have from time to time been 
offered. Plato says &quot; The eye is the organ of a fire which does not burn 
but gives a mild light. The rays proceeding from the eye meet those of the 
outward light. With the departure of the outward light the inner also becomes 
less active; all inward movements become calmer and less disturbed ; and should 
any more prominent influences have remained they become in various points where 
they congregate, so many pictures of the fancy.&quot;</P>
<P>Democritus held that <I>visions </I>and dreams are passing shapes, ideal 
forms proceeding from other beings. Of death-bed <I>visions </I>Plutarch says: 
&quot; It is not probable that in death the soul gains new powers which it was 
not before possessed of when the heart was confined within the chains of the 
body; but it is much more probable that these powers were always in being, 
though dimmed and clogged by the body; and the soul is only then able to 
practise them when the corporeal bonds are loosened, and the drooping limbs and 
stagnating juices no longer oppress it.&quot; The spiritualistic theory of 
<I>visions </I>can hardly be called a physiological one, save in so far as 
spirit is regarded as refined matter. An old theory of visionary ecstasy on 
these lines was that the soul left the body and proceeded to celestial spheres, 
where it remained in contemplation of divine scenes and persons. Very similar to 
this is the doctrine of Swedenborg, whose spirit, he believed, could commune 
with discarnate spirits-the souls of the dead-as one of themselves. To this may 
be directly traced the doctrines of modern spiritualism, which thus regards 
<I>visions </I>as actual spirits or spirit scenes, visible to the ecstatic or 
entranced subject whose spirit was projected to discarnate planes. The question 
whether or no <I>visions </I>are contagious has been much disputed. It has been 
said that such appearances may be transferred from one person to another by the 
laying on of hands. In the case of the Scottish seers such a transference may 
take place even by accidental contact with the seer. The <I>vision </I>of the 
second person is, however, less distinct than that of the original seer. The 
same idea prevailed with regard to the visions of magnetised patients. In so far 
as these may be identified with the collective hallucinations of the hypnotic 
state, there is no definite scientific evidence to prove their existence.</P><I>
<P>Visions </I>have by no means been confined to the ignorant or the 
superstitious. Many men of genius have been subject to visionary appearance. 
While Raphael was trying to paint the Madonna she appeared to him in a 
<I>vision. </I>The famous composition known as the &quot; Devil's Sonata&quot; 
was dictated to Tartini by the Evil One himself. Goethe also had <I>visions. 
</I>Blake's portraits of the Patriarchs were done from visionary beings which 
appeared to him in the night. And such instances might easily be multiplied.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Vitality :</B> according to theosophists, comes from the sun. When a physical 
atom is transfused with <I>vitality, </I>it draws to itself six other atoms and 
thus makes an etheric element. The sum of their <I>vitality </I>is then divided 
among each of the atoms and in this state the element enters the physical body 
by means of one of the sense organs or <I>chaksams </I>of the etheric 
double-that situated opposite the spleen. Here the element is divided into its 
component parts and these are conveyed to the various parts of the physical 
body. It is on <I>vitality </I>that the latter depends, not only for life but 
for its well-being in life. A person sufficiently supplied with it enjoys good 
health and one insufficiently supplied is afflicted with poor health. In the 
case of a healthy person. however, more <I>vitality </I>is drawn in than is 
necessary for the vital purposes and the superfluous <I>vitality </I>acts 
beneficially on his neighbours, whether human or animal, while it can also be 
directed in certain definite channels to the healing of diseases and so forth. 
With unhealthy persons, the case is, of course, reversed, and they devitalise 
the more healthy, with whom they come in contact.</P>
