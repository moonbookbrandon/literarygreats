<P>Unguents :</B> There are many kinds of <I>unguents, </I>each with its 
peculiar properties. It is known that the devil compounds them in order to harm 
the human race. One such <I>unguent </I>is composed of human fat, and is used by 
the witches to enable them to fly through the air to the Sabbath. Many old 
recipes exist for <I>unguents </I>to induce sleep, visions, etc., and these are 
compounded from various strange ingredients. </P><I>

<P>Univercoelum, The :</B> An American periodical having for its aim &quot; the 
establishment of a universal System of Truth, the Reform and Reorganisation of 
Society.&quot; It made its first appearance in December, <B>1847</B>, under the 
editorship of Andrew Jackson Davis (q.v.), and lived for about a year and a 
half. Its supporters and contributors looked for a new revelation to supplement 
those of the Old and New Testaments, Swedenborg and Fourier. Attention was given 
in its pages to prophecy, clairvoyance, somnambulism and trance phenomena 
generally, while it also taught &quot; an interior and spiritual 
philosophy&quot; whose central idea was that God was the infinitely intelligent 
Essence which pervaded all things-the Universal Soul, expressing itself in the 
material universe and the laws of nature as the human soul expresses itself 
through the material body. Though the Rochester Rappings broke out some time 
before the <I>Univercoelum </I>came to an end, the adherents of the paper did 
not seem to connect the disturbances with their propaganda. However, many of 
those who were associated with the <I>Univercoelum </I>afterwards became editors 
of spiritualistic papers. In July, <B>1849</B> the paper passed out of the hands 
of A. J. Davis, and became <I>The Present Age, </I>under the editorship of W. M. 
Channing.</P>

<P>Universities (Occult) :</B> In many works on the occult sciences allusions 
are made to schools and <I>universities </I>for the instruction of those who 
were drawn to them. Thus we are, told that Salamanca abounded in such schools; 
that Jechiel, a Jewish Rabbi of medieval France, kept such a seminary; and there 
is reason to believe that in all ages such institutions were by no means 
uncommon. Balzac alludes to one of them in a well-known novel <I>The Secret of 
Ruggier, </I>which he places at the time of Catherine de Medici. He says, &quot; 
At this epoch the occult sciences were cultivated with an ardour which put to 
shame the incredulous spirit of our century. . . . The universal protection 
accorded to these sciences by the ruling sovereigns of the times was quite 
remarkable.&quot; He goes on to say that at the commencement of the sixteenth 
century Ruggier was the member of a secret university for the study of the 
occult sciences, where astrologers, alchemists, and others, studied several 
branches of hidden knowledge; but he gives no details as to its locality, or as 
to the exact nature of its curriculum, There is no doubt that during the Middle 
Ages many extra-mural lecturers taught alchemy and kindred subjects at the great 
<I>universities. </I>Thus Paracelsus lectured on alchemy at the University of 
Basel, and he was preceded and followed there and elsewhere by many illustrious 
professors of that and other occult arts. M. Figuier in his work <I>Alchemy and 
the Alchemists (See </I>Alchemy), alludes to a school in Paris frequented by 
alchemists, which he himself attended in the middle of the last century. The 
school-an ordinary chemical laboratory through the day-became in the evening a 
centre of the most elaborate alchemical study, where Figuier met many alchemical 
students, visionary and practical, with one of whom he had a prolonged argument, 
which we have outlined at considerable length in the article &quot; 
Alchemy.&quot; Many professors of the occult sciences in early and later times 
drew around them considerable bands of students and assistants and formed 
distinct schools for the practice of magic and alchemy, principally the latter. 
The College of Augurs in Rome and the Calmecac of Ancient Mexico are distinct 
examples of institutions for the study of at least one branch of occult science, 
and in this connection the House of Wisdom of the Ismaelite sect at Cairo may be 
mentioned. It is likely that in ancient Egypt and Babylonia, institutions of the 
kind flourished more or less in secret. Mme. Blavatsky insisted to the last that 
a great &quot; school&quot; of illuminated occult adepts flourished in Tibet; 
but as nobody except herself and her immediate friends ever saw them, or had any 
dealings with<B> </B>them; and as all proof is against the existence of such a 
semi-divine brotherhood, her statements must be taken as being somewhat open to 
question. There is, however, no reason to doubt that bodies of men who study the 
higher occultism do exist in various Asiatic centres, whatever the nature of 
their powers, supernormal or otherwise, may be. Vague rumours reach students of 
occultism every now and again of schools or colleges on the continent of Europe, 
the purpose of which is to train aspirants in the occult arts ; but as definite 
information is seldom forthcoming regarding these, they can only be merely 
alluded to here. &quot;The School for the Discovery of the Lost Secrets of 
Antiquity,&quot; which flourishes at Lotus-land, California, was founded by 
Catherine Tingley late in the nineteenth century, and is under theosophical 
regime. Numerous small bodies for the study of occultism exist in every town of 
considerable size in Europe and America; but these cannot be dignified even by 
the name of &quot;schools,&quot; as they are for the most part private affairs, 
the occultism of which is of an extremely amateurish and innocent character.</P>

probable that (<B>1</B>) they were used to determine guilt and innocence, and 
(<B>2</B>) that this was done by means of categorical questions, to which the 
suspected person answered &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No.&quot; They appear to have 
been the prerogative of the priesthood.</P></FONT>
