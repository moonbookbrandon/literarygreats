<P>Wafer : </B>The sacred <I>wafer </I>is often used by devil-worshippers for 
purposes of profanation. <I>(See' </I>Devil-worship.) There was found in the 
house of the notorious witch, Dame Alice Kyteler (q.v.), a <I>wafer </I>of 
sacramental bread, bearing thereon the name of the Devil.</P><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Waldenses :</B> The name of a Christian sect which arose in the south of 
France about <B>1170</B>. They were much the same in origin and ethics as the 
Albigenses (q.v.), that is, their religious system rested upon that of 
Manichaeism, which believed in dualism and severe asceticism. It undoubtedly 
arose from the desire of the bourgeois class to have changes made in the 
clerical discipline of the Roman Church. Its adherents called themselves 
<I>cathari </I>thus demonstrating the eastern origin of their system. There were 
two classes of these, <I>credentes </I>and <I>perfecti, </I>or neophytes and 
adepts,-the perfecti only being admitted to the esoteric doctrines of the 
Waldensian Church. Outwardly its aim and effort was rationalistic ; but the 
inner doctrine partook more of the occult. It was in <B>1170</B> that Peter 
Waldo, a rich merchant of Lyons, sold his goods and gave them to the poor, and 
from him the sect was named. The earliest account of Waldensian beliefs is that 
of an enemy, Sacconi, an inquisitor of the Holy Office, who wrote about the 
middle of the thirteenth century. He divides the Waldensians into two classes, 
those of Lombardy, and those north of the Alps. The latter believed that any 
layman might consecrate the sacrament of the altar, and that the Roman Church 
was not the Church of Christ; while the Lombardian sect held that the Roman 
Church was the Scarlet Woman of the Apocalypse. They also believed that all men 
were priests. As their opinions became more widespread, persecution became more 
severe, and the Waldensians latterly withdrew themselves altogether from the 
Church of Rome, and chose ministers for themselves by election. Papal bulls were 
issued for their extermination, and a crusade was directed against them; but 
they survived these attacks, and so late as the time of Cromwell were protected 
by him against the Duke of Savoy and the French king. Their ministers were later 
subsidised by the government of Queen Anne, and this subsidy was carried on 
until the time of Napoleon, when he granted them an equivalent. Latterly they 
have received much assistance from various Protestant countries of Europe, 
especially from England and at the present time number some <B>12</B>,<B>000</B> 
to <B>13</B>,<B>000</B> communicants.</P>
<P>During the Middle Ages, it was strongly held by the priesthood of the Roman 
Church that, like the Albigenses, the Waldensians had a diabolic element in 
their religion and they have been from time to time classed with the various 
secret societies that sprang up in medieval Europe, such as the Knights Templar, 
the Rosicrucians, and so forth ; but although they possessed an esoteric 
doctrine of their own, there is no reason to believe that this was in any way 
magical, nor in any manner more esoteric&quot; than the inner doctrine of any 
other Christian sect.</P>

discovered the theory of evolution independent of Darwin. He was born at Usk, in 
Monmouthshire, on the <B>8</B>th of January, <B>1823</B>. His scientific studies 
included an enquiry into. the phenomena of spiritualism, and he became a firm 
believer in the genuineness of these manifestations. <I>Dr. Wallace' </I>had 
unique opportunities for studying these in connection with Mrs. Guppy, who, as 
Miss Nichols, lived for a time with his sister. Among his works was one entitled

<P>Wandering Jew, The :</B> A medieval German legend which has several forms. 
Through various writers, and differing in detail, the essential features of the 
narratives which have been handed down to us, are the same. The legend is that 
as Christ was dragged on his way to Calvary, he passed the house of a Jew, and 
stopping there, sought to rest a little, being weary under the weight of his 
cross. The Jew, however, inspired with the adverse enthusiasm of the mob, drove 
Him on, and would not allow Him to rest there. Jesus, looking at him, said, I 
shall stand and rest, but thou shalt go till the last day.&quot; Ever afterwards 
the Jew was compelled to wander over the earth, till this prophecy should be 
fulfilled.</P>
<P>The legend of the <I>Wandering Jew </I>is to be regarded as the epic of the 
Semite people in the Middle Ages.</P>
<P>In some parts of Germany we find the <I>Wandering Jew </I>identified with the 
Wild Huntsman, whilst in several French districts that mythical character is 
regarded as the wind of the night. The blast in his horn, which, rushing through 
the valleys creates a hollow booming sound not unlike a great bugle. In this 
legend we have in all probability the clue to the mythological side of the story 
of the wandering <I>Jew. </I>Or perhaps the idea. of the <I>Wandering Jew 
</I>has been fused with that of the conception of the wind. The resemblance 
between the two conceptions would be too strong to escape the popular mind. From 
a literary point of view this legend has been treated by Eugene Sue and 
Croly.</P><B>

<P>War, Occult Phenomena during the</B> : A surprising number of ideas regarding 
the supernatural have crystallized around the circumstances of the war. Perhaps 
the most striking of these was the alleged vision of angels at Mons. The first 
notice regarding this, or at least the most important and public record of the 
occurrence, was that contained in the <I>Evening News </I>for September 
<B>14</B>th, <B>1915</B>, ill Which Mr. Machen described the evidence as given 
to him by an officer who was in the retreat from Mons. This officer was a member 
of a well-known army family and was a person of great credibility, who stated 
that on August <B>26</B>th, <B>1914</B>, he was fighting in the battle of Le 
Cateau, from which his division retired in good order. On the night of the 
<B>27</B>th,&quot; he says, I was riding along the column with two other 
officers. . . . As we rode along I became conscious of the fact that in the 
fields on both sides of the road along which we were marching I could see a very 
large body of horsemen. . . . the other two officers had stopped talking. At 
last one of them asked me if I saw anything in the fields. I told them what I 
had seen. The third officer confessed that he, too, had been watching these 
horsemen for the past twenty minutes. So convinced were we that they were really 
cavalry, that at the next halt one of the officers took a party of men out to 
reconnoitre and found no one there. The night then grew darker and we saw no 
more.</P>
<P>Mr. Harold Begbie in his book <I>On the' Side' of the Angels </I>states that 
a vision of angels was seen in the retreat from Mons and gives the narrative of 
a soldier, who states that an officer came up to him &quot;in a state of great 
anxiety&quot; and pointed out to him a ' strange light which seemed to be quite 
distinctly outlined and was not a reflection of the moon, nor were there any 
clouds in the neighbourhood. The light became brighter and I could see quite 
distinctly three shapes. one in the centre having what looked like outspread 
wings. The other two were not so large, but were quite plainly distinct from the 
centre one. They appeared to have a long, loose-hanging garment of a golden tint 
and they were above the German line facing us. We stood watching them for about 
three-quarters of an hour.&quot; All the men in the battalion who saw this 
with<B> </B>the exception of five were killed. Mr. Begbie goes on to say that he 
was told by a nurse that a dying soldier spoke to her of the reluctance of the 
Germans to attack our line, because of the thousands of troops behind us.&quot; 
This man had heard German prisoners say so and fully believed in the phantasmal 
nature of those supporting hosts.</P>
<P>In his monograph on the Bowmen at Mons, Mr. Machen put forward the idea that 
those seen before the retreat from Mons were the spirits of the English bowmen 
who had fought at Agincourt and this idea gained wide prevalence, an interesting 
monograph being written upon it by Mr. Ralph Shirley. Men from the front, too, 
have stated to interviewers that phantasms of the dead frequently appeared in 
the space between the German and British trenches called No Man's 
Land.&quot;</P>
<P>Mr. Shirley has also written an excellent pamphlet on &quot;Prophecies and 
Omens of the Great War&quot; dealing with the various oracular utterances on the 
gigantic struggle, which may be referred to with confidence.</P>
<P>Stories, too, were current in the earlier times of the war regarding the 
appearance of saintly and protective figures resembling the patrons of the 
several allied countries. Thus the English were convinced that in certain 
engagements they had beheld the figure of Saint George mounted on a white 
charger and the French were equally sure that the figure in question was either 
Saint Denis or Joan of Arc. Wounded men in base hospitals asked for medallions 
or Coins on which the likenesses of these saints were impressed in order to 
verify the statements they made.</P><B>

<P>Wayland Smith : </B>A famous character in German mythological romance and 
father of Weltich, whom he trained in the art of warfare and sent to the Court 
of Dietrich in Bern. To him he gave the sword Miming and told him of a mermaid, 
his ancestress, to whom he was to apply when in difficulty. He is also referred 
to in the Sigfried story, being in company with a smith named Mimi, when 
Sigfried joins the smithy. His workmanship is praised in the Beowulf Saga and he 
is mentioned there and elsewhere as a maker of impregnable armour. He is the 
supernatural smith of the Teutonic peoples, and is comparable to Vulcan in 
Roman, and to Hephaistos in Greek mythology.</P>

<P>Werwolf :</B> A man temporarily or permanently transformed into a wolf, from 
the Anglo-Saxon <I>wer, </I>a man, and <I>wolf, </I>a wolf. It is a phase of 
Lycanthropy (q.v.), and in ancient and medieval times was of very frequent 
occurrence. It was, of course, in Europe where the wolf was one of the largest 
carnivorous animals, that the superstition gained currency, similar tales in 
other countries usually introducing bears, tigers, and so forth.</P>
<P>The belief is probably a relic of early cannibalism. Communities of 
semi-civilised people would begin to shun those who devoured human flesh, and 
they would be ostracised and classed as wild beasts, the idea that they had 
something in common with these would grow, and the conception that they were 
able to transform themselves into veritable animals would be likely to arise 
therefrom.</P>
<P>There were two kinds of <I>werwolf, </I>voluntary and involuntary. The 
voluntary would be, as has been said, those persons who, because of their taste 
for human flesh, had withdrawn from intercourse with their fellows. These 
appeared to possess a certain amount of magical power, or at least sufficient of 
it to transform themselves into the animal shape at will. This they effected by 
merely disrobing, by the taking off a girdle made of human skin, or, putting on 
a similar belt of wolf-skin, obviously a substitute for an entire wolf-skin. But 
we also hear of their donning the entire skin. In other instances the body is 
rubbed with a magic ointment, or water is drunk out of a wolf's footprint. The 
brains of the animal are also eaten. Olaus Magnus says that the <I>werwolves 
</I>of Livonia drained a cup of beer on initiation, and repeated certain magic 
words. In order to throw off the wolf shape the animal girdle was removed, or 
else the magician merely muttered a certain formula. In some instances the 
transformation was supposed to be the work of Satan.</P>
<P>The superstition regarding <I>werwolves </I>seems to have been exceedingly 
prevalent in France during the <B>16</B>th century as is evidenced by numerous 
trials, in some of which it is clearly shown that murder and cannibalism took 
place. Self-hallucination, too, was accountable for some of these cases, the 
supposed <I>werwolves </I>fully admitting that they had transformed themselves 
and had slain numerous persons. But at the beginning of the <B>17</B>th century, 
commonsense came to the rescue, and persons making such confessions were not 
credited. In Teutonic and Slavonic countries it was complained by men of 
learning that <I>werwolves </I>did more damage than the real criminals, and a 
regular college&quot; or institution for the practice of the art of animal 
transformation was attributed to them.</P>
<P>Involuntary <I>werwolves </I>were often persons transformed into an animal 
shape because of the commission of sin, and condemned to pass so many years in 
that form. Thus certain saints metamorphosed sinners into wolves. In Armenia it 
is thought that sinful women are condemned to pass seven years in the form of a 
wolf. To such a woman a demon appears, bringing a wolf-skin. He commands her to 
don it, from which moment she becomes a wolf with all the nature of a wild 
beast, devouring her own children and those of strangers, wandering forth at 
night, undeterred by locks, bolts, or bars, returning only with morning to 
resume her human form.</P>
<P>Romance, especially French romance, is full of <I>werwolves, </I>and one of 
the most remarkable instances of this is the Lay by Marie de France entitled 
<I>Bisclaveret, </I>the Lay of a <I>werwolf.</I></P>
<P>Many <I>werwolves </I>were innocent persons suffering through the witchcraft 
of others. To regain their true form it was necessary for them to kneel in one 
spot for a hundred years, to lose three drops of blood, to be hailed as a 
<I>werwolf, </I>to have the sign of the cross made on their bodies, to be 
addressed thrice by their baptismal names, or to be struck thrice on the 
forehead with a knife.</P>
<P>According to Donat de Hautemer, quoted by Goulart, &quot;there are some 
lycanthropes who are so dominated by their melancholy humour that they really 
believe themselves to be transformed into wolves. This malady, according to the 
testimony of Aetius in his sixth book, chapter XI., and Paulus in his third 
book, chapter XVI., and other moderns, is a sort of melancholy, of a black and 
dismal nature. Those who are attacked by it leave their homes in the months of 
February, imitate wolves iii almost every particular, and wander all night long 
among the cemeteries and sepulchres, so that one may observe a marvellous change 
in the mind and disposition, and, above all in the depraved imagination, of the 
lycanthrope. The memory, however, is still vigorous, as I have remarked in One 
of this lycanthropic melancholiacs whom we call <I>werwolves. </I>For one who 
was well acquainted with me was one day seized with his affliction, and on 
meeting him I withdrew a little, fearing that he might injure me. He, having 
glanced at me for a moment, passed on followed by a crowd of people. On his 
shoulder he carried the entire leg and thigh of a corpse. Having received 
careful medical treatment, he was cured of this malady. On meeting me on another 
occasion he asked me if I had not been afraid when he met me at such and such a 
place, which made me think that his memory was not hurt by the vehemence of his 
disease, though his imagination was so greatly damaged.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Guillaume de Brabant. in the narrative of Wier, repeated by Goulart, 
has written in his <I>History </I>that a certain man of sense and settled 
understanding was still so tormented by the evil spirit that at a particular 
season of the year he would think himself a ravening wolf, and would run here 
and there in the woods, caves and deserts, chasing little children. It was said 
that this man was often found running about in the deserts like a man out of his 
senses, and that at last by the grace of God he came to himself and was healed. 
There was also, as is related by Job Fincel in the second book <I>On Miracles 
</I>a villager near Paule in the year <B>1541</B>, who believed himself to be a 
wolf, and assaulted several men in the fields, even killing some. Taken at last, 
though not without great difficulty, he stoutly affirmed that he was a wolf, and 
that the only way in which he differed from other wolves was that they wore 
their hairy coats on the outside, while he wore his between his skin and his 
flesh. Certain persons, more inhuman and wolfish than he, wished to test the 
truth of this story, and gashed his arms and legs severely. Then, learning their 
mistake, and the innocence of the melancholiac, they passed him over to the 
consideration of the surgeons, in whose hands he died some days after. Those 
afflicted with this disease are pale, with dark and haggard eyes, seeing only 
with difficulty; the tongue is dry, and the sufferer very thirsty. Pliny and 
others write that the brain of a bear excites such bestial imaginations. It is 
even said that one was given to a Spanish gentleman to eat. in our times, which 
so disturbed his mind, that imagining himself to be transformed into a bear, he 
fled to the mountains and deserts.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;As for the lycanthropes, whose imagination was so damaged,&quot; says 
Goulart, that by some Satanic efficacy they appeared wolves and not men to those 
who saw them running about and doing all manner of harm, Bodin maintains that 
the devil can change the shape of one body into that of another, in the great 
power that God gives him in this elementary world. He says, then, that there may 
be lycanthropes who have really been transformed into wolves, quoting various 
examples and histories to prove his contention. In short, after many disputes, 
he believes in Colt's forms of lycanthropy. And as for the latter, there is 
represented at the end of this chapter the summary of his proposition, to wit, 
that men are sometimes transformed into beasts, retaining in that form the human 
reason it may be that this comes about by the direct power of God, or it may be 
that he gives this power to Satan, who carries out his will, or rather his 
redoubtable judgments. And if we confess (he says) the truths of the sacred 
history in Daniel, concerning the transformation of Nebuchadnezzar, and the 
history of Lot's wife changed into motionless stone, the changing of men into an 
ox or a stone is certainly possible; and consequently the transformation to 
other animals as well.&quot;</P>
<P>G. Peucer says in speaking of lycanthropy: &quot;As for me I had formerly 
regarded as ridiculous and fabulous the stories I had often heard concerning the 
transformation of men into wolves ; but I have learnt from reliable sources, and 
from the testimony of trustworthy witnesses, that such things are not at all 
doubtful or incredible, since they tell of such transformations taking place 
twelve days after Christmas in. Livonia and the adjacent countries; as they have 
been proved to be true by the confessions of those who have been imprisoned and 
tortured for such crimes. Here is the manner in which it is done. Immediately 
after Christmas day is past, a lame boy goes round the country calling these 
slaves of the devil, of which there are a great number, and enjoining them to 
follow him. If they procrastinate or go too slowly, there immediately appears a 
tall man with a whip whose thongs are made of iron chains, with which he urges 
them onwards, and sometimes lashes the poor wretches so cruelly, that the marks 
of the whip remain on their bodies till long afterwards, and cause them the 
greatest pain. As soon as they have set out on their road, they are all changed 
into wolves They travel in thousands, having for their conductor the bearer of 
the whip, after whom they march. When they reach the fields, they rush upon the 
cattle they find there, tearing and carrying away all they can, and doing much 
other damage; but they are not permitted to touch or wound persons. When they 
approach any rivers, their guide separates the waters with his whip, so that 
they seem to open up and leave a dry space by which to cross. At the end of 
twelve days the whole band scatters, and everyone returns to his home, having 
regained his own proper form. This transformation, they say, comes about in this 
wise. The victims fall suddenly on the ground as though they were taken with 
sudden illness, and remain motionless and extended like corpses, deprived of all 
feeling, for they neither stir, nor move from one place to another, nor are in 
any wise transformed into wolves, thus resembling carrion, for although they are 
rolled or shaken, they give no sign of life.&quot;</P>
<P>Bodin relates several cases of lycanthropy and of men changed into 
beasts.</P>
<P>&quot;Pierre Mamot, in a little treatise he has written on sorcerers, says 
that he has observed this changing of men into wolves, he being in Savoy at the 
time. Henry of Cologne in his treatise <I>de' Lamiis </I>regards the 
transformation as beyond doubt. And Ulrich in a little book dedicated to the 
emperor Sigismund, writes of the dispute before the emperor, and says that it 
was agreed, both on the ground of reason, and of the experience of innumerable 
examples, that such transformation was a fact; and he adds that he himself had 
seen a lycanthrope at Constance, who was accused, convicted, condemned, and 
finally executed after his confession. And several books published in Germany 
say that one of the greatest kings of Christendom, who is not long dead, and who 
had the reputation of being one of the greatest sorcerers in the world, often 
changed into a-wolf.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I remember that the attorney-general of the King, Bourdin, has narrated 
to me another which was sent to him from the Low Countries, with the whole trial 
signed by the judge and the clerks, of a wolf, which was struck by an arrow on 
the thigh, and afterwards found himself in bed, with the arrow (which he had 
torn out). on regaining his human shape, and the arrow was recognised by him who 
had fired it-the time and place testified by the confession of the 
person.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Garnier, tried and condemned by the parliament of Dole, being in the 
shape of a werwolf, caught a girl of ten or twelve years in a vineyard of 
Chastenoy, a quarter of a league from Dole, and having slain her with his teeth 
and claw-like hands, he ate part of her flesh and carried the rest to his wife. 
A month later, in the same form, he took another girl, and would have eaten her 
also, had he not, as he himself confessed, been prevented by three persons who 
happened to be passing by; and a fortnight after he strangled a boy of ten in 
the vineyard of Gredisans, and ate his flesh; and in the form of a man and not 
of a wolf, he killed another boy of twelve or thirteen years in a wood of the 
village of Porouse with the intention of eating him, but was again prevented. He 
was condemned to be burnt, and the sentence was executed.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;At the parliament of Bezancon, the accused were Pierre Burgot and 
Michel Verdun, who confessed to having<B> </B>renounced God, and sworn to serve 
the devil. And Michel Verdun led Burgot to the bord du Chastel Charlon where 
everyone carried a candle of green wax which shone with a blue flame. There they 
danced and offered sacrifices to the devil. Then after being anointed they were 
turned into wolves, running with incredible swiftness; then they were changed 
again into men, and suddenly transformed back to wolves, when they enjoyed the 
society of female wolves as much as they had done that of their wives. They 
confessed also that Burgot had killed a boy of seven years with his wolf-claws 
and teeth, intending to eat him, but the peasants gave chase, and prevented him. 
Burgot and Verdun had eaten four girls between them; and they had caused people 
to die by the touch of a certain powder.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Job Fincel, in the eleventh book of his <I>Marvels </I>wrote that there 
was at Padua a lycanthrope who was caught and his wolf-claws cut, and at the 
same instant he found his arms and feet cut. That is given to strengthen the 
case against the sorcerers of Vernon (<B>1556</B>) who assembled themselves in 
an old and ruined chateau under the shape of an infinite number of cats. There 
happened to arrive there one evening four or five men, who decided to spend the 
night in the place. They were awakened by a multitude of cats, who assaulted 
them, killed one of their number, and wounded others. The men, however, 
succeeded in wounding several of the cats, who found on recovering their human 
shape that they were badly hurt. And incredible as it may seem, the trial was 
not proceeded with.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But the five inquisitors who had experimented in these causes have left 
it in writing that there were three sorcerers in Strasbourg who, in the guise of 
three large cats, assaulted a labourer, and in defending himself he wounded and 
dispersed the cats, who found themselves, at the same moment, laid on sick-beds, 
in the form of women severely wounded. At the trial they accused him who had 
struck them, and he told the judges the hour and the place where he had been 
assaulted by the cats, and how he had wounded them.&quot; <I>(See 
</I><B>Lycanthropy.</B>)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>West Indian Islands :</B> Magic and sorcery in the <I>West Indian Islands 
</I>are wholly the preserve of the negro population, who possess special magical 
cults called <I>Obeah </I>and <I>Vaudoux, </I>variants of West African 
fetishism. The root idea of Obeahism and Vaudoux is the worship and propitiation 
of, the snake-god Obi-a West African word typifying the Spirit of Evil. Vaudoux 
or Voodoo is a form of Obeah practised in Haiti, San Domingo, and the French 
West Indies. Its rites are always accompanied by the sacrifice of fowls and 
goats, and in only too many cases by the offering up of the goat without horns 
&quot;-the human sacrifice, usually a young girl or boy. The lonely groves and 
mountain caves where the devotees of Vaudoux enjoy the orgies of a Walpurgis 
night seldom give up their secrets.. There are two sects of Vaudoux-the white 
and the red. The former, which only believes in the sacrifice of white fowls and 
goats, is tolerated by the laws of Haiti, and its rites are as commonly 
practised as those of the Catholic Church. But even the red sect, which openly 
stands for human sacrifice, is seldom interfered with. The authorities dare not 
suppress it, for their own policemen and soldiers stand in awe of the 
&quot;Papaloi&quot; and Mamaloi&quot;-the priests and priestess of the 
snake-god. More than that, there have been Presidents of Haiti in recent years 
who believed in Vaudoux. Hippolyte was even a &quot; Papaloi&quot; himself. He 
beat the black goatskin drum in the streets of the capital to call the faithful 
together to see him kill the <I>sen-sel </I>fowl. Another president, Geffard, 
tried to do his duty and stamp out the cult. A terrible revenge was taken upon 
him. His young daughter, Cora, was shot dead as she knelt in prayer before the 
altar of a church in Port-au-Prince. Today there is a temple of the red sect in 
the Haitian capital near a triumphal arch, which is inscribed with the unctuous 
words:- </P>
<P>&quot; Liberty - education - progress.&quot; Under British government 
Obeahism perforce takes forms less dangerous to the social order than it does in 
Haiti; but it is none the less a constant public peril in Jamaica and the other 
British <I>West Indian Islands. </I>It is a bitter foe of religion, education 
and social advancement In olden days it worked by means of wholesale poisoning, 
and in quite recent days there have been not a few cases of Obeahmen seeking to 
do murder in the old way. A favourite method of the Obeahmen, both in Jamaica 
and Haiti, is to mix the infinitesimal hairs of the bamboo in the food of 
persons who refuse to bow the knee to them. This finally sets up malignant 
dysentery. If the afflicted one remains contumacious, he dies if he makes his 
peace with the Obeahman, and gives him a handsome present, the slow process of 
poisoning ceases, and he lives. In all the crises and troubles of life the negro 
flies to the Obeahman. If he has to appear at the Police Court he pays the 
Obeahman to go there also and &quot;fix de eye&quot; of the magistrate, so that 
he will be discharged. Perhaps he has been turned out of his office of deacon in 
the Baptist Chapel by a white minister for immorality. In that case the Obeahman 
will arrange for a choice collection of the most powerful spells-such as dried 
lizards, fowls' bones, and graveyard earth-to be placed in the minister's Bible 
for him to stare upon when he looks up the text of his sermon. Then, if the 
Obeah works properly, the erring deacon will be received back to office. Even 
coloured men of education and official position are often tainted with Obeahism. 
They often make use of. it for profit and to increase their power over the 
ignorant negroes. The mulatto chairman of a Parochial Board-the Jamaican 
equivalent of our County Council-was sent to goal for practising Obeah only a 
few years ago. A prominent member of the Kingston City Council was the leading 
Obeahman in the island-the pontiff of the cult. He was so clever that the police 
could never catch him, although he was supposed to make over 
&pound;<B>3</B>,<B>000</B> a year by his nefarious practices. Once some 
detectives raided his place, but he received timely warning and fled.</P>
<P>A writer to the press thus describes a &quot; red &quot; Vaudoux ceremony: 
&quot; I had seen the ' white ritual several times in Port-au-Prince and 
elsewhere when at last I was permitted through the kindness of a mulatto 
general, to witness the ' red ' rite. I was informed that only cocks and goats 
would be sacrificed, and that turned out to be the fact. The General conducted 
me to a small wood about three miles from the town of Jacmel. By the light of 
kerosene oil flares I saw about forty men and women gathered round a rude stone 
altar, on which, twined around a <I>cocomacacque </I>stick, was the sacred green 
snake. The 'Mamoli' a tall, evil-looking negress, was dressed in a scarlet robe, 
with a red turban on her head. She was dancing a sinuous dance before the altar, 
and droning an ancient West African chant, which the onlookers repeated. Rapidly 
she worked herself up to a frantic pitch of excitement, pausing now and then to 
take a drink from one of the rum bottles which passed freely from hand to hand. 
At last she picked up a glittering <I>machete </I>from the altar, and with her 
other hand seized a black cock held by a bystander. She whirled the bird round 
her head violently until the feathers were flying in all directions, and then 
severed the head from the body with one swift stroke. The tense and horrible 
excitement had kept the worshippers silent, but they burst into a savage yell 
when the priestess pressed the bleeding neck of the slaughtered fowl to her 
lips. Afterwards she dipped her finger in the blood and made the sign of the 
cross on her forehead and pressed it to the forehead of some of her 
disciples.&quot;</P>
<P>The obeah man can always be easily recognised by one who has had much to do 
with negroes. He has an indescribably sinister appearance. He is unwashed, 
ragged, often half mad, usually diseased, and almost always has an ulcerated 
leg. This last, indeed, is a badge of the tribe. Often he is a very old negro 
who knew &quot;slavery days&quot; and more than half believes in his magical 
pretensions. But not all are of this disreputable type. Even some of the white 
planters themselves do not scorn to make use of obeah, although, of course, they 
have no belief in it. The theft of growing crops by the negroes is one of the 
greatest trials of their lives. Sometimes they adorn the trees round the edge of 
a&quot; banana piece&quot; or orange grove with miniature coffins, old bones, 
bottles of dirty water, and other obeah objects; and then the negroes will not 
dare to enter and steal. An interesting report published in a Jamaican journal 
during <B>1908</B> gives particulars of an obeah case of possession or haunting 
as follows:-</P>
<P>&quot;The <I>cause celebre </I>at Half-way Tree Court, Jamaica, recently, was 
the case of Rex v. Charles Donaldson for unlawfully practising obeah. Robert 
Robinson, who stated that he was a labourer living at Trench Pen, in the parish 
of St. Andrew, stated that on Tuesday, the <B>8</B>th ult., he was sitting down 
outside the May Pen cemetery on the Spanish Town Road. He was on his way from 
work, and had a white handkerchief tied around his head. He was feeling sick, 
and that led him to sit down. While there sitting the prisoner came to him. He 
did not know the man before, but he began by asking him what was the matter. 
Witness replied, &quot; I am well sick.&quot; The prisoner said, &quot; No, you 
are not sick; you have two ghosts on you-one creole and one coolie.&quot; 
Witness told the prisoner to go away and was left. He next saw prisoner on 
Wednesday <B>9</B>th. He came to him at Bumper Hall, where he was working, and 
he said to him, &quot;Man, how you find me here?&quot; &quot;Oh,&quot; replied 
the prisoner, &quot;if a man is in hell self I can find him; I come for you to 
give me the job ? &quot; Witness then inquired, &quot; What job?&quot; and 
accused told him he wanted to &quot;take off the two ghosts.&quot; He would do 
it for <B>25</B> pounds, and he&quot; killed&quot; for any sum from <B>25</B> 
pounds to <B>50</B> pounds. He had worked for all classes-white, black, coolie, 
Chinese, etc. Witness said he did not give him any &quot;good consent&quot; at 
the time, but reported the matter after the accused left to Clark and Wright, 
two witnesses in the case. Clark told him he must not scare the man but go home. 
On Thursday, the <B>10</B>th, the defendant came to him at his yard at French 
Pen. The accused told him he would come back to him to take off the ghost. He 
also told him to get a bottle of rum and <B>5</B>s. He (witness) consented to 
the arrangement. The defendant began by taking off his jacket. He then opened 
his &quot; brief bag&quot; and took out a piece of chalk. The accused then made 
three marks on the table and took out a phial and a white stone. The phial 
contained some stuff which appeared be quicksilver. He arrayed his paraphernalia 
on the table. They consisted of a large whisky bottle with some yellow stuff, a 
candle, a pack of cards, a looking-glass, three cigarette pictures, a pocket 
knife, etc. The accused also took out a whistle which he sounded, and then 
placed the cards on the table. He then asked for the <B>5</B>s. which was given 
to him. He placed the coins on the cards around a lighted candle. The pint of 
rum which he (witness) had brought was on the table and prisoner poured some of 
it into a pan. He went outside and sprinkled the rum at the four corners of the 
house. Accused came back in and said, &quot; Papa! papa! your case is very bad! 
There are two ghosts outside. The creole is bad, but the coolie is rather worse. 
But if he is made out of hell I will catch him.&quot;</P>
<P>The prisoner then began to blow his whistle in a very funny way-a way in 
which he had never heard a whistle blown before. He also began to speak in an 
unknown tongue and to call up the ghosts.</P>
<P>Mr. Lake - &quot; Aren't there a lot of you people who believe that ghosts 
can harm and molest you?</P>
<P>Witness-&quot; No, I am not one.'</P>
<P>Mr. Lake-&quot; Did you not tell him that a duppy struck you on your back and 
you heard voices calling you ?&quot;</P>
<P>Witness-&quot; He told me so.&quot; Continuing, witness said he had seen all 
sorts of ghosts at all different times and of different kinds also.</P>
<P>Mr. Lake&quot; Of all different sexes, man and woman?&quot; </P>
<P>Witness-&quot; Yes any man who can see ghosts will know a man ghost from a 
woman ghost. Dem never walk straight.&quot;</P><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Westcar Papyrus : </B>An Egyptian<B> </B><I>papyrus </I>dating from the 
eighteenth century B.C., devoted chiefly to tales of magic and enchantment. The 
commencement and ending are wanting, yet enough of the subject matter has 
survived to enable us to form a fairly correct idea of the whole. Wiedemann says 
concerning it (Popular Literature in Ancient Egypt) &quot;The <I>papyrus 
</I>tells how Kheops-the king whom notices of Greek writers have made 
universally famous as the builder of the Great Pyramid of Gizeh - commands 
stories of magic to be told to him. The first of these, of which the conclusion 
only remains, is supposed to have occurred in the reign of King T'eser of the 
Third Dynasty. The next, which is complete, belongs to the reign of Nebka, a 
somewhat earlier king. In those days it came to the ears of a great nobleman 
that his faithless wife was in the habit of meeting her lover by the side of a 
lake. Being skilled in magic he modelled a crocodile in wax and ordered one of 
his servants to cast it into the water. It was immediately transformed into a 
real crocodile and devoured the lover, Seven days later the king was walking by 
the lake with his friend the nobleman, when at the command of the latter the 
crocodile came to the shore and laid its victim at their feet. The king 
shuddered at the sight of the monster but at the touch of its maker it became 
once more a mere figure of wax. Then the whole astonishing story was told to the 
king. who thereupon granted the crocodile permission to take away that which was 
its own. The creature plunged into the depths of the lake and disappeared with 
the adulterer, while the guilty wife was burnt to death and her ashes were 
scattered in the stream.</P>
<P>A tale of enchantment follows, the scene of which is laid during the reign of 
King Sneferu, the predecessor of Kheops. The king was one day taking his 
pleasure on a lake in a boat rowed by twenty beautiful maidens, when one of the 
girls dropped a malachite ornament into the water. The king promised to give her 
another in its stead, but this did not content her, for she wanted her own jewel 
and no other. A magician was summoned who repeated a spell by the might of which 
he piled one half of the lake on the top of the other, so that the water, which 
at first was twelve ells deep in the middle of the lake, now stood twenty-four 
ells high. The jewel, found lying in the mud in the dry portion of the lake, was 
restored to its owner ; and the magician having once more mumbled his spell the 
water returned to its former place.</P>
<P>When Kheops had listened for some time with much interest to the accounts of 
the strange events that had transpired in the days of his predecessors, then 
stepped forward Prince Horduduf, who is really known to us from the song in the 
tomb-temple of King Antef as renowned for his wisdom. He told the king that all 
marvels were not things of the past but that even then there was living a 
magician named Deda, who was one hundred and ten years old, and consumed every 
day five hundred loaves, a side of beef, and a hundred jars of beer.</P>
<P>Kheops was so much interested that he sent the prince to escort the magician 
to his presence. Deda obeyed the royal summons and performed his chief feat 
before the King. This consisted in decapitating a goose, a duck, and an ox, and 
charming the heads back again on to the bodies so that the creatures lived and 
breathed as before. Kheops fell into talk with the magician, who told him that 
the wife of a priest in Sakhebu was awaiting the birth of three sons, children 
of the god Ra, who should one day sit on the throne of Egypt. Deda sought to 
allay the king's natural distress at this information by prophesying that only 
after the reigns of his son and grandson should the power fall into the hands of 
the descendants of the Sun-god. But Kheops was not to be consoled ; he inquired 
into the details of the story and announced that he would himself travel to 
Sakhebu, no doubt with the ultimate intention of finding an opportunity to put 
out of the way the pretenders to his throne.</P>
<P>The scene of the sequel is laid in Sakhebu. The birth and infancy of the 
three children are described in detail, and all sorts of marvellous incidents 
are represented as influencing their fate. The gods cared for the safety of the 
little ones. A maid to whom the secret was known being enraged by a severe 
punishment inflicted upon her, threatened to betray all to Kheops. Her own 
brother beat her, and when she went down to the water she was carried off by a 
crocodile. Here the <I>papyrus </I>ceases, but it is possible to a certain 
extent to restore the conclusion. The names of the three children of Ra show 
that they stand for the first three kings of the Fifth Dynasty, the family that 
followed the house of Kheops. The <I>papyrus </I>must therefore have told how 
the boys escaped all the snares laid for their lives and in due time ascended 
the throne for which they were destined.&quot;</P><B>

<P>Wild-Women : </B>A<B> </B>species of nature spirits believed in by the German 
peasantry. Says Keightley concerning them:</P>
<P>&quot;The <I>Wilde Frauen </I>or <I>Wild-women </I>of Germany bear a very 
strong resemblance to the Elle-maids of Scandinavia. Like them they are 
beautiful, have fine flowing hair, live within hills, and only appear singly or 
in the society of each other. They partake of the piety of character we find 
among the German Dwarfs.</P>
<P>&quot;The celebrated Wunderberg, or Wunderberg, on the great moor near 
Salzburg, is the chief haunt of the <I>Wild-women. </I>The Wunderberg is said to 
be quite hollow, and supplied with stately palaces, churches, monasteries, 
gardens, and springs of gold and silver. Its inhabitants, besides the 
<I>Wild-women, </I>are little men, who have charge of the treasures it contains, 
and who at midnight repair to Salzburg to perform their devotions in the 
cathedral; giants, who used to come to the church of Grodich and exhort the 
people to lead a godly and pious life ; and the great emperor Charles V., with 
golden crown and sceptre, attended by knights and lords. His grey beard has 
twice encompassed the table at which he sits, and when it has the third time 
grown round it, the end of the world and the appearance of the Antichrist will 
take place.</P>
<P>The following is the only account we have of the <I>Wild-women:-</I></P>
<P>&quot;The inhabitants of the village of Grodich and the peasantry of the 
neighbourhood assert that frequently, about the year <B>1753</B>, the 
<I>Wild-women </I>used to come out of the Wunderburg to the boys and girls that 
were keeping the cattle near the hole within Glanegg, and give them bread to 
eat</P>
<P>&quot;The <I>Wild-women </I>used frequently to come to where the people were 
reaping. They came down eagerly in the morning, and in the evening, when the 
people left off work, they went back into the Wunderburg without partaking of 
the supper.</P>
<P>&quot;It once fell out near this hill, that a little boy was sitting on a 
horse which his father had tethered on the headland of the field. Then came the 
<I>Wild-women </I>out of the hill and wanted to take away the boy by force. But 
the father, who was well acquainted with the secrets of this hill, and what used 
to occur there, without any dread hasted up to the women and took the boy from 
them, with these words : ' What makes you presume to come so often out of the 
hill, and now to take away my child with you ? What do you want to do with him 
?' The <I>Wild-women </I>answered He will be better with us, and have better 
care taken of him than at home. We shall be very fond of the boy, and he will 
meet with no injury' But the father would not let the boy out of his hands, and 
the <I>Wild-women </I>went away weeping bitterly.</P>
<P>&quot;One time the <I>Wild-women </I>came out of the Wunderberg, near the 
place called the Kugel-mill, which is prettily situated on the side of this 
hill, and took away a boy who was keeping cattle. This boy, whom every one knew, 
was seen about a year after by some wood-cutters, in a green dress, and sitting 
on a rock of this hill. Next day they took his parents with them, intending to 
search the hill for him, but they all went about it to no purpose, for the boy 
never appeared any more.&quot;</P><B>

<P>Will : </B>is in theology, one of the aspects of the triplicity, of the 
Logos, and hence since the Monad is essentially a part of the Logos, it is also 
an aspect of the Monad, taken on when the latter commences his descent into 
matter by entering the Spiritual World and appearing as Spirit.</P>

<P>William Rufus :</B> Son of William the Conqueror, and tyrant of England in 
the eleventh century; a wicked and cruel prince. He was much disliked, 
particularly by the priests and monks, whom he reduced to the extremest poverty. 
One day when he was out hunting (in the year <B>1100</B>, the forty-fourth year 
of his life, the thirtieth of his reign) he was killed by an arrow launched by 
an invisible hand. While he was drawing his last breath the Comte de 
Comonailles, who had been separated from the hunt, saw a shaggy black goat 
carrying off a mangled human form, pierced by an arrow. The comte cried aloud to 
the goat to halt, and asked who he was, and where he was going. The goat 
responded that he was the devil, and was carrying off <I>William Rufus, </I>to 
present him before the great tribunal, where he would be condemned for his 
tyranny and forced to accompany him (the devil) to his abode.</P>

<P>Williams, Charles :</B> An English medium who began to practice about 
<B>1870</B>. In <B>1871</B> he went into partnership with the medium Herne. 
During the earlier years of their mediumship Mrs. Guppy, herself a well-known 
medium, was their patroness. The phenomena then produced were not of a very 
ambitous character, but consisted of lights, apports, movements of the furniture 
without contact, spirit voices, and the appearance of fiery letters in the air. 
One of the most curious feats of these early seances was the transit of Mrs. 
Guppy. <I>(See </I><B>Levitation.</B>)<B> </B>Soon afterwards materialisation 
was attempted by Messrs. Herne and <I>Williams, </I>in emulation of the feats of 
Miss Florence Cook, who had been a sitter at their early seances. In <B>1878</B> 
<I>Williams's </I>was the mediumship chosen for investigation by the Research 
Committee of the British National Association of Spiritualists (q.v.). 
Notwithstanding the favourable report of the Committee, <I>Williams's 
</I>mediumship was not destined to last much longer. In company with a new 
partner, Rita, he had gone to Amsterdam, and there were found in their 
possession false beards, spirit draperies, and phosphorised oil. The exposure 
was entirely carried out and given to the public by indignant spiritualists.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Willow-tree :</B> The <I>Willow, </I>as might be expected, had many 
superstitious notions connected with it, since, according to the authorized 
version of the English Bible, the Israelites are said to have hung their harps 
on <I>willow trees. </I>The weeping <I>willow </I>is said to have, ever since 
the time of the Jews' captivity in Babylon, drooped its branches, in sympathy 
with this circumstance. The common <I>willow </I>was held to be under the 
protection of the devil and it was said that, if any were to cast a knot upon a 
young <I>willow, </I>and sit under it, and thereupon renounce his or her 
baptism, the devil would confer upon them supernatural power.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Windsor Castle :</B> <I>Windsor Castle </I>is said to be the haunt of 
numerous spectres. Queen Elizabeth, Henry VIII., Charles I., and some of the 
Georges have all been reputed to haunt the <I>Castle, </I>while Herne the Hunter 
(q.v.) is also said to roam the Great Park. An officer of the Foot Guards, while 
on duty, was once sitting in the library reading in the gloaming when he 
declares he heard a rustle of silken dress, and, looking up, saw the ghost of 
Queen Elizabeth glide across the room. He buckled on his sword, and reported the 
matter. The story attracted the attention of the country for some weeks. Sir 
Richard Holmes and his assistants kept watch for many nights, but the ghost did 
not re-appear. Not long ago a housemaid in St. John's Tower thought she saw a 
ghost, and was so frightened that she became ill, and had to be sent home. In 
<B>1908</B> a sentry discharged five rounds of ball cartridge at a figure which 
he declared was a spectre which appeared on the terrace.</P><B>

<P>Wirdig's Magnetic Sympathy :</B> The doctrine of magnetic attraction and 
repugnance formulated by <I>Tenzel Wirdig, </I>professor at Rostock, who 
published his <I>Tenzelius Wirdig, Nova medicina spirituum </I>in <B>1673</B>. 
<I>Wirdig </I>believed that everything in the universe possessed a soul, and 
that the earth itself was merely a larger animal. Between the souls of things in 
accordance with each other there was a magnetic sympathy and a perpetual 
antipathy between those of an uncongenial nature. To this sympathy and antipathy 
<I>Wirdig </I>gave the name of magnetism. He says:</P>
<P>&quot;Out of this relationship of sympathy and antipathy arises a constant 
movement in the whole world, and in all its parts, and an uninterrupted 
communion between heaven and earth, which produces universal harmony. The stars 
whose emanations consist merely of fire and spirits, have an undeniable 
influence on earthly bodies; and their influence on man demonstrates itself by 
life, movement, and warmth, those things without which he cannot live. The 
influence of tile stars is the strongest at birth. The new-born child inhales 
this influence, and on whose first breath frequently his whole constitution 
depends, nay, even his whole life.&quot;</P>

<P>Wisconsin Phalanx :</B> A spiritualistic community founded by Warren Chase in 
<B>1844</B>. Chase had settled in Southport, Wisconsin, in <B>1838</B>, and 
there, with his wife and child, he lived for a time in the deepest poverty. At 
length, however, their circumstances brightened, and Chase attained to a 
position of civic honour in Southport. Meanwhile he had studied mesmerism and 
socialism with the aid of a few periodicals-Laroy Sunderland's <I>Magnet </I>and 
the <I>New York Tribune-and </I>was filled with the idea of founding a community 
where his ideals of social order and harmony might be carried out. With the aid 
of his friends such a community was formed, each member with a share of 
twenty-five dollars. The chosen settlement-near the town of Ripon-was christened 
Ceresco, in honour of Ceres. For six years the <I>Wisconsin Phalanx 
</I>flourished, having as its leader and ruling spirit Warren Chase himself. But 
at last dissensions arose, and in <B>1850</B> it was dissolved, When its affairs 
were wound up it was found that a considerable profit fell to the share of its 
members. In all, it was one of the most successful spiritualistic or socialistic 
communities of the time.</P><B>

<P>Wisdom Religion </B><I>: (See </I><B>Theosophy.</B>)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Witchcraft :</B> (From Saxen <I>Wicca, </I>a contraction of <I>witega. </I>a 
prophet or sorcerer.) The cult of persons who, by means of satanic assistance or 
the aid of evil spirits or familiars, are enabled to practise minor black magic. 
But the difference between the sorcerer and the witch is that the former has 
sold his soul to Satan for complete dominion over him for a stated period, 
whereas the witch usually appears as the devoted and often badly treated servant 
of the diabolic power. But she is often mistress of a familiar, her bounden 
slave, and among certain savage peoples her occult powers are self-evolved. The 
concept of <I>witchcraft </I>was perhaps brought into being by the mythic 
influence of conquered races. It closely resembles in ritual and practice the 
demonism of savage races, from which it probably sprang.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<EM>(</EM><I>See </I><B>Devil Worship.</B>) That is, the non-Aryan peoples of 
Europe who preceded the Aryan population,. carrying on the practice and 
traditions of their religions more or less in secret, awoke in the Aryan mind 
the idea that such practices were of a &quot; magical&quot; character. This idea 
they would not fail to assist, and would probably exaggerate such details as 
most strongly impressed the Aryan mind, to which their gods would appear 
as&quot; devils,&quot; and their religious ritual as sorcery. This view has been 
combatted on the ground that the gap betwixt, say, the extinction of the 
pre-Aryan religion known as Druidism and the first notices of <I>witchcraft, 
</I>is too great to bridge. But Druidism continued to exist long after it was 
officially extinct, and British <I>witchcraft </I>is its lineal successor. The 
theory is further advanced that on the failure of the non-Aryan priesthood 
novices would be adopted from the invading race for the purpose of carrying on 
the old religion.. It seems to the present writer that the circumstance that the 
greater number of the upholders of this ancient tradition were women points to 
the likelihood of an early custom of the adoption or marriage of Aryan women by 
a non-Aryan people who would prefer to recruit their novices and devotees from 
the more plastic sex, naturally distrusting the masculine portion of an alien 
people to fall in with their religious ideas, and that the almost exclusive 
employment of women in the cult (in Britain, at least) originated in this 
practice. Then individually all claimed to have been initiated. Says Gomme, 
&quot; I am inclined to lay great stress upon the act of initiation. It 
emphasises the idea of a caste distinct from the general populace, and it 
postulates the existence of this caste anterior to the time when those who 
practice their supposed powers first come into notice. Carrying back this act of 
initiation age after age, as the dismal records of <I>witchcraft </I>enable us 
to do for some centuries, it is clear that the people from time to time thus 
introduced into the witch caste carried on the practices and assumed the 
functions of the caste even though they came to it as novices and strangers. We 
thus arrive at an artificial means of descent of a peculiar group of 
superstition, and it might be termed initiatory descent.&quot; This concept, 
thinks Gomme <I>(Folklore as an Historical Science, </I>p.<B>201</B> at seq.) 
was influenced in the Middle Ages by another.</P>
<P>&quot;Traditional practices, traditional formulae, and traditional beliefs 
are no doubt the elements of <I>witchcraft, </I>but it was not the force of 
tradition which produced the miserable doings of the Middle Ages, and of the 
seventeenth century against witches. These were due to a psychological force, 
partly generated by the newly acquired power of the people to<B> </B>read the 
Bible for themselves, and so to apply the witch stories of the Jews to 
neighbours of their own who possessed powers or peculiarities which they could 
not understand, and partly generated by the carrying on of traditional practices 
by certain families or groups of persons who could only acquire knowledge of 
such practices by initiation or family teaching. Lawyers, magistrates, judges, 
nobles and monarchs are concerned with <I>witchcraft. </I>These are not minds 
that have been crushed by civilisation, but minds which have misunderstood it or 
misused it.&quot;</P><I>
<P>Sabbath.-The </I>medieval criminal records abound in descriptions of a 
ceremony at which the rites of the witch cult were periodically celebrated. This 
was the witches' Sabbath. The Sabbath was generally held in some wild and 
solitary spot, often in the midst of forests or on the heights of mountains, at 
a great distance from the residence of most of the visitors. The circumstance 
connected with it most difficult of proof was the method of transport from one 
place to another. The witches nearly all agreed in the statement that they 
divested themselves of their clothes and anointed their bodies with an ointment 
made for that especial purpose. They then strode across a stick, or any similar 
article, and, muttering a charm, were carried through the air to the place of 
meeting in an incredibly short space of time. Sometimes the stick was to be 
anointed as well as their persons. They generally left the house by the window 
or by the chimney, which perhaps suggests survival of the custom of an 
earth-dwelling people. Sometimes the witch went out by the door, and there found 
a demon in the shape of a goat, or at times of some other animal, who carried 
her away on his back, and brought her home again after the meeting was 
dissolved. In the confessions extorted from them at their trials, the witches 
and sorcerers bore testimony to the truth of all these particulars; but those 
who judged them, and who wrote upon the subject, asserted that they bad many 
other independent proofs in corroboration.</P>
<P>We are told by Bodin that a man who lived at the little town of Loches having 
observed that his wife frequently absented herself from the house in the night, 
became suspicious of her conduct, and at last by his threats obliged her to 
confess that she was a witch, and that she attended the Sabbaths. To appease the 
anger of her husband, she agreed to gratify his curiosity by taking him with her 
to the next meeting, but she warned him on no account whatever to allow the name 
of God or of the Saviour to cross his lips. At the appointed time they stripped 
and anointed themselves, and, after uttering the necessary formula, they were 
suddenly transported to the <I>landes </I>of Bordeaux, at an immense distance 
from their own dwelling. The husband there found himself in the midst of a great 
assembly of both sexes in the same state of <I>deshabille </I>as himself and his 
wife, and in one part he saw the devil in a hideous form ; but in the first 
moment of his surprise he inadvertently uttered the exclamation, &quot; Mon 
<I>Dieu! ou sommes-nous ? &quot; </I>and all disappeared as suddenly from his 
view, leaving him cold and naked in the middle of the fields, where he wandered 
till morning, when the countrymen coming to their daily occupations told him 
where he was, and he made his way home in the best manner he could. But he lost 
no time in denouncing his wife, who was brought to her trial, confessed, and was 
burnt.</P>
<P>As the witches generally went from their beds at night to the meetings, 
leaving their husbands and family behind them, it may seem extraordinary that 
their absence was not more frequently perceived. They had, however, a method of 
providing against this danger, by casting a drowsiness over those who might be 
witnesses, and by placing in their bed an image which, to all outward 
appearance, bore an exact resemblance to themselves, although in reality was 
nothing more than a besom or some other similar article. But the belief was so 
inculcated that the witches did not always go in body to the Sabbath-that they 
were present only in spirit, whilst their body remained in bed, Some of the more 
rational writers on <I>witchcraft </I>taught that this was the only manner in 
which they were ever carried to the Sabbaths, and various instances are deposed 
to where that was manifestly the case. The president, Touretta told Bodin that 
he had examined a witch, who was subsequently burnt in the Dauphine, and who was 
carried to the Sabbath in this manner. Her master one night found her stretched 
on the floor before the fire in a state of insensibility and imagined her to be 
dead. In his attempt to arouse her, he first beat her body with great severity, 
and then applied fire to the more sensitive parts, which being without effect, 
he left her in the belief that she had died suddenly. His astonishment was great 
when in the morning he found her in her own bed, in an evident state of great 
suffering. When he asked what ailed her, her only answer was,&quot; Ha! mon 
maistre, tant m'avez batue!&quot;</P>
<P>When further pressed, however, she confessed that during the time her body 
lay in a state of insensibility, she had been herself to the witches' Sabbath, 
and upon this avowal she was committed to prison. Bodin further informs us that 
at Bordeaux, in <B>1571</B>, an old woman, who was condemned to the fire for 
<I>witchcraft, </I>and confessed that she was transported to the Sabbath in this 
manner. One of her judges, who was personally known to Bodin, while she was 
under examination, pressed her to show him how she was effected, and released 
her from the fetters for that purpose. She rubbed herself in different parts of 
the body with &quot; a certain grease,&quot; and immediately became stiff and 
insensible and, to all appearance, dead. She remained in this state about five 
hours, and then as quickly revived, and told her inquisitors a great number of 
extraordinary things, which showed that she must have been spiritually 
transported to far distant places.</P>
<P>The description of the Sabbath given by the witches differed only in slight 
particulars of detail for their examinations were all carried on upon one model 
and measure-a veritable bed of Procrustes, and equally fatal to those who were 
placed upon it. The Sabbath was, in general, an immense assemblage of witches 
and demons, sometimes from distant parts of the earth, at others only from the 
province or district in which it was held. On arriving, the visitors performed 
their homage to the evil one with unseemly ceremonies, and presented their new 
converts. They then gave an account of all the mischief they had done since the 
last meeting. Those who had neglected to do evil, or who had so far overlooked 
themselves as to do good, were treated with disdain, or severely punished. 
Several of the victims of the French courts in the latter part of this century 
confessed that, having been unwilling or unable to fulfil the commands of the 
evil one, when they appeared at the Sabbath he had beaten them in the most cruel 
manner. He took one woman, who had refused to bewitch her neighbour's daughter, 
and threatened to drown her in the Moselle. Others were plagued in their bodies, 
or by destruction of their property. Some were punished for their irregular 
attendance at the Sabbath ; and one or two, for slighter offences, were 
condemned to walk home from the Sabbath instead of being carried through the 
air. Those, on the other hand, who had exerted most their mischievous 
propensities were highly honoured at the Sabbath, and often rewarded with gifts 
of money. After this examination was passed, the demon distributed among his 
worshippers unguents, powders, and other articles for the perpetration of evil. 
A French witch, executed in <B>1580</B>, confessed that some of her companions 
offered a sheep or a heifer; and another, executed the following year, stated 
that animals of a black colour were most acceptable. A third, executed at 
Gerbeville in <B>1585</B> declared that no one was exempt from this offering, 
and that the poorer sort offered a hen or a chicken, and some even a lock of 
their hair, a little bird, or any trifle, they could put their hands upon. 
Severe punishments followed the neglect of this ceremony. In many instances, 
according to the confessions of the witches, besides their direct worship of the 
devil, they were obliged to show their abhorrence of the faith they had deserted 
by trampling on the cross, and blaspheming the saints, and by other 
profanations.</P>
<P>Before the termination of the meeting, the new witches received their 
familiars, or imps, who they generally addressed as their &quot; little 
masters,&quot; although they were bound to attend at the bidding of the witches, 
and execute their desires. These received names, generally of a popular 
character, such as were given to cats, and dogs, and other pet animals and the 
similarity these names bear to each other in different countries is very 
remarkable.</P>
<P>After all these preliminary ceremonies had been transacted, and a great 
banquet was laid out, and the whole company fell to eating and drinking and 
making merry. At times, every article of luxury was placed before them, and they 
feasted in the most sumptuous manner. Often, however, the meats served on the 
table were nothing but toads and rats, and other articles of a revolting nature. 
In general they had no salt, and seldom bread. But, even when best served, the 
money and the victuals furnished by the demons were of the most unsatisfactory 
character; a circumstance of which no rational explanation is given. The coin 
when brought forth by open daylight, was generally found to be nothing better 
than dried leaves or bits of dirt ; and, however, greedily they may have eaten 
at the table, they commonly left the meeting in a state of exhaustion from 
hunger.</P>
<P>The tables were next removed, and feasting gave way to wild and uproarious 
dancing and revelry. The common dance, or carole, of the middle ages appears to 
have been performed by the persons taking each other's hand in a circle, 
alternately a man and a woman. This, probably the ordinary dance among the 
peasantry, was the one generally practised at the Sabbaths of the witches, with 
this peculiarity, that their backs instead of their faces were turned inwards. 
The old writers endeavour to account for this, by supposing that it was designed 
to prevent them from seeing and recognising each other. But this, it is clear, 
was not the only dance of the Sabbath; perhaps more fashionable ones were 
introduced for witches in better conditions in society; and moralists of the 
succeeding age maliciously insinuate that many dances of a not very decorous 
character invented by the devil himself to heat the imaginations of his victims, 
had subsequently been adopted in classes in society who did not frequent the 
Sabbath. It may be observed, as a curious circumstance that the modern waltz is 
first traced among the meetings of the witches and their imps It was also 
confessed, in almost every case, that the dances at the Sabbaths produced much 
greater fatigue than commonly arose from such exercises. Many of the witches 
declared that, on their return home, they were usually unable to rise from their 
bed for two or three days.</P>
<P>Their music, also, was by no means of an ordinary character, The songs were 
generally obscene, or vulgar, or ridiculous. Of instruments there was 
considerable variety, but all partaking of the burlesque character of the 
proceedings. &quot;Some played the flute upon a stick or bone; another was seen 
striking a horse's skull for a lyre; there you saw them beating the drum on the 
trunk of an oak, with a stick ; here, others were blowing trumpets with the 
branches. The louder the instrument, the greater satisfaction it gave; and the 
dancing became wilder and wilder, until it merged into a vast scene of 
confusion, and ended in scenes over which, though minutely described in the old 
treatises on demonology, it will be better to throw a veil.&quot; The witches 
separated in time to reach their homes before cock-crow.</P>
<P>We then see that Satan had taken the place of the deities of the older and 
abandoned cults of the non-Aryans, whose obscene rites were attended by &quot; 
initiated &quot; or &quot;adopted&quot; neophytes of a race to the generality of 
which they were abominable, that witches often worked by means of familiars, 
whose shapes they were able to take, or by means of direct satanic agency. But 
there were probably mythological elements in <I>witchcraft </I>as well.</P><I>
<P>Powers of Witches -In </I>the eyes of the populace the powers of witches were 
numerous. The most peculiar of these were The ability to blight by means of the 
evil eye (q.v.) the sale of winds to sailors, power over animals, and capacity 
to transform themselves into animal shapes. Thus, says Gomme-&quot; The most 
usual transformations are into cats and hares, and less frequently into red 
deer, and these have taken the place of wolves. Thus, cat-transformations are 
found in Yorkshire, hare-transformations in Devonshire, Yorkshire and Wales, and 
Scotland, deer-transformations in Cumberland, raven-transformations in Scotland, 
cattle-transformations in Ireland. Indeed the connection between witches and the 
lower animals is a very close one, and hardly anywhere in Europe does it occur 
that this connection is relegated to a subordinate place. Story after story, 
custom after custom is recorded appertaining to <I>witchcraft, </I>and animal 
transformation appears always.</P>
<P>Witches also possessed the power of making themselves invisible, by means of 
a magic ointment supplied to them by the devil, and of harming others by 
thrusting nails into a waxen image representing them.</P><I>
<P>Witchcraft among Savage People.-Witchcraft </I>among savage people is, of 
course, allied to the various cults of demonism in vogue among barbarian folk 
all over the world. These are indicated in the various articles dealing with 
uncultured races. The name <I>witchcraft </I>is merely a convenient English 
label for such savage demon-cults, as is &quot; witch-doctors &quot; applied to 
those who smell out these practitioners of evil.</P><I>
<P>Evidence for Witchcraft.-The </I>evidence for <I>witchcraft, </I>says Podmore 
<I>(Modern Spiritualism) </I>falls under four main heads (a) the confessions of 
witches themselves ; (b) the corroborative evidence of lycanthropy, apparitions, 
etc. ; (c) the witch-marks ; (d) the evidence of the evil effects produced upon 
the supposed victims.</P>
<P>&quot;(a)-The confessions, as is notorious, were for the most part extracted 
by torture, or by lying promises of release. In England, where torture was not 
countenanced by the law, the ingenuity of Matthew Hopkins and other professional 
witch-finders could generally devise some equally efficient substitute, such as 
gradual starvation, enforced sleeplessness, or the maintenance for hours of a 
constrained and painful posture. But apart from these extorted confessions, 
there is evidence that in some cases the accused persons were actually driven by 
the accumulation of testimony against them, by the pressure of public opinion, 
and the singular circumstances in which they were placed, to believe and confess 
that they were witches indeed. Some of the women in Salem who had pleaded guilty 
to <I>witchcraft </I>explained afterwards, when the persecution had died down 
and they were released, that they had been consternated and affrighted even out 
of their reasons to confess that of which they were innocent. And there were not 
a few persons who voluntarily confessed to the practice of <I>witchcraft, 
</I>nocturnal rides, compacts with the devil, and all the rest of it.&quot; The 
most striking instances of this voluntary confession are afforded by children. 
For even among the earlier writers on <I>witchcraft </I>the opinion was not 
uncommonly held that the nocturnal rides and banquets with the devil were merely 
delusions, thought the guilt of the witch was not lessened thereby. And in the 
sixteenth centuries, at least in English-speaking countries this belief seems to 
have been generally alike by believers in <I>witchcraft </I>and their opponents. 
Thus Gaule: &quot; But the more prodigious or stupendous (of the things narrated 
by witches in their confessions) are effected merely by the devil the witches 
all the while either in a rapt ecstasie, a charmed sleepe, or a melancholy 
dreame; and the witches imagination, phantasie, common sense, only deluded with 
what is now done, or pretended. Even Antoinette Bourignon, observing her 
scholars eat &quot; great pieces of bread and butter&quot; at breakfast, pointed 
out-to them that they could not have such good appetites if they had really fed 
on dainty meats at the devil's Sabbath the night before.</P>
<P>&quot;(b)-But if the witch's own account of her marvellous feats may be 
explained as, at best, the vague remembrance of a nightmare, it is hardly 
necessary to go beyond this explanation to account for the prodigies reported by 
others. In most cases there is no need to suppose even so much foundation for 
the marvels, since the evidence <I>(e.g., </I>for lycanthropy) is purely 
traditional. And when we get accounts at first hand, they are commonly 
concerned, not with such matters as levitation, or transformation of hares into 
old women, but merely with vague shapes seen in the dusk, or the unexplained 
appearance of a black dog. Even so the evidence comes almost exclusively from 
ignorant peasants, and is given years after the events.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;(c)-The evidence for &quot; witch-marks &quot; does not greatly concern 
us. The insensible patches on which Matthew Hopkins and other witch-finders 
relied may well have been genuine in some cases. Such insensible areas are known 
to occur in hysterical subjects, and the production of insensibility by means of 
suggestion is a commonplace in modern times. The supposed witches' teats, which 
the imps sucked, appear to have been found almost exclusively, like the imps 
themselves, in the English-speaking countries. Any watt, boil, or swelling would 
probably form a sufficient warrant for the accusation ; we read in Cotton Mather 
of a jury of women finding I preter-natural teat upon a witch's body, which 
could not be discovered when a second search was made three or four hours later, 
and of a witch's mark upon the finger of a small child, which took the form 
of&quot; a deep red spot, about the bigness of a flea-bite.&quot; And the 
witch-mark which brought conviction to the mind of Increase Mather in the case 
of George Burroughs was his ability to hold a heavy gun at arm's length, and to 
carry a barrel of cider from the canoe to the shore.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;(d)-Of most of the evidence based upon the injuries suffered by the 
witches' supposed victims, it is difficult to speak seriously. If a man's cow 
ran dry, if his horse stumbled, his cart stuck in a gate, his pigs or fowls 
sickened, if his child had a fit, his wife or himself an unaccustomed pain, it 
was evidence acceptable in a court of law against any old woman who might be 
supposed within the last twelve months-or twelve years-to have conceived some 
cause of offence against him and his. Follies of this kind are too well known to 
need repetition.</P>
<P>But there is another feature of <I>witchcraft, </I>at any rate of the cases 
occurring in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries in England and America, 
which is not so well recognised, and which has a more direct bearing upon our 
present inquiry-the predominant part played in the initial stages of witch 
persecution by malevolent or merely hysterical children and young 
women.&quot;</P><I>
<P>Symptoms of Bewitchment. </I>-Mr. Pod more remarks: &quot;The symptoms of the 
alleged bewitchment were, in all these cases monotonously alike. The victims 
would fall into fits or convulsions, of a kind which the physicians called in 
were unable to diagnose or to cure. In these fits the children would commonly 
call out on the old woman who was the imaginary cause of their ailment; would 
profess, at times, to see her shape present in the room, and would even stab at 
it with a knife or other weapon. (In the most conclusive cases the record 
continues that the old woman, being straightway sought for, would be found 
attempting to conceal a corresponding wound on her person.) These fits, which 
sometimes lasted, with slight intermission, for weeks together would be 
increased in violence by the approach of the supposed witch; or, as Hutchinson 
notes, by the presence of sympathetic spectators. The fits, as was also commonly 
noted by contemporary chroniclers, would diminish or altogether cease when the 
witch was imprisoned or condemned; on the other hand, if the supposed witch were 
released the victim would continue to suffer horrible tortures, insomuch that at 
the Salem trials one old woman who had been acquitted by the jury was, because 
of the hideous outcry from the afflicted persons in court, straightway re-tried 
and condemned. The witch's touch would always provoke severe attacks, indeed, 
contact with the witch or the establishment of rapport between her and the 
victim by means of some garment worn by the latter, as in Mistress Faith 
Corbet's case, was generally regarded as an essential pre-requisite of the 
enchantment. Once this rapport established the mere look of the witch, or the 
direction of her evil will would suffice. The afflicted in Salem were, as the 
Mathers testify, much tortured in court by the malevolent glances of the poor 
wretches on trial ; and two ' visionary' girls added greatly to the weight of 
the evidence by foretelling with singular accuracy, when such or such of the 
afflicted persons then present would feel the baneful influence, and howl for 
anguish. It should be added-though the evidence as we now understand the word, 
for the fact alleged is of course practically negligible-that it was commonly 
reported that the witch's victim could, although blindfolded, distinguish her 
tormentor by the touch alone from all other persons, and could even foresee her 
approach and discern her actions at a considerable distance.</P>
<P>&quot;The effect of the convulsions and cataleptic attacks, which modern 
science would unhesitatingly dismiss as being simply the result of hysteria, was 
heightened in many cases by manifestations of a more material kind. It was a 
common feature for the victim to vomit pins, needles, wood, stubble, and other 
substances ; or for thorns or needles to be found embedded in her flesh. In a 
case recorded by Glanvil an hysterical servant girl, Mary Longdon, in addition 
to the usual fits, vomiting of pins, etc., was tormented by stones being 
continually flung at her, which stones when they fell to the ground straightway 
vanished. Her master bore witness in court to the falling of the stones and 
their miraculous disappearance. Moreover, the same Mary Longdon would frequently 
be transported by an invisible power to the top of the house, and there &quot; 
laid on a board betwixt two Sollar beams,&quot; or would be put into a chest, or 
half suffocated between two feather-beds.</P>
<P>&quot;Gross as these frauds appear to us, it is singular that for the most 
part they remained undetected, and even, it would seem, unsuspected, not merely 
by the ignorant peasants, for whose benefit the play was acted in the first 
instance, but in the larger theatre of a law court. But there are some notorious 
instances of confession or detection. Edmund Robinson, the boy on whose 
accusation the Lancashire witches were tried, subsequently confessed to 
imposture. Other youths were detected with blacklead in their mouths when 
foaming in sham epileptic fits, colouring their urine with ink, concealing 
crooked pins about their persons in order to vomit them later, scratching the 
bed posts with their toes, and surreptitiously eating to repletion during a 
pretended fast. But commonly the spectators were so convinced beforehand of the 
genuineness of such portents that they held it superfluous to examine the claims 
of any particular performance of this kind on their credence.</P>
<P>&quot;It is difficult to know in such cases where self-deception ends and 
where malevolent trickery begins. Nor would the examination of these bygone 
outbreaks of hysteria trivial in themselves as terrible in their consequences-be 
of interest in the present connection, except for the fact that we find here the 
primitive form of those Poltergeist manifestations which gave the popular 
impetus in <B>1848</B> to the belief in Modern Spiritualism, and which are still 
appealed by those who maintain the genuineness of the physical manifestations of 
the seance room as instances of similar phenomena occurring 
spontaneously.&quot;</P><I>
<P>Difference between British and Continental Witchcraft.-</I>The salient 
difference between British and Continental <I>witchcraft </I>systems seems to 
have been that whereas the former was an almost exclusively female system, the 
Continental one favoured the inclusion in the ranks of sorcerers (as foreign 
witches were called) of the male element; this at least was the case in France 
and Germany, but there is evidence that in Hungary and the Slavonic countries, 
the female element was the more numerous. In Ireland we find women also 
pre-eminent; this is probably to be accounted for by the circumstance before 
noted that the non-alien priesthoods in their decline became almost entirely 
dependent upon the offices of women. But the various forms of <I>witchcraft 
</I>are duly entered in the several articles dealing with European 
countries.</P><I>
<P>Growth of Belief in Witchcraft.-It </I>is significant that in early times the 
supernatural side of <I>witchcraft </I>won little public credence. People 
believed in such things as magical poisoning and the raising of tempests by 
witches. but they refused to give credence to such superstitions as that the 
witch rode through the air, or had communion in any way with diabolic agency. As 
early as <B>800</B> A.D. an Irish synod pronounced the belief of flight through 
the air and vampirism, to be incompatible with Christian doctrine, and many 
early writers like Stephen of Hungary and Regino state that flight by night and 
kindred practices are merely a delusion. Indeed those who held these beliefs 
were actively punished by penance. In face of the later development of belief in 
<I>witchcraft, </I>this frank scepticism is almost amazing, and it is most 
strange that the tenth and eleventh centuries should have rejected superstitions 
embraced widely by the sixteenth and seventeenth.</P>
<P>From the thirteenth to the fifteenth centuries we find the conception of 
<I>witchcraft </I>and demonology greatly furthered and assisted by the writings 
of scholars and the institution of the Inquisition to deal with the rise of 
unbelief. A vast amount of literature was circulated dealing with questions 
relating to magic and sorcery, and regarding the habits and customs of witches, 
magicians and practitioners in&quot; black magic,&quot; and many hairs were 
split. The Church gladly joined in this campaign against what it regarded as the 
forces of darkness, and indeed both accused and accusers seem to have lingered 
under the most dreadful delusions-delusions which were to cost society dear as a 
whole. The scholastic conception of demonology was that the witch 'was not a 
woman but a demon. Rationalism was at a discount and the ingenuity of medieval 
scholars disposed of all objections to the phenomena of <I>witchcraft. </I>The 
deities of pagan times were cited as practitioners of sorcery, and erudition, 
especially in- ecclesiastical circles, ran riot on the subject. There also arose 
a class of judges or inquisitors like Bodin in France and Sprenger in Germany, 
who composed lengthy treatises upon the manner of discovering witches, of 
putting them to the test, and generally of presiding in <I>witchcraft 
</I>trials. The cold-blooded cruelty of these textbooks on current demonology 
can only be accounted for by the likelihood that their authors felt themselves 
justified in their composition through motives of fidelity to their church and 
religion. The awful terror disseminated especially among the intelligent by the 
possibility of a charge of <I>witchcraft </I>being brought against them at any 
moment brought about an intolerable condition of things. The intellectual might 
be arraigned at any time on a charge of <I>witchcraft </I>by any rascal who 
cared to make it. Position or learning were no safeguard against such a charge, 
and it is peculiar that the more thoughtful and serious part of the population 
should not have made some attempt to put a period to the dreadful condition of 
affairs brought about by ignorance and superstition. Of course the principal 
reason against their being able to do so was the fact that the whole system was 
countenanced by the Church, in whose hands the entire procedure of trials for 
<I>witchcraft </I>lay.</P>
<P>Strangely enough convents and monasteries were often the centres of demoniac 
possession. The conception of the incubi and succubi undoubtedly arose from the 
ascetic tortures of the monk and the nun. Wholesale trials, too, of wretched 
people who were alleged to attend Sabbatic orgies of the enemy of mankind on 
dreary heaths were gone through with an elaborateness which spread terror in the 
public mind. The tortures inflicted on those unfortunates were generally of the 
most fiendish description, but they were supposed to be for the good of the 
souls of those who bore them. In France the majority of these trials took place 
in the fifteenth century; whereas in England we find that most of them were 
current in the seventeenth century. Full details regarding these will be found 
in the articles <B>France </B>and <B>England</B>. The famous outburst of 
fanaticism in New England under Cotton Mather <I>(See </I><B>America.</B>)<B> 
</B>in <B>1691</B> to <B>1692</B> was by no means the last in an 
English-speaking country, for in <B>1712</B> a woman was convicted of 
<I>witchcraft </I>in England, and in Scotland the last trial and execution for 
sorcery took place in <B>1722</B>. In Spain we find burnings by the Inquisition 
in <B>1781</B> ; in Germany as late as <B>1793</B>, and as regards Latin South 
America a woman was burned in Peru so recently as <B>1888</B>. The death of the 
belief in <I>witchcraft </I>was brought about by a more sane spirit of criticism 
than had before obtained. Even the dull wits of the inquisitorial and other 
courts began to see that the wretched creatures upon whom they passed sentence 
either confessed because of the extremity of torture they had to suffer, or else 
were. under hallucination regarding the nature of their connection to the 
satanic power. Reginald Scot in his <I>Discover; of Witchcraft </I>(<B>1584</B>) 
proved that the belief on the part of the witch that she was a servant of the 
Devil was purely imaginary, and in consequence drew upon his work the wrath of 
the British Solomon, James I., who warmly replied to him in his <I>Demonologie. 
</I>But Friedrich von Spee's <I>Cautio Criminalis, </I><B>1631</B>, advanced 
considerations of still greater weight from the rationalistic point of 
view-considerations of such weight indeed that Bodin, the archdemonologist, 
denounced him and demanded that he should be added to the long list of his 
victims.</P><I>
<P>Psychology of Witchcraft.-No </I>doubt exists nowadays when the conditions of 
savage <I>witchcraft </I>have been closely examined and commented upon, that the 
witch and the sorcerer of the Middle Ages, like their prototypes among the 
native races of Africa, America, Asia and elsewhere, have a firmly-rooted belief 
in their own magical powers, and in their connection with unseen and generally 
diabolic agencies. It is a strange circumstance that in many instances the 
confessions wrung from two or more witches, when a number of them have been 
concerned in the same case, have tallied with one another in almost every 
detail. This would imply that these women suffered from collective 
hallucination, and actually believed that they had seen the supernatural beings 
with whom they confessed fellowship, and had gone through the rites and acts for 
which they suffered. A period arrived in the medieval campaign against 
<I>witchcraft </I>when it was admitted that the whole system was one of 
hallucination; yet, said the demonologists, this was no palliation of the 
offence, for it was equally as evil to imagine such diabolic acts as actually to 
take part in them.</P>
<P>There is also evidence which would lead to the belief that the witch 
possessed certain minor powers of hypnotism and telepathy, which would give her 
real confidence in her belief that she wielded magical terrors. Again the 
phenomena of spiritualism and the large possibilities it offers for fraud 
suggest that some kindred system might have been in use amongst the more shrewd 
or the leaders in these Sabbatic meetings, which would thoroughly convince the 
ignorant among the sisterhood of the existence in their midst of diabolic 
powers. Trance and hysteria, drugs and salves, there is good reason to believe, 
were also used unsparingly, but the' great source of witch-belief undoubtedly 
exists in auto-suggestion, fostered and fomented from ecclesiastical and 
scholastic sources, and by no means lessened by popular belief.</P>
<P>Since the above article was written an exhaustive examination of the 
phenomena of <I>witchcraft </I>has been made by Miss M. A. Murray, lecturer on 
Egyptology at University College, London, Basing her conclusions upon the 
suggestions of C. G. Leland, in his &quot;Aradia, or the Witches of Italy,&quot; 
and those of other modern writers, she inclines to the hypothesis that 
witchcraft was in reality the modern and degraded descendant of an ancient 
nature-religion, the rites of which were actually carried out in deserted places 
and included child-sacrifice and other barbarous customs. In the Satanic 
presence at such gatherings she sees the attendance of a priest of the cult. In 
brief, her hypothesis tends to prove the actual reality of the witch-religion as 
against that of hallucination which, until recently, was the explanation 
accepted by students of the subject. Her remarks, too, upon the familiar, go to 
show that a large body of proof exists for the belief that this conception also 
rested upon actual occurrences. <I>(See </I>her papers in <I>Man </I>and 
elsewhere.)</P>
<P>Recent researches on the part of the writer have convinced him of the 
soundness of these views, but have added the conviction that witchcraft religion 
was, in some manner, possessed of an equestrian connection, the precise nature 
of which is still dark to him. The broomstick appears to be the magical 
equivalent of a horse, the witches occasionally rode to the Sabbath on 
horseback, and one of the tests for a witch was to see if her eye held the 
reflection or likeness of a horse. May it not be that the witch-religion was the 
remnant of a prehistoric horse-totem cult ? But this is, after all, merely of 
the nature of surmise. The writer has also found good evidence for the existence 
of a witch-cult precisely similar to that of Europe in pre-Columbian Mexico, and 
has even encountered a picture of a naked witch with peaked cap riding on a 
broomstick in the native Mexican painting known as the Codex Fejervary-Mayer, 
which seems to show that the witch-religion was in no sense limited to Europe, 
and was of most ancient origin.</P>

<P>Wolf, The :</B> Amongst the ancient Romans, the wolf was a fruitful source of 
augury, and many are the tales in which he has figured as a good or evil omen. A 
<I>wolf </I>running to the right with his mouth full was a sign of great joy. If 
a <I>wolf, </I>after he had entered a Roman camp, escaped unhurt it was regarded 
as a sign of defeat ; and the terrible result of the second Punic war was said 
to have been augured from the carrying off of the sword of a sentinel in the 
camp by a <I>waif. </I>Plutarch tells of a <I>wolf </I>who ate the landmarks of 
a proposed new settlement at Libya and thus stopped its colonisation; but later 
another <I>wolf </I>which had stolen a burnt sacrifice led his pursuers to a 
place where they afterwards settled in. It is said that a <I>wolf </I>ran off 
with Hiero's slate when he was a schoolboy, and this was regarded as a sign of 
his future greatness. The peasants of Sweden do not dare to speak of a <I>wolf 
</I>by name but call him the &quot; grey one&quot; or &quot; old grey&quot; : 
they seem to regard the pronouncing of his name as unlucky.</P><B>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Worlds, Planes, </B>or <B>Spheres :</B> According to theosophists, these are 
seven in number and are as follows: The older Sanskrit names, which are now 
superseded, being given for reference -Divine, or <I>Adi; </I>Monadic or 
<I>Anutadaka, </I>Spiritual or <I>Nirvana, </I>Intuitional or <I>Buddhi, 
</I>Mental or <I>Manas, </I>Astral or <I>Karma, </I>and Physical or <I>Sthula. 
</I>These worlds are not physically separate in the manner which planets appear 
to be, but interpenetrate each other, and they depend for their differences, on 
the relative density of the matter which composes them, and the consequent 
difference in the rates at which the matter of each world vibrates.</P>
<P>Except for the physical world (the densest) our knowledge of them, so far as 
it extends, is dependent on clairvoyance, and the more exalted the vision of the 
clairvoyant the higher the world to which his vision can pierce. Each world has 
its appropriate inhabitants, clothed in appropriate bodies, and possessing 
appropriate states of consciousness. The two highest worlds, the Divine and the 
Monadic are at present incapable of attainment by human powers, the remaining 
five are in greater or less degree. The monad for the purpose of gathering 
experience and for development, finds it necessary to pass downwards into the 
material sphere, and, when it has taken possession of the spiritual, 
intuitional, and higher Mental Worlds, it may be looked on as an ego or soul 
embodying will, intuition and intellect, continuing eternally the same entity. 
never altering except by reason of increasing development, and hence being 
immortal. These Worlds, however, do not afford sufficient scope to the Monad and 
it presses c ill farther down into matter, through the lower Mental, into the 
Astral and Physical Worlds. The bodies with which it is there clothed form its 
personality and this personality suffers death and is renewed at each fresh 
incarnation. At the death of the physical body, the ego has merely cast aside a 
garment and thereafter continues to live in the next higher world, the 
Astral.</P>
<P>At the death of the Astral body in turn, another garment is cast aside, the 
ego is clear of all appendages and as it was before its descent into denser 
matter, having returned to the Mental World, the Heaven World. The ego finds 
itself somewhat strange to this owing to insufficient development, and it again 
descends into matter as before. This round is completed again and again, and 
each time the ego returns with a fresh store of experience and knowledge, which 
strengthens and perfects the mental body. When at last this process is complete, 
this body in turn is cast aside and the ego is clothed with its casual body. 
Again it finds itself strange and the round of descents into matters again 
begins and continues till the casual body has been fully developed. The two 
remaining worlds are but imperfectly known but the intuitional, as it's name 
indicates is that where the ego's vision is quickened to see things as they 
really are, and in the Spiritual World the divine and the human become unified 
and the divine purpose is fulfilled. </P>

<P>Wraith : </B>The apparition or &quot;double&quot; of a living person, 
generally supposed to be an omen of death. The wraith closely resembles its 
prototype in the flesh, even to details of dress. It is believed possible for 
people to see their own <I>wraiths, </I>and among those who have been warned of 
approaching dissolution in this wise are numbered Queen Elizabeth, Shelley, and 
Catherine of Russia, the latter of whom, seeing her &quot; double&quot; seated 
upon the throne, ordered her guards to fire upon it I But <I>wraiths </I>of 
others may appear to one or more persons. Lord Balcarres saw the <I>wraith 
</I>of his friend &quot; Bonnie Dundee&quot; at the moment when the latter fell 
at Killiecrankie, while Ben Jonson saw his eldest son's double when the original 
was dying of the plague. The belief flourishes also on the continent, and in 
different parts of Britain it goes under different names, such as 
&quot;waff,&quot; &quot; swarth,&quot; &quot; task,&quot; &quot;fye,&quot; etc. 
Variants of the <I>wraiths </I>are the Irish &quot; fetch &quot; (q.v.), and the 
Welsh &quot;lledrith.&quot; In Scotland it was formerly believed that the 
<I>wraith </I>of one about to die might be seen wrapped in a winding-sheet. The 
higher the shroud reached the nearer was the approach of death. Something 
analogous to wraith-seeing comes within the scope of modern psychical science, 
and the apparition is explained in various ways, as a projection of the 
&quot;astral body,&quot; an emanation from the person of its living prototype, 
or, more scientifically perhaps, on a telepathic basis. A well-known case in 
point is that of the Birkbeck Ghost, where three children witnessed the 
apparition of their mother shortly before her death. This instance, which is 
recorded in the &quot; Proceedings&quot; of the Psychical Research Society, is 
noteworthy because of the fact that Mrs. Birkbeck was conscious before she died 
of having spent the time with her children.</P><B>
