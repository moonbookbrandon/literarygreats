<P>Labadie, Jean :</B> A fanatic of the seventeenth century, born in <B>1610</B> 
at Bourg, on the Dordogne. He declared himself a second John the Baptist, sent 
to announce the second coming of the Messiah. He even went so far as to claim 
some measure of divinity for himself. But to his ambition as a votary he joined 
a taste for more worldly pleasures, which he indulged under the mask of 
religion. He died in <B>1674</B>. Among his works (which were condemned) was 
<I>Le Veritable Exorcisme, au l'unique moyen de chasser le diable du, monde

<P>Lady-bird :</B> A rustic mode of divination was that practised with the 
<I>lady-bird </I>or lady-fly. The <I>lady-bird </I>was captured by a maid and 
bidden to fly &quot;north, south, or east, or west&quot; in the direction in 
which her lover lived. Whichever way the insect flew, there dwelt her future 
husband.</P>

<P>Lady of Lawers :</B> One of the Breadalbane family. of Scottish origin, and 
married to Campbell of Lawers. This gentle-woman was believed to be gifted with 
prophetic powers, and her prophecies are said to be written in a book shaped 
like a barrel and kept in the charter room of Taymouth Castle: it is named 
&quot; The Red Book of Balloch.&quot; These forecasts all have reference to the 
house and lands of Breadalbane; we give the following as an example :-&quot; 
When the red cairn on Ben Lawers fell the church would split. In the same year 
that the cairn, built by the sappers and miners on Ben Lawers, fell, the 
Disruption in the Church of Scotland took place.&quot;</P>

<P>Lam :</B> A magical word in Hindu yoga practice.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Lamb :</B> <I>Dr. Lamb </I>was a noted sorcerer in the time of Charles the 
First. The famous Richard Baxter, in his <I>Certainty of the World of Spirits, 
</I>printed in <B>1691</B>, has recorded an appropriate instance of the 
miraculous performance of this man. Meeting two of his acquaintance in the 
street, and they having intimated a desire to witness some examples of his 
skill, he invited them home with him. He then conducted them into an inner room, 
where presently, to their no small surprise, they saw a tree spring up in the 
middle of the apartment. They had scarcely ceased wondering at this phenomenon, 
when in a moment there appeared three diminutive men, with little axes in their 
hands for the purpose of cutting down this tree. The tree was felled; and the 
doctor dismissed his guests, fully satisfied of the solidity of his pretensions. 
That very night, however, a tremendous hurricane arose, causing the house of one 
of the guests to rock from side to side, with every appearance that the building 
would come down, and bury him and his wife in the ruins. The wife in great 
terror asked &quot; Were you not at <I>Dr. Lamb's </I>to-day?&quot; The husband 
confessed it was true. &quot;And did you not bring something away from his house 
?&quot; The husband owned that, when the little men felled the tree, he had 
picked up some of the chips, and put them in his pocket. Nothing now remained to 
be done but to produce the chips, and get rid of them as fast as they could. 
This ceremony performed, the whirlwind immediately ceased, and the remainder of 
the night passed quietly.</P><I>
<P>Dr. Lamb </I>at length became so odious by his reputation for these infernal 
practices, that the populace rose upon him in <B>1640</B>, and tore him to 
pieces in the streets. Nor did the effects of his ill-fame -terminate here. 
Thirteen years after, a woman, who had been his servant maid, was apprehended on 
a charge of witchcraft, was tried, and in expiation of her crime was executed at 
Tyburn.</P>

<P>Lamps, Magic :</B> There dwelt at Paris in the time of St. Louis, a famous 
Jewish Rabbi called Jachiel, a great manufacturer of prodigies, who was regarded 
by the Jews as one of their saints, and by the Parisians as a sorcerer. During 
the night when everyone was asleep, he was wont to work by the light of a magic 
lamp which cast through his chamber a glow like that - of day itself. He never 
replenished this lamp with oil, nor otherwise attended to it, and folks began to 
hint that he had acquired it through diabolic agencies. If anyone chanced to 
knock at his door during the night they noticed that the lamp threw out sparks 
of light of various colours, but if they continued to rap the lamp failed and 
the Rabbi turning from his work touched a large nail in the middle of his table 
which connected magically with the knocker on the street-door, giving to the 
person who rapped upon it something of the nature of an electric shock. <I>(See 
</I><STRONG>France.</STRONG>)</P><I>
<P>Lamps </I>of this description were supposed to be known to the Rosicrucians, 
and it is said that in opening the tomb of a daughter of Cicero several <I>lamps 
</I>were found burning upon it. It is of course possible that the light from 
these was luminous or phosphorescent and not living flame.</P>
<P>The magic <I>lamp </I>of Aladdin will occur to everyone in this connection; 
and romance abounds in such vehicles of light.</P><B>
<P>Lancashire Witches :</B> A story with many pathetic and pitiable features, 
and one which is eloquent of the ignorance and credulity of the age, is that of 
the <I>Lancashire Witches. </I>Not very far from Manchester lies Pendelbury 
Forest, a gloomy though romantic and picturesque spot. At the time when it was 
inhabited by the witches-that is to say, about the beginning of the <B>17</B>th 
century-it was held in such terror by law-abiding folks that they scarcely dared 
to approach it. They imagined it to be the haunt of witches and demons, the 
scene of all sorts of frightful orgies and diabolical rites. So that when Roger 
Nowel, a country magistrate, hit upon the plan of routing the witches out of 
their den, and thus ridding the district of their malevolent influence, he 
fancied he would be doing a public-spirited and laudable action. He promptly 
began by seizing Elizabeth Demdike and Ann Chattox, two women of eighty years of 
age, one of them blind, and the other threatened with blindness, both of them 
living in squalor and abject poverty. Demdike's daughter, Elizabeth Device, and 
her grandchildren, James and Alison Device, were included in the accusation, and 
Ann Redferne, daughter of Chattox was apprehended with her mother. Others were 
seized in quick succession-Jane Bulcock and her son John, Alice Nutter, 
Catherine Hewitt, and Isabel Roby. All of them were seduced-by what means it 
were better not to enquire too closely-to make a more or less detailed 
confession of their communication with the Devil. When this had been extorted 
from them. they were sent to prison in Lancaster Castle, some fifty miles away, 
there to await trial for their misdeeds.</P>
<P>They had not lain in prison very long when the authorities were informed that 
about twenty <I>witches </I>had assembled on Good Friday, at Malkin's Tower, the 
home of Elizabeth Device, in order to compass the death of one Covel, to blow up 
the castle in which their companions were confined, and rescue the prisoners, 
and also to kill a man called Lister, which last purpose they accomplished by 
means of diabolical agency. In the summer assizes of <B>1612</B> the prisoners 
were tried for witchcraft, and were all found guilty. The woman Demdike had died 
in prison, and thus escaped a more ignominious death at the gallows. The 
principal witnesses who appeared against Elizabeth Device were her 
grandchildren, James and Jennet Device. Directly the latter entered the 
witness-box her grandmother set up a terrible yelling punctuated by bitter 
execrations. The child, who was only nine years of age, begged that the prisoner 
might be removed as she could not otherwise proceed with her evidence. Her 
request was granted, and she and her brother swore that the Devil had visited 
their grandmother in the shape of a black dog, and asked what were her wishes. 
She had intimated that she desired the death of one John Robinson, whereupon the 
fiend told leer to make a clay image of Robinson and gradually crumble it to 
pieces, saying that as she did so the man's life would decay and finally perish. 
On such evidence ten persons were hanged, including the aged Ann Chattox.</P>
<P>It is shocking to reflect that, at a period when literature and learning were 
at their height, such cruelty could be tolerated, not only by the vulgar and 
uneducated, but by the learned judges who pronounced the sentence. The women 
were old and ignorant and probably weak-minded. No doubt they began in time to 
invest themselves with those powers, which their neighbours credited to them, 
and to believe themselves fit objects for the awe and terror of the people. It 
is even possible that they may have seen some sort of visions, or 
hallucinations, which they persuaded themselves were evil spirits attending on 
them Thus their own cunning and ignorance may have hastened their downfall.</P>
<P>Twenty-two years later a similar outrage, on the same spot, was narrowly 
avoided, by the shrewdness of the judge who tried the case. A certain misguided 
man, by name Edmund Robinson, thought to profit by the general belief in 
witchcraft. To this end he taught his young son, a boy of eleven to say that one 
day he encountered in the fields two dogs, with which he tried to catch a hare. 
But the animals would not obey his bidding, and at length he tied them to a post 
and whipped them, when they immediately turned into <I>a witch </I>and her imp. 
This monstrous story gained such credence that when Robinson declared that his 
son possessed a sort of second-sight, which enabled him to distinguish a 
<I>witch </I>at a glance, no one thought of denying his statement. Accordingly, 
he took the boy to the neighbouring churches, set him on a bench, and bade him 
point out the <I>witches. </I>No less than seventeen persons were thus accused 
and might have been hanged had not the judge's suspicions been aroused by the 
story, for the jury did not hesitate to convict them. However, the doubts of the 
worthy judge gained a respite for the prisoners, some of whom were sent to 
London for examination by the King's physician and by the king himself. The 
boy's story was investigated and found to be merely a tissue of lies, as, 
indeed, the child himself confessed it to be. <I>(See </I>Whitaker, <I>The 
History of Whalley, </I>p.<B>215</B>.)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Lapis Exilis :</B> A name applied to the Graal itself. It is this stone which 
causes the phoenix to renew her youth. <I>Lapis Exilis, </I>according to Wolfram 
von Eschenbach, was synonymous with the Holy Grail.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Lapis Judaicus :</B> Also identified with the Graal and the Talismanic stone 
of inexhaustible feeding power. It is sometimes called Theolithos, and seems but 
another name for the Lapis Exilis (q.v.) It has been confounded with the Phoenix 
stone. Another legend clings to it: it is said to have fallen from the crown of 
Lucifer, as he was banished from heaven, and remains in the keeping of the 
angels of the air.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Lapland :</B> The Laplanders have a reputation for magical practice which is 
almost proverbial throughout Europe, and certainly so among the peoples of the 
Scandinavian Peninsula. Indeed the Finns still credit them with extraordinary 
power in sorcery and divination. Many Scandinavian scions of nobility were in 
ancient times sent to <I>Lapland </I>to obtain a magical reputation, and Eric 
the son of Harold Haarfager found Gunhild, daughter of Asur Tote, sonjourning 
among the Lapps in A.D. <B>922</B> for that purpose. English literature abounds 
with reference to <I>Lapland </I>witches. But Sorcery in <I>Lapland </I>was a 
preserve of the male shamans or magicians. Like the Celtic witches the Lapps 
were addicted to the selling of wind or tempests in knotted ropes.</P>
<P>Scheffer in his <I>Lapponia </I>(<B>1674</B>) writing of Lapp magic says 
:-&quot; The melancholic constitution of the Laplanders, renders them subject to 
frightful apparitions and dreams, which they look upon as infallible presages 
made to them by the Genius of what is to befall them. Thus they are frequently 
seen lying upon the ground asleep, some singing with a full voice, others 
howling and making a hideous noise not unlike wolves.</P>
<P>&quot;Their superstitions may be imputed partly to their living in solitudes, 
forests, and among the wild beasts partly to their solitary way of dwelling 
separately from the society of others, except who belong to their own families 
sometimes several leagues distance. Hereafter it may be added. that their daily 
exercise is hunting, it being observed that this kind of life is apt to draw 
people into various superstitions, and at last to a correspondence with spirits. 
For those who lead a solitary life being frequently destitute of human aid, have 
oft-times recourse to forbidden means, in hopes to find that aid and help among 
the spirits, which they cannot find among men; and what encourages them in it is 
impunity, these things being committed by them, without as much as the fear of 
any witnesses; which moved Mr. Rheen to allege, among sundry reasons which he 
gives for the continuance of the impious superstitions of the Laplanders, this 
for one: because they live among inaccessible mountains, and at a great distance 
from the conversation of other men. Another reason is the good opinion they 
constantly entertain of their ancestors, whom they cannot imagine to have been 
so stupid as not to understand what God they ought to worship, wherefore they 
judge they should be wanting in their reverence due to them, if, by receding 
from their institutions, they should reprove them of impiety and ignorance.</P>
<P>&quot;The parents are the masters, who instruct their own sons in the magical 
art. 'Those,' says Tornaeus, 'who have attained to this magical art by 
instructions receive it either from their parents, or from somebody else, and 
that by degrees which they put in practice as often as an opportunity offers. 
Thus they accomplish themselves in this art, especially if their genius leads 
them to it. For they don't look upon every one as a fit scholar; nay, some are 
accounted quite incapable of it, notwithstanding they have been sufficiently 
instructed, as I have been informed by very credible people.' And Job. Tornaeus 
confirms it by these words: ' As the Laplanders are naturally of different 
inclinations, so are they not equally capable of attaining to this art.' And in 
another passage, they bequeath the demons as part of their inheritance, which is 
the reason that one family excels the other in this magical art. From whence it 
is evident, that certain whole families have their own demons, not only 
differing from the familiar spirits of others, but also quite contrary and 
opposite to them. Besides this, not only whole families, but also particular 
persons, have sometimes one, sometimes more spirits belonging to them, to secure 
them against the designs of other demons, or else to hurt others. Claus Petri 
Niurenius speaks to this effect, when he says &ndash; &lsquo; They are attended 
by a certain number of spirits, some by three, others by two, or at least by 
one. The last is intended for their security, the other to hurt others. The 
first commands all the rest. Some of those they acquire with a great deal of 
pains and prayers, some without much trouble, being their attendants from their 
infancy.' Joh. Tornaeus gives us a very large account of it. 'There are some,' 
says he, 'who naturally are magicians; an abominable tiling indeed. For those 
who the devil knows which will prove very serviceable to him in this art, he 
seizes on in their very infancy with certain distemper, when they are haunted 
with apparitions and visions, by which they are, in proportion of their age, 
instructed in the rudiments of this art. Those who are a second time taken with 
this distemper, have more apparitions coming before them than in the first, by 
which they receive much more insight into it than before. But if they are seized 
a third time with this disease, which then proves very dangerous, and often not 
without the hazard of their lives, then it is they see all the apparitions the 
devil is able to contrive, to accomplish them in the magical art. Those are 
arrived to such a degree of perfection, that without the help of the drum (see 
infra), they can foretell things to come a great while before; and are so 
strongly possessed by the devil, that they foresee things even against their 
will. Thus, not long ago, a certain Laplander, who is still alive, did 
voluntarily deliver his drum to me, which I had often desired of him before; 
notwithstanding all this, he told me in a very melancholy posture, that though 
he had put away his drum, nor intended to have any other hereafter, yet he could 
foresee everything without it, as he had done before. As an instance of it, he 
told me truly all the particular accidents that had happened to me in my journey 
into <I>Lapland, </I>making at the same time heavy complaints, that he did not 
know what use to make of his eyes those things being presented to his sight much 
against his will.'</P>
<P>&quot;Lundius observes, that some of the Laplanders are seized upon by a 
demon, when they are arrived to a middle age, in the following manner: -Whilst 
they are busy in the woods, the spirit appears to them, where they discourse 
concerning the conditions, upon which the demon offers them his assistance, 
which done, he teaches them a certain song, which they are obliged to keep in 
constant remembrance. They must return the next day to the same place, where the 
same spirit appears to them again, and repeats the former song, in case he takes 
a fancy to the person; if not, he does not appear at all. These spirits make 
their appearances under different shapes, some like fishes, some like birds, 
others like a serpent or dragon, others in the shape of a pigmee. about a yard 
high; being attended by three, four, or five other pigmees of the same bigness, 
sometimes by more, but never exceeding nine. No sooner are they seized by the 
Genius, but they appear in the most surprising posture, like madmen, before 
bereaved of the use of reason. This continues for six months; during which time 
they don't suffer any of their kindred to come near them, not <B>50</B> much as 
their own wives and children. They spend most of this time in the woods and 
other solitary places, being very melancholy and thoughtful scarce taking any 
food, which makes them extremely weak. It you ask their children, where and how 
their parents sustain themselves, they will tell you, that they receive their 
sustenance from their Genii. The same author gives us a remarkable instance of 
this kind in a young Laplander called Olaus, being then a scholar in the school 
of Liksala, of about eighteen years of age. This young fellow fell mad on a 
sudden, making most dreadful postures and outcries, that he was in hell, and his 
spirit tormented beyond what could be expressed. If he took a book in hand; so 
soon as he met with the name of Jesus, he threw the book upon tile ground in 
great fury, which after some time being passed over, they used to ask him 
whether he had seen any vision during this ecstacy ? He answered that abundance 
of things had appeared to him, and that a mad dog being tied to his foot, 
followed him wherever he stirred. In his lucid intervals he would tell them, 
that the first beginning of it happened to him one day, as he was going out of 
the door of his dwelling, when a great flame passed before his eyes and touching 
his ears, a certain person appeared to him all naked. The next day he was seized 
with a most terrible headache, so that he made most lamentable outcries, and 
broke everything that came under his hands. This unfortunate person's face was 
as black as coal, and he used to say, that the devil most commonly appeared to 
him in the habit of a minister, in a long cloak; during his fits he would say 
that he was surrounded by nine or ten fellows of a low stature, who did use him 
very barbarously, though at the same time the standers-by did not perceive the 
least thing. like it. He would often climb to the top of the highest fir trees, 
with as much swiftness as a squirrel, and leap down again to the ground, without 
receiving the least hurt. He always loved solitude, flying the conversation of 
other men. He would run as swift as a horse, it being impossible for anybody to 
overtake him. He used to talk amongst the woods to himself no otherwise than if 
several persons had been in his company.</P>
<P>I am apt to believe, that those spirits were not altogether unknown to the 
ancients, and that they are the same which were called by Tertullian <I>Paredri, 
</I>and are mentioned by Monsieur Valois, in his <I>Ecclesiastical History of 
Eusebius.</I></P>
<P>Whenever a Laplander has occasion for his familiar spirit, he calls to him, 
and makes him come by only singing the song he taught him at their first 
interview; by which means he has him at his service as often as he pleases. And 
because they know them obsequious and serviceable, they call them <I>Sveie, 
</I>which signifies as much in their tongue, as the companions of their labour, 
or their helpmates. Lundius has made another observation, very well worth taking 
notice of, viz. -That those spirits or demons never appear to the women, or 
enter into their service, of which I don't pretend to allege the true cause, 
unless one might say, that perhaps they do it out of pride, or a natural 
aversion they have to the female sex, subject to so many infirmities.&quot;</P>
<P>For the purposes of augury or divination the Lapps employed a magic drum, 
which, indeed, was in use among several Arctic peoples. Writing in <B>1827</B>, 
De Capell Brooke states that the ceremonies connected with this instrument had 
almost quite disappeared at that date. The encroachments of Lutheranism had been 
long threatening the existence of the native shamanism. In <B>1671</B> the Lapp 
drum was formally banned by Swedish law, and several magicians were apprehended 
and their instruments burnt. But before that date the religion which the drum 
represented was in full vigour. The Lapps called their drum <I>Kannus 
</I>(Regnard, <B>1681</B>), also <I>Kaunus, Kabdas, Kabdes Gabdas, </I>and 
<I>Keure </I>(Von Duben, <B>1873</B>.) its Scandinavian designations being 
<I>troll-trumma, </I>or <I>Ruec-bomme,&quot; </I>magic or runic drum,&quot; 
otherwise <I>Spa-trumma, </I>fortune-telling drum.&quot; J. A. Friis has shown 
that the <I>sampo </I>of the Finnish <I>Kelevala </I>is the same instrument. 
According to Von Duben, the best pictures and explanations of the drum are to be 
found in Friss's <I>Lappisk Mythologi </I>(Christiania, <B>1871</B>), pp. 
<B>30</B>-<B>47</B>, but there are good descriptions in Von Duben's own work 
<I>(On Lapland, och Lapparne, </I>Stockholm, <B>1873</B>), as also in the books 
of Scheffer, Leem, Jessen, and others. The appearance of the Lapp drum is thus 
described by Regnard in <B>1681</B> -This instrument is made of a single piece 
of wood, hollowed in its thickest part in an oval form, the under part of which 
is convex, in which they make two apertures long enough to suffer the fingers to 
pass through, for the purpose of holding it more firmly. The upper part is 
covered with the skin of the reindeer, on which they paint in red a number of 
figures, and from whence several brass rings are seen hanging, and some pieces 
of the bone of the reindeer.&quot; A wooden hammer, or, as among the Samoyeds 
(<B>1614</B>), a hare's foot was used as a drum-stick in the course of the 
incantation. An <I>arpa </I>or divining-rod was placed on a definite spot 
showing from its position after sounding the drum what magic inference might be 
drawn. By means of the drum, the priest could be placed <I>en rapport </I>with 
the spirit world, and was thus enabled to divine the future; to ascertain 
synchronous events occurring at remote distances ; to forecast the measure of 
success attending the day's hunting; to heal the sick; or to inflict people with 
disease and cause death. Although obsolete in <I>Lapland </I>these rites are 
still performed among the Samoyeds and other races of Arctic Asia and America. 
It is interesting to note how exactly the procedure among the Vaigatz Samoyeds 
in <B>1556</B> <I>(Pinkerton's Voyages, </I>London, <B>1808</B>, I.<B>63</B>) 
tallies with that of the Saklialin Amos in <B>1883</B> (J. M. Dixon in Trans, 
Asiatic Soc. of Japan, Yokohama, <B>1883</B>, <B>47</B>). The same practices can 
be traced eastward through Arctic America, and the drum is used in the same 
fashion by the Eskimo shaman priests in Greenland (Henry Rink's <I>Tales, 
</I>etc., <B>1875</B>, <B>60</B>-<B>61</B>.) The shape of the drum varies a 
little according to locality. The form of the Eskimo drum is that of a 
tambourine.</P>
<P>&quot;Their most valuable instrument of enchantment,&quot; says Tornaeus, 
&quot; is this sorcerer's kettle-drum, which they call Kannas or Quobdas. They 
cut it in one entire piece out of a thick tree stem, the fibres of which run 
upwards in the same direction as the course of the sun. The drum is covered with 
the skin of an animal; and in the bottom holes are cut by which it may be held. 
Upon the skins are many figures painted, often Christ and the Apostles, with the 
heathen gods, Thor, Noorjunkar, and others jumbled together; the picture of the 
sun, shapes of animals, lands and waters, cities and roads, in short, all kinds 
of drawings according to their various uses. Upon the drum there is placed an 
indicator, which they call <I>Arpa, </I>which consists of a bundle of metallic 
rings. The drumstick is, generally, a reindeer's horn. This drum they preserve 
with the most vigilant care, and guard it especially from the touch of a woman. 
When they will make known what is taking place at a distance,-as to how the 
chase shall succeed, how business will answer, what result a sickness will have, 
what is necessary for the cure of it, and the like, they kneel down, and the 
sorcerer heats the drum; at first with light strokes, but as he proceeds, with 
ever louder stronger ones, round the index, either till this has moved in a 
direction or to a figure which he regards as the answer which he has sought, or 
till he himself falls into ecstasy, when he generally lays the kettle-drum on 
his head. Then he sings with a loud voice a song which they call <I>Jogke, 
</I>and the men and woven who stand round sing songs, which they call <I>Daura, 
in </I>which the name of the place whence they desire information frequently 
occurs. The sorcerer lies in the ecstatic state for some time, frequently for 
many hours, apparently dead, with rigid features ; sometimes with perspiration 
bursting out upon him. In the meantime the bystanders continue their 
incantations, which have for their object that the sleeper shall not lose any 
part of his vision from memory; at the same time they guard him carefully that 
nothing living may touch him- not even a fly. When he again awakes to 
consciousness, he relates his vision, answers the questions put to him, and 
gives unmistakable evidence of having seen distant and unknown things. The 
inquiry of the oracle does not always take place so solemnly and completely. In 
everyday matters as regards the chase, etc., the Lapp consults his drum without 
falling into the somnambulic crisis. On the other hand, a more highly developed 
state of prophet vision may take place without this instrument, as has already 
been stated. Claudi relates, that at Bergen, in Norway, the clerk of a German 
merchant demanded of a Norwegian Finn-Laplander what his master was doing in 
Germany. The Finn promised to give him the intelligence. He began then to cry 
out like a drunken man, and to run round in a circle, till he fell, as one dead, 
to the earth. After a while he woke again, and gave the answer, which time 
showed to be correct. Finally, that many, while wholly awake, free from 
convulsions and a state of unconsciousness, are able to become clairvoyant, is 
placed beyond all doubt by the account of Tornaeus.</P>
<P>&quot;The use which they make of their power of clairvoyance, and their magic 
arts, is, for the most part, good and innocent; that of curing sick men and 
animals; inquiring into far-off and future things, which in the confined sphere 
of their existence is important to them. There are instances however, in which 
the magic art is turned to the injury of others.&quot;</P>

<P>Lascaris :</B> (Alchemist of the Eighteenth Century.) It is impossible to 
determine the date at which this mysterious personage was born, or to say, 
exactly, whence he came and where he chiefly lived. He is commonly supposed to 
have been active about the beginning of the eighteenth century, while Germany is 
held to have been the principal scene of his activities; but everything recorded 
concerning him reads like a romance, and suggests the middle ages rather than 
the day before yesterday. Sometimes he assured people that he was of Oriental 
origin, sometimes he maintained that his native land was the Ionian Isles, and 
that he was a scion of the Greek royal house of <I>Lascaris; </I>while on other 
occasions he declared that he was an archimandrite of a convent in the Island of 
Mytilene, and that his object in coming to Europe was to solicit alms for the 
ransom of Christian prisoners in the East. Such was his tale when, about 
<B>1700</B>, he commenced wandering in Germany, and, while sojourning at Berlin, 
he happened to fall ill and sent for medical aid. This appeared shortly in the 
shape of a young apothecary, Johann Friedrich Botticher by name, who chanced to 
be deeply interested in alchemy. so a friendship sprang up between physician and 
patient and ere <I>Lascaris </I>left the Prussian capital he gave Botticher a 
packet of transmuting powder, at the same time instructing him how to use it 
successfully, yet refraining from telling him how to manufacture the powder 
itself. Nothing daunted, Botticher set to work speedily, concocted considerable 
quantities of gold and silver, grew rich, and was raised to the peerage; while 
simultaneously he began to find his society, and more especially his services as 
a scientist, courted by kings and nobles. Meanwhile, however, his supply of the 
precious powder had run short, and being unable to make more he found his 
reputation waning apace; while worse still, he had spent his newly-acquired 
wealth speedily, and now he found himself reduced to penury. Ultimately he was 
incarcerated, but during his period of durance vile he set himself to the 
manufacture of porcelain, and by the sale of this he eventually restored his 
fallen fortunes.</P>
<P>We presume naturally that it was gratitude to his physician which inspired 
the crafty alchemist to give Botticher the powder, but why did <I>Lascaris 
</I>make an analogous present at a later date ? The recipient on this occasion 
being one Schmolz de Dierbach, a lieutenant-colonel in the Polish Army. He, like 
the German apothecary, succeeded in making a quantity of gold, and, though we 
hear no more about him after this transmutation, we learn that a certain Baron 
de Creux was likewise favoured by <I>Lascaris, </I>the Baron's experiments 
proving just as successful as those of the others aforesaid. Nor were these the 
only people on whom our alchemist bestowed his indulgence, for one Domenico 
Manuel, the son of a Neapolitan mason, was likewise given a packet of 
transmutatory powder, and, armed thus, he wandered through Spain, Belgium, and 
Austria, performing operations before princes and noblemen, and reaping wealth 
accordingly. Pride was the inevitable result of this, and though there is no 
reason to suppose that any patent of nobility was ever conferred on Domenico, we 
find him styling himself now Comte Gautano, now Comte di Ruggiero; while in one 
town he maintained that he was a Prussian major-general, and elsewhere he 
declared that he was field-marshal of the Bavarian forces. Going to Berlin in 
the course of his perambulations, he offered to make gold in the presence of the 
king; but alas I his operation proved utterly futile, and he was hanged as a 
charlatan in consequence. This was in <B>1709</B>, and in the same year, 
according to tradition, <I>Lascaris </I>himself performed some successful 
transmutations before a German politician named Liebknech, a citizen of 
Wurtembourg. Nothing further is heard of the mysterious Greek alchemist, 
however, so it may be assumed that he died soon after these events. His was a 
curious career indeed : his generosity having scarcely a parallel in the whole 
history of hermetic philosophy.</P>

one may enter without the loss of a hand or a foot. Dietrich and his follower 
Witege, enter it, and the latter rides through the rose bushes. Laurin, the 
dwarf, appears, on horseback and dismounts Witege. He is challenged by Dietrich 
and, assuming his cloak of invisibility, wounds him. Dietrich now persuades him 
to a wrestling match and wrenches off the dwarf's belt which gives him 
super-human strength. Thus he overthrows <I>Laurin. Laurin </I>then invites 
Dietrich and his followers to his mountain home, prepares them a banquet, makes 
them tipsy, and throws them all into a dungeon. They are released by Kunhild, a 
mortal woman, who restores their weapons. They take <I>Laurin </I>prisoner and 
carry him to Bern where he becomes a Christian convert and receives Kunhild in

<P>Law, William :</B> English Mystic and Theologian (<B>1686</B>-<B>1761</B>.) 
<I>William Law </I>was born at Kingscliffe, Northamptonshire, in the year 
<B>1686</B>. His father followed the humble calling of a grocer, but it is 
manifest that he was in tolerably affluent circumstances nevertheless, and 
ambitious besides, for in <B>1705</B> <I>William </I>was sent to Cambridge 
University. Entering Emmanuel College, he became a fellow thereof in 
<B>1711</B>, but on the accession of George I. he felt himself unable to 
subscribe the oath of allegiance, the inevitable consequence being that he 
forfeited his fellowship. In <B>1727</B> he went to Putney, having acquired 
there the post of tutor to the father of Edmund Gibbon, the historian of the 
Roman Empire in decline, and he acted in this capacity for ten years, winning 
universal esteem the while for his piety and his theological erudition. In 
<B>1737</B>, on the death of his employer, <I>Law </I>retired to his native 
village of Kingscliffe, and it would seem that thenceforth he was chiefly 
supported by the purses of some of his devotees, notably Miss Hester Gibbon, 
sister of his guardian pupil, and a widow named Mrs. Hutcheson. These two ladies 
had a united income of fully &pound;<B>3000</B> a year, so <I>Law </I>must have 
been comfortable indeed, yet wealth and luxury did not tend to corrupt his 
piety, and it is recorded that he was wont to get up every morning at five, and 
spend several hours before breakfast in prayer and meditations. At a 
considerably earlier stage in his career he had begun publishing theses on 
mysticism, and on religion in general; and now, being blessed with abundance of 
leisure, and having acquired fresh inspiration from reading the works of Jacob 
Boehme, he produced year after year a considerable mass of writing. Thus his 
life passed away placidly, and he died in <B>1761</B>.</P><I>
<P>Law's </I>works amount in all to some twenty volumes. His <I>debut </I>as a 
writer was made in <B>1717</B>, with an examination of certain tenets lately 
promulgated from the pulpit by the Bishop of Bangor; and this was followed soon 
afterwards by a number of analogous writings, while in <B>1726</B> he employed 
his pen to attack the theatre, bringing out a book entitled <I>The Absolute 
Unlawfulness of the Stage Entertainment fully Demonstrated. </I>In the same year 
he issued <I>A Practical Treatise upon Christian Perfection, </I>and this was 
followed shortly by <I>A Serious Call </I>to: a <I>Devout and Holy Life, adapted 
to the State and Condition of all Orders of Christians. </I>This last is the 
best-known of his works, but others which it behoves to cite are <I>The Grounds 
and Reason of Christian Regeneration </I>(<B>1739</B>), <I>The Spirit of Prayer 
</I>(<B>1749</B>), <I>The Way to Divine Knowledge </I>(<B>1752</B>), <I>The 
Spirit of Love </I>(<B>1752</B>), and <I>Of Justification by Faith and Works 
</I>(<B>1760</B>). Most of the foregoing, but especially the <I>Serious Call, 
</I>have been reprinted again and again; while in <B>1762</B> a collected 
edition of <I>Law's </I>works was published, and in <B>1893</B> there appeared a 
sort of anthology, made up of extracts from the writer, chosen by Dr. Alexander 
Whyte. In his preface the editor speaks of <I>Law's </I>&quot; golden 
books,&quot; while he adds that &quot;In sheer intellectual strength <I>Law 
</I>is fully abreast of the very foremost of his illustrious contemporaries, 
while in that fertilising touch which is the true test of genius, <I>Law 
</I>stands simply alone.&quot; Numerous other encomiums no less enthusiastic 
than this have been offered to the mystic, and it is noteworthy that he has 
engaged the interest of many great writers. Sir Leslie Stephen, for example, 
deals with him in his <I>History of English Thought in the Eighteenth Century, 
</I>and again in his pleasant <I>Studies of a Biographer; </I>while the mystic 
figures also in the brilliant pages of W. E. H. Lecky, and in Gibbon's 
<I>Autobiography </I>he is hailed as &quot;a worthy and pious man, who believed 
all that he professed, and practised all that he enjoined.&quot;</P>

<P>Le Normand, Marie</B> <B>:</B> Known as &quot;The Sybil of the Faubourg Saint 
Germain,&quot; was born at Alencon in <B>1772</B> and died at Paris in 
<B>1843</B>. She was one of the most famous occultists and diviners of her day; 
but it might justly be said that her art was much more the product of sound 
judgment than of any supernatural gift. She predicted their futures to Marat, 
Robespierre, and St. Just, but we hear no more of her under the Directory. When 
Josephine Beauharnais came into prominence as the intended wife of Napoleon, 
Mile. La Normand was received at all those houses and salons where the future 
empress had any influence. Josephine was extremely credulous, and used to read 
her own fortunes to herself on the cards; but when she found that <I>MIle. 
</I>Le <I>Normand </I>was an adept at this art, she often had her in attendance 
to assist her in it. Even Napoleon himself who was not without his own 
superstitions, had his horoscope read by her. She soon set up her own salon in 
Paris where she read people's fortunes by means of the cards. It is not stated 
whether these cards were of the nature of Tarot cards, but it is more than 
likely that they were; but we know that she occasionally divined the fortunes of 
others through playing the games of piquet, sept, and other card games. She did 
not hide her methods from others, but the Parisian society of her day appears to 
have thought that her power of divination lay not in the cards she manipulated 
but in her personality. It has been stated by Migne that she did use the Tarot, 
but as he calls them &quot; German cards,&quot; one cannot attach much 
importance to his statement. After the fall of the Emperor she was the rage 
amongst the Russian, German and English officers in Paris, and even the Emperor 
Alexander and other potentates consulted her. Shortly after this she went to 
Brussels, where she read the fortune of the Prince of Orange, but as she tried 
to cheat the customs she soon found herself the occupant of a Belgian prison. By 
the year <B>1830</B> she had become quite forgotten, and when the newspapers 
announced her death on June <B>25</B>th, <B>1843</B>, the majority of people 
failed to remember her name. There is very little doubt that she was a harmless 
charlatan, though several contemporary historians appear to consider that she 
possessed mischievous tendencies ; but the air of omniscience and mystery with 
which she surrounded herself was <B>50</B> absurd that by the majority of people 
she was looked upon, probably with justice, as a mere impostor.</P>

<P>Levi, Eliphas :</B> Alphonse Louis Constant, better known by his pen-name of 
<I>Eliphas Levi, </I>was a French occultist of the nineteenth century, who has 
been called &quot;the last of the magi.&quot; He was born about <B>1810</B>, the 
son of a shoemaker, and through the good offices of the parish priest was 
educated for the church at St. Sulpice. In due course he became a deacon, taking 
a vow of celibacy. Shortly after this he was expelled from St. Sulpice for 
teaching doctrines contrary to those of the Church. How he lived during the 
ensuing years is not known, but about <B>1839</B> under the influence of a 
political and socialistic prophet named Ganneau, he wrote a pamphlet entitled 
<I>The Gospel of Liberty, </I>for which he received six months imprisonment. In 
Paris, notwithstanding his vow of celibacy, he married a beautiful girl of 
sixteen, who afterwards bad the marriage annulled. It was probably not until 
Madame Constant had left him that he studied the occult sciences. At all events 
his writings previous to this show little trace of occult influence. In 
<B>1855</B> he published his <I>Doctrine of Transcendental Magic, </I>followed 
in <B>1856</B> by the <I>Ritual of Transcendental Magic; </I>in <B>1860</B> was 
issued his <I>History of Magic ; </I>in <B>1861</B> <I>The Key of the Grand 
Mysteries ; Fables and Symbols </I>in <B>1864</B>; <I>Le Sorcier de Mendon 
</I>and <I>La Science des Esprits </I>in <B>1865</B>. Most of his works have 
been translated by Mr. A. E. Waite. He died in <B>1875</B>.</P>
<P>Levi's knowledge of the occult sciences was much more imaginative than 
circumstantial, and in perusing his works the reader requires to be on his guard 
against the adoption of hasty generalisations and hypotheses. </P><B>

<P>Leviathan :</B> <I>(See </I><B>Devil.</B>)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Levitation :</B> A term in use among spiritualists to denote the raising in 
the air of the human body or other objects without visible means, and presumably 
through the agency of disembodied spirits. Thus the <I>levitation </I>of tables 
and other more or less weighty objects is a common feat among physical&quot; 
mediums, whether or not a supernatural explanation be required. The witches of 
olden times, too, were popularly supposed to make use of some occult mode of 
locomotion in their nocturnal travels, being transported through the air by the 
arts of their master, the Devil. And the poltergeist was also thought to suspend 
in the air, without visible means of support, the agent through whom he 
manifested himself. As a spiritualistic phenomenon <I>levitation </I>of the 
human body became known at an early stage of the movement, being recorded in 
connection with the medium Gordon so early as <B>185</B>:. But the most 
important of levitated. mediums was D. D. Home, and many accounts of his feats 
in this direction are given by witnesses who were themselves convinced of their 
genuineness. It may be noted, however, that <I>levitations </I>usually occurred 
in a darkened seance-room, when the only indication of any untoward happening 
was furnished by the medium's own exclamations, by the fact that his voice 
seemed to come from high in the air, and sometimes by his boots scraping the 
back of a chair or the hand of one of the sitters. The Rev. Stainton Moses, who 
also was levitated on several occasions, seems to have held his seances in 
darkness also, or at most by the light of the fire. Mrs. Guppy (see Nicholls) 
was before her marriage several times levitated, notwithstanding the fact that 
she was extremely stout, and a curious story concerning a later <I>levitation 
</I>is told in a letter in the <I>Echo </I>of June <B>8</B>th, <B>1871</B>, for 
whose (anonymous) author's trustworthiness the editor vouches. About that time 
the writer attended a circle with Messrs. Herne and Williams as mediums, the 
spirits present being the famous John and Katie King. One of the sitters 
jokingly expressed a wish that Mrs. Guppy (then in her home some three miles 
distant might be brought to the seance-room, and to this Katie King was heard to 
assent. While the company were laughing at the absurdity of the idea, there was 
a loud bump, followed by shrieks and exclamations. A match was struck, and there 
in the centre of the table stood Mrs. Guppy, an account-book in one hand, a pen 
in the other, and apparently in a state of trance. Less than three minutes 
elapsed between the expression of the wish and the appearance of Mrs. Guppy. The 
writer adds: &quot;The possibility of her being concealed in the room is as 
absurd as the idea of her acting in collusion with the media.&quot;</P>
<P>Pseudo-historical instances of <I>levitation </I>may be found in abundance, 
especially among the early saints. St. Dunstan, archbishop of Canterbury, was 
observed to rise from the ground shortly before his death in <B>988</B>. St. 
Bernard Ptolomei, St. Philip Benitas, St. Albert of Sicily, and St. Dominic, 
founder of the Dominican order, were all seen to be levitated while engaged in 
their devotions. An ecstatic nun &quot;rose from the ground with so much 
impetuosity, that five or six of the sisters could hardly hold her down.&quot; 
It is related by his biographers that Savonarola, shortly before he perished at 
the stake, remained suspended at a considerable height above the floor of his 
dungeon, absorbed in prayer. And such instances might easily be multiplied.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Leviticon :</B> A gospel adopted by the French Templars, and alleged by them 
to have been discovered in the Temple at Paris, along with other objects. It was 
supposed to have been composed in the fifteenth century by a Greek monk, 
Nicephorus, who sought to combine Moslem tenets with Christianity.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Lewis, Matthew Gregory :</B> Commonly known as &quot;Monk&quot; Lewis, 
English Author (<B>1775</B>-<B>1818</B>). Matthew Gregory Lewis was born in 
London in <B>1775</B>. His father was Matthew Lewis, deputy secretary of war, 
and proprietor of several valuable estates in Jamaica; while his mother was Anna 
Maria Sewell, a lady of cultured tastes, devoted to music and various other 
arts. The future author showed precocity while yet a child, and on reaching 
boyhood he was sent to Westminster School, but while he was there an ugly cloud 
rose to dim his horizon, his parents quarrelling and agreeing to separate. 
<I>Matthew </I>contrived to remain friendly with both his father and mother, and 
in <B>1771</B> he visited Paris, while about the same time he made his first 
literary efforts, and in <B>1792</B> he went to Weimar in Germany where he made 
the acquaintance of Goethe, and also learnt German thoroughly. Two years later 
he was appointed attache to the British Embassy at the Hague, and while staying 
there he wrote his mystical story, <I>Ambrosio, or the Monk, </I>which earned 
him his now familiar <I>sobriquet </I>of&quot; Monk Lewis &quot;while in 
<B>1796</B> he entered Parliament as member for Hindon, in Wiltshire, and during 
the next few years he necessarily resided chiefly in London, or near it, 
becoming friendly the while with most of the notable people of the day. Meantime 
his interest in the occult had been developing apace, and in <B>1798</B> there 
was staged at Drury Lane a play of his, <I>Castle Spectre, </I>in which ghosts 
and the like play a prominent part, and which won great popularity among people 
interested in things of that nature; while in <B>1788</B> lie issued his 
<I>Tales of Terror, </I>and in <B>1801</B> a volume entitled <I>Tales of Wonder, 
</I>this being virtually an anthology of popular occult verses, some of which 
were supplied by Sir Walter Scott.</P>
<P>In <B>1812</B> <I>Lewis's </I>father died, and the author accordingly found 
himself a very rich man. His conscience was troubled, nevertheless, by the fact 
that his wealth was derived from slave labour, and so, in <B>1815</B>, he sailed 
to Jamaica, intent on making arrangements for the generous treatment of the 
negroes on his estates. Returning to England in <B>1816</B>, he went soon 
afterwards to Geneva, where he met Byron and Shelley, while in <B>1818</B> he 
paid a last visit to the West Indies, and died at sea while returning home.</P>

<P>Libellus Merlini :</B> (Little Book of Merlin.) A Latin tract on the subject 
of the prophecies of Merlin written by Geoffrey of Monmouth about <B>1135</B>. 
Geoffrey prefaces his account of the prophecies with one concerning the deeds of 
a supernatural youth named Ambrosius whom he deliberately confounded with 
Merlin. Vortigern, King of the Britons, asks Ambrose Merlin the meaning of a 
vision in which appear two dragons red and white in combat. Merlin replies that 
the Red Dragon signifies the British race which would be conquered by the Saxon, 
represented by the White Dragon. A long prophetic rhapsody follows, relating 
chiefly to the Saxon wars, and with this the work, as given in the Seventh Book 
of Geoffrey's Historia Regum Britanniae, concludes. It was, however, known in 
Iceland before <B>1218</B> in a form independent of the Historia. (H. C. Leach, 
<I>Modern Philology, </I>viii., pp.<B>607</B> et seq.) This tract must not be 
confounded with the <I>Vita Merlini (<B>1145</B> </I>or <B>1148</B>) generally 
attributed to Geoffrey.</P>

<P>Licking, a Charm :</B> The following was believed to be a remedy for 
enchantment : to lick the child's forehead first upward, then across, and lastly 
up again; and then to spit behind its back.</P>
<P>It is said that if on licking a child's forehead with the tongue a salt taste 
is perceived, this is an infallible proof of fascination.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Life Waves</B> <B>:</B> according to Theosophists, are three in number. It is 
necessary to remember that the Deity, the Logos (q.v.) has three aspects 
corresponding to the Christian Trinity. These aspects are first that of Will ; 
second, that of Wisdom; and third, that of Activity, and each has its definite 
scope in the creation of a universe. When the Logos Sets about the great work of 
creation he sends the first <I>life wave </I>through his aspect of Activity into 
the multitude of bobbles in the ether, and thereby forms the various kinds of 
matter. The universe having been thus far prepared, he through his aspect of 
Wisdom sends the second <I>life wave, </I>which bringing with it <I>life </I>as 
we usually understand that term and penetrating matter from above, gradually 
descends to the grosser forms and again ascends to the finer forms. In its 
descent, this <I>life wave </I>makes for an ever-increasing heterogeneity, but 
in its ascent the process is reversed and it makes for an ever increasing 
homogeneity. The work of creation is now far enough advanced to permit of the 
creation of man, for matter has now been infused with the capacity of form and 
provided with <I>life, </I>and the Logos, therefore, through his aspect of Will, 
bears forth the Divine Spark, the Monad, and, along with the form and the

<P>Lignite :</B> is a beautiful stone like glass; being hung about a child it 
preserves it from witchcraft, and if bound on the forehead it stops the bleeding 
of the nose, restores the loss of senses, and helps to foretell future 
events.</P>

<P>Lilith :</B> According to Wierus and other demonologists; <I>Lilith </I>was 
the prince or princess who presided over the demons known as succubi. The demons 
under <I>Lilith </I>bore the same name as their chief, and sought to destroy 
newborn infants. For this reason the Jews wrote on the four corners of a 
birth-chamber a formula to drive <I>Lilith </I>away. <I>(See </I>Babylonia.)</P>

<P>Limachie :</B> This little curiosity, resembling a chip of a man's nail, is 
to be squeezed out of the head of a slug, which must be done the instant it is 
seen. It is a good amulet to preserve from fever.</P>

<P>Litanies of the Sabbath :</B> On Wednesdays and Saturdays, if the accounts 
speak truly, it was the custom to sing at the witches' Sabbath the following 
<I>Litanies :-</I>Lucifer, Beelzebub, Leviathan, have pity on us. Baal, prince 
of the seraphim; Baalberith, prince of the cherubim; Astaroth, prince of the 
thrones; Rosier, prince of denominations; Carreau, prince of the powers; Belial, 
prince of the vertues ; Perrier, prince of the principalities; Oliver, prince of 
the arch angels ; Junier, prince of the angels; Sarcueil, Fume-bouche, 
Pierre-le-Feu, Carniveau, Terrier, Contellier, Candelier, Behemoth, Oilette, 
Belpuegor, Sabathan, Garandier, Dolers, Pierre-Fort, Axaphat, Prisier, Kakos, 
Lucesme, pray for us.</P>
<P>It must be remarked that Satan is evoked in these <I>litanies </I>only in 
company with a crowd of others.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Lithomancy :</B> A species of divination performed by stones, but in what 
manner it is difficult to ascertain. Gale, in a &quot;note upon 
lamblichus,&quot; confesses that he does not clearly understand the nature of it 
; whether it refers to certain motions observable in idols, or to an insight 
into futurity obtained by demons (familiars) enclosed in particular stones. That 
these supernatural beings might be so commanded is clear from a passage of 
Nicephorus. The Rabbis have attributed Lev. XXVI., I to <I>Lithomancy; </I>but 
the prohibition of stones there given is most probably directed against idolatry 
in general. Bulenger has a short chapter on <I>Lithomancy. </I>He shows from 
Tzetzes, that Helenus ascertained the fall of Troy by the employment of a 
magnet, and that if a magnet be washed in spring water, and interrogated, a 
voice like that of a sucking child will reply.</P>
<P>The pseudo-Orpheus has related at length this legend of Helenus. &quot;To 
him,&quot; he says, &quot; Apollo gave the true and vocal sideritis, which 
others call the animated ophites, a Stone possessing fatal qualities, rough, 
hard, black, and heavy, graven everywhere with veins like wrinkles. For</P>
<P>one and twenty days Helenus abstained from the nuptial couch from the bath, 
and from animal food. Then, washing ibis intelligent stone in a living fountain, 
he cherished it as a babe in soft clothing; and having propitiated it as a god, 
he at length gave it breath by his hymn of mighty virtue. Having lighted lamps 
in his own purified house, he fondled the divine stone in his hands, bearing it 
about as a mother bears her infant; and you, if ye wish to hear the voice of the 
gods, in like manner provoke a similar miracle, for when ye have sedulously 
wiped and dandled the stone in your arms, on a sudden it will utter the cry of a 
new-born child seeking milk from the breast of its nurse. Beware, however, of 
fear, for if you drop the stone upon the ground, you will rouse the anger of the 
immortals. Ask boldly of things future, and it will reply. Place it near your 
eyes when it has been washed, look steadily at it, and you will perceive it 
divinely breathing. Thus it was that Helenus, confiding in this fearful stone, 
learned that his country would be overthrown by the Atridae.&quot;</P>
<P>Photius, in his abstract of the life of Isodorus by Damascius, a credulous 
physician of the age of Justinian, speaks of - an oracular stone, the baetulum, 
to which <I>Lithomancy </I>was attributed. A physician named Eusebius used to 
carry one of these wonder-working stones about with him. One night it seems, 
actuated by an unaccountable impulse, he wandered Out from the city Emesa to the 
summit of a mountain dignified by a temple of Minerva. There, as he sat down 
fatigued by his walk, he saw a globe of fire falling from the sky and a lion 
standing by it. The lion disappeared, the fire was extinguished, and Eusebius 
ran and picked up a baetulum. He asked it to what god it appertamed, and it 
readily answered, to Gennaeus, a deity worshipped by the Heliopolitae, under the 
form of a lion in the temple of Jupiter. During this night, Eusebius said he 
travelled not less than <B>210</B> stadia, more than <B>26</B> miles. He never 
became perfectly master of the baetulum, but was obliged very humbly to solicit 
its responses. It was of a handsome, globular shape, white, a palm in diameter, 
though sometimes it appeared more, sometimes less; occasionally, also, it was of 
purple colour. Characters were to be read on it, impressed in the colour called 
tingaribinus. Its answer seemed as if proceeding from a shrill pipe, and 
Eusebius himself interpreted the sounds. Damascius believed its animating spirit 
to be divine; Isodorus, on the other hand, thought it demoniacal, that is, not 
belonging to evil or material demons, not yet to those which are quite pure and 
immaterial. It was with one of these stones, according to Hesychius, that Rhea 
fed Saturnus, when he fancied that he was devouring Jupiter, its name being 
derived from the skin in which it was wrapped, and such the commentator supposed 
to have been the <I>Lapides divi, </I>or <I>vivi, </I>which the insane monster 
Heliogabalus wished to carry off from the temple of Diana, built by Orestes at 
Laodicea. Bochart traces the name and the reverence paid to the baetylia, to the 
stone which Jacob anointed at Bethel. Many of these baetylia, Photius assures us 
from Damascius, were to be found on Mount Libanus.</P>

<P>Little World :</B> The name given to a secret society which conspired in 
England, in the eighteenth century, to reestablish the Stuart dynasty. Many

<P>Loathly Damsel :</B> The Kundrie or Kundry. The Grail Messenger. One would 
imagine that the holder of such an office would be saint-like, but Christian 
describes her as a damsel more hideous than could be pictured outside 
hell.&quot; Wolfram refers to her in his work as &quot; Kundri la 
Sorciere.&quot; Kundry in Wagner's music-drama &quot; Parsifal&quot; represents 
sin.</P>

<P>Lodestone : </B>A precious stone believed to possess magical properties of 
diverse kinds. If one is ill, one must hold it in one's hands and shake it well. 
It cures wounds, snake-bites, weak eyes, headaches and restores hearing. The 
possessor of the <I>lodestone </I>may walk through reptiles in safety, even when 
they are accompanied by&quot; black death.&quot; Orpheus says that&quot; with 
this stone you can hear the voices of the gods and learn many wonderful things; 
&quot; that it has the property of unfolding the future; and if held close to 
the eyes it will inspire with a divine spirit.</P>

<P>Lodge, Sir Oliver :</B> <I>(See </I><B>Spiritualism.)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P></B><B>
<P>Logos :</B> Fohat-is the term very commonly used in theosophy to designate 
the Deity. Along with the great religions, theosophy has as the beginning of its 
scheme a Deity who, in Himself, is altogether beyond human knowledge or' 
conception, whether in the ordinary or the clairvoyant states. But when the 
Deity manifests Himself to man through his works of creation, He is known as the 
<I>Logos. </I>Essentially He is infinite but when He encloses a &quot;ring 
pass-not&quot; within which to build a kosmos, He has set limits to Himself, and 
what we can know of Him is contained in these limits. To us He appears in a 
triple aspect-the Christian Trinity-but this is, of course, merely an 
appearance, and in reality He is a unity. This triple aspect shews Him as Will, 
Wisdom and Activity, and from each of these came forth one of the creative life 
waves which formed the universe. From the third came the wave which created 
matter, from the second, the wave which aggregated diffuse matter into form, and 
from the first, the wave which brought with it the Monad; that scintillation of 
Himself which took posession of formed matter, to start thereby the evolutionary 
process.</P><B>

<P>Lombroso, Professor Cesare : </B>A celebrated Italian anthropologist. A few 
years before his death be took up the study of spiritualism and experimented 
extensively with the well-known medium Eusapia Palladino, in company with 
Messieurs Richet, Maxwell, Flammarion, and Professor Schiaparelli. He embodied 
the results of his investigations in several well-known works, and concluded 
that although man was probably not immortal, his &quot;shell&quot; or shadow, a 
mere conglomeration of thought forces, remained on earth behind him for some 
considerable time after his demise. <I>(See </I>&quot;After Death-What?&quot; 
<B>1909</B>.)</P><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>London Dialectical Society :</B> In <B>1869</B> an important enquiry into the 
phenomena of spiritualism was undertaken by the <I>London Dialectical Society. 
</I>A committee of more than thirty members-including Alfred Russel Wallace, 
Sergeant Cox, Charles Bradlaugh, H. G. Atkinson, and Dr. James Edmunds-was 
formed, and resolved itself into six subcommittees. During the eighteen months 
over which their' labours extended, the committee received a large quantity of 
evidence from believers in the phenomena, but very little from those 
antagonistic to the spirit hypothesis. In &quot;The Dialectical Society's Report 
on Spiritualism,&quot; published by the Society, particulars are given both of 
the members' own experiences and of testimonies from witnesses whose character 
and position made their evidence valuable. Practically every form of 
manifestation, both physical and automatic, is covered in the report, which 
concluded thus:</P>
<P>&quot;In presenting their report, your Committee, taking into consideration 
the high character and great intelligence of many of the witnesses to the more 
extraordinary facts, the extent to which their testimony is supported by the 
reports of the sub-committees, and the absence of any proof of imposture or 
delusion as regards a large portion of the phenomena; and further, having regard 
to the exceptional character of the phenomena, and the large number of persons 
of every grade of society and over the whole civilised world who are more or 
less influenced by a belief in their supernatural origin, and to the fact that 
no philosophical explanation of them has yet been arrived at, deem it incumbent 
upon them to state their conviction that the subject is worthy of more serious 
attention and careful investigation than it has hitherto received.&quot;</P>
<P>The <I>Dialectical Society's </I>investigations are noteworthy as the first 
organised attempt to elucidate the problem of spiritualistic phenomena.</P>

tract, said to be translated from the Russian and entitled <I>Characteristics of

Eckhartshausen whose work has elsewhere been briefly described-it is a kind of 
Christian transcendentalism and in its tenour, resembles the higher literature

<P>Lords of the Flame or Children of the Fire Mist :</B> are, according to 
theosophists, adepts sent from the planet Venus to aid terrestrial evolution. It 
is necessary to explain that, in the evolution of the Solar System (q.v.) Venus 
is considerably in advance of the Earth, but by the efforts of these adepts 
directed towards intellectual development-the inhabitants of the earth are now 
really farther advanced than in ordinary course they would be. These adepts are 
not permanently inhabitants of the Earth, and, while a few yet remain, most of 
them have returned whence they came, the time of crisis at which they assisted 
having now passed. <I>(See </I>Theosophy, Evolution, Chains.)</P>

not really <I>lost, </I>only withheld for a season. In the same way the Graal 
was not <I>lost, </I>but withdrawn to its own place and the search for it 
occupied the noblest figures in chivalry. It represents the Key to the enigma of 
Creation; in terms of Christianity, the Kingdom of Heaven.</P>

<P>Loudun, Nuns of :</B> In the year <B>1633</B>, the convent of Ursulines 
established at <I>Loudun </I>in France was the scene of an outbreak of 
diabolical possession. The numerous <I>nuns </I>who inhabited the convent showed 
signs of diabolic possession, spoke with tongues. and behaved in the most 
extraordinary and hysterical manner. The affair grew in volume until practically 
all the <I>nuns </I>belonging to the institution were in the same condition of 
temporary insanity. The Mother Superior of the convent, Jeanne de Belfiel, 
appears to have been of hysterical temperament, and she was not long in 
infecting the other inmates of the institution. She, with a sister named Claire 
and five other <I>nuns, </I>were the first to be obsessed by the so-called evil 
spirits. The outbreak spread to the neighbouring town and so scandalous did the 
whole affair become that Richelieu appointed a commission to examine into it. 
The devils were subjected to the process of exorcism, which, however. proved to 
be fruitless in this instance. and the attacks of the <I>nuns </I>continued. But 
on a more imposing ceremony being held, they took themselves off, but only for a 
little while, returning again with greater violence than ever. Suspicion, or 
rather injustice, fixed upon the person of Urbain Grandier (q.v.), confessor. of 
the convent, as the head and source of the whole affair. He was arrested and 
accused of giving over the <I>nuns </I>to the possession of the Devil by means 
of the practice of sorcery. The truth is that the neighbouring clergy were madly 
jealous of Grandier because he had obtained two benefices in their diocese, of 
which lie was not a native, and they had made up their minds to compass his 
destruction at the first possible moment. Despite his protests of innocence, the 
unfortunate priest was haled before a council of judges of the neighbouring 
presidencies, who found upon his body the various marks which were the undoubted 
signs of a sorcerer, and it is said that the inquest brought to light the fact 
that Grandier had none too good a reputation. We must be very careful, however, 
to refrain from believing the worst about him, as the sources regarding this are 
undoubtedly tainted by religious prejudice. It is said that on his papers being 
seized much matter subversive of religious practice was found amongst them. They 
failed, however, to find that pact with Satan for which they had looked, 
although afterwards several versions of it were published by more or less 
credulous persons and sold as broadsheets. The unfortunate man was condemned to 
be burnt at the stake-a sentence which was duly carried out. After his death, 
however, the possession of the hysterical sisters did not cease ; the demons 
became more obstreperous than ever and flippantly answered to their names of 
Asmodeus, Leviathan, and Behemoth, and so forth. A very holy Brother called 
Surin was delegated to put an end to the affair. Frail and unhealthy, he 
possessed, however, an indomitable spirit, and after much wrestling in prayer 
succeeded in finally exorcising the demons. The whole affair is set forth in the 
<I>Historie des Diables de Loudun, </I>published in <B>1839</B>. which gave a 
detailed account of one of the most extraordinary obsessions of modern 
times.</P>

<P>Loyer, Pierre Le :</B> Sieur de la Brosse, royal councillor and 
demonographer, was born at Huille in Anjou in <B>1550</B>. He was the author of 
a work entitled <I>Discours et histoires des spectres, visions et apparitions 
des esprits, anges, demons et ames se montrant aux hommes. </I>The work is 
divided into eight books dealing with the marvellous visions and prodigies of 
all the centuries. and the most celebrated authors sacred as well as profane, 
who have dealt with occult subjects, the cause of apparitions, the nature of 
good and evil spirits, of demons, of ecstasy, of the essence, nature and origin 
of souls, of magicians and sorcerers, of the manner of their communication, of 
evil spirits, and of impostors It was published at Paris in <B>1605</B> in one 
quarto volume. The first book deals with spectres, apparitions and spirits; the 
second with the physics of <I>Loyer's </I>time, the illusions to which the 
senses are prone, wonders, the elixirs and metamorphases of sorceries and of 
philtres ; the third book establishes the degrees, grades and honours of 
spirits, gives a resume of the history of Philinnion and of Polycrites, and 
recounts diverse adventures-with spectres and demons; the fourth book gives many 
examples of spectral appearances, of the speech of persons possessed of demons, 
of the countries and dwelling-places of these spectres and demons, of marvellous 
portents, and so forth ; the fifth treats of the science of the soul, of its 
origin, nature, its state after death, and of haunting ghosts; the sixth 
division is entirely taken up with the apparition of souls, and shows how the 
happy do not return to earth, but only those whose souls are burning in 
purgatory; in the seventh book the case of the Witch of Endor, and the evocation 
of the soul of Samuel, are dealt with, as is evocation in general and the 
methods practised by wizards and sorcerers in this science ; the last book gives 
some account of exorcism, fumigations, prayers, and other methods of casting out 
devils, and the usual means employed by exorcists to destroy these. The work as 
a whole is exceedingly curious if disputatious and a little dull in parts, and 
throws considerable light upon the occult science of the times.</P>

<P>Lubin :</B> The fish whose gall was used by Tobias to restore his father's 
sight. It is said to be very powerful against ophthalmia, and its heart is 
potent in driving away demons.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Lucifer :</B> Literally light-bringer, a name applied to the conception of 
the devil, who has often been likened to a fallen<B> </B>star or angel. The 
Miltonic conception of <I>Lucifer </I>as a force potent for good or evil, one 
who might have done good greatly, intensely proud and powerful exceedingly, is 
one which is inconsistent with enlightenment. He represents simply the absence 
of good; a negative not a positive entity.</P>
<P>He presides over the east, according to the ideas of the old magicians. He 
was invoked on Mondays, in a circle in the centre of which was his name. As the 
price of his complaisance in appearing to the magician he asked only a mouse. 
Lucifer commands Europeans and Asiatics. He appears in the shape of a beautiful 
child. When he is angry his face is flushed, but there is nothing monstrous 
about him. He is, according to some students of demonology, the grand justiciary 
of Hades. He is the first to be invoked in the litanies of the Sabbath. <I>(See 
</I>Devil-worship.)</P><B>

<P>Lugh : </B>In Irish romance, son of Kian, and father of Cuchulain. He was 
brought up by his uncle Goban, the Smith, and by Duach, King of Fairyland. It 
was prophesied of <I>Lugh </I>that he should eventually overcome his father's 
old enemy Balor, his own grandfather. So instead of killing the three murderers 
of his father, Kian, he put them on oath to obtain certain wonders, including 
the magical spear of the King of &quot; Persia&quot; and the pig-skin of the 
King of Greece, which, if laid on a patient, would heal him of his wound or cure 
him of his sickness. Thus equipped, <I>Lugh </I>entered the Battle of Moytura, 
against the Fomorians, and by hurling a stone which pierced through the eye to 
the brain of Balor, fulfilled the druidic prophecy. <I>Lugh </I>was the Irish 
Sun-god; his final conquest of the Fomorians and their leader symbolises the 
victory of light and intellect over darkness. Balor was god of darkness, and 
brute force as embodied in the Fomorians. By his title of Ildanach, or &quot; 
All Craftsman,&quot; <I>Lugh </I>is comparable to the Greek Apollo. He was 
widely worshipped by Continental Celts.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Lully, Raymond :</B> The life of this alchemist was a curious and eventful 
one, and all its diverse chapters bespeak him a man of titanic physical and 
mental energy, quite incapable of doing anything in dilettante fashion, but 
instead throwing himself heart and soul into every quest which chanced to appeal 
to him. <I>Raymond's </I>father was a Spanish knight, who, having won the 
approval of John I.. King of Arragon. was granted an estate in Majorca; and it 
was in that island of the Balearic group that the future alchemist was born, 
probably in the year <B>1229</B>. but the date is uncertain. Thanks to the royal 
favour which his father enjoyed, <I>Raymond </I>was appointed Seneschal of the 
Isles while he was still a mere youth; but hardly had he acquired this position 
ere, much to the chagrin of his parents, he began to show a strong predilection 
for debauchery. He paid amorous addresses to women of all sorts, while at 
length. becoming enamoured of a married lady named Eleonora de Castello, he 
began to follow her wherever she went, making no attempt to conceal his illicit 
passion. On one occasion, indeed, he actually sought the lady while she was 
attending mass. And, so loud was the outcry against this bold, if not 
sacrilegious act, that Eleonora found it essential to write in peremptory style 
to her <I>cavaliere servente, </I>bidding him desist from his present course. 
The letter failed to cool the youth's ardour, but anon, when it transpired that 
the lady was smitten with the deadly complaint of cancer, her admirer's frame of 
mind began to alter speedily. Sobered by the frustration of his hopes, he vowed 
that henceforth he would live differently, consecrating his days to the service 
of God.</P>
<P>So <I>Raymond </I>espoused holy orders, but, as was natural in the case of a 
man of such active and impetuous temperament, he felt small inclination for 
monastic life. His aim was to carry the Gospel far afield, converting the 
children of Mahomet, and with this in view he began to study</P>
<P>Arabic; while having mastered that tongue he proceeded to Rome, eager to 
enlist the Pope's sympathy in his project. <I>Raymond </I>failed in the latter 
particular, yet, nothing daunted he embarked on his own account at Genoa about 
the yeas <B>1291</B>, and having reached Tunis he commenced his crusade. His 
ardour resulted in his being fiercely persecuted and ultimately banished so 
perforce he returned for a while to Europe, visiting Paris, Naples and Pisa, and 
exhorting all good Christians to aid his beloved enterprise. But in <B>1308</B> 
he ventured to go back to Africa, and at Algiers he made a host of converts, yet 
was once more forced to fly for his life before the angry Mussulmans. He 
repaired to Tunis, thinking to escape thence to Italy, but his former activities 
in the town were remembered, and consequently he was seized and thrown into 
prison. Here he languished for a long time, never failing to seize every 
opportunity which presented itself of preaching the gospel, but at last some 
Genoese merchants contrived to procure his release, and so he sailed back to 
Italy. Proceeding to Rome, he made further and strenuous efforts towards 
obtaining the Pope's support of a well-equipped foreign mission; but 
<I>Raymond's </I>importunity herein proved abortive, and, after resting for a 
brief space at his native Majorca, the heroic zealot took his life in his hands, 
and returned to Tunis. Here he even proclaimed his presence publicly, but 
scarcely had he begun preaching when he reaped the inevitable harvest, and after 
being savagely attacked he was left lying on the sea-shore, his assailants 
imagining him dead. He was still breathing, however, when some Genoese found 
him, and carrying him to a ship they set sail for Majorca. But the missionary 
did not rally, and he died while in sight of his home, the date being 
<B>1315</B>.</P><I>
<P>Raymond's </I>proselytising ardour had made his name familiar throughout 
Europe, and, while many people regarded him as a heretic because he had 
undertaken a mission without the pope's sanction, there were others who admired 
him so much that they sought to make him a saint. But he was never canonized, 
and the reason, perhaps, lay in the well-known fact that he had engaged in 
alchemy. He is reported to have made a large sum of gold for the English king, 
and, while there is really no proof that he ever visited Britain, the remaining 
part of the story holds a certain significance. For it is said that <I>Lully 
</I>made the money on the strict understanding that it should be utilised for 
equipping a large and powerful band of missionaries, and the likelihood is that 
he thought to. employ his chymical skill on behalf of his beloved object, and 
approached some European Sovereign with this in view, thus giving rise to the 
tradition about his dealings with the English monarch. Be that as it may, 
<I>Raymond's </I>voluminous writings certainly include a number of aichem-istic 
works, notably <I>Alchimia Magic Naturalis, De Aquis Super Accurtationes, De 
Secretis Medicina Magna </I>and <I>De Conservatione Vitae; </I>and it is 
interesting to find that several of these won considerable popularity and 
were-repeatedly reprinted, while so late as <B>1673</B> two volumes of <I>Opera 
Alchima </I>purporting to be from <I>Raymond's </I>pen were issued at London. 
Five years before this a biography by Vernon had been published at Paris, while 
at a later date a German historian of chemistry, Gruelin, referred to Lully as a 
scientist of exceptional skill, and mentioned him as the first man to distil 
rosemary oil.</P>

Robin Goodfellow. Like him he had many names and like him had the power of

Thus, on market days, when a farmer lingered late over his ale, whether in 
driving a close bargain or in enjoying the society of a boon companion, he 
declared the <I>Lutin </I>was sure to play him some spiteful trick on his way 
home his horse would stumble-he would be thrown-he would lose his purse-or else 
his way. If the farmer persisted in these habits, more serious would become the 
<I>Lutin's </I>tricks; the sheep-pens would be unfastened, the cow-house and 
stable doors left open, and the flocks and cattle be found moving among the 
standing corn and unmown hay; while every servant on the farm would swear to his 
own innocence, and unhesitatingly lay the blame on the <I>Lutin. </I>Similar 
tricks were played on the fishermen by the Nain Rouge-another name for the 
<I>Lutin. </I>He opened the meshes of the nets and set the fish free ; he 
removed the floats and let the nets sink to the bottom, or the sinkers, and let 
the nets float away on the retiring tide. True, if closely questioned, the 
fishermen would confess that on these occasions the night was dark and stormy, 
the botby warm, and the grog plentiful, and that instead of drawing their nets 
at the proper time, they had delayed it till mornmg. Again, he would appear like 
a black nag, ready bridled and saddled, quietly feeding by the way-side; but woe 
to the luckless wight who mounted him !-unless, indeed, he did so for some 
charitable or holy purpose, in which case he was borne with the speed of the 
wind to his destination. In this form the <I>Lutin </I>played his wildest pranks 
and was called Le Cheval Bayard.</P><B>

<P>Lux <I>:</B> (See </I><B>Spain.</B>)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Lycanthropy :</B> The transformation of a human being into an animal. The 
term is derived from the Greek words, <I>lukos </I>a wolf, and <I>anthropos 
</I>a man, but it is employed regarding a transformation into any animal shape. 
It is chiefly in these countries where wolves are numerous that we find such 
tales concerning them. <I>(See </I>Wer-wolf.) But in India, and some parts of 
Asia, the tiger takes the place of the wolf; in Russia and elsewhere the bear, 
and in Africa the leopard.</P>
<P>It is usually savage animals regarding which these beliefs are prevalent, but 
even harmless ones also figure in them. There is considerable confusion as to 
whether such transformations were voluntary, or involuntary, temporary or 
permanent. The man as transformed into the animal may be the very individual 
himself, or, on the other hand may be only his double, that is his spirit may 
enter the animal and his body remain unchanged. Magicians and witches were 
credited with the power of transforming themselves into wolves and other animal 
shapes, and it was asserted that if the animal were wounded that the marks of 
the wound would be discovered upon the wizard's body.</P>
<P>The belief is current amongst many savage tribes that every individual 
possesses an animal form which he enters at death, or at will. This is effected 
either by magic or natural agency.</P>
<P>As has been said, the wolf is a common form of animal transformation in 
Europe. In ancient Greece the belief was associated with the dog, which took the 
place of the wolf. Other similar beliefs are found in India and Java and in the 
former country we find the wer-wolf in a sort of vampire form.</P>
<P>Guyon relates the history of an enchanter who used to change himself into 
different beasts.</P>
<P>&quot;Certain people,&quot; said he, &quot;persuaded Ferdinand, first Emperor 
of that name, to command the presence of a Polish enchanter and magician in the 
town of Nuremberg to learn the result of a difference he had with the Turks, 
concerning the kingdom of Hungary; and not only did the magician make use of 
divination, but performed various other marvels, so that the king did not wish 
to see him, but the courtiers introduced him into his chamber. There he did many 
wonderful things, among others, he transformed himself into a horse, anointing 
himself with some grease, then he took the shape of an ox, and thirdly that of a 
lion, all in less than an hour. The emperor was so terrified by these 
transformations that he commanded that the magician should be immediately 
dismissed, and declined to hear the future from the lips of such a 
rascal.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It need no longer be doubted,&quot; adds the same writer, &quot;that 
Lucius Apuleius Plato was a sorcerer, and that he was transformed into an ass, 
forasmuch as he was charged with it before the proconsul of Africa, in the time 
of the Emperor Antonine I., in the year <B>150</B> A.D., as Apollonius of Tyana, 
long before, in the year <B>60</B>, was charged before Domitian with the same 
crime. And more than three years after, the rumour persisted to the time of St. 
Augustine, who was an African, who has written and confirmed it; as also in his 
time the father of one Prestantius was transformed into a horse, as the said 
Prestantius declared. Augustine's father having died, in a short time the son 
had wasted the greater part of his inheritance in the pursuit of the magic arts, 
and in order to flee poverty he sought to marry a rich widow named Pudentille, 
for such a long time that at length she consented. Soon after her only son and 
heir, the child of her former marriage, died. These things came about in a 
manner which led people to think that he had by means of magic entrapped 
Pudentille, who had been wooed in vain by several illustrious people, in order 
to obtain the wealth of her son. It was also said that the profound knowledge he 
possessed-for he was able to solve difficult questions which left other men 
bewildered-was obtained from a demon or familiar spirit he possessed. Further, 
certain people said they had seen him do many marvellous things, such as making 
himself invisible, transforming himself into a horse or into a bird, piercing 
his body with a sword without wounding himself, and similar performances. He was 
at last accused by one Sicilius OEmilianus, the censor, before Claudius Maximus, 
proconsul of Africa, who was said to be a Christian; but nothing was found 
against him.</P>
<P>Now, that he had been transformed into an ass, St. Augustine regards as 
indubitable, he having read it in certain true and trustworthy authors, and 
being besides of the same country; and this transformation happened to him in 
Thessaly before he was versed in magic, through the spell of a sorceress, who 
sold him, and who recovered him to his former shape after he had served in the 
capacity of an ass for some years, having the same powers and habits of eating 
and braying as other asses, but with a mind still sane and reasonable as he 
himself attested. And at last to show forth his case, and to lend probability to 
the rumour, he wrote a book entitled <I>The Golden Ass, </I>a melange of fables 
and dialogues, to expose the vices of the men of his time, which he had heard 
of, or seen, during his transformation, with many of the labours and troubles he 
had suffered while in the shape of an ass.</P>
<P>&quot;However that may be, St. Augustine in the book of the <I>City of God, 
</I>book XVIII., chapters XVII. and XVIII., relates that in his time there were 
in the Alps certain sorceresses who gave a particular kind of cheese to the 
passers by, who, on partaking of it, were immediately changed into asses or 
other beasts of burden, and were made to carry heavy weights to certain places. 
When their task was over, they were permitted to regain their human 
shape.&quot;</P><B>
<P>&quot;</B>The bishop of Tyre, historian, writes that in his time, probably 
about <B>1220</B>, some Englishmen were sent by their king to the aid of the 
Christians who were fighting in the Holy Land, and that on their arrival in a 
haven of the island of Cyprus a sorceress transformed a young English soldier 
into an ass. He, wishing to return to his companions in the ship, was chased 
away with blows from a stick, whereupon he returned to the sorceress who made 
use of him, until someone noticed that the ass kneeled in a church and did 
various other things which only a reasoning being could do. The sorceress who 
followed him was taken on suspicion before the authorities, was obliged to give 
him his human form three years after his transformation, and was forthwith 
executed.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;We read,&quot; says Loys Guyon, &quot;that Ammonius, a peripatetic 
philosopher, about the time of Lucius </P>
<P>Septimius Severus, in the year <B>196</B> A.D., had present at his lessons an 
ass whom he taught. I should think that this ass had been at one time a man, and 
that he quite understood what Ammonius taught, for these transformed persons 
retain their reason unimpaired, as St. Augustine and other writers have assured 
us.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Fulgose writes, book VIII., chapter II., that in the time of Pope Leon, 
who lived about the year <B>930</B>, there were in Germany two sorceresses who 
used thus to change their guests into beasts, and on one occasion she changed a 
young mountebank into an ass, who, preserving his human understanding, gave a 
great deal of amusement to the passers-by. A neighbour of the sorceresses bought 
the ass at a good price, but was warned by them that he must not take the beast 
to a river, or he would lose it. Now the ass escaped one day and running to a 
near-by lake plunged into the water, when he returned to his own shape. Apuleirs 
says that he regained his human form by eating roses.</P>
<P>&quot;There are still to be seen in Egypt asses which are led into the 
market-place to perform various feats of agility and tricks, understanding all 
the commands they receive, and executing them: such as to point out the most 
beautiful woman of the company, and many other things that one would hardly 
believe; and Belon, a physician, relates in his observations that lie has seen 
them, and others also, who have been there, and who have affirmed the same to 
me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;One day there was brought to St. Macarius, the Egyptian,&quot; says 
Calmet, &quot;an honest woman who had been transformed into a mare by the wicked 
art of a magician. Her husband and all who beheld her believed that she had 
really been changed into a mare. This woman remained for three days without 
taking any food, whether suitable for a horse or for a human being. She was 
brought to the priests of the place, who could suggest no remedy. So they led 
her to the cell of St. Macarius, to whom God had revealed that she was about to 
come. His disciples wished to send her away, thinking her a mare, and they 
warned the saint of her approach, and the reason for her journey. He said to 
them: ' It is you who are the animals, who think you see that which is not; this 
woman is not changed, but your eyes are bewitched.&quot; As he spoke he 
scattered holy water on the head of the woman, and all those present saw her in 
her true shape. He had something given her to eat and sent her away safe and 
sound with her husband.&quot;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Lytton, Bulwer :</B> Author (<B>1803</B>-<B>1873</B>). According to his 
baptismal certificate, the full name of this once famous author was <I>Edward 
George Earle Lytton Bulwer-Lytton, </I>and in signing some of his early writings 
he used all these names with occasional variations in their order, an act which 
was regarded by many people as springing from pride and pompousness, and which 
elicited the withering satire of Thackeray in <I>Punch. Lytton </I>was born at 
London in <B>1803</B>, and his father was a Norfolk squire, Bulwer of Heydon 
Hall; while his mother was Elizabeth Barbara Lytton, a lady who claimed kinship 
with Cadwaladr Vendigaid, the semi-mythical hero who led the Strathclyde Welsh 
against the Angles in the seventh century. As a child the future novelist was 
delicate, but he learnt to read at a surprisingly early age, and began to write 
verses before he was ten years old. Going first to a small private school at 
Fulham, he soon passed on to another one at Rottingdean; and here he continued 
to manifest literary tastes, Byron and Scott being his chief idols at this time. 
So clever was the boy thought, indeed, that his relations decided it would be a 
mistake to send him to a public school; and accordingly he was placed with a 
tutor at Ealing, under whose care he progressed rapidly with his studies. 
Thereafter he proceeded to Cambridge, where he took his degree easily; and won 
many academic laurels, while on leaving the University he travelled for a while 
in Scotland and in France, and then bought a commission in the army. He sold it 
soon afterwards, however, while in <B>1827</B> he was married, and now he began 
to devote himself seriously to writing, his first publications of note being the 
novels of <I>Falkland, Pelkam </I>and <I>Eugene Aram. </I>These won an instant 
success, and placed considerable wealth in the author's hands, the result being 
that in <B>1831</B> he entered parliament as liberal member for St. Ives, 
Huntingdonshire; and during the next ten years he was an active politician yet 
found time to produce a host of stories, for instance <I>The Last Days of Pompei 
</I>and <I>Ernest Maltravers, Zanoni </I>and <I>The Last of the Barons. 
</I>These were followed shortly by <I>The Cartons, </I>and simultaneously 
<I>Lytton </I>achieved some fame as a dramatist, perhaps his best play being 
<I>The Lady of Lyons; </I>while in <B>1851</B> he was instrumental in founding a 
scheme for pensioning authors, in <B>1862</B> he increased his reputation 
greatly by his novel entitled <I>A Strange Story, </I>and four years later his 
services to literature and politics were rewarded by a peerage. He now began to 
work at yet another story, <I>Kenelm Chillingly, </I>but his health was 
beginning to fail, and he died in <B>1873</B> at Torquay.</P>
<P>The works cited above constitute but a fragment of <I>Lytton's </I>voluminous 
achievement. Besides further novels too numerous to mention, he issued several 
volumes of verses notably <I>Ismael </I>and <I>The New Union, </I>while he did 
translations from German, Spanish and Italian, he produced a history of Athens, 
he contributed to endless periodicals, and was at one time editor of <I>The New 
Monthly Magazine. </I>But albeit so busy throughout the whole of his career, and 
while winning vast fame and opulence, <I>Lytton's </I>life was not really a 
happy one, various causes conducing to make it otherwise. Long before meeting 
his wife he fell in love with a young girl who died prematurely, and this loss 
seems to have left an indelible scar on his heart, while his marriage was 
anything but a successful one, the pair being divorced comparatively soon after 
their union. Now as a mere child <I>Lytton </I>had evinced a predilection for 
mysticism, while he had surprised his mother once by asking her whether she was 
&quot;not sometimes overcome by the sense of her own identity&quot; (almost 
exactly the same question was put to his nurse in boyhood by another mystic, 
William Bell Scott) ; <I>Lytton </I>sedulously developed his leaning towards the 
occult, and it is everywhere manifest in his literary output. It transpires, for 
example, in his poem <I>The Tale of a Dreamer, </I>and again in <I>Kenelm 
Chillingly, </I>while in <I>A Strange Story </I>he tries to give a scientific 
colouring to old-fashioned magic; but neither this essay nor those others are 
really to be called triumphant in the artistic sense, and, as Sir Leslie Stephen 
shrewdly observes, <I>Lytton's </I>&quot; attempts at the mysterious too often 
remind us of spirit-rapping rather than excite the thrill of supernatural 
awe.&quot; In a word <I>Lytton's </I>outlook on life was theatrical and his 
mysticism was not a little stagey.</P><B>
