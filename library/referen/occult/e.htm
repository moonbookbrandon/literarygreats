<P>Earth laid upon a Corpse :</B> It is related in Pennant's <I>Tour </I>that it 
was the custom in the Highlands of Scotland to lay on the breast of the deceased 
a wooden platter containing a little earth and a little salt - the former to 
symbolize the corruptibility of the body, the latter the incorruptibility of the

Kelpie, in order to lure souls to his master the Devil. In the disguise of a 
fine steed, beautifully accoutred, the Kelpie grazed innocently by the wayside. 
The weary traveller, passing by, and believing this splendid animal to have 
strayed from his master, was tempted to make use of him to help him on his way 
and the deceitful Kelpie, remaining quiet as a lamb until the traveller was 
fairly mounted. would then with a fiendish yell of triumph plunge headlong into 
an adjacent pool. It was believed that the soul of the unfortunate man, who had 
had no time to prepare for death, would thus be safely secured to the Evil One 
while the Kelpie received the body in payment for his trouble.</P>

<P>Eckartshausen, K. Von : </B>Author of <I>The Cloud on the Sanctuary 
</I>(<B>1800</B>). <I>Eckartshausen, </I>by birth and education an intensely 
religious man, at first wrote several little books of devotion that had great 
vogue in France and Germany. He later turned his attention to larger works of a 
more profound character, such as that mentioned above. According to 
<I>Eckartshausen </I>the requisite faculty of true communion with the church is 
the inward conception of things spiritual and with this sense present, is 
possible the beginning of Regeneration understood as the process of gradually 
eliminating original sin. His work on the Interior Church is in two parts first, 
elucidation of his doctrine second, a series of dogmas or assertions derived 
therefrom.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Ectenic Force :</B> A supposed physical force emanating from the person of 
the medium, and directed by his will, by means of which objects may be moved 
without contact in apparent defiance of natural laws. The existence of such a 
force was first postulated by Count Agenor de Gasparin, to explain the phenomena 
of table-turning and rapping, and the name <I>Ectenic Force </I>was bestowed 
upon the supposed agency by de Gasparin's colleague, M. Thury. The experiments 
of Thury and de Gasparin are declared to offer some of the most convincing 
evidence that spiritualism can produce, and have influenced more than one 
eminent student of psychic research. If it be true that tables were moved 
without contact, then such a theory is indeed necessary, but the evidence for 
this type of phenomena is not abundant.</P>

<P>Eel :</B> The <I>eel </I>is credited with the possession of many marvellous 
virtues. If he is left to die out of the water, his body steeped in strong 
vinegar and the blood of a vulture, and the whole placed under a dunghill, the 
composition will raise from the dead anything brought to it, and will give it 
life as before. It is also said that he who eats the still warm heart of an 
<I>eel </I>will be seized with the spirit of prophecy, and will predict things 
to come. The Egyptians worshipped the <I>eel, </I>which their priests alone had 
the right to eat. Magic <I>eels </I>were made in the eighteenth century of flour 
and the juice of mutton. There may be added a little anecdote told by William of 
Malmesbury. A dean of the church of Elgin, in the county of Moray in Scotland, 
having refused to cede his church to some pious monks, was changed, with all his 
canons, into <I>eels, </I>which the brother cook made into a stew.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Egbo, The :</B> or Esik, is a secret society of Calabar, near the Niger 
delta. The name means tiger,&quot; and the society is divided into eleven 
grades, of which the first three are not open to slaves. Members, as a rule, buy 
themselves into the higher grades in their turn, and the money thus obtained is 
shared amongst the <I>Nyampa </I>who form the inner circle. The king is 
president of the society under the title of <I>Cyamba. </I>Each grade has its 
special festival day, on which their <I>Idem </I>or spirit-master exercises 
complete control. Whenever an <I>Egbo </I>day is announced, slaves, women, and 
children take flight in all directions, as the ambassador of the Idem, armed 
with a heavy whip, goes through the village and lashes everyone whom he may 
encounter. The Idem is usually a hermit who lives in the distant bush-land, and 
when he appears it is in a fantastic guise of mats and branches, which covers 
him from head to foot, and with a black mask on his face. The principals of the 
order themselves are linked together by a garb of leaves so gathered up that 
they seem to move in a connected mass.</P>
<P>The Order of <I>Free Egbos, </I>(says Froebenius) is said to have originated 
at the fairs which were held at a great palm-oil market in the interior, midway 
between Calabar and the Kamerun. As the place became the scene of much disorder, 
while the European trade made it necessary for the maintenance of public credit 
that all engagements should be strictly carried out, this institution was formed 
as a sort of Hanseatic Union under the most influential traders, for the mutual 
safeguarding of their interests. Later it acquired the political character of a 
<I>Vehmgericht </I>or secret tribunal, by bringing within its sphere of action 
the whole police of the Calabars and the Kamerun. The kings always sought to 
secure for themselves the Grand-mastership of the Order, since otherwise their 
authority would sink to a mere shadow. European skippers have frequently found 
it to their advantage to be enrolled in the lower grades, in order thereby the 
more easily to recover their debts. A member of the <I>Egbo </I>has the right to 
claim as his own property the slave of Isis debtor, wherever he may find him, 
merely by fastening a yellow strip to his dress or loincloth. Even in the 
interior of the continent the standing of an <I>Egbo </I>is still respected and 
feared, and affords one a certain immunity from molestation, such as is 
absolutely needed for the extensive commercial speculations in Africa.</P>
<P>In the Kamerun, as a preliminary to their acceptance into the <I>Free Egbos, 
</I>the young men are sent for a protracted period to the Mokokos, a bush tribe 
in the interior; with these they live naked in the fields, and only now and then 
dart out, clad in green leaves, to have a bath in the river. All women, and 
especially slaves, are prohibited, under heavy penalties, from approaching the 
forest where they reside. In the Kamerun, it is customary to pay particular 
honour to a visitor, above all if he be a European, by introducing the <I>Egbo 
</I>goat, which the people are otherwise seldom allowed to set eyes upon.</P>
<P>Holman reports that the whole of the Old Calabar district is subject to the 
rule of the so-called <I>Egbo </I>laws. These are promulgated at a secret 
Council, the <I>Egbo </I>Assembly, which is held in the ' Palaver-house ' 
erected for this special purpose. In virtue of his sovereign rights, the 
head-chief presides, under the title of <I>Cyamab, </I>over this assembly. 
Amongst the members of the <I>Egie </I>there are different ranks, which must be 
acquired in their due order, one after the other. Holman quotes Englishmen who 
state that Europeans have bought themselves into the <I>Egbo, </I>and even into 
the Yampai, in order to be thus better able to get in their money. He gives the 
following as the names and prices of the different grades of <I>Egbo:</P>
<P></I><B>1 </B>Abungo .. <B>.. .. .. 125 </B>bars</P>
<P><B>2</B> Aboko . .. .. .. <B>75</B> bars</P>
<P><B>3</B> Makairo .. .. .. .. <B>400</B> copper bars</P>
<P><B>4</B> Bakimboko .. .. .. <B>100</B> bars</P>
<P><B>5</B> Yampaic .. .. .. <B>850</B> copper bars</P>
<P>&quot;To these must be added rum, clothes, membo, etc.</P>
<P>The Yampai is the only grade whose members are allowed to sit in Council. The 
sums paid for the various titles of the <I>Egbo </I>are distributed exclusively 
amongst the Yampai, who, however, are not limited to a single share, since every 
Yampai can multiply his title as often as he can purchase shares, and these give 
him a claim to the receipt of the corresponding quotas from the profits of the 
whole institution.&quot;</P>

<P>Egg, Orphean :</B> The cosmic doctrine of the Greek sage Orpheus. He says: ' 
God, the uncreated and incomprehensible Being, created all things ; the ether 
proceeded from him; from this the unshapely chaos and the dark night arose, 
which at first covered all things. The unshapen mass was formed into the shape 
of n egg, from which all things have proceeded.&quot; The whole universe has the 
form of an egg, and everything in it strives to attain the same form. The 
Orphean theory has something in common with the doctrines of the magnetic 
philosophers.</P>

<P>Eglamour of Artoys, Sir : </B>A magical English legend of French origin. The 
poem tells of the winning of Christabell by <I>Eglamour. </I>Christabell's 
father will agree to the union if <I>Eglamour </I>will fulfil three tasks. He 
must conquer the giant, Sir Maroke; bring from a distant land the head of an 
enormous boar, and kill a powerful dragon which has been devastating the country 
round Rome. In these adventures he is successful, but is kept in Rome by 
illness. Meantime, Christabell has given birth to a son, and is banished by her 
angry father. Her son is stolen from her by a griffin, and taken to Israel, 
where he is adopted by the king and named Degrabell. Many years afterwards, 
<I>Sir Eglamour </I>and Degramour meet in a tournament for the hand of 
Cliristabell. The former is successful, and eventually their identities are 
revealed. <I>Eglamour </I>and Christabell are married, and return to their 
native country with their son.</P>

<P>Eglinton, Wililam :</B> A well known English medium, who in <B>1876</B> 
succeeded Slade as the principal exponent of slate-writing (q.v.) That 
<I>Eglinton's </I>performances in this direction were very skillfully carried 
out there is abundant evidence, for several practised conjurers, as well as many 
other investigators, were entirely at a loss to explain the <I>modus operandi. 
</I>Yet on one occasion, at least, <I>Eglinton </I>was seen-by Professor Lewis 
Cargill-to write the&quot; spirit messages himself. This was in <B>1886</B>, 
when his slate-writing was attracting attention. Some ten years earlier, when he 
was giving materialisation seances, there were discovered in his portmanteau a 
false beard and some muslin draperies, which were found to correspond with 
fragments cut from the hair and garments of the materialised spirit. Nor were 
these the only occasions on which he made use of fraudulent means of producing 
mediumistic phenomena. It may be objected that <I>Eglinton </I>was &quot; 
controlled &quot; to procure draperies and fake hair, but it necessarily casts a 
dark shadow on his mediumship.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Egypt :</B> To the peoples of antiquity as well as to those of the modern 
world, <I>Egypt </I>appeared as the very mother of magic. The reason for this 
widespread belief is not far to seek. In <I>Egypt </I>the peoples of the ancient 
world found a magical system much more highly developed than anything within 
their native knowledge, and again the cult of the dead with which Egyptian 
religion was so deeply imbued, appeared to the stranger to savour strongly of 
magical practice. It must be borne in mind that, if the matter of the magical 
papyri be omitted, the notices which we possess of Egyptian magic are almost 
wholly foreign, so that it is wiser for a proper understanding of Egyptian 
occultism to derive our facts concerning it from the original native sources as 
far as is possible. Like all other systems, the magic of the Egyptians was of 
two kinds, that which was supposed to benefit either the living or the dead, and 
that which has been known throughout the ages as black&quot; magic or 
necromancy.</P>
<P>The contents of the Westcar Papyrus show that as early as the fourth dynasty, 
the working of magic was a recognised art in <I>Egypt, </I>but in reality we 
must place the beginnings of Egyptian magical practice in neolithic times. 
Throughout the centuries magical practice varied considerably, but the principal 
means for its working remained the same. That is to say, the Egyptians relied 
for magical effect upon amulets, magical figures, pictures, and formulae, 
magical names and ceremonies, and the general apparatus of the occult 
sciences.</P>
<P>The objects for which magic was exercised were numerous. It exorcised storms, 
protected against wild beasts, poison, disease, wounds, and the ghosts of the 
dead. One of the most potent methods of guarding against misfortune of any kind 
was the use of <I>Amulets. </I>It must not be assumed that all ornaments or 
objects discovered on the mummy are of magical potency. These are frequently the 
possession of the <I>Ra </I>or double (q.v.), necessary to its comfort in a 
future existence. The small crowns, sceptres, and emblems of Osiris, usually 
executed in <I>faience, </I>are placed inside the dead person in order that he 
may wear them when he becomes one with Osiris, and therefore a king. The scarab, 
fashioned in the likeness of a scarabaeus beetle, symbolised resurrection. The 
<I>dad </I>symbolised the human skeleton, and, therefore, perhaps, the dead and 
dismembered Osiris. It has an influence on the restoration of the deceased. The 
<I>uza, </I>or eye, signifies the health necessary to the dead man's soul. The 
so-called &quot;palettes&quot; at one time supposed to have been employed for 
the mixing of paint, are now known to have been amulets inscribed with words of 
power placed on the breasts of the dead in neolithic times. The amulet of the 
<I>menat </I>was worn, or held, with the sistrum by gods, kings, and priests, 
and was supposed to bring joy and health to the wearer. It represented the 
vigour of the two sexes.</P><I>
<P>Spells.-The </I>simplest type of spell in use in <I>Egypt, </I>was that in 
which the exorcist threatens the evil principle, or assures it that he can 
injure it. Generally, however, the magician requests the assistance of the gods, 
or he may pretend to that which he desires to exorcise that he is a god. 
Invocations, when written, were usually accompanied by a note to the effect that 
the formula had once been employed successfully by a god-perhaps by a deified 
priest. An incomprehensible and mysterious jargon was employed, which was 
supposed to conceal the name of a certain deity who was thus compelled to do the 
will of the sorcerer. These gods were almost always those of foreign nations, 
and the invocations themselves appear to be attempts at various foreign idioms, 
employed, perhaps, as sounding more mysterious than the native speech. Great 
stress was laid upon the proper pronunciation of these names, and failure in all 
cases was held to lie at the door of mispronunciation. The <I>Book of the Dead 
</I>(q.v.) contains many such &quot;words of power,&quot; and these were 
intended to assist the journey of the dead in the underworld of Amenti. It was 
believed that all supernatural beings, good and evil, possessed hidden names, 
which if a man knew, he could compel them to do his will. The name, indeed, was 
as much part of a man as his body or soul. The traveller through Amenti must 
tell not only the divine gods their names, but must prove that he knew the names 
of a number of the supposedly inanimate objects in the dreary Egyptian Hades, if 
he desired to make any progress. <I>(See </I><B>Gnostics and Names 
Magical.</B>)</P><I>
<P>Magical Books.-Many </I>magical books existed in <I>Egypt </I>which contained 
spells and other formulae for exorcism and necromantic practice. Thus Medical 
Papyri in the Leipsic collection contain formulae spoken whilst preparing drugs 
; the Ebers Papyrus contains such spells; the Harris Magical Papyrus, dating 
from the New Kingdom, and edited by Chabas, contains spells against crocodiles. 
The priestly Caste, who compiled those necromantic works, was known as 
<I>Kerheb, </I>or &quot;scribes of the divine writings,&quot; and even the sons 
of Pharaohs did not disdain to enter their ranks.</P><I>
<P>The Ritual of Egyptian Magic. </I>In many instances the ritual of Egyptian 
magic possesses strong similarities to the ceremonial of other systems and 
countries. Wax figures were employed in lieu of the bodies of persons to be 
bewitched or harmed and models of all kinds were utilised in order that the 
physical force directed against them might react upon the persons or animals it 
was desired to injure. But the principal rite in which ceremonial magic was 
employed was the very elaborate one of mummification. As each bandage was laid 
in its exact position certain words of power were uttered which were supposed to 
be efficacious in the preservation of the part swathed. After evisceration, the 
priest uttered an invocation to the deceased, and then took a vase of liquid 
containing ten perfumes, with which he smeared the body twice from head to foot, 
taking especial care to anoint the head thoroughly. The internal organs were 
then placed on the body, and the backbone immersed in holy oil, supposed to be 
an emanation from the gods Shu and Seb. Certain precious stones were then laid 
on the mummy, each of which had its magical significance. Thus crystal lightened 
his face, and cornelian strengthened his steps. A priest who personified the 
jackal-headed god, Anubis, then advanced, performed certain symbolical 
ceremonies on the head of the mummy, and laid certain bandages upon it. After a 
further anointing with oil the deceased was declared to have &quot;received his 
head.&quot; The mummy's left hand was filled with thirty-six substances used in 
embalming, symbolic of the thirty-six forms of the god Osiris. The body was then 
rubbed with holy oil, the toes wrapped in linen, and after an appropriate 
address the ceremony was completed.</P><I>
<P>Dreams. </I>The art of procuring dreams and their interpretation was much 
practised in <I>Egypt. </I>As instances of dreams recorded in Egyptian texts may 
be quoted those of Thothmes IV. (B.C. <B>1450</B>) and Nut-Amen, King of Egypt 
(B.C. <B>670</B>). The Egyptian magician procured dreams for his clients by 
drawing magical pictures and the recitation of magical words. The following 
formulae for producing a dream is taken from British Museum Papyrus, 
No.<B>122</B>, lines <B>64</B> fi. and <B>359</B> ff.</P>
<P>&quot;To obtain a vision from the god Bes : Make a drawing of Besa, as shewn 
below, on your left hand, and envelope your hand in a strip of black cloth that 
has been consecrated to Isis and lie down to sleep without speaking a word, even 
in answer to a question. Wind the remainder of the cloth round your neck. The 
ink with which you write must be composed of the blood of a cow, the blood of a 
white dove, fresh frankincense, myrrh, black writing ink, cinnabar, mulberry 
juice, rain-water, and the juice of wormwood and vetch. With this write your 
petition before the setting sun, saying, ' Send the truthful seer out of the 
holy shrine, I beseech thee, Lampsuer, Sumarta, Baribas, Dardalam, Iorlex: O 
Lord send the sacred deity Anuth, Anuth, Salbana, Chambre, Breith, now, now, 
quickly, quickly. Come in this very night.'&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;To procure dreams: Take a clean linen bag and write upon it the names 
given below. Fold it up and make it into a lamp-wick, and set it alight, pouring 
pure oil over it. The word to be written is this : ' Armiuth, Lailamchouch, 
Arsenophrephren, Phtha, Archentechtha.' Then in the evening, when you are going 
to bed, which you must do without touching food <I>(or, </I>pure from all 
defilement), do thus : Approach the lamp and repeat seven times the formula 
given below: then extinguish it and he down to sleep. The formula is this: 
Sachmu . . . . epaema Ligotereench: the Aeon, the Thunderer, Thou that hast 
swallowed the snake and dost exhaust the moon, and dost raise up the orb of the 
sun in his season, Chthetho is the name; I require, O lords of the gods, Seth, 
Chreps, give me the information that I desire;'</P><I>
<P>Medical Magic. </I>Magic played a great part in Egyptian medicine. On this 
point Weidemann says: &quot;The Egyptians were not great physicians : their 
methods were purely empirical and their remedies of very doubtful value, but the 
riskiness of their practice arose chiefly from their utter inability to diagnose 
because of their ignorance of anatomy. That the popular respect for the human 
body was great we may gather from the fact that the Paraskhistai who opened the 
body for embalmment were persecuted and stoned as having committed a sinful 
although necessary deed. The prescribed operations in preparing a body for 
embalmment were never departed from, and taught but little anatomy, so that 
until Greek times the Egyptians had only the most imperfect and inaccurate ideas 
of the human organism. They understood nothing about most internal diseases, and 
especially nothing about diseases of the brain, never suspecting them to be the 
result of organic changes, but assuming them to be caused by demons who had 
entered into the sick. Under these circumstances medicines might be used to 
cause the disappearance of the symptoms, but the cure was the expulsion of the 
demon. Hence the Egyptian physician must also practise magic.</P>
<P>&quot;According to late accounts, his functions were comparatively simple, 
for the human body had been divided into thirty-six parts, each presided over by 
a certain demon, and it sufficed to invoke the demon of the part affected in 
order to bring about its cure - a view of matters fundamentally Egyptian. In the 
Book of the Dead we find that different divinities were responsible for the 
well-being of the bodies of the blessed; thus Nu had charge of the hair, Ra of 
the face, Hathor of the eyes, Apuat of the ears, Anubis of the lips, while Thoth 
was guardian of all parts of the body together. This doctrine was subsequently 
applied to the living body. with the difference that for the great gods named in 
the Book of the Dead there were substituted as gods of healing the presiding 
deities of the thirty-six decani, the thirty-six divisions of the Egyptian 
zodiac, as we learn from the names given to them by Celsus and preserved by 
Origen. In earlier times it was not so easy to be determined which god was to be 
invoked, for the selection depended not only on the part affected but also on 
the illness and symptoms and remedies to be used, etc.</P>
<P>&quot;Several Egyptian medical papyri which have come down to us contain 
formulas to be spoken against the demons of disease as well as prescriptions for 
the remedies to be used in specified cases of illness. In papyri of older date 
these conjurations are comparatively rare, but the further the art of medicine 
advanced, or rather receded, the more numerous they became.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It was not always enough to speak the formulas once even their repeated 
recitation might not be successful, and in that case recourse must be had to 
other expedients: secret passes were made, various rites were performed, the 
formulas were written upon papyrus, which the sick person had to swallow, etc., 
etc. But amulets were in general found to be most efficacious, and the personal 
intervention of a god called up, if necessary, by prayers or 
sorcery.&quot;</P><I>
<P>Magical Figures. </I>As has been said the Egyptians believed that it was 
possible to transmit to the figure of any person or animal the soul of the being 
which it represented. In the Westcar Papyrus we read how a soldier who had 
fallen in love with a governor's wife was swallowed by a crocodile when bathing, 
the saurian being a magical replica of a waxen one made by the lady's husband. 
In the official account of a conspiracy against Rameses III. (ca B.C. 
<B>1200</B>) the conspirators obtained access to a magical papyrus in the royal 
library and employed its instructions against the king with disastrous effects 
to themselves. These, too, made waxen figures of gods and of the king for the 
purpose of slaying the latter.</P><I>
<P>Astrology </I>The Egyptians were fatalists, and believed that a man's destiny 
was decided before he was born. The people therefore had recourse to 
astrologers. Says Budge:-</P>
<P>&quot;In magical papyri we are often told not to perform certain magical 
ceremonies on such apd such days, the idea being that on these days hostile 
powers will make them to be powerless, and that gods mightier than those to 
which the petitioner would appeal will be in the ascendant. There have come down 
to us fortunately, papyri containing copies of the Egyptian calendar, in which 
each third of every day for three hundred and sixty days of the year is marked 
lucky or unlucky, and we know from other papyri <I>why </I>certain days were 
lucky or unlucky, and why others were only partly so.&quot; &quot; From the life 
of Alexander the Great by Pseudo-Callisthenes we learn that the Egyptians were 
skilled in the art of casting nativities, and that knowing the exact moment of 
the birth of a man they proceeded to construct his horoscope. Nectanebus 
employed for the purpose a tablet made of gold and silver and acacia wood, to 
which were fitted three belts. Upon the outer belt was Zeus with the thirty-six 
<I>decani </I>surrounding him; upon the second the twelve signs of the Zodiac 
were represented ; and upon the third the sun and moon. He set the tablet upon a 
tripod, and then emptied out of a small box upon it models of the seven stars 
that were in the belts, and put into the middle belt eight precious stones ; 
these he arranged in the places wherein he supposed the planets which they 
represented would be at the time of the birth <I>of </I>Olympias, and then told 
her fortune from them. But the use of the horoscope is much older than the time 
of Alexander the Great, for to a Greek horoscope in the British Museum is 
attached 'an introductory letter from some master of the art of astrology to his 
pupil, named Hermon, urging him to be very exact and careful in his application 
of the laws which the ancient Egyptians, with their laborious devotion to the 
art, had discovered and handed down to posterity.' Thus we have good reason for 
assigning the birthplace of the horoscope to Egypt. In connection with the 
horoscope must be mentioned the &quot;sphere &quot;or&quot; table &quot; of 
Democritus as a means of making predictions as to life and death. In a magical 
papyrus we are told to 'ascertain in what month the sick man took to his bed, 
and the name he received at his birth. Calculate the course of the moon, and see 
how many periods of thirty days have elapsed; then note in the table the number 
of days left over, and if the number comes in the upper part of the table, he 
will live, but if in the lower part he will die.'</P><I>
<P>Ghosts. </I>The conception that the ha or double of man wandered about after 
death, greatly assisted the Egyptian belief in ghosts.</P>
<P>&quot;According to them a man consisted of a physical body, a shadow, a 
double, a soul, a heart, a spirit called the <I>khu, </I>a power, a name, and a 
spiritual body. When the body died the shadow departed from it, and could only 
be brought back to it by the performance of a mystical ceremony; the double 
lived in the tomb with the body, and was there visited by the soul whose 
habitation was in heaven. The soul was, from one aspect, a material thing, and 
like the ha, or double, was believed to partake of the funeral offerings which 
were brought to the tomb; one of the chief objects of sepulchral offerings of 
meat and drink was to keep the double in the tomb and to do away with the 
necessity of its wandering about outside the tomb in search of food. It is clear 
from many texts that, unless the double was supplied with sufficient food, it 
would wander forth from the tomb and eat any kind of offal and drink any kind of 
dirty water which it might find in its path. But besides the shadow, and the 
double, and the soul, the spirit of the deceased, which usually had its abode in 
heaven, was sometimes to be found in the tomb. There is, how-ever, good reason 
for stating that the immortal part of man which lived in the tomb and had its 
special abode in the statue of the deceased was the 'double.' This is proved by 
the fact that a special part of the tomb was reserved for the ha, or double, 
which was called the ' house of the ha,' and that a priest, called the priest of 
the ha, was specially appointed to minister therein.&quot;</P><I>
<P>Esoteric Knowledge of the' Priesthood. </I>The esoteric knowledge of the 
Egyptian priesthood is now believed to have been of the description with which 
the Indian medicine man is credited plus a philosophy akin to that of ancient 
India. Says Davenport Adams:</P>
<P>&quot;To impose upon the common people, the priesthood professed to lead 
lives of peculiar sanctity. They despised the outer senses, as sources of evil 
and temptation. They kept themselves apart from the <I>profanium </I>vulgus, 
'and,' says lamblicus, 'occupied themselves only with the knowledge of God, of 
themselves, and of wisdom ; they desired no vain honours in their sacred 
practice, and never yielded to the influence of the imagination.' Therefore they 
formed a world within a world, fenced round by a singular awe and wonder, 
apparently abstracted from the things of earth, and devoted to the constant 
contemplation of divine mysteries. They admitted few strangers into their order, 
and wrapt up their doctrines in a hieroglyphical language, which was only 
intelligible to the initiated. To these various precautions was added the 
solemnity of a terrible oath, whose breach was invariably punished with 
death.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The Egyptian priests preserved the remaining relics of the former 
wisdom of nature. These were not imparted as the sciences are, in our age, but 
to all appearances they were neither learned nor taught ; but as a reflection of 
the old revelations of nature, the perception must arise like an inspiration in 
the scholar's mind. From this cause appear to have arisen those numerous 
preparations and purifications the severity of which deterred many from 
initiation into the Egyptian priesthood in fact, not in-frequently resulted in 
the scholar's death. Long fasting, and the greatest abstinence, appear to have 
been particularly necessary : besides this, the body was rendered insensible 
through great exertions, and even through voluntarily inflicted pain, and 
therefore open to the influence of the mind. The imagination was excited by 
representations of the mysteries ; and the inner sense was more impressed by the 
whole' than-as is the case with us-instructed by an explanation of simple facts. 
In this manner the dead body of science was not given over to the initiated, and 
left to chance whether it would become animated or not, but the living soul of 
wisdom was breathed into them.</P>
<P>&quot;From this fact, that the contents of the mysteries were rather revealed 
than taught-were received more from inward inspiration and mental intoxication, 
than outwardly through endless teaching, it was necessary to conceal them from 
the mass of the people. </P>
<P>So says Schubert, dealing with the same subject : The way to every innovation 
was closed, and outward knowledge and science could certainly not rise to a high 
degree of external perfection ; but that rude sensuality, inclination for change 
and variety, was suppressed as the chief source of all bodily and spiritual 
vices. is clear, as well as that here, as in India, an ascetic and contemplative 
life was recommended.</P>
<P>&quot;They imparted their secret and divine sciences to no one who did not 
belong to their caste, and it was long impossible for foreigners to learn 
anything; it was only in later times that a few strangers were permitted to 
enter the initiation after many severe preparations and trials. Besides this, 
their functions were hereditary, and the son followed the footsteps of his 
father.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Concerning that which passed within the temples, and of the manner in 
which the sick were treated, we have but fragmentary accounts; for to the 
uninitiated the entrance was forbidden, and the initiated kept their vows. Even 
the Greeks, who were admitted to the temples, have been silent concerning the 
secrets, and have only here and there betrayed portions. Jablonski says, ' that 
but few chosen priests were admitted into the sanctum, and that admission was 
scarcely ever permitted to strangers even under the severest 
regulations.'&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Dealing with the subject of hypnotism in <I>Egypt, </I>Montfaucon 
says.. Magnetism was daily practised in the temples of Isis, of Osiris, and 
Serapis. In these temples the priests treated the sick and cured them, either by 
magnetic manipulation, or by other means producing somnambulism.&quot; 
Presenting a painting of a mesmeric scene, he says : Before a bed or table, on 
which be the sick, stands a person in a brown garment, and with open eyes, and 
the dog's head of Anubis. His countenance is turned towards the sick person ; 
his left hand is placed on the breast, and the right is raised over the head of 
his patient, quite in the position of a magnetiser.</P>

<P>Elder Tree :</B> The <I>elder </I>had wonderful influence as a protection 
against evil. Wherever it grew, witches were powerless.. In this country, 
gardens were protected by having <I>elder trees </I>planted at the entrance, and 
sometimes hedges of this plant were trained round the garden. There are very few 
old gardens in country places in which are not still seen remains of the 
protecting <I>elder tree. </I>&quot; In my boyhood&quot; says Napier, I remember 
that my brothers, sisters, and myself were warned against breaking a twig or 
branch from the <I>elder </I>hedge which surrounded my grandfather's garden. We 
were told at the time as a reason for this prohibition, that it was poisonous ; 
but we discovered afterwards that there was another reason, viz., that it was 
unlucky to break off even a small twig from a bourtree bush.&quot; In some parts 
of the Continent this superstition feeling is so strong that, before pruning it, 
the gardener says : <I>Elder, elder, </I>may I cut thy branches ? &quot; If no 
response be heard, it is considered that assent has been given and then, after 
spitting three times, the pruner begins his cutting. According to Montanus, 
<I>elder </I>wood formed a portion of the fuel used ill the burning of human 
bodies as a protection against evil influences ; and, the drivers of hearses had 
their whip handles made of <I>elder </I>wood for a similar reason. In some parts 
of Scotland, people would not put a piece of <I>elder </I>wood into the fire, 
and Napier says Pieces of this wood lying about unused when the neighbourhood 
was in great straits for firewood but none would use it, and when asked why ? 
the answer was: We don't know, but folks say it is not lucky to burn the 
bourtree.&quot; It was believed that children laid in a cradle made wholly or in 
part of elderwood, would not sleep well, and were in danger of falling out of 
the cradle. <I>Elder </I>berries gathered on St. John's Eve, would prevent the 
possessor suffering from witchcraft, and often bestowed upon him magical powers. 
If the <I>elder </I>were planted in the form of a cross upon a new-made grave, 
and if it bloomed, it was a sure sign that the soul of the dead person was 
happy.</P>

Normandy peasant girl, whose' phenomena were first observed about <B>1846</B>. 
Finally she was taken to Paris and placed under the observation of Dr. Tanchon 
and others, who testified to the actuality of the phenomena. These included the 
movement of objects without contact, or at a mere touch from Angelique's 
petticoats, the agitation in her presence of the magnetic needle, and the 
blowing of a cold wind. She was also able to distinguish between the poles of a 
magnet at a touch. A commission appointed by the Academy of Sciences, however, 
could observe nothing but the violent movements of her chair, which were 
probably caused by muscular force. Other <I>electric girls </I>practised about 
the' same time', and even after the' begin-ding of the' spiritualistic movement

<I>electrum </I>are of the' tell-tale character.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Elementary Spirits :</B> The unseen intelligences who inhabit the' four 
elements, of the finest essence of which they are composed. The creatures of the 
air are called sylphs; of the earth gnomes; of fire salamanders; and of water, 
nymphs or undines. The best authority on the subject is the Abbe de' Villars, 
who published early in the' eighteenth century a short treatise' entitled 
<I>Comte de Gabalis, </I>from which a good deal of what follows is drawn. 
According to this work the creatures of the elements were' before' the Fall 
subject to Adam in all things, and we arc led to understand that by means of 
certain performances this ancient communication may be' restored, and that man 
may once' more' have at his beck and call the' <I>elementary spirits. </I>The' 
Abbe give's a brief sketch of the nature' of these' peoples. The' air, he' says, 
is filled with a great number of beings of human form, somewhat fierce' in 
appearance, but really of a docile' nature. They are much interested in the 
sciences, and are subtle, officious towards the' sages, hostile' toward&quot;' 
the foolish and the ignorant. Their wives and daughters are of a masculine type 
of beauty, such as is depicted in the Amazons. The seas and rivers are' 
inhabited as well as the' air, beings dwelling therein whom the' sage's 
designated undine's, or nymphs. The female' population much exceeds the' male', 
the women being exceedingly beautiful, so that among the' daughters of men 
there' is none to equal them. The earth is filled almost to the centre' with 
gnome's, people' of small stature', the' guardians of subterranean treasure, 
minerals and precious stone's. They are ingenious, friendly towards men, and 
easy to command. They provide' the' children of the' sage's with all the money 
they require, asking no other reward for their services than the glory of 
performing them. The gnomides, their wives, are small of stature' but very 
good-looking, and they dress very curiously. As for the salamanders, the' 
inhabitants of the' region of fire', they serve' the' philosophers, but are' not 
over-anxious for their company, while their daughters and wives are' rarely 
seen. Their women are' very beautiful, beyond all the other elementals, since 
they dwell in a purer element. Their habits, mode of life, manners and laws are' 
admirable', and the attractions of their minds are greater even than that of 
their persons. The' Supreme Being they know and religiously adore', but have' no 
hope of eternal enjoyment of Him, since their souls are mortal. True' it is 
that, being composed of the' purest parts of the' elements wherein they dwell, 
and having no contrary qualities, they can live' for several centuries; yet are' 
they much troubled because' of their mortal nature. It was, however, revealed to 
the' philosophers that an <I>elementary spirit </I>could attain to immortality 
by being united in marriage' with a human being. The' children born of such 
unions are' more' noble' and heroic than the' children of human men and women, 
and some of the greatest figures of antiquity-Zoroaster, Alexander, Hercules, 
Merlin, to mention a few-are' declared to have been the children of 
<I>elementary spirits.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P></I>
<P>The salamanders, the Comte de Gabalis goes on to say, are composed of the' 
most subtle' particles of the' sphere of fire, conglobated and organised by the 
action of the' Universal Fire', so called because' it is the' principle of all 
the motions of nature'. The sylphs are' composed of the purest atoms of the air; 
the' nymphs, of the' most delicate particle's of water; and the' gnomes, of the' 
finest essence of earth. Adam was in complete' accord with these' creatures 
because', being composed of that which was purest in the' four elements, he' 
contained in himself the' perfections of these' four people's, and was their 
natural king. But since by reason of his sin he' had been cast into the' 
excrements of the' elements, there' no longer existed the' harmony between him, 
so impure' and gross, and these' fine' and ethereal substance's. The' Abbe then 
gives a recipe whereby the' resultant state of things may be' remedied and the' 
ancient correspondence' restored. To attain this end we must purify and exalt 
the element of fire which is within us. All that is necessary is to concentrate' 
the' fire' of the' world by means of concave' mirrors, in a globe' of glass. 
There' will then be formed within the globe' a solary powder, which, having 
purified itself from the admixture' of other elements, becomes in a very short 
time a sovereign means of exalting the' fire' which is in us, and makes us, so 
to speak, of an igneous nature'. Thenceforward these' creatures of the' fire' 
become' our inferiors, and, delighted at the' restoration of mutual harmony 
between themselves and the human race', they will show towards man all the' 
good-will they have' for their own kind. Sylphs, gnome's, and nymphs are' more 
familiar with man than are' the salamanders, on account of their shorter term of 
life', and it is therefore' easier to get into touch with them. To accomplish 
the' restoration of our empire' over the sylphs, gnome's, or nymphs, we must 
close' a glass full of air, earth, or water, and expose' it to the sun for a 
month, at the end of which period its various elements must be' separated 
according to science'. This process is most easy in this case of water and 
earth. &quot;Thus,&quot; says the' Comte &quot;without characters, without 
ceremonies, without barbarous words, it is possible to rule' absolutely over 
these peoples.&quot; Other authorities prescribe' other means of obtaining 
dominion over the spirits of the' elements. Eliphas Levi, for instance, state's 
that anyone' desirous of subjugating' the elementals must first perform the' 
four trials of antique initiation; but as the' original trials are no longer 
known similar ones must be substituted. Thus he who would control the' sylphs 
must walk fearlessly on the' edge of a precipice, he who would win the service' 
of the salamanders must take his stand in a burning building, and so on, the' 
point of the ordeals being that the' man should show himself unafraid of the 
elements whose' inhabitants he' desires to rule'. In mediaeval times the 
evocation and exorcism of <I>elementary spirits </I>was much practised, the' 
crystal being a favourite means of evoking them. The' exorcism of earth is 
performed by means of breathing, sprinkling of water, and burning of incense', 
and the' repetition of a formula of prayer to the' gnomes. Air is exorcised by 
breathing towards the four cardinal points, and by the' recital of prayers to 
the air-spirits (sylphs). The casting of salt, incense, sulphur, camphor, and 
white' resin into a fire is declared efficacious in the exorcism of that 
element. In the case of water, breathing and laying on of hands, repetition of 
formulae, mixing of salt and ashes of incense, and other ceremonials are to be 
observed. In every instance' a special consecration of the four elements is a 
primary and essential part of the proceedings.</P>
<P>As has been said, it is possible for a human being to confer immortality on 
an <I>elementary spirit </I>by the' ceremony of marriage'. But this doe's not 
always occur sometimes the reverse is the case, and the' elementals share their 
mortality with their human mate. In literature, at all events, countless stories 
relate how men have' risked and lost their immortality by marrying a sylph or an 
undine. According to the Comte de Gabalis, however, it would seem to be a matter 
of choice whether a man confers his immortality on his ethereal partner, or 
whether he partakes of her mortal nature; for it is therein suggested that 
those' who have not been predestined to eternal happiness would do we'll to 
marry with an elemental, and spare themselves an eternity of woe.</P>
<P>Not every authority has painted so attractive a picture of the' creatures of 
the elements as has the Abbe do Villars. By some it is believed that there' are 
numberless degree's among these' beings, the highest resembling the' lowest 
angels, while' the lowest may often be' mistaken for demons, which, of course, 
they are not. Not only do multitudinous variations of form and disposition 
characterise the elementals of our own planet; the other planets and the' stars 
are the' abode' of countless hosts of <I>elementary spirits, </I>differing from 
those' of our world perhaps more' than the' latter differ from one' another. All 
the' forms of beasts, insects, and reptiles may be' taken by the lower 
elementals, as we'll as strange combinations of the shapes of different animals. 
The inhabitants of each element have their peculiar virtues and vices which 
serve to distinguish them. The sylphs are capricious and inconstant, but agile 
and active; the undines, jealous and cold, but observant; the salamanders, hot 
and hasty, but energetic and strong; and the' gnome's, greedy of gold and 
treasure's, but nevertheless hard-working, good-tempered and patient. One' who 
would seek dominion over any of these must practise' their virtues; but 
carefully avoid their faults, thus conquering them, as it were, on their own 
ground. Each species can only dwell in its own proper element. Thus a sylph may 
not invade the sphere of a salamander, or <I>vice versa, </I>while both would 
be' decidedly out of their element in the' regions of the' nymphs or the' 
gnome's. Four rulers have' been set over the four species-Gob, ruler of the 
gnome's; Paralda, of the' sylphs; Djin, of the salamanders; and Necksa, of the 
nymphs. To the' dwellers in each element is assigned a point of the' compass, 
where lie's their special kingdom. To the gnome's is given the' north; to the 
salamanders, the' south; to the sylphs, the' east; and to the undine's, the' 
west. The gnomes influence' those of a melancholic disposition, because they 
dwell in the gloom of subterranean caverns. The salamanders have' an effect on 
those of sanguine temperament, because' their home is in the fire. The 
influence' of the undine's is upon the phlegmatic, and of the' sylphs upon those 
of a bilious temperament. Though as a rule' they are' invisible' to human eyes, 
they may on occasion become visible' to those' who invoke them, to the' sages 
and philosophers, or even to the multitude. In the' reign of king Pepin, 
Zedekias suggested to the sylphs that they should appear to men, whereupon the' 
air was seen to be full of them, sometimes ranged in battle, or in an aerial 
navy. It was said by the' people that they were' sorcerers-an opinion to which 
Charlemagne and Louis the Debonnair subscribed, the latter at least imposing 
heavy penalties on the' supposed sorcerers. So that they might behold their 
admirable institutions, certain men we're' raised up in the' air, and while' 
descending we're seen by their fellowmen on earth. The latter regarded them as 
stragglers of the aerial army of sorcerers, and thought that they had come' to 
poison the' fruits and fountains. These' unfortunate' persons we're' thereupon 
put to death, along with many others suspected of connection with the' 
sorcerers.</P>
<P>To return to the' consideration of the nature of these' spirits, we find them 
collated in the <I>Comte de Gabalis </I>with the oracles of antiquity, and even 
with the' classic pantheons of Greece and Rome. Pan, for example, was the first 
and oldest of the nymphs, and the news of his death, communicated by the people 
of the air to the inhabitants of the waters, was proclaimed by them in a voice 
that was heard sounding over all the rivers of Italy-&quot; The great Pan is 
dead &quot; Mr. A. E. Waite considers that the&quot; angels&quot; evoked in 
medieval magic, as we'll as the' &quot;devils&quot; of the Sabbath, were higher 
or lower elementals. Others may see in the brownies and domestic spirits of 
folk-lore some resemblance to the subjugated <I>elementary spirit. </I>Even the 
familiar poltergeist, where he does not clearly establish his identity as the 
spirit of a deceased person. may be regarded with propriety as an elemental. The 
Theosophists use' the word ' elemental&quot; in a different sense, tQ denote' 
the' &quot; astral remains &quot; (See Shell) of one who has lived an evil life' 
on earth, and who is loath to leave' the scene of his pleasure's. With some 
occultists, again, &quot; elemental&quot; really signifies a sub-human being, 
probably identical with an <I>elementary spirit, </I>but of a mental and moral 
status considerably lower than that of a human being. M.J.</P>

<P>Elf Arrows :</B> The superstitious name given to triangular flints, 
<I>Belemnites, </I>which are found in many countries, but notably in Scotland. 
It was believed that these stones were arrows shot by the elves, which prove 
fatal to cattle, -the cure being to touch them with the arrow with which they 
have been hit, and give them to drink of water in which the arrow has been 
dipped. It is even on record that an Irish bishop was thus shot at by an evil 
spirit; and it is said that they are' manufactured by the' Devil with the help 
of attendant imps who roughhew them, while' the' Archfiend finishes the' work. 
Cases are' on record where' they have' been known to be made' and used by the 
witches of Scotland within historic times. Similar superstitions regarding

<P>Elf-Fire :</B> The <I>Ignis fatuus, </I>or &quot;foolish fire'.&quot; This is

believed that these wandering lights are' the souls of still-born children, who 
do not desire to lure' people from the path, but who get no rest until they find 
their bodies.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Elixir of Life :</B> No doubt exists that the medieval alchemists and mystics 
believed that they were' perfectly justified in their search for the <I>Elixir 
of Life, </I>the universal medicine, and the' renewal of youth. This, with the 
quest for gold, became' the grand aim of alchemy, and although this search may 
have' had a psychical and mystical side', it most certainly had a physical one'. 
But there does not seem to have been any standard method of accomplishing the 
manufacture' of the <I>elixir. </I>Thus in <I>Petit Albert </I>one' is 
instructed to take' <B>8</B>lbs. of sugar of mercury as the' foundation of such 
a mixture'; while' Bernard Trevisan believes that the' precipitation of the' 
philosopher's stone into mercurial water results in the manufacture' of the 
<I>elixir. </I>This he' state's, will when elaborated to the' Red, transmute 
copper and other metals into pure' gold, and if elaborated to the' White', will 
produce' unalloyed silver.</P>
<P>But the' application of the' <I>elixir </I>to the prolongation of life' was 
undoubtedly the chief reason for its continued search. The retired alchemist in 
his later years, wearied with his quest for gold, craved the boon of youth and 
desired renewed health and strength to assist him to carry out his great 
purpose. As an illustration of the alchemical conception of the elixir of 
<I>life, </I>we quote the following from a work dealing with the secret of 
rejuvenescence, originally supposed to have been written by Arnold de Villanova, 
and published by Longueville-Harcour at Paris in <B>1716</B>:-</P>
<P>&quot;To renew youth is to enter once more into that felicitous season which 
imparts to the human frame the pleasures and strength of the morning. Here it is 
to no purpose that we should speak of that problem so much discussed by the 
Wise, whether the art can be carried to such a pitch of excellence that old age 
should itself be made young. We know that Paracelsus has vaunted the metamorphic 
resources of his Mercury of Life which not merely rejuvenates men but converts 
metals into gold ; He who promised unto others the years of the sybils, or at 
least the <B>300 </B>winters of Nestor, himself perished at the age of 
thirty-seven. Let us turn rather to Nature, so admirable in her' achievements, 
and deem her not capable alone of destroying what she has produced at the moment 
she has begotten them. Is it possible that she will refuse unto man, for whom 
all was created, what she accords to the stags, the eagles, and the serpents, 
who do annually cast aside the mournful concomitants of senility, and do assume 
the most brilliant, the most gracious amenities of the most joyous youth ? Art,. 
it is true, has not as yet arrived at that apex of perfection wherefrom it can 
renew our youth; but that which was unachieved in the past may be accomplished 
in the future, a prodigy which may be more confidently expected from the fact 
that in isolated cases it has actually already taken place, as the facts of 
history make evident. By observing and following the manner in which nature 
performs such wonders, we may assuredly hope to execute this desirable 
transformation, and the first condition is an amiable temperament, such as that 
which was possessed by Moses, of whom it is written that for one hundred and 
twenty years his sight never failed him.</P>
<P>&quot;The stag, eagle, and sparrow-hawk renew their youth. Aldrovandus has 
written on the rejuvenescence of the eagle. Among the birds of the air, we are 
told by Pliny that the raven and the phoenix live, each of them six hundred 
years. No one denies that the stag is renewed by feeding on vipers and serpents, 
while the apes of Caucasus, whose diet is pepper, prove a sovereign remedy for 
the lion, who grows young by devouring their flesh. Those who have written of 
the elephant maintain that his normal life is extended through three centuries, 
while the horse, which alone in creation participates in the natures of man, of 
the lion, of the ox, the sheep, the mule, the stag, the wolf, the fox, the 
serpent, and the hare, from each deriving three of its qualities, has 
occasionally survived with undiminished vigour the lapse of a hundred years. The 
serpent, who is instrumental in the rejuvenescence of the stag, himself renews 
his youth at the shedding of his scales, from all which considerations, it 
follows that it is not beyond belief that a like prodigy may be found in the 
superior order of the same productions whence man has been himself derived, for 
man is assuredly not in a worse condition than the beasts whom he 
rules.&quot;</P>
<P>Trithemius (q.v.) on his death-bed dictated a receipt which he said would 
preserve mind, health and memory with perfect sight and hearing, for those who 
made use of it. It consists of among other things, calomel, gentian, cinnamon, 
aniseed, nard, coral, tartar, mace, and five grammes of it were to be taken 
night and morning in wine or brodium during the whole of the first month; during 
the second month, in the morning only; during the third month thrice in the 
week, and so continuing through life. This is a more understandable receipt than 
that of Eu-genius Philalethes, who says: &quot; Ten parts of coelestiall slime; 
separate the male from the female, and each after wards from its own earth, 
physically, mark you, and with no violence. Conjoin after separation in due, 
harmonic vitall proportion; and straightway, the Soul descending from the 
pyroplastic sphere, shall restore, by a mirific embrace, its dead and deserted 
body. Prbceed according to the Volcanico magica theory, till they are exalted 
into the Fifth Metaphysical Rota. This is that world-renowned medicine, whereof 
so many have scribbled, which, notwithstanding, so few have known.&quot;</P>
<P>In his <I>History of Magic </I>Eliphas Levi gives Cagliostro's great secret 
of rejuvenescence in the following terms:</P>
<P>&quot;Let us now turn to the secret of physical regeneration to attain which 
- according to the occult prescription of the Grand Copht-a retreat of forty 
days, after the manner of a jubilee, must be made once in every fifty years, 
beginning during the full moon of May in the company of one faithful person 
only. It must be also a fast of forty days, drinking May-dew-collected from 
sprouting corn with a cloth of pure white linen-and eating new and tender herbs. 
The repast should begin with a large glass of dew and end with a biscuit or 
crust of bread. There should be slight bleeding on the seventeenth day. Balm of 
Azoth should then be taken morning and evening, beginning with a dose of six 
drops and increasing by two drops daily till the end of the thirty-second day. 
At the dawn which follows thereafter renew the slight bleeding; then take to 
your bed and remain in it till the end of the fortieth day.</P>
<P>&quot;On the first awakening after the bleeding. take the first grain of 
Universal Medicine. A swoon of three hours will be followed by convulsions, 
sweats and much purging, necessitating a change both of bed and linen. At this 
stage a broth of lean beef must be taken, seasoned with rice, sage, valerian, 
vervain and balm. On the day following take the second grain of Universal 
Medicine, which is Astral Mercury combined with Sulphur of Gold. On the next day 
have a warm bath. On the thirty-sixth day drink a glass of Egyptian wine, and on 
the thirty-seventh take the third and last grain of Universal Medicine. A 
profound sleep will follow, during which the hair, teeth, nails and skin will be 
renewed. The prescription for the thirty-eighth day is another warm bath, 
steeping aromatic herbs in the water, of the same kind as those specified for 
the broth. On the thirty-ninth day drink ten drops of Elixir of Acharat in two 
spoonsful of red wine. The work will be finished on the fortieth day, and the 
aged man will be renewed in youth.</P>
<P>&quot;By means of this jubilary regimen, Cagliostro claimed to have lived for 
many centuries. It will be seen that it is a variation of the famous Bath of 
Immortality in use among the Menandrian Gnostics.&quot;</P>
<P>Aristeus is stated to have left to his disciples a secret which rendered all 
metals diaphanous, and man immortal. The process would appear to consist in a 
mystic treatment of the atmosphere, which is to 'be congealed and distilled 
until it develops the divine sparkle, and subsequently becomes liquified. It is 
then subjected to heat and undergoes several other processes, when the elixir 
emerges.</P>
<P>There is surprisingly little literature upon the subject of the <I>Elixir of 
Life. </I>But a more prolonged notice on the subject will be found under the 
article &quot; Philosopher's stone &quot; (q.v.).</P>

<P>Elongation :</B> The phenomenon of <I>elongation </I>is a fairly common one' 
at spiritualistic seance's. It may be described as a stretching out of the 
medium's body, till his height is in-creased by from three inches to nearly a 
foot. The feat is ascribed to spirit agencies. There are accounts by witnesses 
of standing in the social and scientific world of <I>elongations </I>of Herne, 
Home, Morse', and other well-known mediums. These manifestations usually made 
their appearance only when the light was low, but there were several exceptions. 
In describing an <I>elongation </I>of Home', Lord Lindsay says: &quot; Home 
looked as if he' was pulled up by the' neck, the muscles seemed in a state' of 
tension. He stood firmly upright in the middle' of the' room, and before the 
<I>elongation </I>commenced I placed my foot on his instep.&quot; The same 
witness also declares that the' increase in Home's height on this occasion was 
eleven inches. Most accounts describe a violent swaying motion on the' part of 
the medium as preceding the <I>elongation, </I>which some critics have regarded 
a a convenient mode of covering the use of mechanism, which might be concealed 
in the medium's boots.</P>

<P>Elymas, the Sorcerer :</B> A magician of Paphos, in Cyprus, who openly defied 
the apostle Paul before' the Roman governor. The latter, who did not know 
whether to credit Paul or <I>Elymas, </I>summoned them both before' him, when 
the apostle suffered the indignity referred to. &quot; Oh, full of all subtlety 
and mischief,&quot; said Paul, in righteous anger, child of the devil, enemy of 
all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord ? 
And, now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, 
not seeing the' sun for a season.&quot; It is not related in what manner 
<I>Elymas </I>exercised his talents, or what were the characteristics of his 
sorceries, but we' are told that the sentence of Paul immediately took effect, 
and &quot;there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he' went about, seeking 
some to lead him by the hand.&quot;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Emanations :</B> Variously defined as subtle fluid, astral influence, psychic 
force, physical effluence, magnetism, radiations and vibrations. They are said 
to proceed from and surround all bodies and objects in nature, and when brought 
into contact through this medium, influencing and re-acting on each other, the' 
result being either interpenetration or repulsion. The attractive properties of 
the magnet were known to the ancients, some authorities claiming that it was 
used in their religious rites and mysteries, in Egypt, Greece and Rome. They 
adduced as evidence the' iron rings and wings used in the Samothracian 
mysteries, the iron wings worn by the priests of Jupiter to increase their 
magical power, and in the' various symbols ascribed to the' pagan gods. It is 
said too that meteoric stones, because' of their supposed radiation of force', 
were also made use of in the' religious rites, either being worshipped, or 
employed for purposes of divination and soothsaying. Small one's were worn by 
the priests and Pliny tells of the temple of Arsinoe which was vaulted with 
magnetic stone in order to receive a hovering statue of its patron. Cedrenus 
gives an account of an ancient image in the Serapium at Alexandria being 
suspended by magnetic force.</P>
<P>The most ancient writing extant in which this theory of <I>emanations </I>may 
be traced is ascribed to Timaeus of Locris in which he' ascribes the' creation 
of the' universe to the' divine <I>emanations </I>of God, an imparting of His 
being to unformed matter. By this union a world-soul was created which vitalises 
and regulates all things. Claudian in his <I>Idyl of the Magnet </I>uses it as a 
symbol of the informative' spirit of things, the laws of nature, creative and 
existent.</P>
<P>The mysticism of the' seventeenth and eighteenth centuries mainly depends on 
these ideas of radiations emanating from all things but especially the' stars, 
magnets and human beings, of a force which would act on all things and was 
controlled by the indwelling spirit. The writings of Paracelsus abound with 
instances of the theory. He' asserts that every substance in itself contains 
something of the nature of the loadstone; that the astral light, which is one of 
the finer media of nature, finer than the lurminiferous ether, exists throughout 
planetary space especially around the' brain and spinal cords of human beings; 
<I>(See </I>article Aura) that we' are' all but organised magnets having each 
our pole's which attract and repel; that our thoughts are magnetic <I>emanations 
</I>escaping from our brains. His theory of the universe was that it emanated 
from a great first Being and there was a reciprocity in all things. In man too 
there' exists an astral quality, emanating from the stars, which, whether 
physical or not, when compared with the physical body may be considered a 
spirit. This life stands in connection with the stars from which it sprang and 
draws to it their power like a magnet. He calls this Sidereal life the magnes 
microcosmi and makes use' of it to explain the manifestations of nature - it 
glows in the flower, glides in the stream, moves in the ocean and shines in the' 
sky. Van Helmont speaks of an ethereal spirit, pure' and living, which pervades 
all things. Robert Fludd explained sympathy and antipathy by the' action of the 
emanatory spheres surrounding man-in sympathy the <I>emanations </I>proceeding 
from the centre', in antipathy the' opposite movement taking place. He 
maintained that these sensitive <I>emanations </I>are to be found also amongst 
animals and plants, drawing an argument from the fact that if dead and inert 
substance's, such as the' earth and magnet seem to be, should have their 
<I>emanations </I>and their poles, their living forms must needs have them 
likewise. In the writings of Maxwell, a Scotch physician, is to be' found the 
statement: &quot;There' is a linking together of spirits, an incessant 
outpouring of the rays of our body into another.&quot; Athanasius Kircher 
elaborated the theory deriving all natural phenomena from the action of magnetic 
radiation ; the arts and sciences being also <I>emanations. </I>Wirdig, 
Bartholin and many more pursued 'and developed their philosophical 
investigations along these line's.</P>
<P>Descartes asserted that all space is filled with a fluid matter which he held 
to be elementary, the foundation and fountain of all life', enclosing all globes 
and keeping them in motion. In Newton's doctrine of attraction, which he called 
the Divine' Sensorium, the idea of emanation and magnetism is found. The 
following quotation is from his <I>Fundamental Principles of Natural Philosophy: 
</I>&quot; Here' the question is of a very subtle' spirit which penetrates 
through all, even the' hardest bodies and which is concealed in their 
substance'. Through the strength and activity of this spirit, bodies attract 
each other and adhere' together when brought into contact. Through it electrical 
bodies operate at the' remotest distances as we'll as near at hand, attracting 
and repelling; through this spirit the light also flows and is refracted and 
reflected and warms bodies.&quot; Mesmer enunciated the' following propositions 
: &quot; Between the' heavenly bodies, the earth and human beings, there exists 
a mutual or interchangeable influence. The medium of this influence is an 
universally distributed fluid which suffers no vacuum, is of a rarity with which 
nothing can compare and has the' property of receiving and transmitting all 
impressions of movement. Animal bodies experience the mutual effect of this 
agent, because it penetrates the nerves and affects them directly. In the' human 
body particularly are observed properties analagous to those' of the' magnet. It 
is shown by experiment that <I>a </I>matter flows out so fine that it penetrates 
all bodies without apparently losing any of its activity. This may be' 
communicated to other bodies, animate or inanimate, such as mirrors; it is 
communicated, propagated, augmented by sound. Its virtues may be accumulated, 
concentrated and transported.&quot; On this theory he' based his famous 
&quot;Animal Magnetism&quot; (q.v.) and its practice for the' cure of disease', 
in fact all human ailments. Baron von Reichenbach, a man of scientific 
attainments, a chemist and metallurgist of some' repute, conducted a series of 
experiments to investigate this theory. He' procured the aid of a large number 
of sensitives, clairvoyants and mediums. These' persons he' placed in dark 
rooms, and then submitted to their spiritual sight magnets, shells, crystals, 
minerals, animals, human hands and a great variety of animate' and inanimate' 
objects, known only to himself but detected by the sensitive's through the 
luminous <I>emanations </I>given forth by each substance'. These' <I>emanations 
</I>or flames differed in colour, size and intensity according to the nature of 
the' object examined. The' sensations experienced seemed mainly of two 
kinds-temperature and perceptions of light and colour. The poles of the magnet 
emitted flames, reddish yellow from the' south pole', bluish green from the 
north; a similar polarity was observed in the' luminous <I>emanations </I>from 
crystals. The human fingers radiated light. Elementary substances each had their 
distinctive light and colour, the' metals giving the most vivid impressions. 
Iron, copper, bismuth, mercury and others gave off a red glow, each differing 
from the others; the flames emitted by lead, cobalt and palladium were blue'; 
those' of silver, gold, cadmium, diamond we're white. The' clairvoyants also 
perceived the luminous matter over the bodies of the' sick in hospitals; and a 
column of misty vapour hovering over a newly made grave'. This radiance emitted 
by the' various substances, was capable of illuminating other objects. It could 
be concentrated by a lens, reflected by a mirror but produced no effect on a 
thermometer and was liable' to be absorbed by the glass of the percipient's 
spectacle's. A large number of the' sensitive's fully corroborated each other's 
statements and observations, two artists amongst them sketching their 
clairvoyant visions. These' experiments of the' Baron's were conducted for years 
with the' most persevering attention and he arrived at the' conclusion that from 
every object in the' human, animal, vegetable' and mineral kingdom there 
emanated a force' which could be detected under favourable' conditions as 
flame's or luminous radiations. Some observers defined these as the' universal 
life of things. Reichenbach in his writings and descriptions of the experiments 
called them the &quot; Od Force&quot; or &quot;Odyle'.&quot; Modern Spiritualism 
claims that all physical phenomena such as materialisations, (q.v.) levitation, 
(q.v.) apports, (q.v.) table-rapping etc. are' produced by the' spirits' 
manipulations of the medium's more' physical <I>emanations </I>in such a way as 
to give them power to manifest materially and control matter. The finer phases 
of mediumship are traced to a similar use of the' psychic aura or force' emitted 
from the medium's personality. Theosophy has elaborated the theory of 
<I>emanations </I>into grandiose conceptions of astral light, influences, auras, 
etc. In Paris, in <B>1901</B>, a peculiar phenomenon produced through the' 
agency of a young Roumanian gentleman was investigated by Dr. Rozier. Broussay 
could occasion a gaseous bubbling of water when this was enclosed in a bottle 
and over this ebullition he had more or less control. In Dr. Rozier's presence 
this was carried out by the following process. A white glass bottle was taken, a 
quarter filled with water, and the neck of this was firmly closed up by 
Broussay's hand. It was then turned upside down and held tightly so that no 
moisture could possibly escape. On watching the water thus brought into touch 
with the hand minute air bubble's formed rapidly and rose in threadlike line's 
to the' surface. After lapse of a minute' or two the' appearance intensified and 
the bubbles rose in greater number until the effect resembled soda water in 
effervesence. When the experiment was at its height the bubbles seemed to fly 
from every part of the hand which was exposed to the' water and gathered round 
the neck of the' bottle' while' a crackling sound was audible. Light had no 
effect on the experiment and the' temperature of M. Broussay was normal, 
<B>37</B>deg. to <B>38</B>deg. at most. This experiment is similar to a 
favourite performance' given by Indian jugglers, who will boil an egg in from 
five to ten minutes at most without fire to heat the' water. An explanation of 
this phenomenon is given as being due to the electric vibrations passing along 
the' surface of the skin and raising the' temperature' of the water above 
boiling point-the' definition of electricity in this case being that as it is 
neither matter nor energy, though energy may be expended in moving or creating 
it' it is quite probably generated by the brain cells, a manifestation of 
cerebral force' and will vibrations. Later investigations in the' subject of 
<I>emanations </I>were set in motion by certain results detected in connection 
with a study of the' famous X &quot; rays, when it was found that a new specie's 
of radiations was emitted by the' focus tube, which traversed aluminium, black 
paper, wood, etc. These new rays we're plane-polarized from the' moment of their 
emission ; were. susceptible of rotatory and elliptic polarization and could be 
refracted, reflected and diffused. The wave-lengths of the &quot;N&quot; rays 
are much smaller than those of light and they also appear to be' without heat. 
They can be obtained from various sources other than the Rontgen tube, and 
certain bodies seem to have the property of retaining or storing the rays for a 
considerable time. The human body is said to emit them unceasingly. Though 
non-luminous in themselves the rays will, if allowed to fall upon a 
phosphorescent body, increase its glow. A small spark or flame is similarly 
influenced. In photography the existence of the &quot; N &quot; rays is we'll 
demonstrated, those' pictures taken without the rays being very faint while' 
those obtained while the' &quot; N&quot; rays we're in action were much 
stronger. Pebble's exposed to sunlight spontaneously emit &quot; N&quot; rays 
and bodies such as Rupert's drops, hardened steel, hammered brass, etc, are 
permanent sources of the' rays. These rays we're named after the' initial letter 
of the town of Nancy where' the' researches were made that led to their 
discovery by Professor Blondlot. Further experiments proved that all matter 
possesses the' power of radiation and those potentialities can be' seen and 
registered by a fluorescent screen just as those' of the animal and human 
organism. Whenever muscular and nerve energies are manifesting rays are emitted, 
and it was found that they would pass through certain substance's whereas others 
would intercept and store' them. For example, they passed through an oak board 
three or four centimetre's thick, black paper, aluminium, etc, but water stopped 
them or even a cigarette paper if wet. Fresh water intercepted them but if the 
liquid were salt the' rays passed through. Dr. Baraduc for many years pursued 
his studies in the emission of human fluidic force's and used the biometre for 
registering vibrations emitted from human bodies. This instrument consists of a 
needle suspended by a fine thread and covered with a glass shade. When the hand 
approaches this shade, without touching it the needle is deflected. As the 
result of long observation he' formed the opinion that the' variations in the' 
movements of the needle were caused by various conditions, physical, mental and 
moral in the persons who approached it and that by these means he was able to 
estimate those conditions. Dr. Baraduc also experimented in photography on 
these' lines. He took photographs of the <I>emanations </I>given off from the 
hands of persons in varied, mental, moral and physical states. In these' the 
lines of radiation varied considerably. In one, described by him as a psychic 
hand, the luminosity seemed to radiate from the lower base' of the palm; 
another, where' all the' lines we're' confused. was a photograph taken from the 
hand of a man in mental distress. Dr. Baraduc also photographed some stone's 
which were said to have' been used in the initiation rite's of pre-Christian 
religions and the' stream of rays emanating from these' Stones was distinctly 
visible' on the plates ; also some holy water at Lourdes just after a miraculous 
cure had been effected, and there' again the influence was strong. He' 
photographed with similar result the' sacred wafer during the moment of 
elevation in a Roman Catholic Church. He also photographed both his son and his 
wife', the one' four minute's after death and the' other twenty-four hours after 
death, and in each instance there' was seen stretching from the lifeless body a 
great stream of force' which extended right up to the ceiling of the room and 
then turned down again. In the' one case the face of the' son could be' 
recognised by anyone who had known him and could be seen close to the' body. In 
the' other case the profile of Dr. Baraduc's wife' was to be seen halfway up the 
room. <I>(See article </I>Thought Photography.)</P>

<P>Enchiridion of Pope Leo, The :</B> Is a collection of charms, cast in the' 
form of prayers, which have nothing in common with those' of the Church. It is 
concerned chiefly with worldly, rather than spiritual advantages. It was perhaps 
printed at Rome in <B>1523</B>, and again in <B>1606</B>. Its magical virtue 
rests on a supposed letter from Charlemagne' to Pope Leo, in which he states 
that since receiving the <I>Enchiridion </I>he' has never ceased to be' 
fortunate. The charms it contains are' supposed to be' effectual against all 
the' dangers to which human flesh is heir-poison, fire, wild beasts and 
tempests. When a copy of the' book has been secured, it must be placed in a 
small bag of leather, carried on the person, and one page at least read daily. 
The' reading must be done' upon the knees with the face turned to the' east, and 
works of piety must be performed in honour of the' celestial spirits, whose 
influence it is desired to attract. The first chapter of the Gospel according to 
St. John is declared to be the most potent in the book. As for the symbols, they 
are mostly of oriental origin. It also includes the mysterious prayers of Pope' 
Leo, and certain conjurations of a semi-magical character, including the seven 
mysterious onions, which are merely clumsy imitations of the Roman ritual.</P>

<P>Endless Cord, Tying Knots in :</B> About the years <B>1877</B>-<B>88</B> 
Professor Zollner of Leipsic investigated the phenomena of the medium Slade, and 
particularly anything which might prove a fourth dimension of space, in which 
hypothesis Professor Zollner was at that time greatly interested. The tying in 
an endless cord of such knots as could ordinarily only be made if the' ends of 
the' cord were free' provided such a test. In December, <B>1877</B>, Zollne'r 
visited Slade with two pieces of hempen cord, the' free ends of each</P>
<P>being sealed to a piece of cardboard. To ensure the' cord always being in 
sight Zollne'r hung it round his neck, and kept Slade's hands continually in 
view. Under these circumstances four knots were produced, apparently on the 
original sealed cord.</P>

<P>England :</B> (For the pre-Saxon inhabitants of <I>England, See </I>Celts.) 
The Anglo-Saxon system of magic was of course' Teutonic. Their pretenders to 
witchcraft we're called <I>wicca, scin-laeca, galdor-craeftig, wiglaer, and 
morthwyrtha. Wiglaer </I>is a combination from <I>wig, </I>an idol or a temple', 
and laer, learning. He' was the wizard, as <I>wicca </I>was the witch. Scinlaeca 
was a species of phantom or apparition, and was also used as a name' of the 
person who had the' power of producing such things: it is, literally, &quot;a 
shining dead body.&quot; <I>Galdor-craeftig </I>implies one skilled in 
incantations ; and <I>morth-wyrtha </I>is, literally, &quot;a worshipper .of the 
dead.&quot;</P>
<P>Another general appellation for such personages was <I>dry, </I>a 
magician.</P>
<P>The laws visited these practices with penal severity. The best account that 
can be given of them will be found in the passages proscribing them.</P>
<P>&quot;If any wicca, or <I>wiglaer, </I>or false swearer, or <I>morthwyrtha, 
</I>or any foul, contaminated, manifest <I>horcwenan </I>(whore, quean or 
strumpet), he any where in the' land, man shall drive them out.&quot; We teach 
that every priest shall extinguish all heathendom, and forbid <I>wilweorthunga 
</I>(fountain-worship), and <I>licwiglunga </I>(incantations of the dead), and 
<I>hwata </I>(omens), and <I>galdra </I>(magic), and man-worship, and the 
abominations that men exercise in various sorts of witchcraft, and in 
<I>frithspottum, </I>and with elms and other tree's, and with stones, and with 
many phantoms.&quot;</P>
<P>From subsequent regulations, we find that these practice's we're made' the 
instruments of the' most fatal mischief; for penitentiary penalties are enjoined 
if any one should destroy another by <I>wicce craefte; </I>or if any should 
&quot;drive' sickness on a man&quot;; or if death should follow from the' 
attempt.</P>
<P>They seem to have' used philtres ; for it is also made punishable' if any 
should use' witchcraft for another's love', or should give him to eat or to 
drink with magic. They were also forbid to <I>wiglian </I>(or to divine) by the 
moon. Canute renewed the' prohibitions. He enjoined them not to worship the sun 
or the moon, fire or floods, wells or stones, or any sort of tree; not to love 
<I>wiccecraeft, </I>or frame death-spells, either by lot or by torch ; nor to 
effect any thing by phantoms. From the <I>Poenitentiale </I>of Theodore' we also 
learn, that the' power of letting loose' tempests was also pretended to.</P>
<P>Another name for magical arts among the Anglo-Saxons was <I>unlybban wyrce, 
</I>destructive of life.&quot; The penitence' is prescribed for a woman who 
kills a man by <I>unlybban. </I>One instance' of philtre using is detailed to 
us. A woman resolving on the' death of her step-son, or to alienate from him his 
father's affection, sought a witch, who knew how to change minds by arts and 
enchantments. Addressing such a one with promises and rewards, the' enquired how 
the mind of the father might be' turned from the child, and be fixed on herself. 
The magical medicament was immediately made, and mixed with the husband's meat 
and drink. The catastrophe of the' whole was the murder of the child and the 
discovery of the crime' by the assistant, to revenge the step-mother's 
ill-treatment.</P>
<P>The charms used by the Anglo-Saxons were' innumerable'. They trusted in their 
magical incantations for the cure of disease', for the success of their tillage, 
for the' discovery of lost property, and for the prevention of casualties. 
Specimens of their charms for these' purposes still remain to us. Bede' tells 
us, that ' many, in times of disease' (neglecting the sacraments) went to the 
erring medicaments of idolatry, as if to restrain God's chastisements by 
incantations, phylacteries, or any other secret of the' demoniacal 
arts.&quot;</P>
<P>Their prognostications, from the sun, from thunder, and from dreams, were so 
numerous, as to display and to perpetuate superstition. Every day of every month 
was catalogued as a propitious or unpropitious season for certain transactions. 
We have' Anglo-Saxon treatise's which contain rules for discovering the' future 
and disposition of a child, from the' day of its nativity. One' day was useful - 
or all things; another, though good to tame' animals was baleful to sow seeds. 
One' day was favourable to the' commencement of business; another to let blood ; 
and others wore a forbidding aspect to these and other things. On this day one 
must buy, on a second sell, on a third hunt, on a fourth do nothing. If a child 
was born on such a day, it would live'; if on another, Its life' would be' 
sickly; if on another, he would perish early. In a word, the' most alarming 
fears, and the most extravagant hope's, were perpetually raised by these foolish 
superstitions, which tended to keep the mind in the' dreary bondage of ignorance 
and absurdity, which prevented the' growth of knowledge, by the' incessant war 
of prejudice', and the' slavish effects of the' most imbecile apprehensions.</P>
<P>The same anticipations of futurity were' made' by noticing on what day of the 
week or month it first thundered, or the new moon appeared, or the new-year's 
day occurred. Dreams likewise' had regular interpretations and applications; and 
thus life, instead of being governed by counsels of wisdom, was directed by 
those' solemn lessons of gross superstition, which the most ignorant peasant of 
our days would be ashamed to avow.</P>
<P>Although witchcraft was of early origin in <I>England, </I>we do not find 
many notices of it in the literature of the country, nor does it seem to have' 
been systematically punished until past Reformation time's. That is not to say, 
that no prosecution ever took place' against witchcraft in Plantagenet and early 
Tudor time's, but that in all probability the vogue of sorcery was so 
widespread, and so powerful was supposed to be the' protection of a Church that 
nothing like' a crusade was directed against it. Again it was regarded as a 
political offence' to employ sorcery against the ruling powers, and a's such it 
was punished severely enough, as <B>45</B> witnessed by the execution of the' 
Duchess of Gloucester in Henry VI.'s reign, and the Duke of Buckingham in 
<B>1521</B>. In Henry VI.'s time Lord Hungerford was beheaded for consulting 
certain soothsayers concerning the duration of the' King's life. L. S.</P>
<P>According to Sir William Blackstone, &quot;To deny the' possibility, nay, 
the' actual existence of witchcraft and sorcery is at once flatly to contradict 
the' revealed Word of God in various passage's of the Old and New Testaments, 
and the thing itself is a truth to which every nation in the' world hath in its 
turn borne testimony.&quot;</P>
<P>At very early periods the Church fulminated against those' who practised it. 
In <B>696</B> a Canon of Council held at Berkhampstead condemned to corporal 
punishment those who made sacrifices to evil spirits, and at subsequent dates 
Statutes against Witchcraft were enacted by the Parliaments of Henry VIII., 
Elizabeth and James I. Mr. Inderwick says, &quot; For centuries in this country 
strange as it may now appear, a denial of the' existence of such demoniacal 
agency was deemed equal to a confession of Atheism and to a disbelief in the 
Holy Scriptures themselves. But not only did Lord Chancellors, Lord Keepers, 
benches of Bishops and Parliament attest the truth and the existence of 
witchcraft, but Addison writing as late as <B>1711</B>, in the pages of the 
<I>Spectator, </I>after describing himself as hardly pressed by the' arguments 
on both side's of this question expresses his own belief that there' is and has 
been, witchcraft in the' land.&quot;</P>
<P>It is in the twelfth Century that a first distinct glimpse is obtained of 
the' bond between the <I>Evil One </I>and his victim. The' tale of the old woman 
of Berkeley which Southey's Ballad has familiarised, is related by William of 
Malmesbury on the' authority of a professed eye-witness. When the devil informed 
the witch of the near expiry of her contract, she' summoned the' neighbouring 
monks and her children; and after confessing her criminal compact displayed 
great anxiety lest Satan should secure her body as well as her soul. She gave' 
directions to be' sewn in a stag's hide' and placed in a stone' coffin, shut in 
with lead and iron, to be loaded with heavy stones and the' whole' fastened down 
with three iron chains. In order to baffle the power of the demons, she further 
directed fifty psalms to be sung by night, and fifty masses to be sung by day, 
and that at the end of three nights, if her body was still secure, she said that 
it might be buried with safety. All these' precautions however, proved of no 
avail. The monks bravely resisted the' efforts of the fiends on the first and 
second nights, but on the third night in the middle of a terrific uproar an 
immense demon burst into the' monastery and in a voice of thunder commanded the' 
dead witch to rise. She' replied that she was bound with chains, which however 
the demon snapped like' thread, the' coffin lid fell aside, and on the' witch 
arising the demon bore her off on a huge black horse' and galloped into the 
darkness, while' her shrieks resounded through the air. The first trial for 
witchcraft in England occurred during the tenth year of the reign of King John, 
when according to the <I>Abbreviato-Placitorum, </I>the wife of Ado the 
merchant, accused one Gideon of the crime. He proved his innocence however, by 
the ordeal of the red-hot iron. A trial was reported with more detail in the 
year <B>1324</B>. Certain citizens of Coventry had suffered at the hands of the' 
prior whose extortions were approved of and supported by two of Edward II.'s 
favourites. Byway of revenge they plotted the' death of the prior, the 
favourites, and the King.</P>
<P>In order to carry this into effect they consulted John of Nottingham, a 
famous Magician of the time and his Servant Robert Marshall of Leicester. 
Marshall however, betrayed the plot and stated that together with his master 
they fashioned images of wax to represent the King, his two favourites, the' 
prior, his caterer and steward, and one Richard de Lowe-the latter being brought 
in merely as an experimental lay-figure in which to test the' effect of the' 
charm. At an old ruined house near Coventry, on the Friday following Holy Cross 
Day, John gave his man a sharp pointed leaden branch and commanded him to plunge 
it into the forehead of the figure representing Richard de Lowe. This being done 
John dispatched his servant to Lowe's house' to find out the' result of the 
experiment. Lowe it seems had lost his senses and went about screaming 
&quot;Harrow.&quot; On the Sunday before Ascension John with-drew the branch 
from the' image's forehead, and thrust it into the heart, where it remained till 
the following Wednesday when the unfortunate victim died. Such was the' evidence 
of Marshall, but the judges gave it little' belief, and after several 
adjournments the trial was abandoned.</P>
<P>The first enactment against witchcraft in <I>England </I>was by the 
Parliament of <B>1541</B>. In <B>1551</B> further enactments were levelled at 
it, but it was not until <B>1562</B> that Parliament defined witchcraft as a 
Capital Crime. Thenceforth followed the regular persecution of Witches. Many 
burnings occurred during the latter years of Elizabeth's reign.</P>
<P>At the village of Worboise, (q.v.) in the County of Huntingdon in <B>1589</B> 
dwelt two country gentlemen, Robert Throgmorton and Sir Samuel Cromwell. Mr. 
Throgmorton's family consisted of his wife and five daughters of whom the eldest 
Joan, a girl of fifteen was possessed with a mind and imagination well stocked 
with ghost-and witch-lore. On one occasion she had to pass the cottage of a 
labouring family of the name of Samuel. This family consisted of a man, his 
wife, and their grown-up daughter. Mother Samuel was sitting at the door wearing 
a black cap, and busily engaged in knitting. Joan declared that she was a witch, 
ran home and fell into strange convulsive fits, stating that Mother Samuel had 
bewitched her. In doe course the other daughters respectively were attacked with 
similar fits, and attributed the blame to Mother Samuel. The parents now began 
to suspect that their children were really bewitched and reported the matter to 
Lady Cromwell, who, as an intimate friend of the family took the matter up and 
along with Sir Samuel ordered that the alleged witch should be put to ordeal. 
Meanwhile the children let loose their imagination and invented all sorts of 
weird and grotesque tales about the old woman. Eventually Throgmorton had the 
poor old woman dragged to his grounds where she was subjected to torture, pins 
being thrust into her body to see if blood could be drawn. Lady Cromwell tore 
out a handful of the old crone's hair which she gave to Mrs. Throgmorton 
requesting her to burn it as an antidote against witchcraft, Suffering under 
these injuries the old woman invoked a curse against her torturers which was 
afterwards remembered, though she was allowed her liberty. She thereafter 
suffered much persecution at the hands of the two families, all ills and 
misfortunes occurring amongst their cattle and stock being laid to her charge. 
Eventually Lady Cromwell was seized with an illness that caused her death, and 
upon old Mother Samuel was laid the responsibility. Repeated efforts were made 
to persuade her to confess and amend what she had done. At last, tormented 
beyond endurance, she let herself be persuaded to pronounce an exorcism against 
the spirits and confessed that her husband and daughter were also associates 
with her and had sold themselves to the devil. On the strength of this 
confession the whole family were imprisoned in Huntingdon Gaol. At the following 
Session the three Samuels were put upon trial indicted with various offences and 
&quot; bewitching unto death&quot; the Lady Cromwell, In the agony of torture 
the old woman confessed all that was required, but her husband and daughter 
strongly asserted their innocence. All were sentenced to be hanged and burned. 
The executions were carried out in April <B>1595</B>.</P>
<P>It is related that in <B>1594</B> the Earl of Derby attributed the cause of 
his death to witchery, though he had no idea of the person who had bewitched 
him,</P>
<P>The Accession of James I. himself a great expert in witchcraft and the author 
of the famous treatise on demonology (q.v.) gave a great impetus to the 
persecution of witches in <I>England. </I>&quot; Poor old women and girls of 
tender age were walked, sworn, shaved, and tortured, the gallows creaked and the 
fires blazed.&quot;</P>
<P>In <B>1606</B> there were tried at King's Lynn the wife of one Henry Smith a 
grocer, for cursing a sailor who had struck a boy, and for cursing her 
neighbours because they were more prosperous in their trades than she was.</P>
<P>After hearing the most absurd evidence she was convicted and sentenced to 
death. Upon the scaffold she confessed to various acts of witchcraft.</P>
<P>In <B>1633</B> arose the famous case of the Lancashire Witches (q.v.). On the 
assertion of a boy called Robinson, that he had been carried off and witnessed a 
witches' Sabbath at the Hoare Stones, some eighteen women were brought to trial 
at Lancaster Assizes.</P>
<P>As the result of the severe legislation against witchcraft, there arose a 
class of self-constituted impugners or witch-finders who to their personal 
advantage were the means of the sacrifice of many innocent lives.</P>
<P>The most famous of these witch-finders was Matthew Hopkins of Manningtree, in 
Essex. He assumed the title of &quot;Witch-finder General,&quot; and with an 
assistant, and a woman whose duty was to examine female suspects for devil's 
marks, he travelled about the Counties of Essex, Sussex, Huntingdon, 
and-Norfolk. In one year this murderer-for want of a better name-caused the 
death of sixty people. His general test was that of swimming. The hands and feet 
of accused were tied together crosswise. She was wrapped in a sheet and thrown 
into a pond. If she sank as frequently happened, she was deemed innocent, but at 
the cost of her life, if she floated she was pronounced guilty and forthwith 
executed. Another test was to repeat the Lord's Prayer without a single falter 
or stumble, a thing accredited impossible of a witch. On one occasion she was 
weighed against the Church Bible, obtaining her freedom if she outweighed it, It 
is alleged but without certainty, that on his impostures being found out an 
angry crowd subjected him to his own test by swimming, but whether he was 
drowned or executed authorities fail to agree.</P>
<P>In his <I>Witch, Warlock and Magician </I>Mr. Adams says, &quot;I think there 
can be little doubt that many evil-disposed persons availed themselves to the 
prevalent belief in witchcraft as a cover for their depredations on the property 
of their neighbours, diverting suspicion from themselves to the poor witches, 
who through accidental circumstances had acquired notoriety as the devil's 
accomplices. It would also seem probable that not a few of the reputed witches 
similarly turned to account their bad reputation.&quot;</P>
<P>It was not till the close of the seventeenth Century that convictions began 
to be discouraged by the Courts. But an old superstition dies hard, and in the 
early part of the eighteenth Century witchcraft was generally believed in, in 
England, even among the educated classes.</P>
<P>Probably the revolution of opinion was effected between the Restoration and 
the Revolution. According to Dr. Parr, the last execution of witches in 
<I>England </I>took place at Northampton where two were hung in <B>1705</B>, and 
at the same place five others suffered a like fate in <B>1712</B>. Hutchison 
commenting on this in his <I>Historical Essay </I>says, &quot; This is the more 
shameful as I shall hereafter prove from the literature of that time, a 
disbelief in the existence of witches had become almost universal among educated 
men, though the old superstition was still defended in the Judgment Seat, and in 
the pulpit.&quot; Wesley who had more influence than all the Bishops put 
together says, &quot; It is true likewise that the English in general, and, 
indeed, most of the men of learning in Europe, have given up all accounts of 
witches and apparitions as mere old wives' fables. I am sorry for it. The giving 
up of witchcraft, is in effect giving up the Bible. But I cannot give up to all 
the Deists in Great Britain the existence of witchcraft, till I give up the 
credit of all history sacred and profane.&quot;</P>
<P>Every year however, diminished the old belief, and in <B>1736</B>, a 
generation before Wesley stated the above opinions, the laws against witchcraft 
were repeated, but as illustrative of the long lived prevalence of the 
superstition in <B>1759</B> Susannah Hannaker of Wengrove, in Wiltshire, was put 
to the ordeal of weighing, but she fortunately outweighed the Bible, Cases of 
ducking supposed witches occurred in <B>1760</B> at Leicester, in <B>1785</B> at 
Northampton, and in <B>1829</B> at Monmouth, while as recently as <B>1863</B> a 
Frenchman died as the result of an illness caused by his having been ducked as a 
Wizard, at Castle Hedingham in Essex, and on September <B>17</B>th, <B>1875</B>, 
an old woman named Ann Turner. a reputed witch, was killed by a feebleminded man 
at Long Compton in Warwickshire. A. J. B. G.</P><I>
<P>See </I>Wright. <I>Narrative of Sorcery and Magic; </I>and Mackay. 
<I>Extraordinary Popular Delusions.</P>
<P>Magic. </I>Magic in <I>England </I>in early times is of course one' with 
witchcraft, and it is only when we' discern the stupendous figure of Roger Bacon 
(q.v.) that we' find any thing like separation between the two. Of course, the' 
popular traditions concerning Bacon are merely legendary. but they assist to 
crystallise for us the idea of an English magician of medieval times. The 
Elizabethan History of Friar Bacon was probably the first which placed these' 
traditions on record. Here we have no concern with the Bacon of science', for 
the Bacon of magic is a magician who cheated the' Devil, who made a brazen head 
that spoke, and who engaged in all manner of black magic.</P>
<P>In <I>England </I>the' popular belief in magic was strengthened by the 
extraordinary effects of natural processes then known only to a small number of 
individuals who concealed their knowledge with the most profound secrecy. In 
<I>England, </I>as we approach the age of the Reformation, we find that the 
study of magic and alchemy have' become extremely common among the Romish 
clergy. The rapid rise to power of men like Wolsey and Cromwell led people to 
think that they had gained their high positions through diabolical assistance, 
The' number of Magicians in the reign of Henry VIII. was exceedingly great, as 
is witnessed by documents in the Record Office. At the' height of Wolsey's 
greatness, a magician who is described as one' Wood, gent.&quot; was dragged 
before the Privy-council, charged with some misdemeanour which was connected 
with the' intrigues of the day. In a paper addressed to the lords of the 
council, Wood states that William Nevill had sent for him to his house at 
Oxford, it being the first communication he had ever had with that 
&quot;person.&quot; After he' had been at Weke a short time, Neville took him by 
the' arm and led him privately into the garden, and, to use the quaint language 
of the original, &quot;ther demawndyd of me many questyons, amowog all other 
askyd (if it) we're not possible to have a rynge made that should brynge man in 
favor with hys prynce, saying my lord cardinale had suche a rynge that 
whatsomevere he askyd of the kynges grace that he hadd yt, ' and master 
Cromwell, when he and I were servauntys in my lord cardynales housse, dyd hawnt 
to the' company of one that was seyne in your faculti, and shortly after no man 
so grett with my lord cardynale as master Cromwell was.'&quot; Neville added, 
that he had spoken &quot;with all those who have any name in this realm, &quot; 
who had assured him that in the same way he' might become &quot; great with his 
prince,&quot; and he' ended by asking of the reputed magician what books he had 
studied on the subject. The latter continued, &quot;and I, at the harti desire 
of hym showyd that I had rede many bokes, and specyally the boke of Salamon, and 
how his rynges be made and what mettell, and what vertues they had after the 
canon of Salamon.&quot; He added, that he had also studied the magical work of 
Hermes. William Neville' then requested him to undertake the making of a ring, 
which he says that he declined, and so went away for that time. But Neville' 
sent for him again, and entered into further communication with him on the old 
subject, telling him that he had with him another conjurer, named Wade, who 
could show him more than he should; and, among other things, had showed him that 
&quot;he should be' a great lord,&quot; This was an effective' attempt to move' 
Wood's jealousy; and it appears that Neville now prevailed upon him to make 
&quot; moldes,&quot; probably images, to the entent that he showid we'd mastre's 
Elezebeth Gare,&quot; on whom he seemed to have set his love'. Perhaps she was a 
rich heiress. Wood then enters into excuses for himself, declaring that, 
although at the' desire' of&quot; some of his friends,&quot; he had &quot;called 
to a stone' for things stolen,&quot; he had not undertaken to find treasures, 
and he concluded with the naive boast, &quot;but to make the phylosofer's stone, 
I will chehard (i.e, jeopard) my lyffe to dohyt, yf hyt plesse the kynge's good 
grace to command me do hyt.&quot; This was the' pride of science' above the' low 
practitioner's. He even offered to remain in prison until be' had performed his 
boast, and only asked &quot; twelve' months upon silver, and twelve' and a half 
upon gold.&quot;</P>
<P>The search for treasures, which the conjurer Wood so earnestly disclaims, 
was, however, one' of the' most usual occupations of our magicians of this 
period. The frequent discoveries of Roman or Saxon, or medieval deposits, in 
the' course' of accidental digging - then probably more common than at 
present-was enough to whet the appetite of the needy or the miserly, and the 
belief that the' sepulchral barrow, or the long deserted ruin, or even the' wild 
and haunted glen, concealed treasures of gold and silver of great amount has 
been carried down to our own days in a variety of local legends. Hidden 
treasures were under the particular charge' of some of the spirits who obeyed 
the magician's call, and we still trace his operations in many a barrow that has 
been disturbed, and ruined floor that has been broken up. That these searches 
were not always successful will be evident from the' following narrative</P>
<P>In the reign of Henry VIII. a priest named William Stapleton was placed under 
arrest as a conjurer, and as having been mixed up in some court intrigues, and 
at the request of Cardinal Wolsey he wrote an account of his adventures, still 
preserved in the Roll's House' records (for it is certainly addressed to Wolsey, 
and not, as has been supposed, to Cromwell). Stapleton says that he had been a 
monk of the mitred abbey of St. Benet in the Holm, in Norfolk, where he was 
resident in the' nineteenth year of Henry VIII. i.e. in <B>1527 </B>or 
<B>1528</B>, at which time he' borrowed of one Dennys, of Hofton, who had 
procured them of the vicar of Watton, a, book called <I>Thesaurus Spirituum, 
</I>and after that another, called <I>Secreta Secretorum </I>a little' ring, a 
plate, a circle, and also a sword for the' art of digging, in studying the use 
of which he spent six months. Now it appears that Stapleton had small taste' for 
early rising, and after having been frequently punished for being absent from 
matins and negligent of his duty in church he' obtained a licence of six months 
from the' abbot to go into the world, and try and raise money to buy a 
dispensation from an order which seemed so little agreeable to his taste. The 
first person he' consulted with was his friend Dennys, who recommended him to 
try his skill in finding treasure, and introduced him to two &quot;knowing 
men,&quot; who had &quot;placards&quot; or licences from the king to search for 
treasure' trove, which were not unfrequently bought from the' crown at this 
period. These' men lent him other books and instruments belonging to the 
&quot;art of digging,&quot; and they went together to a place named Sidestrand 
in Norfolk, to search and mark out the' ground where they thought treasure 
should lie'. It happened, however, that the lady Tyrry, to whom the estate' 
belonged, received intelligence of their movements, and after sending for them 
and subjecting them to a close examination, ordered them to leave her 
grounds.</P>
<P>After this rebuff, the treasure-seekers went to Norwich, where they became 
acquainted with another conjurer named Godfrey, who had a &quot;shower&quot; of 
spirit, &quot; which spirit,&quot; Stapleton says, ' I had after myself,&quot; 
and they went together to Felmingham, and there Godfrey's boy did 
&quot;scry&quot; unto the spirit, but after opening the' ground they found 
nothing there. There are Roman barrows at Felmingham, which, when examined 
recently, appeared to have been opened at a former period in search of treasure. 
The disappointed conjurers returned to Norwich, and there met with a stranger, 
who brought them to a house in which it was supposed that treasure lay 
concealed, and Stapleton again applied himself to his incantations, and called 
the spirit of the treasure to appear, hut he turned a deaf ear to their charms, 
&quot; for I suppose of a truth,&quot; is the pithy observation of the operator, 
&quot; that there was none.&quot;</P>
<P>Disappointed and disgusted, Stapleton now gave up the pursuit. In Norfolk, 
however, he soon met with some of his old treasure-seeking acquaintances, who 
urged him to go to work again, which he refused to do unless his books were 
better. They told him of a man of the name of Leech, who had a book, to which 
the parson of Lesingham had bound a spirit called &quot; Andrea Malchus;&quot; 
and to this man he went. Leech let him have all his instruments, and told him 
further that the parson of Lesingham and Sir John of Leiston (another 
ecclesiastic) with others, had called up of late by the means of the book in 
question three spirits, Andrea Malchus (before mentioned), Oberion and Inchubus. 
' When these spirits,&quot; he said, were all raised, Oberion would in nowise 
speak. And then the parson of Lesiogham did demand of Andrea Malchus, and so did 
Sir John of Leiston also, why Oberion would not speak to them. And Andrea 
Malchus made answer, For because he was bound unto the lord cardinal.&quot; And 
that also they did entreat the said parson of Lesingham, and the said Sir John 
of Leiston, that they might depart as at that time ; and whensoever it might 
please them to call them up again, they would gladly do them any service they 
could.&quot;</P>
<P>When Stapleton had made this important acquisition, he repaired again to 
Norwich, where he had not long been, when he was found by a messenger from the 
personage whom he calls the lord Leonard Marquees, who lived at Calkett 
Hall,&quot; and who wanted a person expert in the art of digging. He met lord 
Leonard at Walsingham, who promised him that if he would take pains in 
exercising the said art he would sue out a dispensation for him to be a secular 
priest, and to make him his chaplain. The lord Leonard proceeded rather shrewdly 
to make trial of the searcher's talents for he directed one of his servants to 
hide a sum of money in the garden, and Stapleton hewed&quot; for it, and one, 
Jackson &quot;scryed,&quot; but he was unable to find the money. Yet, without 
being daunted at this slip Stapleton went directly with two other priests, Sir 
John Shepe and Sir Robert Porter, to a place beside Creke Abbey, where treasure 
was supposed t<B><SUB>9</B> </SUB>be, and Sir John Shepe called the spirit of 
the treasure, and I shewed to him, but all came to no purpose.</P>
<P>Stapleton now went to hide his disappointment in London, and remained there 
some weeks, till the lord Leonard, who had sued out his dispensation as he 
promised, sent for him to pass the winter with him in Leicestershire, and 
towards spring he returned to Norfolk. And there he was informed that there was 
much money&quot; hidden in the neighbourhood of Calkett Hall, and especially in 
the Bell Hill (probably an ancient tumulus or barrow), and after some delay, he 
obtained his instruments, and went to work with the parish priest of Gorleston, 
but &quot; of truth we could bring nothing to effect.&quot; On this he again 
repaired to London, carrying his instruments with him, and on his arrival he was 
thrown into prison at the suit of the lord Leonard, who accused him of leaving 
his service without permission, and all his instruments were seized. These he 
never recovered, but he was soon liberated from prison, and obtained temporary 
employment in the church.</P>
<P>But his conjuring propensities seem still to have lingered about him, and we 
find this ex-monk and hermit, and now secular priest, soon afterwards engaged in 
an intrigue which led him eventually into a much more serious danger. It appears 
by Stapleton's statements, that one Wright, a servant of the Duke of Norfolk, 
came to him, and &quot;at a certain season shewed me that the duke's grace, his 
master was soore vexed with a spyrytt by the enchantment of your grace&quot; (he 
is addressing Wolsey). Stapleton says, that he refused to interfere, but that 
Wright went to the duke and told him that he, Stapleton, knew of his being 
enchanted by Cardinal Wolsey, and that he could help him; upon which the duke 
sent for Stapleton, and had an interview with him. It had previously been 
arranged by Wright and Stapleton (who says that he had been urged into the plot 
by the persuasion of Wright, and by the hope of gain and prospect of obtaining 
the duke's favour) that he should say he knew that the duke was persecuted by a 
spirit. and that he had &quot;forged&quot; an image of wax in his similitude, 
which he had enchanted, in order to relieve him. The Duke of Norfolk appears at 
first to have placed implicit belief in all that Stapleton told him ; he 
inquired of him if he had certain knowledge that the Lord Cardinal had a spirit 
at his command, to which he replied in the negative. He then questioned him as 
to his having heard anyone assert that the cardinal had a spirit; on which 
Stapleton told him of the raising of Oberion by the parson of Lesingham and Sir 
John of Leiston, and how Oberion refused to speak, because he was the lord 
cardinal's spirit. The duke, however, soon after this, became either suspicious 
or fearful, and he eventually sent Stapleton to the cardinal himself, who 
appears to have committed him to prison, and at whose order he drew up the 
account here abridged.</P>
<P>The foregoing is the history of a man who, after having been a victim to his 
implicit belief in the efficiency of magical operations was himself driven at 
last t(. have recourse to intentional deception. The number of such 
treasure-hunters appears to have been far greater among his contemporaries, of 
almost all the classes of society, than we should at first glance be led to 
suppose. A few years before the date of these events, in the <B>12</B>th year of 
Henry VIII., or A.D. <B>552</B>, the king had granted to Robert, Lord Curzon, 
the monopoly of treasure-seeking in the counties of Norfolk and Suffolk, and 
Lord Curzon immediately delegated to a man, named William Smith, of Clopton, and 
a servant or retainer of his own, named Amylyon, not only the right of search 
thus given to him, but the power to arrest and proceed against any other person 
they found seeking treasures within the two counties. It appears that Smith and 
Amylyon had in some eases used this delegated authority for purposes of 
extortion; and in the summer of the same year, Smith was brought up before the 
court of the city of Nonvich, at the suit of William Goodred, of Great Melton, 
the minutes of the proceedings against him still remaining on the records. We 
here again find priests concerned in these singular operations.</P>
<P>It appears that the treasure-diggers, who had received their&quot; 
placard&quot; of Lord Curzon in March, went to Norwich about Easter, and paid a 
visit to the schoolmaster, named George Dowsing, dwelling in the parish of St. 
Faith, who, they had heard, was &quot;seen in astronymye. They shewed him their 
license for treasure-seeking, which authorised him to press into their service 
any persons they might find who had skill in the science; so that it would 
appear that they were not capable of raising spirits themselves. without the 
assistance of &quot;scholars.&quot; The schoolmaster entered willingly into 
their project, and they went, about two or three o'clock in the morning, with 
one or two other persons who were admitted into their confidence, and dug in 
ground beside &quot; Butter Rules,&quot; within the walls of the city, but 
&quot; found nothing there.&quot; These &quot; hilles,&quot; also, were probably 
tumuli. They next proceeded to a place called &quot;Seynt William in the Wood by 
Norwich,&quot; where they excavated two days (or rather two nights), but with no 
better success.</P>
<P>They now held a meeting at the house of one Saunders, in the market of 
Norwich, and called to their assistance two ecelesiastics, one named Sir 
William, the other Sir Robert Cromer, the former being the parish priest of St. 
Gregory's. At this meeting. George Dowsing raised &quot;a spirit or two,&quot; 
in a glass; but one of the priests, Sir Robert Cromer, &quot;began and raised a 
spirit first.&quot; This spirit, according to the depositions, was seen by two 
or three persons. Amylyon deposed that &quot;he was at Saunders's where Sir 
Robert Cromer held up a stone, but he could not perceive anything in it; but 
that George Dowsing caused to rise in a glass a little thing of the length of an 
inch or thereabout, but whether it was a spirit or a shadow he cannot tell, but 
the said George said it was a spirit.&quot; However, spirit or no spirit, they 
seem to have had as little success as ever in discovering the treasure.</P>
<P>Unable after so many attempts, to find the treasure themselves, they seem now 
to have resolved on laying a general contribution on everybody who followed the 
same equivocal calling. They went first and accused a person of the name of 
Wikman, of Morley Swanton, in the county of Norfolk, of &quot;digging of 
hilles,&quot; and, by threatening to take him before Lord Curzon, they obtained 
from him ten shillings. Under the same pretext, they took from a lime-burner of 
Norwich, named White, a &quot; christalstone,&quot; and twelvepenca in money in 
order that he&quot; should not be put to further trouble.&quot; They took both 
books (probably conjuring books) and money from John Wellys, of Hunworth, near 
Holt Market, whom, similarly, they accused of &quot;digging of hilles.&quot; And 
of another person, labouring under the same charge, they took &quot;a christal 
stone and certain money.&quot;</P>
<P>With the era of Dr. Dee (q.v.) Edward Kelly, (q.v.) their school, a much more 
definite system of magico-astrology was evolved on English soil. Although Dee 
was credulous and Kelly was a rogue of the first water, there is little doubt 
that the former possessed psychic gifts of no mean character. His most 
celebrated followers were William Lilly (q.v) and Elias Ashmole (q.v) not to 
speak of Simon Forman (q.v.) and Evans (q.v.). Lilly gathered about him quite a 
band of magicians, Ramsey, Scott, Hodges, and others, not to speak of his 
&quot;skryers&quot; Sarah Skelhorm and Ellen Evans. But these may be said to be 
the last of the practical magicians of <I>England. </I>Their methods were those 
of divination by crystal-gazing and evocation of spirits, combined with 
practical astrology.</P><I>
<P>Spiritualism. </I>For the beginnings of spiritualism in <I>England </I>we 
must go back to the middle of the seventeenth century when Maxwell and Robert 
Fludd (q.v.) flourished and wrote concerning the secrets of mysticism and 
magnetism. Fludd was a Paracelsian pure and simple and regarded man as the 
microcosm of the universe iii miniature. He was an ardent defender of the 
Rosicrucians, concerning whom he wrote two spirited works, as well as his great 
<I>Tractalus Apologetic us </I>and many other alchemical and philosophical 
treatises. The part of the <I>Tractates </I>which deals with natural magic is 
one of the most authoritative ever penned <B>9</B>n the subject, and divides the 
subject most minutely into its several parts. Thomas Vaughan (q.v.) is likewise 
a figure of intense interest about this period. He was a supreme adept of 
spiritual alchemy and his many works written under the Pseudonym of Eugenius 
Philalethes show him to have possessed an exalted mind. It is to men of this 
type, magi, perhaps, butnone the less spiritualists, that the whole 
superstructure of English spiritualism is indebted. </P><I>

<P>Enoch :</B> Seventh master of the world after Adam, and author of the 
<I>Kabala </I>and <I>Book of the Tarot. </I>He is identical with the Thoth of 
the Egyptians, the Cadmus of the Phoenicians, and the Palamedes of the Greeks. 
According to tradition he did not die, but was carried up to heaven, whence he 
will return at the end of time.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Enoch, Book of :</B> An Apochryphal book of the Old Testament, written in 
Hebrew about a century before Christ. The original version was lost about the 
end of the fourth century, and only fragments remained, but Bruce the traveller 
brought back a copy from Abyssinia, in <B>1773</B> in Ethiopia, probably made 
from the version known to the early Greek fathers. In this work the spiritual 
world is minutely described, as is the region of Sheol (q.v.) the place of the 
wicked. The book also deals with the history of the fallen angels, their 
relations with the human species and the foundations of magic. The book says 
&quot;that there were angels who consented to fall from heaven that they might 
have intercourse with the daughters of earth. For in those days the sons of men 
having multiplied, there were born to them daughters of great beauty. And when 
the angels, or sons of heaven, beheld them, they were filled with desire; 
wherefore they said to one another: Come let us choose wives from among the race 
of man, and let us beget children&rsquo;. Their leader Samyasa, answered 
thereupon and said: ' Perchance you will be wanting in the courage needed to 
fulfil this resolution, and then I alone shall be answerable for your fall.' But 
they swore that they would in no wise repent and that they would achieve their 
whole design. Now there were two hundred who descended on Mount Armon, and it 
was from this time that the mountain received its designation, which signifies 
Mount of the Oath. Hereinafter follow the names of those angelic leaders who 
descended with this object: Samyasa, chief among all, Urakabarameel, Azibeel, 
Tamiel, Ramuel, Danel, Azkeel, Sarakuyal, Asael, Armers, </P>
<P>Batraal, Anane, Zavebe, Sameveel, Ertrael, Turel, Jomiael, Arizial. They took 
wives with whom they had intercourse, to whom also they taught Magic, the art of 
enchantment and the diverse properties of roots and trees. Amazarac gave 
instruction in all secrets of sorcerers ; Barkaial was the mister of those who 
study the stars ; Akibeel manifested signs; and Azaradel taught the motions of 
the moon.&quot; In this account we see a description of the profanation of 
mysteries. The fallen angels exposed their occult and heaven-born wisdom to 
earthly women, whereby it was profaned, and brute force taking advantage of the 
profanation of divine law, reigned supreme. Only a deluge could wipe out the 
stain of the enormity, and pave the way for a restitution of the balance between 
the human and the divine, which had been disturbed by these unlawful 
revelations. A translation of the <I>Book of Enoch </I>was published by 
Archbishop Lawrence in <B>1821</B>, the Etheopic text in <B>1838</B>, and there 
is a good edition by Diliman (<B>1851</B>). Philippi and Ewald have also written 
special works on the subject.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Epworth, Poltergeist, The :</B> In December, <B>1716</B>, a disturbance of a 
poltergestic character broke out in the Parsonage of Epworth, the home of John 
Wesley. The evidence consists in contemporary letters written to Samuel Wesley 
by his mother and two of his sisters ; letters written nine years after the 
events to John Wesley by his mother and four of his sisters, and a copy of an 
account by Samuel Wesley the elder. The disturbances, consisting of rappings, 
loud and varied noises, were heard by every member of the household. Mrs. Wesley 
says in a letter, &quot; Just as we (Mr. and Mrs. Wesley) came to the bottom of 
the broad stairs, having hold of each other, on my side there seemed as if 
somebody had emptied a bag of money at my feet, and on his as if all the bottles 
under the stairs (which were many) had been dashed in a thousand pieces.&quot; 
The disturbances lasted for about two months, though occasional manifestations 
were heard after that period. Hetty, one of the five daughters of the Wesley 
household, is the only one who has not left a record of her experiences, 
although it would seem that the poltergeist was most active in her 
neighbourhood.</P>

<P>Equilibrium :</B> Magical harmony depends upon equilibrium. In occult 
operations if the will of the operator be always at the same tension and 
directed along the same line, moral impotence will ensue. <I>(See 
</I>Levi-Ceremonial Magic.)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Eric of the Windy Hat :</B> According Hector of Boece, the king of Sweden, 
<I>Eric </I>or Henry, surnamed the <I>Windy Hat, </I>could change the wind 
merely by turning his hat or cap on his head, to show the demon with whom he was 
in league which way he wished the wind to blow. The demon obeyed the signal so 
promptly that the king's hat might have served the people for a 
weather-cock.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Eromanty :</B> One of six kinds of divination practised among the Persians by 
means of air. They enveloped their heads in a napkin and exposed to the air a 
vase filled with water, over which they mutter in a low voice the objects of 
their desires. If the surface of the air shows bubbles it is regarded as a happy 
prognostication.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Esdaile :</B> <I>(See </I><B>Hypnotism.</B>)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Eskimos :</B> The religion of the <I>Eskimos </I>is still to a great extent 
in the magical stage. Their shamans or medicine-men, whom they call <I>Angekok 
</I>partake more of the character of magicians than that of priests and they 
invariably consult them before starting on a hunting expedition, or when 
prostrated by illness. The nature of the ceremonies employed on those occasions 
may be inferred from the account of Captain Lyon, who on one occasion employed 
an angekok named Toolemak, to summon a Tomga or familiar spirit in the cabin of 
a ship.</P>
<P>All light having been carefully excluded from the scene of operations, the 
sorcerer began by vehemently chanting to his wife, who, in her turn, responded 
with the <I>Amna-aya, </I>the favourite song of the <I>Eskimo. </I>This lasted 
throughout the ceremony. Afterwards, Toolemak began to turn himself round very 
rapidly, vociferating for Tomga, in a loud powerful voice and with great 
impatience, at the same time blowing and snorting like a walrus. His noise, 
agitation, and impatience increased every moment, and at length he seated 
himself on the deck, varying his tones, and making a rustling with his 
clothes.</P>
<P>Suddenly the voice seemed smothered, and was so managed as to give the idea 
that it was retreating beneath the deck, each moment becoming more distant, and 
ultimately sounding as if it were many feet below the cabin, when it ceased 
entirely. In answer to Captain Lyon's queries, the sorcerer's wife seriously 
declared that he had dived and would send up Tomga.</P>
<P>And, in about half a minute, a distant blowing was heard</P>
<P>approaching very slowly, and a voice differing from that which had first been 
audible was mixed with the blowing, until eventually both sounds became 
distinct, and the old beldame said that Tomga had come to answer the stranger's 
questions. Captain Lyon thereupon put several queries to the sagacious spirit, 
receiving what was understood to be an affirmative or a favourable answer by two 
loud slaps on the deck.</P>
<P>A very hollow yet powerful voice, certainly differing greatly from that of 
Toolemak, then chanted for some time, and a singular medley of hisses, groans, 
and shouts, and gobblings like a turkey's followed in swift succession. The old 
woman sang with increased energy, and as Captain Lyon conjectured that the 
exhibition was intended to astonish &quot; the Kabloona,&quot; he said 
repeatedly that he was greatly terrified. As he expected, this admission added 
fuel to the flame, until the form immortal, exhausted by its own might, asked 
leave to retire. The voice gradually died away out of hearing, as at first, and 
a very indistinct hissing succeeded. In its advance it sounded like the tone 
produced by the wind upon the bass cord of an AEolian harp; this was soon 
changed to a rapid hiss, like that of a rocket, and Toolemak with a yell, 
announced the spirit's return.</P>
<P>At the first distant sibilation Captain Lyon held his breath, and twice 
exhausted himself; but the <I>Eskimo </I>conjurer did not once respire, and even 
his returning and powerful yell was uttered without previous pause or 
inspiration of air.</P>
<P>When light was admitted, the wizard, as might be expected, was in a state of 
profuse perspiration, and greatly exhausted by his exertions, which had 
continued for at least half an hour. Captain Lyon then observed a couple of 
bunches, each consisting of two strips of white deerskin and a long piece of 
sinew, attached to the back of his coat. These he had not seen before, and he 
was gravely told that they had been sewn on by Tomga while he was below.</P>
<P>The angekoks profess to visit the dwelling-place of the spirits they invoke 
and give circumstantial descriptions of these habitations. They have a firm 
belief in their own powers.</P>
<P>Dr. Kane considers it a fact of psychological interest, as it shows that 
civilised or savage wonder-workers form a single family, that the angekoks have 
a firm belief in their own powers. &quot;I have known, he says&quot;, &quot; 
several of them personally, and can speak with confidence on this point. I could 
not detect them in any resort to jugglery or natural magic; their deceptions are 
simply vocal, a change of voice, and perhaps a limited profession of 
ventriloquism, made more imposing by the darkness.&quot; They have, however, 
like the members of the learned professions everywhere else, a certain language 
or jargon of their own, in which they communicate with each other.</P>
<P>While the angekoks are the dispensers of good, the <I>issintok, </I>or evil 
men, are the workers of injurious spells, enchantments, and metamorphoses. Like 
the witches of both Englands, the Old and the New, these malignant creatures are 
rarely submitted to trial until they have suffered punishment-the old ' Jeddart 
justice <I>&quot;castigat auditque. </I>Two of them, in <B>1818</B>, suffered 
the penalty of their crime on the same day, one at Kannonak, the other at 
Upernavik. The latter was laudably killed in accordance with the &quot;old 
custom&quot; custom being everywhere the apology for any act revolting to moral 
sense. He was first harpooned, then disembowelled; a flap let down from his 
forehead to cover his eyes and prevent his seeing again-he had, it appears, the 
repute of an evil eye;-and then small portions of his heart were eaten, to 
ensure that he should not come back to earth unchanged.&quot;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Esoteric Languages :</B> Artificial languages invented by certain castes for 
the better preservation of secrets, or for the purpose of impressing the vulgar 
with the mysteries and superior nature of those who employed the tongues in 
question. &quot;They conversed with one another in eager undertones in a 
language I did not understand.&quot; This is one of the stock phrases of the 
mystery novel of the nineteenth century, and has probably given rise to a great 
deal of misconception as to the true character and multipliticy of esoteric 
tongues. As a matter of fact, these are particularly rare. It is stated by 
several ancient authors that the Egyptian priests possessed a secret language of 
their own; but what its nature was we are unable to state, as no fragments of it 
are now extant,-probably because it was not reduced to writing. At the same time 
many </P>
<P>Egyptian magical formulae are in existence <I>(See </I>Egypt) which teem with 
words and expressions of secret meaning; but examination of these shows that 
they are merely foreign, usually Syrian, words slightly changed. We know, for 
example, that the secret dialects of the medicine-men among the North-American 
Indians are chiefly composed either of archaic expressions or the idioms of 
other tribes. But there are examples of the deliberate manufacture of a secret 
tongue, such as the <I>Shelta Than </I>(q.v) or language of the ancient caste of 
bronze-workers, still spoken by the tinkler classes of Great Britain, and the 
secret language of the <I>Ndembo </I>caste (q.v.) of the Lower Congo. It is 
probable that the Jewish priesthood cast a veil of secrecy over the sacred names 
of the Deity, and the higher ranks of their heavenly hierarchy, by substituting 
other names for them, such as &quot; Adonai&quot; for &quot;Jahveh.&quot; This 
of course arose from the Egyptian conception that the name of the god must be 
concealed from the vulgar, as to know it was to possess magical power over the 
deity. The spells and incantations of medieval magic are full of oriental names 
and idioms, but much jargon also found its way into these. It was considered in 
the middle ages that the primitive language of the world was lost to man, and it 
was thought that this might only be recovered through magical agency, or the 
reversion to a state of complete innocence. Others believed it to be Hebrew ; 
and it is on record that James IV. of Scotland isolated two infants on the 
island of Inchkcith, in the Firth of Forth along with a dumb woman who cared for 
them and that in course of time they ' spak gude Ebrew.&quot; A similar 
tradition acquaints us with the circumstance that a certain Egyptian king 
isolated two children in a like manner, who on coming to the period of speech 
met the first persons they beheld after their time of solitude with the word 
<I>beccos, </I>the Greek for bread. But these instances, it is unnecessary to 
say, are purely legendary. In many savage tribes, secret jargons or dialects are 
in use among the priesthood or the initiated of secret societies ; and in 
several brotherhoods of modern origin, symbolic words are constantly in use for 
the purpose of veiling veritable meaning. The Rosicrucians (q.v.) are said to 
have constituted and employed an arcane tongue.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Esplanadian :</B> A medieval Spanish legend. It tells how Amadie of Gaul and 
his wife Oriana of the Firm Island had the wicked enchanter Archelous in their 
keeping, but set him free in answer to his wife's entreaties. Certain calamities 
happen which are attributed to Archelous, and Amadis' son <I>Esplandian </I>is 
carried off by the enchantress Urganda. The legend goes on to relate 
<I>Esplandian's </I>adventures, how he is given a magic sword, and kills a 
dragon. With this sword he succeeds in killing Archelous himself, and his 
nephew, and he then sets free a kinsman. His next opponent is Matroed, son of 
Arcobone, whom he also vanquishes; and finally the stronghold of Archelous is 
utterly destroyed, and the land freed from the pagan influence of Matroed.</P>

<P>Essenes, The :</B> A mystical Jewish sect, the tenets of which are only 
partly known. They first appeared in history about <B>150</B> years B.C. They 
were very exclusive and possessed an organisation peculiar to themselves. They 
exercised strict asceticism, and great benevolence. They had fixed rules for 
initiation, and a succession of strictly separate grades. Their system of 
thought deviated greatly from the normal development of Judaism, and was more in 
sympathy with Greek philosophy and oriental ideas. The tendency of the society 
was practical, and they regarded speculation on the universe as too lofty for 
the human intellect. So far as can be judged there was nothing occult in their 
beliefs.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Etain :</B> The second wife of Midir the Proud, of Irish fame. Fuamnach, 
Midir's first wife, became jealous of her beauty and turned her into a 
butterfly, and she was blown out of the palace by a magic storm. For seven years 
she was tossed hither and thither through Ireland, but then was blown into the 
fairy palace of Angus on the Boyne. He could not release her from the spell, but 
during the day she fed on honey-laden flowers, and by night in her natural form 
gave Angus her love. Fuamnach discovered her hiding-place, and sent a dreadful 
tempest which blew <I>Etain </I>into the drinking-cup of Etar, wife of an Ulster 
chief. Etar swallowed her, but she was born her daughter, and as such married 
Eochy, High King of Ireland.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Ether :</B> sometimes spoken of as <I>koilon </I>is in theosophic as in 
scientific teaching, all pervading. filling all space and interpenetrating all 
matter. Despite this, it is of very great density, <B>10</B>,<B>000</B> times 
more dense than water and with a pressure of <B>750 </B>tons per square inch. It 
is capable of being known only by clairvoyants of the most highly developed 
powers. This <I>ether </I>is filled with an infinitude of small bubbles pretty 
much like the air-bubbles in treacle or some such viscid substance, and these 
were formed at some vastly remote period by the infusion of the breath of the 
Logos into the <I>ether, </I>or, as Madame Blavatsky phrased it, they are the 
holes which Fohat, the Logos, dug in space. Of these bubbles-not of the 
ether-matter is built up in its degree of density varying with the number of 
bubbles combined together to form each degree. </P><I>
<P>(See<B> </I>Solar System, Theosophy.</B>)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Etheric Double :</B> is, in Theosophy, the invisible part of the ordinary, 
visible, physical body which it interpenetrates and beyond which it extends for 
a little, forming with other finer bodies the &quot; aura &quot; (q.v.) The term 
<I>etheric </I>is used because it is composed of that tenuous matter by the 
vibrations of which the sensation of light is conveyed to the eye. This matter, 
it must however be noted is not the omnipresent ether of space, hut is composed 
of physical matter known as etheric, super-etheric, sub-atomic, and atomic. The 
term <I>double </I>is used because it is an exact replica of the denser physical 
body. The sense organs of the <I>etheric double </I>are the <I>chaksams 
</I>(q.v.) and it is through these <I>chaksams </I>(q.v.) that the physical body 
is supplied with the vitality necessary for its existence and its well-being 
during life. The <I>etheric double </I>thus plays the part of a conductor, and 
it also plays the part of a bridge between. the physical and astral bodies, for 
without it man could have no communication with the astral world and hence 
neither thoughts nor feelings. Anaesthetics for instance drive out the greater 
part of the <I>double, </I>and the subject is then impervious to pain. During 
sleep it does not leave the physical body, and, indeed, in dreams the etheric 
part of the brain is extremely active, especially when, as is often the case, 
the dreams are caused by attendant physical circumstances, such as noise. 
Shortly after death, the <I>etheric double </I>finally quits the physical body 
though it does not move far away from that body, but is composeed of the four 
subdivisions of physical matter above alluded to. With the decay of the latter, 
the <I>double </I>also decays and thus to a clairvoyant, a, burying ground 
presents a most unpleasant sight. <I>(See also </I>Vitality, Etheric Vision, 
Theosophy, Shell.)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Etheric Vision</B> <B>:</B> is in Theosophy, the power of sight peculiar to 
the Etheric Double (q.v.). It is of considerably greater power than physical 
vision, and by its aid many of the phenomena of the physical world may be 
examined as may also many creatures of a non-human nature which are ordinarily 
just outside the range of physical vision. It responds readily to stimuli of 
various kinds and becomes active under their influence.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Ethlinn :</B> Daughter of Balor, King of the Fomorians of Irish magical 
legend. She was Balor's only child, and as he had been informed by a druid that 
he would be killed by his grandson, he had <I>Ethlinn </I>imprisoned in a tower 
and guarded by twelve women, who were forbidden to tell her that such beings as 
men existed. Balor stole a magic cow from Kian, who in revenge obtained access 
to <I>Ethlinn </I>disguised as a woman. They had three children whom Balor 
ordered to be drowned; but one of them fell from the napkin in which they were 
being taken to their doom, and was carried off by the Druidess Birog to its 
father Kian. This child became Lugh, the great sun-god, who eventually fulfilled 
the prophecy and killed his grandfather. Balor.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Etteilla :</B> An eighteenth century student of the Tarot. By profession he 
was a barber, his true name being Alliette; but on entering upon his occult 
labours he read it backwards, after the Hebrew fashion-Eteilla. He had but 
little education, and was ill acquainted with the philosophy of the initiates. 
Nevertheless he possessed a profound intuition, and, if we believe Eliphas Levi, 
came very near to unveiling the secrets of the Tarot. Of his writings Levi 'says 
that they are &quot;obscure, wearisome, and in style barbarous.&quot; He claimed 
to have revised the <I>Book of Thot, </I>'but in reality he spoilt it, regarding 
as blunders certain cards whose meaning he had failed to grasp. It is commonly 
admitted that he failed in his attempt to elucidate the Tarot, and ended by 
transposing the keys, thus destroying the correspondence between the numbers and 
the signs. It has also been said of him that he had degraded the science of the 
Tarot into the cartomancy, or fortune-telling by cards, of the vulgar.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Evergreens :</B> The custom of decorating houses at Christmas-tide with 
<I>evergreen </I>plants-holly, ivy, box, laurel, mistletoe - is sometimes said 
to have originated when Christianity was introduced into this country, to typify 
the first British church, built of <I>evergreen boughs. </I>More probably it 
</P>
<P>extends back into antiquity. In Druidic times people decorated their houses 
with <I>evergreen </I>plants so that the sylvan spirits might repair thither to 
shelter from the severity of winter, till their leafy bowers should be

<P>Evolution of Life : </B>according to theosophlsts, began when the Logos, in 
his second aspect, sent forth the second life wave. This life wave descends from 
above through the various worlds causing an increasing heterogeneity and 
thereafter ascends, causing a return to its original homogeneity. Our present 
state of knowledge of life in these worlds extends no farther than the mental 
world. In the higher division of that world it has ensouled the relatively fine 
matter appropriate thereto-if that matter is atomic it is known as &quot;monadic 
essence&quot; if non-atomic, as &quot;elemental essence,&quot; and this is known 
as the first elemental kingdom. What we may call the inhabitants of this kingdom 
are the higher order of angels. The life wave having functioned sufficiently 
long in the higher mental world, now presses down to the lower level of that 
world, where it appears as the second elemental kingdom, the inhabitants of 
which are some of the lower orders of angels, the Form Devas. Again pressing 
down, the life wave manifests itself in the astral world, forming the third 
elemental kingdom, the inhabitants of which are the lowest orders of angels, the 
Passion Devas. It now enters the physical world and, in the fourth elemental 
kingdom, ensouls the etheric part of minerals with the elementary type of life 
which these possess. The middle of this kingdom represents the farthest descent 
of 'the life wave, and thereafter its course is reversed and it commences to 
ascend. The next kingdom into which it passes is the fifth elemental kingdom, 
the vegetable world, whence it passes to the sixth elemental kingdom, the animal 
world, and lastly to the seventh elemental kingdom, man. During its stay in each 
kingdom, the life wave progresses gradually from elementary to highly 
specialised types and when it has attained these latter, it passes to the next 
kingdom. This, of course, of necessity means that successive currents of this 
great second life wave have come forth from the Logos, since, if it were 
otherwise, there would be only one kingdom in existence at a time. In each 
kingdom, also, the souls of the bodies which inhabit it differ from those of the 
other kingdoms. Thus, in the seventh kingdom, that of man, each individual has a 
soul. In the animal kingdom on the contrary, one soul is distributed among 
different bodies, the number of which varies with the state of evolution. To one 
soul may be allotted countless bodies of a low type of development, but, as the 
development increases, the soul comes to have fewer bodies allotted to it until 
in the kingdom of man there is but one.</P>

<P>Exorcism :</B> To exorcise, according to the received definitions, says 
Smedley, is to bind upon oath, to charge upon oath, and thus, by the use of 
certain words, and performance of certain ceremonies, to subject the devil and 
other evil spirits to command and exact obedience. Minshew calls an 
&quot;exorcist&quot; a &quot;conjuror;&quot; and it is so used by Shakespeare; 
and <I>exorcism, </I>&quot;conjuration.&quot; It is in the general sense of 
casting out evil spirits, however, that the word is now understood.</P>
<P>The trade of <I>exorcism </I>has probably existed at all times In Greece, 
Epicurus and AEschines, were sons of women who lived by this art, and each was 
bitterly reproached, the one by the Stoics, theother by Demosthenes, for having 
assisted his parent in her dishonourable practices.</P>
<P>We read in the Acts of the Apostles (XIX. <B>13) </B>of the failure and 
disgrace of&quot; certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists,&quot; who, like the 
Apostles. &quot;took upon them to call over them that had evil spirits the Name 
of the Lord Jesus.&quot; &quot; God,&quot; says Josephus, &quot; enabled Solomon 
to learn that skill which expels demons, which is a science useful and sanative 
to men. He composed such incantations also, by which distempers are alleviated, 
and he left behind him the manner of using <I>exorcisims, </I>by which they 
drive away demons, so that they never return. And this method of cure is of 
great force unto this day; for I have seen a certain man of my own country, 
whose name was Eleazar, releasing people that were demoniacal, in the presence 
of Vespasian and his sons, and his captains, and the whole multitude of his 
soldiers. The manner of the cure was this. He put a ring that had a root of one 
of those sorts mentioned by Solomon to the nostrils of the demoniac, after which 
he drew out the demon through his nostrils; and when the man fell down 
immediately, he adjured him to return unto him no more, making still mention of 
Solomon, and reciting the incantation which he composed. And when Eleazar would 
persuade and demonstrate to the spectators that he had such a power, he set, a 
little way off, a cup or basin full of water, and commanded the demon as he went 
out of the man to overturn it. and thereby to let the spectators know that he 
had left the man.&quot; Some pretended fragments of these conjuring books of 
Solomon are noticed in the <I>Codex Pseudepigraphus </I>of Fabricus; and 
Josephus himself has described one of the antidemoniacal roots, in a measure 
reminiscent of the perils attendant on gathering the mandrake.&quot; Another 
fragment of antiquity bearing on this subject is the <I>exorcism </I>practised 
by Tobit, upon which it is by no means easy to pronounce judgment. Grotius, in a 
note on that history, states that the Hebrews attributed all diseases arising 
from natural causes to the influence of demons; and this opinion it is well 
known, has been pushed much farther than Grotius intended, by Hugh Farmer and 
others of his school. These facts are derived in great measure from Bekker's 
most ingenious, though forgotten volumes <I>Le Monde Enchonte, </I>to which the 
reader may be referred for almost all that can be written on the necessity of 
<I>exorcism.</I></P>
<P>Bekker relates an instance of <I>exorcism </I>practised by the modern Jews, 
to avert the evil influence of the demon Lilis, whom the Rabbis esteem to be the 
wife of Satan. During the hundred and thirty years, says Rabbi Elias, in his 
<I>Thisbi </I>which elapsed before Adam was married to Eve, he was visited by 
certain she devils, of whom the four principal were Lilis, Naome, Ogere, and 
Machalas; these, from their commerce with him, produced a fruitful progeny of 
spirits. Lilis still continues to visit the chambers of women recently 
delivered, and endeavours to kill their babes, if boys on the eighth day, if 
girls, on the twenty-first, after their birth. In order to chase her away, the 
attendants describes circles on the walls of the chamber, with charcoal, and 
within each they write, Adam, Eve, Lilis, avaunt!&quot; On the door also of the 
chamber they write the names of the three angels who preside over medicine, 
Senoi, Sansenoi, and Sanmangelof,-a secret which it appears was taught them, 
somewhat unwittingly, by Lilis herself.</P>
<P>A particular ecclesiastical order of exorcists does not appear to have 
existed in the Christian church till the close of the third century; and Mosheim 
attributes its introduction to the prevalent fancies of the Gnostics. In the 
Xth. Canon of the Council of Antioch, held A.D. <B>34</B> exorcists are 
expressly mentioned in conjunction with subdeacons and readers, and their 
ordination is described by the IVth. Council of Carthage, <B>7</B>. It 
consisted, without any imposition of hands, in the delivery, by the Bishop of a 
book containing forms of <I>exorcism, </I>and directions that they should 
exercise the office upon &quot; Energumens,&quot; whether baptized or only 
catechumens. The fire of <I>exorcism, </I>as St. Augustine terms it, always 
preceded baptism. Catechumens were exorcised for twenty days previous to the 
administration of this sacrament. It should be expressly remarked, however, that 
in the case of such catechumens as were not at the same time energumens, these 
<I>exorcisms </I>were not directed against any supposed demoniacal possession. 
They were, as Cyril describes them, no more than prayers collected and composed 
out of the words of Holy Writ, to beseech God to break the dominion and power of 
Satan in new converts, and to deliver them from his slavery by expelling the 
spirit of wickedness and error.</P>
<P>Thus in the Greek Church, as Rycaut mentions, before baptism, the priest 
blows three times upon the child to dispossess the devil of his seat; and this 
may be under-stood as symbolical of the power of sin over the unbaptized, not as 
an assertion of their real or absolute possession.</P>
<P>The exorcists form one of the minor orders of the Romish Church. At their 
ordination the bishop addresses them as to their duties, and concludes with 
these words :-Take now the power of laying hands upon the energumens, and by the 
imposition of your hands, by the grace of the Holy Spirit, and the words of 
<I>exorcism, </I>the unclean spirits are driven from obsessed bodies. One of the 
completest manuals for a Romish exorcist which ever was compiled, is a volume of 
nearly <B>1300 </B>pages, entitled, <I>Thesaurus Exorcismorum et Conjurationum 
terribilium, potentissimorum, efficacissimorumque, cum Practica probatissima, 
quibus, Spiritus matigni, Damones, malecifiaque omnia de corporibus humanis 
tanquam Flagellis Fustigusque fugantur, expeltuntur. Doctrinis refertissimus 
atque uberrimus ; ad maximam Exorcistarum commodi-Tatem in lucem editus et 
recusus, Coloniae, </I><B>1608</B>. It contains the following Tracts F. Valerii 
Polydori Patavini, Ordinis Minor, etc. &quot; Practica Exorcistarum,' ' two 
parts; F. Hieronymi Mengi Vitellianensis, Flagellum Daemonum;&quot; Ejusdem 
&quot;Fustis Daemonium;&quot; F. Zachariae Vicecomitis, &quot; Complementum 
Artis Exorcistiae;&quot; Petri Antonii Stampae, &quot;Fuga Satanae.&quot;</P>
<P>From the first of these treatises, it appears that the energumens were 
subjected to a very severe corporal as well as spiritual discipline. They were 
first exercised in Priexorcizationes &quot; which consist of confessions, 
postulations, protestations, concitations, and interrogations. The <I>exorcisms 
</I>themselves are nine in number : I. &quot; ex Sanctisnominibus Dci,&quot; 
which are thus enumerated, &quot; Schemhamphoras, Eloha, Ab, Bar, Ruachaccocies 
Jehovah, Tetragrammaton, Heheje, Haja hove vejhege, El Sabaoth, Agla, Adonai, 
Cados, Sciadai, Alpha and Omega, Agios and Yschiros. <B>1</B>. Theos and 
Athanatos; <B>2. </B>cx omnium Sanctorum ordine; <B>3</B>. ax priecipuis 
animadversione dignis Sanctorum Angelorum; <B>4</B>. ex actibus vitie gloriosie 
Virg. Mariie ; <B>5</B>. ex gestis, Domini Nostri Jesu Christi; <B>6</B>. cx 
institutis venerabilium Sacramentorum; <B>7</B>. cx priecipuis S. Eceleslie 
Dogmatibus; <B>8</B>. Apocacalypsis (Apocalypsews) Beati Joannis Apostoli.&quot; 
All these are accompanied with appropriate psalms, lessons, litanies, prayers, 
and adjurations. Then follow eight &quot; Postexorcizationes.&quot; The three 
first are to be used according as the demon is more or less obstinately bent on 
retaining possession. If he is very sturdy, a picture of him is to be drawn, 
&quot; effigie horribili ac turpi,&quot; with his name inscribed under it, and 
to be thrown into the flames, after having been signed with the cross, sprinkled 
with holy water and fumigated. The fourth and fifth are forms of thanksgiving 
and benediction after liberation. The sixth refers to &quot;Incubi&quot; and 
&quot; Succubi.&quot; The seventh is for a haunted house, in which the service 
varies during every day of the week. The eighth is to drive away demoniacal 
storms and tempests-for which purpose are to be thrown into a huge fire large 
quantities of Sabinae, Hupericonis, Palmae Christi, Arthemesize, Verbenae, 
Aristolochiae rotundae, Rutae, Aster, Attici, Sulphuris et Assae fetidae. The 
second part of the treatise &quot; Dispersio Daemonum&quot; contains many 
recipes for charms and amulets against possession. Besides these, there are 
directions for the diet and medicine of the possessed, as bread provided 
&quot;contra Diaboli nequitiam at maleficiorum turbinem.&quot; Mutton &quot; pro 
obsessi nutrimento atque Maleflcii at Diemonis detrimento.&quot; Wine pro 
maleficiatis nutriendis et maleficiis Diabolicisque quibuscunque infestationibus 
destruendis.&quot; Holy water for the same purpose, whenever wine is forbidden. 
A draught &quot;ad omne maleficium indifferenter solvendum et Diabolum 
conterendum.&quot; Four separate lavements and a night draught for the 
delirious; two emetics &quot;pro materialibus instrumentis maleficialibus 
emittendis.&quot; And finally, there is a conserve &quot; virtuosius 
corroborativa ventriculi a maleficialium instrumentorum materialium vomitione 
fessi.&quot;</P>
<P>In the&quot; Flagellum Daemonum &quot;are contained numerous cautions to the 
exorcist himself, not to be deceived by the arts of the demon, particularly when 
he is employed with possessed women. If the devil refuses to tell his name, the 
demoniac is to be fumigated. If it be necessary to break off the <I>exorcism 
</I>before the evil spirits be wholly expelled, they are to be adjured to quit 
the head, heart, and stomach of the energumen, and to abscond themselves in the 
lower parts of his body, &quot;puta in ungues mortuos pedum?'</P>
<P>In the &quot; Fustis Daemonum the exorcist is directed, whenever the evil 
spirit persists in staying, to load him with vituperative addresses. After this 
railing latinity, redoubled precaution is necessary, and if the demons still 
refuse to tell their names, the knowledge of which is always great gain, the 
worst names that can be thought of are to be attributed to them, and fumigations 
resorted to. The seventh <I>exorcism </I>in this treatise is &quot;mirabilis 
efficaciae pro his qui in matrimonis a Daemonibus vel maleficis diabolica arte 
impediuntur seu maleficiantur.&quot; Among other things, they are to be largely 
anointed with holy oil; and if all adjurations fail, they are to be strenuously 
exhorted to patience. In the last form, dumbness is attacked, and a very 
effectual remedy against this infirmity is a draught of holy water with three 
drops of holy wax, swallowed on an empty stomach.</P>
<P>Father Vicecomes, in his <I>Complementum Artis Exorcistiae, </I>explains the 
several signs of possession or bewitchment ; also, in how many separate ways the 
evil spirit notifies his departure, sometimes by putting out the light, now and 
then by issuing like a flame, or a very cold blast, through the mouth, nose, or 
ears. He then writes many prescriptions for emetics, perfumes, and fumigations, 
calculated to promote these results. The writer concludes with a catalogue of 
the names of some of the devils of commonest occurrence, which is of very narrow 
dimensions Astaroth, Baal, Cozbi, Dagon, Aseroth, Baalimm, Chamo, Beelphegor, 
Astarte, Bethage, Phogor, Moloch, Asmodaeus, Bele, Nergel, Melchon, Asima, Bel, 
Nexroth, Tartach, Acharon, Belial, Neabaz, Merodach, Adonides, Beaemot, 
Jerobaal, Socothbenoth, Beelzebub, Leviathan, Lucifer, Satan, Mahomet.</P>
<P>The <I>Fuga Satanae </I>of Stampa is very brief, and does not contain any 
matter which deserves to be added to the much fuller instructions given by Mengs 
and, Vicecomes. Several of the forms used by Mengs are translated and satirized, 
in the coarse ridicule which characterized those times, in a little tract 
entitled <I>A Whip for the Devil, or the Roman Conjuror, </I><B>1683</B>. A 
century and a half before this, Erasmus had directed his more polished and 
delicate wit to the same object ; and his pleasant dialogue <I>Exorcismus seu 
Spectrum </I>is an agreeable and assuredly an unexaggerated picture of these 
practices.</P>
<P>Those who desire to peruse a treatise on practical <I>exorcism </I>should 
consult the <I>Histoire admirable de la possession et conversion d'une 
Penitente, seduite par Un Magicien, Ia faisant Sorciere et Princesse des 
Sorciers, au pais de Provence, conduite a Ia Scte. Baume, pour y estre 
exorcizee, l'an MDCX. au mois de Novembre, soubs l'authorite de R.P.F. Sebastien 
Michaelis, Prieur de Convente Royale de la Scte. Magdalene' a S. Maximin et 
dudict lieu de la Scte. Baume, </I>Paris, <B>1613</B>.<B> </B>The possessed in 
this case, Magdelaine de Palha, was exorcised during &ndash;four months ; she 
was under the power of five princes of the devils, Beelzebub, Leviathan, 
Baalberith, Asmodeus and Astaroth, &quot;avec plusieurs autres inferieurs.&quot; 
Beelzebub abode in her forehead, Leviathan in the middle of her head, Astaroth 
in the hinder part of it ; &quot; la partie de la tete ou ils estoient faisoit, 
centre nature, un perpetual mouvement et battement ; estans sortis la partie ne 
bougeoit point.&quot;</P>
<P>A second sister of the same convent, Loyse, was also possessed by three 
devils of the highest degree, Verin, Gresil, and Soneillon ; and of these, 
Verin, through the proceedings of the exorcists, appears to have turned king's 
evidence, as it were ; for, in spite of the remonstrances and rage of Beelzebub, 
&quot; qui commenca a rugir et a jetter des cris comme feroit un taureau 
echauffe,&quot; he gave important information and instruction to his enemies, 
and appeared grievously to repent that he was a devil. The daily Acts and 
Examinations, from the <B>27</B>th of November to the following <B>23</B>rd of 
April, are specially recorded by the exorcist himself, and all the conversations 
of the devils are noted down verbatim. The whole business ended in a tragedy, 
and Louis Gaufridi, a priest of Marseilles, who was accused of witchcraft on the 
occasion was burned alive at Aix.</P>
<P>Michaelis is eminently distinguished in his line. We find him three years 
afterwards engaged in exorcising three nuns in the convent of St. Brigette, at 
Lisle. Whether the two unhappy women, Marie de Sains and her accomplice, Simone 
Dourlet, who were supposed to have been the causes of this possession, were put 
to death or not, does not appear. The proceedings may be found in a <I>Histoire 
veritable et memorable de ce qui c'est passe sous l'Exorcisme de trois filles 
possedees an pais de Flandre, </I>Paris <B>1623</B> ;<B> </B>and they are in 
some 'respects an appendix to those against Louis Gaufridi, whose imputed 
enormities are again related in a second volume of this work.</P>
<P>This transaction appears to have been the work of superstition alone; but one 
of far deeper dye, and of -almost unparalleled atrocity, occurred at Loudun 
(q.v.) in <B>1634</B>, when Grandier (q.v.), cure and canon of that town, was 
mercilessly brought to the stake partly by the jealousy of some monks, partly to 
gratify the personal vengeance of Richelieu, who had been persuaded that this 
ecclesiest had lampooned him, an offence which he never forgave. Some Ursline 
nuns were tortured to feign themselves possessed, and Grandier was the person 
accused of having tenanted them with devils. Tranquille, one of the exorcists, 
published a <I>Veritable relation des juste procedures observees au fait de la 
possession des Ursulines de Loudun, et au proces de Grandier, </I>Paris 
<B>1634</B>; and by a' singular fatality, this reverend personage himself died 
within four years of the iniquitous execution of his victim, ill a state of 
reputed possession, probably distracted by the self-accusations of remorse.</P>
<P>The last acknowledgment of <I>exorcism </I>in the Anglican Church, during the 
progress of the Reformation, occurs in the first Liturgy of Edward VI. in which 
is given the following form at baptism &quot; Then let the priest, looking upon 
the children, say. ' I command thee, unclean spirit, in the name of the Father, 
of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, that thou come out and depart from these 
infants, whey our Lord Jesus Christ has vouchsafed to call to His holy baptism, 
to be made members of His Body and of His Holy congregation. Therefore, thou 
cursed spirit, remember thy sentence, remember thy judgment, remember the day to 
be at hand wherein thou shalt burn in fire everlasting prepared for thee and thy 
angels. And presume not hereafter to exercise any tyranny towards these infants 
whom Christ hath bought with His precious blood, and by this His holy baptism 
calleth to be of His flock.' &quot; On the remonstrance of Bucer, in his censure 
of the liturgy, that that <I>exorcism </I>was not originally used to any but 
demoniacs, and that it was uncharitable to imagine that all were demoniacs who 
came to baptism, it was thought prudent by our reformers to omit it altogether, 
in their review of the liturgy in the <B>5</B>th and <B>6</B>th of Edward 
VI.</P>
<P>The LXXIId canon thus expresses itself on <I>exorcism, </I>No minister shall, 
without the license of the bishop of the diocese, first obtained and had under 
his hand and seal,-attempt upon any pretence whatever, either of obsession or 
possession, by fasting or prayer, to cast out any devil or devils: under pain of 
the imputation of imposture or cosenage, and deposition from the 
ministry.&quot;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Extispley, or Extispicium</B> <B>:</B> so named from <I>exta </I>and 
<I>spicere, </I>to view, consider, was applied to the inspection of entrails 
chiefly. The officers were Extispices or Aruspices, and one of the instruments 
they used was called by the same name as the craft, an <I>extispicium. </I>The 
Erturians were the first and also the most learned, who practised <I>extispicy, 
</I>and Romulus is said to have chosen his first Aruspices from among them. The 
art was also practised throughout Greece, where it had a consecrated priesthood 
confined to two families. The Roman Aruspices had four distinct duties, to 
examine the victims before they were opened, to examine the entrails, to observe 
the flame as the sacrifice was burnt, and also to examine the meat and 
drink-offering which accompanied it. It was a fatal sign when the heart was 
wanting, and this is said to have been the case with two oxen that were 
immolated on the day when Caesar was killed. If the priest let the entrails 
fall, or there was more bloodiness than usual, or if they were livid in colour, 
it was understood to be a portent of instant disaster. Itruvius has attempted to 
account for the origin of <I>extispicy </I>by the custom of examining the 
viscera of animals, before settling an encampment, to ascertain if the 
neighbourhood was healthy, an explanation to which little value can be 
attached.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Eye-biters :</B> In the time of Queen Elizabeth there came among the cattle 
of Ireland a disease whereby they grew blind. The witches to whose malevolence 
this evil was attributed were called <I>eye-biters, </I>and many of them were 
executed.</P></FONT>
