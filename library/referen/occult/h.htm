<P>Hag of the Dribble, or &quot;Gwrach y Rhibyn&quot; :</B> One of the Welsh 
banshees, whose pleasure it is to carry stones across the mountains in her 
apron, then loosing the string, she lets the stones shower down, thus making a 
&quot;dribble.&quot; It is believed that at twilight this hag flaps her raven 
wing against the window of those who are doomed to die, and howls &quot;A a a ui

<P>Haggadah :</B> Toe general name for the narrative or fabular portion of the 
Rabbinical literature.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Hajoth Hakados :</B> One of the spheres of angels, by whose agency Jehovah's 
providence is spread. The <I>Jews </I>believe that these angels inhabit one of 
the hierarchies named Jehovah,&quot; and that the simple essence of the divinity 
flows through the <I>Hajeth Hakados </I>to the angel &quot;Metratton&quot; and 
to the ministering spirit &quot;Reschith Hajalalim.&quot;</P>
<P><I></I>&nbsp; </P><B>
<P>Hallucination :</B> A false perception of sensory vividness arising without 
the stimulus of a corresponding sense-impression. In this it differs from 
illusion, which is merely the misinterpretation of an actual sense-perception. 
Visual and auditory <I>hallucinations </I>are the most common, and especially 
the former ; but <I>hallucination </I>of the other senses may also be 
experienced, though it is not so readily distinguishable. Human figures and 
voices roost frequently form the subject of a <I>hallucination, </I>but in 
certain types other classes of objects may be seen-as, for instance, the rats 
and insects of <I>delirium tremens. </I>Though <I>hallucination </I>is often 
associated with various mental and physical diseases, it may, nevertheless occur 
spontaneously while the agent shows no departure from full vigour of body and 
mind, and may be induced-i.e., in hypnotism-in about <B>90</B> per cent. of all 
subjects. The essential difference between sane and insane <I>Hallucinations 
</I>is that in the former case the agent can, by reflection, recognise the 
subjective nature of the impression, even when it has every appearance of 
objectivity ; whereas in the latter case the patient cannot be made to 
understand that the vision is not real.</P>
<P>Until comparatively recently hallucinatory percepts were regarded merely as 
intensified memory-images, but as the most intense of ordinary representations 
do not possess that sensory vividness which is yet a feature of the smallest 
sensation received from the external world, it follows that other conditions 
must be present besides the excitement of the brain-elements which is the 
correlate of representation. It is true that the seat of excitement is the same 
both in actual sense-perceptions and in memory images but in the former case the 
stimulas is peripherally originated in the sensory nerve, whereas in the latter 
it takes its rise in the brain itself. Now if any neural system becomes highly 
excited-a state which may be brought about by emotion, ill-health, drugs, or a 
number of causes-it may serve to divert from their proper paths any set of 
impulses arising from the sense organs, and as any impulse ascending through the 
sensory nerves produces an effect of sensory vividness - normally, a true 
perception-the impulse's thus diverted give to the memory images an appearance 
of actuality, not distinguishable from that produced by a corresponding 
sense-impression. In hypnosis a state of cerebal dissociation is induced, 
whereby any one neural system may be abnormally excited, and <I>hallucination 
</I>thus very readily engendered. Drugs which excite the brain also induce 
<I>hallucinations.</I></P>
<P>The question or whether there is any relation between the <I>hallucination 
</I>and the person it represents is, and has long been, a vexed one. Countless 
well-authenticated stories of apparitions coinciding with a death or some other 
crisis are on record, and would seem to establish some causal connection between 
them. In former times apparitions 'were considered to be the &quot;doubles&quot; 
or &quot;ethereal bodies&quot; of the originals, and modern spiritualists 
believe that they are the spirits of the dead-or, mayhap, of the living, 
temporarily forsaking the physical organism. But the main theory among those who 
believe in such a causal connection between agent and <I>hallucination-and 
</I>in view of the statistics collected by Professor Sidgwick and others <I>(See 
</I>&quot; Psychic Research&quot;), it is difficult not to believe-is that of 
telepathy, or thought-transference. That the cerebral machinery for the 
transmission of thought should be specially stimulated in moments of intense 
excitement, or at the approach of dissolution, is not to be wondered at; and 
thus it is sought to account for the appearance of hallucinatory images 
coinciding with death or other crises. Moreover, the dress and appearance of the 
apparition does not necessarily correspond with the actual dress and appearance 
of its original. Thus a man at the point of death, in bed and wasted by disease, 
may appear to a friend as if in his ordinary health, and wearing his ordinary 
garb. Nevertheless there are notable instances where some remarkable detail of 
dress is reproduced in the apparition. It seems clear, however, that it is the 
agent's general personality which is, as a rule, conveyed to the percipient, and 
not, except in special cases, the actual matter of his 
surface-consciousness.</P>
<P>A similar explanation has been offered for the hallucinatory images which 
many people can induce by gazing in a crystal, or even in a pool of water, or a 
drop of ink, and which are often declared to give information, and reproduce 
scenes and people of whom the agent has no knowledge. It is suggested that those 
images which do not arise in the subliminal consciousness of the agent may have 
been telepathically received by him from other minds. <I>(See 
</I><STRONG>Crystal-gazing.</STRONG>)</P><I>
<P>Collective Hallucination </I>is a term applied to <I>hallucinations </I>which 
are shared by a number of people. There is no evidence, however, of the 
operation of any other agency than suggestion (q.v.) or at the most, 
telepathy.</P>

sent by Helgi to engulf Frithjof as he sailed for the island of Yarl Angantyr in 
the Saga of Grettir.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Hambaruan :</B> Among the Dayaks of Borneo the <I>hambaruan, </I>or soul of a 
living man, may leave the body at will, and go where it chooses ; it is, 
however, liable to capture by evil spirits. If this should happen, the man falls 
ill, and, if his soul is not speedily liberated, dies.</P>

<P>Hamon :</B> A sacred stone like gold, shaped as a ram's horn. If its 
possessor is in the posture of contemplation, it gives the mind a representation 
of all divine things.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Hand of Glory :</B> The hand of a dead man, in which a lighted candle has 
been placed. It was formerly believed in Ireland and Mexico to be an instrument 
of magic. If the candle and its gruesome candlestick be taken into a house the 
sleeping inmates will be prevented from waking, and the candle itself will 
remain invisible. To be truly efficacious, however, both hand and candle must be 
prepared in a special manner.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Hands of Spirits :</B> There are instances in occult history where the hand 
only of a spirit has become visible to the human eye. During the reign of James 
I. a vision of this kind came to a certain clerk who was engaged in writing a 
will which was to disinherit a son. It took the form of a fine white hand, which 
appeared between the candle and the parchment, casting a shadow on the latter. 
It came three times, till the clerk, becoming alarmed, threw down his pen and 
refused to finish the work. In the Book of Daniel it is related &quot; In the 
same hour came forth fingers of a. man's hand, and wrote over against the 
candlestick upon the plaster of the wall of the king's palace: and the king 
(Belshazzar) saw the part of the hand that wrote.&quot; There are also many 
instances of writing being done without human hands, and a Mr. Wolf, of Ohio, 
states that he has shaken hands with spirits, as &quot;substantially&quot; as 
one man shakes hands with another. After a certain vision, it is recorded that 
Daniel was touched by a hand, which set him upon his knees and upon the palms of 
his hands.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Hanon-Tramp :</B> The name given by the Germans to a certain kind of 
nightmare (q.v.). This particular nightmare takes the form of a demon, which 
suffocates people during sleep. It is believed by the French peasantry that this 
is &quot; the destruction that wasteth at noon-day,&quot; as it is supposed that 
people are most exposed to its attacks at that time Its method of suffocation is 
to press on the breast and thus Impede the action of the lungs.</P>

<P>Harodim :</B> A degree of Freemasonry very popular in the North of England, 
and especially in the County of Durham, and probably founded in Gateshead in 
<B>1681</B>. It was brought under the Grand Lodge in <B>1735</B>. They were the 
custodians of the Ritual of All Masonry, or the Old York Ritual. There were nine 
lodges in all. A London version of this society was the Harodim-Rosy-Cross, of 
Jacobite origin, probably carried to London by the Earl of Derwentwater. This 
latter may have been a Scotch rite in very early times..</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Harris, Thomas Lake, 1823-1906 :</B> An American spiritualist born in 
Buckinghamshire, who, with his parents, emigrated to the United States when he 
was of a tender age. He adopted the profession of a preacher of the Universalist 
Church, but afterwards became a Swedenborgian. He attached himself to Davis 
(q.v.), but after the latter's exposure he deserted him and established himself 
as a preacher at New York, where he gathered round him a considerable 
congregation. When about twenty-seven years of age, he began to pose as the 
possessor of prophetic power, and produced a number of poems, which are not 
without a certain merit of their own. These he was able to improvise with such 
rapidity as to lead many to the belief that he was indeed divinely inspired. 
Somewhere about the year <B>1859</B> he visited London, where in certain circles 
his verse was admired. On returning to America, he founded a small community 
near New York, of which he became the head. Its members were of a heterogeneous 
description, composing American ladies of means, Japanese, clergymen, and the 
author, Laurence Oliphant, with his wife and mother. This community <I>Harris 
</I>called the Brotherhood of the New Life, and a little later on it was decided 
to change its Site to the shores of Lake Erie. The principal industry of the 
community was wine-making, and for this <I>Harris </I>was called to account by 
the temperance party, but he summarily dismissed their objections by stating 
that the wine he made was the direct vehicle of the Divine Breath. His theology 
was a curious one: he believed that the Creator was androgyne, and he favoured 
married celibacy. The mode of breathing professed by him appears to have been 
imitated from that in vogue among certain Buddhist castes, but it was to be the 
mark of the faithful. In <B>1881</B> the Oliphants seceded from his rule, and 
charged him with fraud. They took legal proceedings against him, and succeeded 
ill recovering considerable sums in this manner. Olipliant believed to the last 
that <I>Harris </I>possessed psychical powers, but there is no doubt at all that 
he was extremely avaricious and licentious as his books of verse, issued to a 
select circle, prove. In <B>1891</B> he proclaimed that he had renewed his 
youth, and that he had discovered what amounted to the elixir of life. On his 
death in <B>1906</B> his disciples would not believe that he had passed away, 
but thought he was only sleeping. He died in March, and it was not util June 
that his demise was publicly acknowledged by his followers. His whole philosophy 
was directed towards the breaking down the established order of the relations of 
the sexes. His sect had a jargon of its own, and its language was often inflated 
and absurd. But with all his failings, and they were many, <I>Harris </I>was a 
man of considerable gifts, among which may be noted some poetic fervour and 
fluency and force of character.</P>

<P>Haruspication :</B> <I>(See </I><B>Divination.)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P></B><B>
<P>Hasidim (&quot;Pious Ones&quot;) :</B> Devotees of a mystical phase of 
Judaism. They are first heard of in the pre-Maccabean age. In the first 
centuries of the Christian era we again hear of the <I>Hasidim,, </I>sometimes 
supposed to be the descendants of the earlier sect. The later <I>Hasidim 
</I>were saints and workers of miracles, gifted with esoteric wisdom and the 
prophetic faculty. Early in the eighteenth century there arose yet another sect 
of the same name, having for its aim the revival of spirituality in the Jewish 
religion. Representatives of this mystic body are still to be found in Hungary, 
Poland, and Russia.</P>

<P>Hastraun : </B>A small mystical sect of Judaism, whose members were to be 
found in some parts of Palestine and Babylon. They practised some sort of 
communism, and were known also as &quot;fearers of sin.&quot;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Hatha Yoga :</B> The earliest and therefore most simple form of the <I>Yoga 
</I>practice. An English translation of the <I>Hatha Yoga Pradipika </I>of 
Swatmaram Swami was published in <B>1893</B>. This book consists of four 
chapters : the first containing advice as to surroundings, conduct, postures, 
etc.; the second dealing with breathing practice, preparation, purification; the 
third gives ten <I>Mudras </I>which confer miraculous powers; and the fourth is 
a sort of supplement, and deals with the results of <I>Yoga </I>practice. The 
fruits of <I>Yoga </I>are detailed, and are of a very omniscient character.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Hauffe, Frederica :</B> Better known as the &quot; Seeress of Provost,&quot; 
a somnambule who came under the observation of Dr. Justinus Kerner, a well-known 
poet and physician, early in the nineteenth century. A natural trance and 
convulsive patient, she came to Kerner to be magnetised, but he endeavoured at 
first to treat her by medicinal means. Finding these unavailing, however, he 
resorted to magnetism. Henceforward the Seeress passed the greater part of her 
life in trance, displaying all the usual somnambulic phenomena. (See Magnetism 
under article Hypnotism.)</P>
<P>She saw and conversed with apparitions, developed remarkable clairvoyant 
faculties, and dealt also in mysticism, describing intricate symbolical 
circle-systems. She was also the author of a &quot;primitive&quot; language, 
constructed with some ingenuity, which purported to be that tongue, spoken by 
the patriarchs of old, wherein the words conveyed in some mystic manner the 
properties of the things they designated. Dr. Kerner and others were sometimes 
able to see <I>Frau Hauffe's </I>ghostly interlocutors, as dim grey pillars of 
cloud. Physical phenomena of a poltergeistic character were also of common 
occurrence in her presence.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Haunted Houses :</B> Not long ago a number of the daily papers contained, 
throughout several consecutive weeks, an advertisement offering for sale 
&quot;an ancient Gothic Mansion, known as Beckington Castle, ten miles from Bath 
and two from Frome&quot; ; and the writer of this advertisement after 
expatiating on the noble scenery around Beckington, and the rare architectural 
beauty of the house itself, proceeded to say that the place was the more 
desirable because it was reported to be haunted I No doubt there are people who 
long for a house containing a <I>bona fide </I>ghost, and it is sometimes said 
that the rich tradesman, anxious to turn himself into a squire, invariably looks 
out for a haunted manor, while some waggish writers have declared, indeed, that 
nowadays ghosts are to be bought at Whitely's, and that the demand for them 
among American millionaires is stupendous. And, if the purchaser of Beckington 
Castle had to pay an additional high price because the place rejoiced in a 
veritable ghost, in reality anything of this sort usually makes a house almost 
unsaleable. At Lossiemouth, for example, on the east coast of Scotland, a fine 
old mansion stood untenanted for years, and was eventually sold for a merely 
nominal sum; and the reason was, simply, that according to popular tradition the 
building was paraded nightly by a female figure draped in white, her throat 
bearing an ugly scar, and her hands tied behind her back with chains. Nor is it 
merely concerning old Manors in the country that stories of this nature are 
current, and, even in many densely populated towns there exist to this day 
houses reputed to be haunted, which are quite unsaleable.</P>
<P>It would seem that royal palaces, closely watched and guarded as they are 
nowadays, and invariably have been, are not altogether destitute of such 
inhabitants. For a legend contends that Windsor Castle is frequently visited by 
the ghost of Sir George Villiers, and it is said, moreover, that once, in the 
reign of Charles I., this ghost appeared to one of the king's 
gentlemen-in-waiting, and informed him that the Duke of Buckingham would shortly 
fall by the hand of an assassin - a prophecy which was duly fulfilled soon 
after, as all readers of <I>Les Trois Mousquetaires </I>will doubtless remember, 
the incident figuring in that immortal story. Then at Hackwood House, near 
Basing-stoke, there is a room in which no one dares to sleep, all dreading 'the 
grey woman supposed to appear there nightly ; while Wyecoller Hall, near Colne, 
boasts a spectre horseman who visits the place once a year, and rides at full 
speed through the garden. Very different is the legend attached to Dilston, in 
Tyneside. where a bygone Lady Windermere is said to appear from time to time, 
and indulge in loud lamentations for her unfortunate husband, who was executed 
for his share in the Jacobite rising of <B>1715</B> ; while at Salmesbury Hall, 
Blackburn, there is a ghost of yet another kind, the people of the neighbourhood 
affirming that periodically they see a weird lady and her knight promenading the 
grounds of the Hall, indulging the while in silken dalliance. It need hardly be 
said, perhaps, that ghosts of this particular nature are remarkably common, and 
bulk largely in the spiritual lore of nearly every county; but the more gruesome 
apparitions predominate withal, and among these is the ghost of Amy Robsart, 
which still haunts the manor of Cumnor, in Oxfordshire. For it must be borne in 
mind that Amy was a real woman, and not a mere creation of Sir Walter Scott's 
brain. She was married in <B>1550</B> to the Earl of Leicester, and his tragic 
death is commonly laid to his charge; but a tradition exists to the effect that 
Queen Elizabeth was really the responsible person, and recalling an authentic 
portrait of Amy, which bespeaks her a woman of charm and of no ordinary beauty, 
it is easy to believe that the ill-favoured queen hated her and took strong 
measures to get her out of the way.</P>
<P>Numerous rectories rejoice in the ghost of a clergyman, erstwhile murdered by 
his infuriated parishioners; and there are several <I>haunted </I>monasteries 
and convents, while at Holy Trinity Church at York a phantom nun appears 
occasionally on winter evenings, and walks about muttering paternosters. The 
story concerning her is that, on one occasion, during a period of civil-war, a 
band of soldiers were minded to sack the edifice in question, and on approaching 
it with this intention they were confronted by an abbess, who bade them beware 
of the divine wrath they would surely incur if they committed an act of 
sacrilege. They laughed at her piety, and, never thinking she would offer any 
resistance, they tried to march <I>en masse </I>into the building, but, hardly 
had they commenced the assault, ere their opponent snatched a sword from one of 
them, and stood bravely on the defensive. A fierce battle ensued, the abbess 
proving herself a veritable amazon, and slaying a host of her foes ; yet she 
lost her life ultimately, and her ghost it is which still frequents the church 
she sought to defend.</P>
<P>There are few parts of England so rich in romance as Sherwood Forest, once 
the scene of Robin Hood's exploits; and there is at least one place in this 
region which claims a number of ghosts, Newstead Abbey, the seat of Lord Byron's 
ancestors. A part of the garden there is popularly known as ' the devil's 
wood,&quot; a name which points to the place having been infested once by 
minions of the foul fiend, while one of the rooms in the house is <I>haunted 
</I>by a certain Sir John Byron, the little, of the grey beard,&quot; who 
presumably ended his days in some uncanny fashion. His portrait hangs over the 
hall in the dining-room, and a young lady, staying at Newstead about the middle 
of last century, contended stoutly that once she had entered this room to find 
the portrait gone, and its subject seated by the fireside reading a black-letter 
folio! The poet Byron himself cherished very fondly all the ghostly traditions 
which clung round his home, and it is recorded that, on his learning that there 
were stone coffins underneath the house, he straightway had one of them dug up 
and then opened. He used some of its gruesome contents to &quot;decorate&quot; 
his own library, while he had the coffin itself placed in the great hall, 
through which thereafter the servants were afraid to pass by night. He also 
utilised the supernatural lore of Newstead in one of his poems, and from this we 
learn that a spectre friar was wont to parade the mansion whenever some 
important event was wont to befall its owners:-</P>
<P>&quot;When an heir is born he is heard to mourn, And when ought is to 
befall</P>
<P>That ancient line, in the pale moonshine</P>
<P>He walks from hall to hall.</P>
<P>His form you may trace, but not his face,</P>
<P>'Tis shadowed by his cowl;</P>
<P>But his eyes may be seen from the folds between, And they seem of a parted 
soul.</P>
<P>Say nought to him as he walks the hall, And he'll say nought to you:</P>
<P>He sweeps along in his dusky pall, As o'er the grass the dew.</P>
<P>Then, gramercy ! for the black friar; Heaven sain him, fair or foul,</P>
<P>And whatsoe'er may be his prayer, Let ours be for his soul.&quot;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Passing from England to Ireland we find many <I>haunted houses </I>; for 
instance, Dunseverick in Antrim, where dwells still the soul of a bygone chief, 
so wicked in his lifetime that even hell's gates are closed to him. And passing 
from Ireland to Scotland we find numerous <I>haunted </I>buildings too, notably 
Holyrood Palace and the castles of Hermitage and Glamis. It is the ghost of the 
murdered Rizzio which frequents Holyrood, yet it should be added that the vision 
is seldom seen nowadays; and mayhap the fates, aware that the Italian minstrel 
was shamefully treated, have at length accorded his soul a resting-place more 
cosy than the dismal Edinburgh Palace. But the ghost of Hermitage, on the 
contrary, is still considerably addicted to exercise, and in truth his Story 
marks him as having been a man of rare activity and ambition. Lord Soulis was 
his name, and, possibly after hearing of Faustus' exploits, he vowed that he too 
would exorcise the devil, who generously made his appearance betimes. &quot;Vast 
power will be yours on earth,&quot; said the evil one to Soulis &quot;if you 
will but barter your soul therefor&quot; ; so his lordship signed the requisite 
compact with his life's blood, and thenceforth his days were given over to the 
enjoyment of every conceivable pleasure. Anon, however, he felt that his end was 
near, and calling some of his vassals around him he told them of the awful fate 
awaiting him after death. Thunderstruck they were, but soon after Soulis was 
gone it occurred to them that, could they but destroy his mortal remains 
completely, they might save his soul from the clutches of Beelzebub. So having 
sheathed the corpse in lead they flung it into a burning fiery furnace, and 
manifestly this cremation saved his lordship from the nether regions, for had he 
gone there his soul would not have been active still at Hermitage.</P>
<P>The ghost-story associated with Glamis Castle, the family seat of the Earl of 
Strathmore, is quite different from the rank and file of supernatural tales, and 
bears a more naked semblance of veracity than pertains to any of these. It is a 
matter of common knowledge that there is a secret chamber at Glamis, a chamber 
which enshrines a mystery known only to a few members of the Strathmore family, 
and three or four generations ago a lady, staying as a visitor at Glamis, vowed 
she would solve the riddle. Her first difficulty was to locate the actual room, 
but one afternoon, when all the rest of the household were going out, she 
feigned a headache and thus contrived to be left completely alone. Her next move 
was to go from room to room, putting a handkerchief in the window of each, and 
having done this she went outside and walked round the castle to see whether any 
room had evaded her search. Very soon she observed a window which had no 
handkerchief in it, so she hastened indoors again, thinking that her quest was 
about to be rewarded. But try as she might she could not find the missing room; 
and while she was searching the other guests returned to the house, along with 
them being the then Lord Strathmore. He was fiercely incensed on learning what 
had been going forward, and that night shrieks were heard in a long corridor in 
the castle. The guests ran out of their rooms to find out what was wrong, and in 
the dim light they perceived a curious creature with an inhuman head, wrestling 
with an aged manservant who eventually contrived to carry the monster away. 
There the story ends, but as remarked before it bears a semblance of truth, the 
probability being that some scion of the Glamis castle family was mad or 
hideously deformed, and was accordingly incarcerated in a room to which access 
was difficult and secret. And no doubt endless other ghost-stories rest on some 
basis of this sort, for, while the diverting practice of showing freaks in 
public is a comparatively new one, freaks themselves are among the world's most 
ancient institutions, perhaps almost as ancient as spectres and visions. It is 
impossible in this place to allude to the host of less famous haunted

<P>Hazel Tree :</B> The Hazel was dedicated to the god Thor, and, in the Roman 
Catholic Church, was esteemed a plant of great virtue for the cure of fevers. 
When used as a divining rod, the rod, if it were cut on St. John's Day or Good 
Friday, would be certain to be a successful instrument of divination. A hazel 
rod was a badge of authority, and it was probably this notion which caused it to 
be made use of by schoolmasters. Among the Romans, a <I>hazel </I>rod was also a 
symbol of authority.</P>

<P>Head of Baphomet : </B>An interesting discovery was made public in 
<B>1818</B> dealing with the history of secret societies. There was found, among 
the antiquities of the imperial museum of Vienna some of those idols named 
<I>heads of Baphomet, </I>which the Templars adored. These heads represent the 
divinity of the Gnostics, named Mete or Wisdom. For a long time there was 
preserved at Marseilles one of these gilded heads, seized in a retreat of the 
Templar when the latter were pursued by the law. <I>(See

<P>Healing by Touch :</B> In England and Scotland, and in France also, the idea 
that a touch of the royal hand was a sure remedy for scrofula was long 
prevalent, and consequently this complaint acquired betimes the now familiar 
name of king's evil.&quot; In France, so far as can be ascertained, this 
interesting practice dates from the reign of Louis IX., and in England from that 
of Edward III., who is recorded to have performed a considerable number of 
cures. He was wont to wash the affected part of the sufferer, but gradually the 
use of actual ablutions was discontinued, and most subsequent kings contented 
themselves with mere touching, while at the same time prayers were offered up on 
behalf of the patient. Anon the religious ceremony used on such occasions grew 
more elaborate, while, during the reign of Henry VII., a special &quot; king's 
evil&quot; petition was drawn up by a body of divines for insertion in the 
Service Book, and there it prevailed for a surprisingly long time thereafter, 
being found in some editions printed as late as the beginning of the eighteenth 
century.</P>
<P>The idea that kings ruled by divine right emanated mainly from Scotland, and 
so it is natural to assume that the early inhabitants of that land regarded 
their sovereigns as capable of miracles. There is little or no evidence, 
nevertheless, that the Stuarts, prior to the Union of the Crowns, practised 
touching for king's evil ; but scarcely was Charles I. on the British throne ere 
he began to demonstrate his powers herein, and scrofulous persons flocked from 
far and near accordingly. Indeed, they came in such numbers, that early in the 
fifth year of his reign, Charles found it essential to specify certain times for 
their reception at court, and the proclamation which he issued on the subject 
may be read in the <I>Historical Collections </I>of John Rushworth, sometime 
secretary to Oliver Cromwell. Here it is stated that, in the future, those who 
wish to benefit from the king's thaumaturgic gift will be welcomed at Michaelmas 
or Easter, but it is clear that his Majesty saw fit to make exceptions to this 
rule, for, during his visit to Edinburgh in <B>1633</B>, he ministered to 
numerous unfortunates in the month of June. It was at Holyrood that he received 
them, the palace being transformed <I>pro tempore </I>into a veritable Lourdes, 
and Sir James Balfour, the Historian, who was knighted at this time, and created 
Lyon King-at-Arms, affirms in an unpublished manuscript, still extant in the 
Advocates Library, Edinburgh, that Charles successfully &quot;heallit <B>100</B> 
persons of the cruelles or kingis aivell, yong and olde.&quot;</P>
<P>Reverting to the proclamation cited above, therein the king speaks at length 
of the many cures wrought by his &quot;royal predecessors.&quot; Now this, of 
course, may allude purely to the Plantagenets or Tudors, but it is equally 
possible that these references indicate touching for scrofula on the part of the 
early Stuarts, and be that as it may, Charles I. was not the only member of that 
dynasty who essayed the act. John Evelyn, in his <I>Diary, </I>writes repeatedly 
of Charles the Second's activities in this relation, while Samuel Pepys refers 
to the same thing, and in one passage he says the sight failed to interest him 
in the least, for he had seen it often before. Clearly, then, quite a host of 
the Merry Monarch's subjects were &quot; heallit&quot; by the royal <I>touch, 
</I>nor did the practice end with the ousting of the Stuarts in <B>1689</B>. The 
Chevalier de St. George essayed it on several occasions, and his son Prince 
Charles, when in Scotland in <B>1745</B>, made at least one attempt, though 
whether with success or not is unrecorded.</P>
<P>In the infancy of the world, and during a time when these laws of nature ware 
but partially known and understood by man, it was most natural that these 
inexplicable powers should be directly ascribed to a divine influence. Healing 
of the sick was supposed to proceed alone from God, or through the priest' and 
saints His servants. Faith was therefore necessary to the cure, and the magical 
powers were therefore transferred by words, prayers, and ceremonies, and the 
science was transmitted among the mysteries. <I>Healing </I>by <I>touch, </I>by 
laying on of hands, and by the breath, belonged to this secret influence; also 
the use of talismans and amulets, which were composed of organic as well as 
inorganic substances,-minerals, stones, and plants; the wearing of rings, of 
images of saints, and other symbolical objects ; lastly, <I>heeling </I>the sick 
by words and prayers.</P>
<P>As regards the semblance which this science hears to magnetism. it is certain 
that not only were the ancients acquainted with an artificial method of treating 
disease but also with somnambulism itself. Among others, Agrippa von Nettesheim 
speaks of this plainly when he says, in his <I>Occulta philosophia, </I>p. 
<B>45</B> :-&quot; There is a science, known but to very few, of illuminating 
and instructing the mind, so that at one step it is raised from the darkness of 
ignorance to the light of wisdom. This is produced principally by a species of 
artificial sleep, in which a man forgets the present, and, as it were, perceives 
the future through the divine inspiration. Unbelieving wicked persons can also 
be deprived of this power by secret means.&quot;</P>
<P>The <I>healing </I>of the sick by the <I>touch </I>and the laying on of hands 
is to be found among primitive peoples, the Indians, the Egyptians, and 
especially among the Jews. In Egypt sculptures have been found where one hand of 
the operator is placed on the stomach and the other on the back. Even the 
Chinese, according to the accounts of the early missionaries (Athan. Kircher, 
<I>China Illustrata), </I>healed sickness by the laying on of hands. In the Old 
Testament we find numerous examples, of which we shall extract a few.</P>
<P>When Moses found his end approaching, he prayed for a worthy successor, and 
we find the following passage (Numbers, xxvii., <B>18</B>, <B>20</B>) :-&quot; 
And the Lord said unto Moses, Take thee Joshua, the son of Nun, a man in whom is 
the spirit, and lay thine hand upon him, &quot;And thou shalt put some of thine 
honour upon him, that all the congregation of the children of Israel may be 
obedient.&quot;</P>
<P>Another instance is to be found in the <I>healing </I>the seemingly dead 
child by Elisha, who stretched himself three times upon the child, and called 
upon the Lord. The manner in which Elisha raised the dead son of the Shunamite 
woman is still more remarkable. He caused Gehazi to proceed before him to lay 
his staff upon the face of the child. As this was of no avail, Elisha went up 
into the room, and laid himself upon the child, etc., and his hands upon the 
child's hands, so that the child's body became warm again. After that the child 
opened his eyes. Elisha's powers even survived his death. &quot;And Elisha died, 
and they buried him; and the bands of the Moabi tee invaded the land in the 
coming of the year. And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that, 
behold, they spied a band of men; and they cast the man into the sepulchre of 
Elisha; and when the man was let down, and touched the bones of Elisha, he 
revived and stood upon his feet.&quot; </P>
<P>(<B>2</B> Kings, xiii., <B>20</B>, <B>21</B>). Naaman the leper, when he 
stood before Elisha's house with his horses and chariots, and had been told to 
wash seven times in the Jordan, said, Behold I thought, he will surely come out 
to me, and stand, and call upon the name of the Lord his God, and strike his 
band over the place, and recover the leper.&quot; (<B>2</B> Kings, v. 
<B>4</B>).</P>
<P>The New Testament is particularly rich in examples of the efficacy of laying 
on of the hands. &quot;Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given 
thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.&quot; (i 
Timothy, iv., '<B>4</B>), is the principal maxim of the Apostles, for the 
practical use of their powers for the good of their brethren in Christ. In St. 
Mark we find (xvi., <B>18</B>) :-&quot; They shall lay hands on the sick and 
they shall recover.&quot; St. Paul was remarkable for his powers: &quot;And it 
came to pass that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody 
flux; to whom Paul entered in, and prayed and laid his hands on him and healed 
him.&quot; (Acts, xxviii., <B>8</B>). &quot;And Ananias went his way, and 
entered into the house, and putting his hands on him, said, Brother Saul, the 
Lord, even Jesus that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest, hath sent me 
that thou mayest receive thy sight and be filled with the Holy Ghost. And 
immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales, and he received 
sight.&quot; (Acts, ix., <B>17</B>, <B>18</B>). In St. Mark we find &quot;And 
they brought young children to him, that he might <I>touch </I>them; and his 
disciples rebuked those who brought them. But Jesus said, ' Suffer the little 
children to come unto me, for of such is the kingdom of heaven.' And he took 
them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and blessed them.&quot; ' And they 
bring unto him one that was deaf and had an impediment in his speech, and they 
besought him to put his hand upon him. And he took him aside from the multitude, 
and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit and touched his tongue; and, 
looking up to heaven, he sighed, and said unto him, 'Ephphatha,'-that is' Be 
opened. And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was 
loosed, and he spake plain.&quot; (Mark, vii., <B>33</B>).</P>
<P>Other passages may be met with in Matth. ix., <B>18</B>; Mark v., <B>23</B> ; 
vi., <B>5</B> ; viii., <B>22</B> ; x., <B>13</B> ; xvi., <B>18</B>; Luke v., 
<B>53</B> ; xviii., <B>15</B> ; John ix., <B>17</B> ; Acts ix., <B>17</B>, etc., 
etc. In the histories of the saints, innumerable examples are recorded, and the 
command, &quot;In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new 
tongues; they shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing it 
shall not hurt them; they shall lay their hands on the sick and they shall 
recover,&quot; applies to all true followers of Christ. Those, however, who are 
wanting in the power of the spirit and in faith cannot perform these acts like 
the saints, on whom they cast doubts because they cannot imitate them.</P>
<P>The Saints accomplished everything through faith in Christ, and therefore 
were able to perform such miracles. We shall make mention of a few of the most 
remarkable accounts. St. Patrick, the Irish apostle, healed the blind by laying 
on his hands. St. Bernard is said to have restored eleven blind persons to 
sight, and eighteen lame persons to the use of their lambs, in one day at 
Constance. At Cologne he healed twelve lame, caused three dumb persons to speak, 
ten who were deaf to hear; and, when he himself was ill, St. Lawrence and St. 
Benedict appeared to him, and cured him by touching the affected part. Even his 
plates and dishes are said to have cured sickness after his death. The miracles 
of SS. Margaret, Katherine, Elizabeth, Hildegarde, and especially the miraculous 
cures of the two holy martyrs Cosmas and Damianus, belong to this class. Among 
others, they freed the Emperor Justinian from an incurable sickness. St. Odilia 
embraced a leper, who was shunned by all men, in her arms, warmed him, and 
restored him to health.</P>
<P>Remarkable above all others are those cases where persons who were at the 
point of death have recovered by holy baptism or extreme unction. The Emperor 
Constantine is one of the most singular examples. Pyrrhus, king of Epirus, had 
the power of assuaging colic and affections of the spleen by laying the patients 
on their backs and passing his great toe over them. (Plutarch. Vita Pyrrhi: 
Digitum maximum pedis divinitatem habuisse adeo quod igne non potuit 
comburi.&quot;) The Emperor Vespasian cured nervous affections, lameness, and 
blindness, solely by the laying on of his hands (Suelin, Vita Vespas). According 
to Coelius Spartianus, Hadrian cured those afflicted with dropsy by touching 
them with the points of his fingers, and recovered himself from a violent fever 
by similar treatment. King Olaf healed Egill on the spot by merely laying his 
hands upon him and singing proverbs <I>(Edda, </I>p, <B>216</B>). The kings of 
England and France cured diseases of the throat by <I>touch. </I>ft is said that 
the pious Edward the Confessor, and in France that Philip the First, were the 
first who possessed this power. The formula used on such occasions was, &quot;Le 
roi te touche, allez at guerissez; &quot; so that the word was connected with 
the act of touching. In England the disease was therefore called King's 
Evil.&quot; In France this power was retained until the time of the Revolution, 
and it is said that at the coronation the exact manner of touching, and the 
formula-&quot; Le roi te touche, dieu te guerisse &quot;-were imparted to the 
monarch. In the reign of Louis XIII. the Duke d'Epernon is said to have 
exclaimed, when Richelieu was made generalissimo against the Spaniards, ' What ! 
has the king nothing left but the power of healing wens ?</P>
<P>Among German princes this curative power was ascribed to the Counts of 
Hapsburg, and also that they were able to cure stammering by a kiss. Pliny says, 
' There are men whose whole bodies possess medicinal properties,-as the Marsi, 
the Psyli, and others, who cure the bite of serpents merely by the touch.&quot; 
This he remarks especially of the Island of Cyprus; and later travellers confirm 
these cures by the touch. In later times, the Salmadores and Ensalmadores of 
Spain became very celebrated, who healed almost all diseases by prayer, laying 
on of hands, and by breathing. In Ireland, Valentine Greatrakes (q.v.) cured at 
first &quot; king's evil&quot; by touch. In the seventeenth century, the 
gardener Levret and the notorious Streeper performed cures in London by stroking 
with the hand. In similar manner cures were performed by Michael Medina, and the 
Child of Salamanca; also Marcellus Empiricus (Sprengel, Gesch. der Med. Part 
<B>2</B>, p. <B>179</B>). Richter, an innkeeper at Royan, in Silicia, cured, in 
the years <B>1817</B>-<B>18</B>, many thousands of sick persons in the open 
fields, by touching them with his hands. Under the Popes, laying on of hands was 
called Chirothasy. Diapenbroek wrote two treatises on it, and, according to 
Lampe, four-and-thirty Chirothetists ware declared to be holy. Mesmer (q.v.) and 
his assistants also employed manipulations largely.</P>

which were coming to life in Jotunheim, it was deemed advisable by All-father 
that they should be brought before him. Hela was cast into Niflheim, to which 
are sent all those who die of sickness or old age. She governs this world, which 
is composed of nine regions, into which she distributes those who coma to her; 
and in which she inhabits a strongly-protected abode. Niflheim is said to be 
&quot; a dark abode far from the sun&quot; its gates open to the ' cutting 
north&quot; : &quot;its walls are formed of wreathed snakes and their venom is 
ever falling like rain&quot; ; and it is surrounded by dark and poisonous 
streams. &quot;Nidhog, the great dragon, who dwells beneath the central root of 
Ygdrassil, torments and gnaws the dead.&quot; It is said that one-half of Hela's 
body is livid, and the other half flesh-coloured. Hunger is her table; 
Starvation, her knife; Delay, her man; Slowness, her maid; Precipice, her 
threshold; Care, her bed; and Burning Anguish forms the hangings of her 
apartments.</P>

<P>Hellotrope :</B> Said to render its possessor invisible if it be rubbed over 
with the juice of the herb of the same name; stops bleeding, and averts danger 
from poison.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Hell :</B> The derivation of this word is probably from the root <I>helen 
</I>to cover, designating a subterranean or hidden place. In Ward's <I>Mythology 
</I>we find it in the form of <I>Hel </I>as a &quot;place of the dead&quot; 
alone, by no means a place of punishment. The conception of such has a more or 
less clear train of evolution behind it. The Christian idea of a place of 
punishment was directly coloured by the Jewish conception of <I>Sheol, </I>which 
in turn took shape from Babylonian sources. When exactly the idea began to form 
itself as a place of punishment is not clear, as among the ancient Semites, 
Egyptians and Greeks, we find the under-world regarded as a place of the dead 
alone. Thus in Egypt we find Amenti distinctly a place of the dead, in which the 
tasks of life are for the most part duplicated. This is the case also among 
barbarian people, who merely regard the land of the dead as an extension of 
human existence, in which man led a more or less shadowy life. The savage does 
not believe in punishment after death, and conceives that any breach of moral 
rule is summarily dealt with in this life. It is only when a higher moral code 
emerges from totemic or similar rule that the idea of a place of punishment is 
invented by priest-craft. This is, however, not always the case: in Greece, Rome 
and Scandinavia, we find that Hades was merely looked upon as a place of the 
dead, where, like shadowy ghosts, mankind flit to and fro, gibbering and 
squeaking as phantoms are supposed to do. According to the Greeks, Hades was 
only some twelve feet under the surface of the ground, so that Orpheus would 
have had no vary long journey from the subterranean spheres to reach earth once 
more. <I>Hell </I>is generally regarded as a sovereignty, a place definitely 
ruled in an ordinary manner by a monarch set there for the purpose by the 
celestial powers. Thus the Greek Hades ruled the Sad Sphere of the Dead; Osiris 
was lord and governor of the Egyptian Amenti; in Central America, we find twin 
rulers in the Kiche Hades, Xibalba, whose names are given as Hun-came and 
Vukub-came. These latter are actively malignant, unlike the Mictlan of the 
Mexican, whose empire was for the generality of the people. These could only 
exist there for the space of four years, after which they finally became 
entirely extinct. The Mexicans represent Mictlan as a huge monster with open 
mouth ready to devour his victims, and this we find paralelled in the Babylonian 
Tiawith. We thus see that at a certain stage in all mythologies, the conception 
of a place of the dead was confounded with the idea of a place of punishment. 
The Greeks generally bewailed the sad end of humanity which was condemned for 
ever to dwell in semi-darkness after death. The possibility of the existence of 
a place of reward never seemed to appeal to them. To the vivid Greek mind life 
was all in all, and it was left to the finer and altogether more upright Semitic 
conscience to evolve in the near East the conception of a place of punishment. 
Thus Sheol, from being regarded as a place of the dead became the home of fire, 
into which the wicked and unjust were thrust for their sins. This was certainly 
foreshadowed by Babylonian and Egyptian ideals, for we find the Egyptian unable 
to pass the test of justification simply rejected from the idea of rejection 
would soon spring the idea of active punishment. The Semitic conception of 
<I>Hell </I>was probably reinforced on the introduction of Christianity into 
Europe, and coloured by the conception of the places of the dead belonging to 
the other mythologies of Europe. Thus the Scandinavian idea, which was also that 
of our Saxon forefathers, undoubtedly coloured the English conception of the 
place of punishment.</P>
<P>&quot;'Hela,' or Death,' in the prose <I>Edda, </I>is one of the offspring of 
Loki and the giantess Angurbodi ; their other two being the wolf Fenrir and the 
Midgard serpent. The gods were not long ignorant that these monsters continued 
to be bred up in Jotunheim, and having had recourse to divination, became aware 
of all the evils they would have to suffer from them ; their being sprung from 
such a mother <I>was </I>a bad presage, and from such a sire one still worse. 
All-father therefore deemed it advisable to send one of the gods to bring them 
to him. When they came he threw the serpent into that deep ocean by which the 
earth is encircled. But the monster has grown to such an enormous size that, 
holding his tail in his mouth he encircles the whole earth. &lsquo;Hela&rsquo; 
he cast into Niflheim, and gave her power over nine worlds (regions), into which 
she distributes those who are sent to her, that is to say, all who die through 
sickness or old age. Here she possesses a habitation protected by exceedingly 
high walls and strongly barred gates. Her hall is called Elvidner; Hunger is her 
table; Starvation, her knife; Delay, her man ; Slowness, her maid ; Precipice, 
her threshold ; Care, her bed ; and Burning Anguish forms the hangings of her 
apartments. The one half of her body is livid, the other half the colour of 
human flesh.' A description of Niflheim itself, the abode of Loki and his evil 
progeny, in given in the <I>Voluspa. </I>It is a dark abode far from the sun' ; 
its gates are open to &lsquo;the cutting north' ; its walls are formed of 
wreathed snakes and their venom is ever falling like rain.' It is surrounded by 
the dark and poisonous streams &lsquo;Elivagar.&rsquo; Nidhog, great dragon, who 
dwells beneath the central root of Ygdrassil, torments and gnaws the 
dead.&quot;</P>
<P>The probabilities are that the ideas concerning the Celtic other-world had 
little to do in forming the British conception of Hell. Tile Brythonic 
&quot;Annwyl&quot; was certainly a subterranean locality, but it was by no means 
a place of punishment, being merely a microcosm of the world above, where folk 
hunted, ate and drank, as in early Britain. Nor was the Irish other-world much 
different and after crossing the waters of oblivion the possessed person found 
himself in a sphere in many ways resembling the earth-life.</P>
<P>In southern Europe again the idea of <I>Hell </I>appears to have been 
strongly coloured <I>by </I>both classical and Jewisih conceptions. Our best 
picture of the medieval conception of the place of punishment is undoubtedly the 
Inferno of Dante, who in most things followed the teaching of contemporary 
schoolmen in describing it. Acknowledging Virgil as his master, he follows him 
in many descriptions of Tartarus; but we find the Semitic idea cropping up every 
here and there, as in the beginning of one of the cantos, where, what looks 
suspiciously like a Hebrew incantation, is set down. The <I>dramatis personae 
</I>are classical; thus we have Pluto and many of the breed of Tartarus. In 
later medieval times the ingenuity of the monkish mind came to the rescue and 
conceptions which in some instances appear to be perfectly original sprang up. 
Thus, <I>Hell </I>obtained an annexe, Purgatory. its inhabitants took on a form 
which may distinctively be alluded to as European, in contradistinction to the 
more satyr-like shape of the earlier hierarchy of Hades. We find grizzly forms 
of bird-like shape, with exaggerated beaks and claws, and the animal forms and 
faces of later medieval gargoyles give us a capital idea of what the denizens of 
Hades seemed like in the eyes of the superstition of the sixteenth and 
seventeenth centuries. It was only a modified version of these ideas which came 
down to our grandfathers, and one may suspect that such superstition, were not 
altogether disbelieved by our fathers. This is not the place to embark upon a 
theological discussion as to whether the <I>Hell </I>of the Christians exists, 
or does not exist ; but it may be interesting to remark that a great controversy 
has raged ever since the time of Origen as to the question whether or not the 
punishments of <I>Hell </I>are eternal. Those who denied that this was so were 
called Universalists, and believed in the final redemption of all. Enough has 
been said to show that most Eastern mythological systems possess a Hades which 
does not differ in any fundamental respect from that of most barbarian races, 
except that it is perhaps rather more specialised and involved. Many later 
writers, sceli as Swedenborg, Boehme, Blake and others (not to forget Milton), 
have given us vivid pictures of the hierarchy and general condition of <I>Hell. 
</I>For the most part these are based on the patristic writings. In the Middle 
Ages endless controversy took place as to the nature and offices of the various 
inhabitants of the place of punishment <I>(See </I>Demonology), and the 
descriptions of later visionaries are practically mere repetitions of the

<P>Helmont, John Baptista van :</B> must be ranked as one of the pioneers of 
science by reason Of his experimental researches. his acute judgment, his 
penetrating attitude of mind leading him to say Names do not trouble me, I 
contemplate the thing in itself as near as I can,&quot; and his untiring search 
for tile truth, not for personal aggrandizement or power, but in the service of 
progress and for the good of mankind. He was born of a noble family in the year 
<B>1557</B> at Bois-le-Duc in Brabant. Studying at Louvain, he early attained 
distinction in the science of mathematics, lecturing on physics at the age of 
seventeen. Before he was twenty-two he had read Hippocrates and the Greek and 
Arabian authors and become eminent in the doctrines of Aristotle and Galen and 
the practice of medicine according to Vopiscus and Plempius. In the year 
<B>1599</B> he took his degree of doctor of medicine. After this some years were 
spent in the practice of physic, but meeting a follower of Paracelsus he became 
interested in his theories of chemical medicine to such a degree that he retired 
to the castle of Vilvord, near Brussels, to spend the rest of his life in the 
study of experimental chemistry on which he wrote various treatises, becoming 
famous throughout Europe for his scientific knowledge. He revolutionized 
medicine as known in his day, turning aside from the theories of Galen and the 
Arabs, and created an epoch in the history of physiology, being the first to 
recognize the functions of the stomach and its relation to the other organs of 
the body. His many and varied experiments led him to deal with aerial fluids, to 
which he gave the name of gas-carbonic acid gas being his discovery -and it is 
said that without him the chemistry of steel in all probability would have been 
unknown to science.</P>
<P>The writings of <I>van Helmont </I>contain many truths, foreshadowings of 
ideas and principles now accepted as indispensable commonplaces, though these 
almost of necessity are hidden under much of the incomprehensible beliefs and 
illusions prevalent in his time. Alchemy, with ifs visions of the Elixir of Life 
and the Philosopher's Stone represented to him another field for experiment and 
research and though he never pretended to the art of making the transmuting 
powder, he testified his belief in the transmutation of metals, having seen the 
experiment performed many times. Among other things he became a firm believer in 
Mineral and Human Magnetism, anticipating Mesmer in almost the very terms of the 
later exponent of the theory and basing his argument on the well-known facts of 
the sympathy or antagonism spontaneously arising between individuals and the 
influence exerted by a firm will over a weak imagination. To the last he 
declined to leave his retirement, though his fame brought him flattering 
invitations and offers from the Emperor and Elector Palatine. Almost unknown to 
his neighbours he yet attended any stricken by illness without accepting any 
fees for his services. He lived to the age of sixty-seven, dying at his castle 
of Vilvord in <B>1624</B>.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Helvetius, John Frederick :</B> A physician of the Hague who in <B>1667</B> 
published a work concerning a strange adventure of his life in which he claimed 
to have taken part in a veritable act of metallic transmutation by alchemical 
processes. The book was translated into English and published at London 
<B>1670</B> under the title <I>Of a Transmutation. </I>As it is one of the few 
exact descriptions of such an experiment, it has been thought well to append the 
passage recounting it in full, as follows:-</P>
<P>&quot;On the <B>27</B>th December, <B>1666</B>, in the afternoon, a stranger, 
in a plain, rustic dress, came to my house at the Hague. His manner of address 
was honest, grave authortative; his stature was low, with a long face and hair 
black, his chin smooth. He seemed like a native of the north of Scotland, and I 
guessed he was about forty-four years old. After saluting me he requested me 
most respectfully to pardon his rude intrusion, but that his love of the 
pyrotechnic art made him visit me. Having read some of my small treatises, 
particularly that against the sympathetic powder of Sir Kenelm Digby and 
observed therein my doubt of the Hermetic mystery, it caused him to request this 
interview. He asked me if I still thought there was no medicine in Nature which 
could cure all diseases, unless the principal parts, as the lungs, liver, etc. 
were perished, or the time of death were come. To which I replied I never met 
with an adept, or saw such a medicine, though I read of much of it and often 
wished for it. Then I asked if he was a physician. He said he was a founder of 
brass, yet from his youth learned many rare things in chemistry, particularly of 
a friend-the manner to extract out of metals many medicinal arcana by the use of 
fire. After discoursing of experiments in metals, he asked me, would I know the 
philosophers' stone if I saw it? I answered, I would not, though I read much of 
it in Paracelsus, Helmont, Basil, and others, yet I dare not say I could know 
the philosophers' matter. In the interim he drew from his breast pocket a neat 
ivory box, and out of it took three ponderous lumps of the stone, each about the 
size of a small walnut. They were transparent and of a pale brimstone colour, 
whereto some scales of the crucible adhered when this most noble substance was 
melted. The value of it I since calculated was twenty tons weight of gold. When 
I had greedily examined and handled the stone almost a quarter of an hour, and 
heard from the owner many rare secrets of its admirable effects in human and 
metallic bodies, also its other wonderful properties, I returned him this 
treasure of treasures, truly with a most sorrowful mind, like those who conquer 
themselves, yet, as was just, very thankfully and humbly. I further desired to 
know why the colour was yellow, and not red, ruby colour, or purple, as the 
philosophers write. He answered that was nothing, for the matter was mature and 
ripe enough. Then I humbly requested him to bestow a little piece of the 
medicine on me, in perpetual memory of him, though but of the size of a 
coriander or hemp seed. He presently answered, Oh no, this is not lawful, though 
thou wouldst give me as many ducats in gold as would fill this room, not for the 
value of the metal, but for some particular consequences. Nay, if it were 
possible,&quot; said he, &quot;that fire could be burnt by fire, I would rather 
at this instant cast all this substance into the fiercest flames.&quot; He then 
demanded if I had a more private chamber, as this was seen from the public 
street. I presently conducted him into the best furnished room backward, not 
doubting but he would bestow part thereof or some great treasure on me. He 
entered without wiping his shoes, although they were full of snow and dirt. He 
asked me for a little piece of gold, and, pulling off his cloak, opened his 
vest, under which he had five pieces of gold. They were hanging to a green silk 
ribbon, and were of the size of breakfast plates. This gold so far excelled mine 
that there was no comparison for flexibility and colour. The inscriptions 
engraven upon them he granted me to write out; they were pious thanksgivings to 
God, dated <B>20</B>th August, <B>1666</B>, with the characters of the Sun, 
Mercury, the Moon, and the signs of Leo and Libra.</P>
<P>&quot;I was in great admiration, and desired to know where and how he 
obtained them. He answered, &quot;A foreigner, who dwelt some days in my house, 
said he was a lover of this science, and came to reveal it to me. He taught me 
various arts-first, of ordinary stones and chrystals, to make rubies, 
chrysolites, sapphires, etc., much more valuable than those of the mine; and how 
in a quarter of an hour to make oxide of iron, one dose of which would 
infallibly cure the pestilential dysentery, or bloody flux; also how to make a 
metallic liquor to cure all kinds of dropsies, most certainly and in four days; 
as also a limpid, clear water, sweeter than honey, by which in two hours of 
itself, in hot sand, it would extract the tincture of garnets, corals, glasses, 
and such like.&quot; He said more, which I <I>Helvetius, </I>did not observe, my 
mind being occupied to understand how a noble juice could be drawn out of 
minerals to transmute metals. He told me his said master caused him to bring a 
glass of rain-water, and to put some silver leaf into it, which was dissolved 
therein within a quarter of an hour, like ice when heated. &quot;Presently he 
drank to me the half, and I pledged him the other half, which had not so much 
taste as sweet milk, but whereby, methought, I became very light-headed. I 
thereupon asked if this were a philosophical drink, and wherefore we drank this 
potion; but he replied, I ought not to be so curious.&quot; By the said master's 
directions, a piece of a leaden pipe being melted, he took a little sulphureous 
powder out of his pocket, put a little of it on the point of a knife into the 
melted lead, and after a great blast of the bellow's, in a short time he poured 
it on the red stones of the kitchen chimney. It proved most excellent pure gold, 
which the stranger said brought him into such trembling amazement that he could 
hardly speak; but his master encouraged him saying, &quot;Cut for thyself the 
sixteenth part of this as a memorial and give the rest away among the 
poor,&quot; which the stranger did, distributing this alms, as he affirmed if my 
memory fail not, at the Church of Sparenda. &quot;At last,&quot; said he, ' the 
generous foreigner taught me thoroughly this divine art.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;As soon as his relation was finished, I asked my visitor to show me the 
effect of transmutation and so confirm my faith; but he declined it for that 
time in such a discreet manner that I was satisfied, he promising to come again 
in three weeks, to show me some curious arts in the fire, provided it were then 
lawful without prohibition. At the three weeks end he came, and invited me 
abroad for an hour or too. In our walk we discoursed of Nature's secrets, but he 
was very silent on the subject of the great elixir gravely asserted that it was 
only to magnify the sweet fame and mercy of the most glorious God; that few men 
endeavoured to serve Him, and this he expressed as a pastor or minister of a 
church; but I recalled his attention, entreating him to show' me the metallic 
mystery, desiring also that he would eat, drink, and lodge at my house, which I 
pressed, but he was of so fixed a determination that all my endeavours were 
frustrated. I could not forbear to tell him that I had a laboratory ready for an 
experiment, and that a promised favour was a kind of debt.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, true,&quot; said he, &quot; but I promised to teach thee at my 
return, with this proviso, if it wore not forbidden.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;When I perceived that all this was in vain, I earnestly requested a 
small crumb of his powder, sufficient to transmute a few grains of lead to gold, 
and at last, out of his philosophical commiseration, he gave me as much as a 
turnip seed in size, saying, &quot; Receive this small parcel of the greatest 
treasure of the world, which truly few kings or princes have ever seen or 
known.&quot; &quot;But,&quot; I said, this perhaps will not transmute four 
grains of lead,&quot; whereupon he bid me deliver it back to him, which, in 
hopes of a greater parcel, I did, but he, cutting half off with his nail, flung 
it into the fire, and gave me the rest wrapped neatly up in blue paper, saying, 
&quot;It is yet sufficient for thee.&quot; I answered him, indeed with a most 
dejected countenance, &quot; Sir, what means this ? The other being too little, 
you give me now less.&quot; He told me to put into the crucible half an ounce of 
lead, for there ought to be no more lead put in than the medicine can transmute. 
I gave him great thanks for my diminished treasure, concentrated truly in the 
superlative degree, and put it charily up into my little box, saying I meant to 
try it the next day, nor would I reveal it to any. 'Not so, not so,' said he, 
'for we ought to divulge all things to the children of art which may tend alone 
to the honour of God, that so they may live in the theosophical truth.' I now 
made a confession to him, that while the mass of his medicine was in my hands, I 
endeavoured to scrape away a little of it with my nail, and could not forbear; 
but scratched off so very little, that, it being picked from my nail, wrapped in 
a paper, and projected on melted lead, I found no transmutation, but almost the 
whole mass sublimed, while the remainder was a glassy earth, At this unexpected 
account he immediately said, &quot; You are more dexterous to commit theft than 
to apply the medicine, for if you had only wrapped up the stolen prey in yellow 
wax, to preserve it from the fumes of the lead, it would have sunk to the 
bottom, and transmuted it to gold; but having cast it into the fumes, the 
violence of the vapour, partly by its sympathetic alliance, carried the medicine 
quite away.' I brought him the crucible, and he perceived a most beautiful 
saffron-like tincture sticking to the sides. He promise] to come next morning at 
nine o'clock, to show me that this tincture would transmute the lead into gold. 
Having taken his leave, I impatiently awaited his return, but the next day he 
came not, nor ever since. He sent an excuse at half-past nine that morning, and 
promised to come at three in the afternoon, but I never heard QI him since. I 
soon began to doubt the whole matter. Late that night my wife, who was a most 
curious student and inquirer after the art, came soliciting me to make an 
experiment of that little grain of the stone, to be assured of the truth. Unless 
this be done,' said she, ' I shall have no rest or sleep this night.' She being 
so earnest, I commanded a fire to be made, saying to myself, ' I fear, I fear 
indeed, this man bath deluded me.' My wife wrapped the said matter in wax, and I 
Cut half an ounce of lead, and put it into a crucible in the fire. Being melted, 
my wife put in the medicine, made into a small pill with the wax, which 
presently made a hissing noise, and in a quarter of an hour the mass of lead was 
totally transmuted into the best and finest gold, which amaxed us exceedingly. 
We could not sufficiently gaze upon this admirable and miraculous work of 
nature, for the melted lead, after projection, showed on the fire the rarest and 
most beautiful colours imaginable, settling in green, and when poured forth into 
an ingot, it had the lively fresh colour of blood. When cold it shined as the 
purest and most splendid gold. Truly all those who were standing about me were 
exceedingly startled, and I ran with this aurified lead, being yet hot, to the 
goldsmith, who wondered at the fineness, and after a short trial by the test, 
said it was the most excellent gold in the world.</P>
<P>&quot;The next day a rumour of this prodigy went about the Hague and' spread 
abroad, so that many illustrious and learned persons gave me their friendly 
visits for its sake. Amongst the rest, the general Assay-master, examiner of 
coins of this province of Holland, Mr. Porelius, who with others earnestly 
besought me to pass some part of the gold through all their customary trials, 
which I did, to gratify my own curiosity. We went to Mr. Brectel, a silversmith, 
who first mixed four parts of silver with one part of the gold, then he filled 
it, put <I>aquafortis </I>to it, dissolved the silver, and let the gold 
precipitate to the bottom; the solution being poured off and the calx of gold 
washed with water, then reduced and melted, it appeared excellent gold, and 
instead of a loss in weight, we found the gold was increased, and had transmuted 
a scruple of the silver into gold by its abounding tincture.</P>
<P>&quot;Doubting whether the silver was now sufficiently separated from the 
gold, we mingled it with seven parts of antimony, which we melted and poured out 
into a cone, and blew off the regulus on a test, where we missed eight grains of 
our gold; but after we blew away the red of the antimony, or superfluous 
<I>scoria, </I>we found nine grains of gold for our eight grains missing, yet it 
was pale and silver-like but recovered its full colour afterwards, so that in 
the best proof of fire we lost nothing at all of this gold, but gained, as 
aforesaid. These tests I repeated four times and found it still alike, and the 
silver remaining out of the <I>acquafortis </I>was of the very best flexible 
silver that could be, so that in the total the said medicine or elixir had 
transmuted six drams and two scruples of the lead and silver into most pure 
gold.&quot;</P>

<P>Hermes Trismegistus (&quot; the thrice greatest Hermes &quot;) :</B> The name 
given by the Greeks to the Egyptian god Thoth or Tehuti, the god of wisdom, 
learning and literature. Thoth is alluded to in later Egyptian writings as 
&quot; twice very great&quot; and even as &quot;five time. very great &quot; in 
some demotic or popular scripts. (ca. third century B.C.) To him was attributed 
as &quot; scribe of the gods&quot; the authorship of all sacred books which were 
ti' us called &quot; Hermetic&quot; by the Greeks. These, according to Clemens 
Alexandrinus were forty-five in number and were sub-divided into six portions, 
of which the first dealt with priestly education, the second with temple ritual 
and the third with geographical matter. The fourth division treated of 
astrology, the fifth of hymns in honour of the gods and a textbook for the 
guidance of Kings, while the sixth was medical. It is unlikely that these books 
were all the work of one individual, and it is more probable that they represent 
the accumulated wisdom of Egypt, attributed in the course of ages to the great 
god of wisdom.</P>
<P>As &quot;scribe of the gods&quot; Thoth was also the author of all strictly 
sacred writing. Hence by a convenient fiction the name of <I>Hermes </I>was 
placed at the head of an extensive cycle of mystic literature, produced in 
post-Christian times. Most of this Hermetic or Trismegistic literature has 
perished, but all that remains of it has been gathered and translated into 
English. It includes the &quot; Poimandres,&quot; the &quot; Perfect 
Sermon,&quot; or the &quot; Asclepius,&quot; excerpts by Stobacus, and fragments 
from the Church Fathers and from the philosophers, Zosimus and Fulgentius. 
Hitherto these writings have been neglected by theologians, who have dismissed 
them as the offspring of third century Neo-Platonism. According to the generally 
accepted view, they were eclectic compilations, combining Neo-Platonic 
philosophy, Philonic Judaism and Kabalistic theosophy in an attempt to supply a 
philosophic substitute for, Christianity. The many Christian elements to be 
found in these mystic scriptures were ascribed to plagiarism. By an examination 
of early mystery writings and traditions it has been proved with some degree of 
certainty that the main source of the Trismegistic Tractates is the wisdom of 
Egypt, and that they &quot;go back in an unbroken tradition of type and form and 
context to the earliest Ptolemaic times.&quot;</P>
<P>The &quot; Poimandres,&quot; on which all later <I>Trismegistic 
</I>literature is based, must, at least in its original form, be placed not 
later than the first century. The charge of plagiarism from Christian writings, 
therefore, falls to the ground. If it can be proved that the 
&quot;Poimandres&quot; belongs to the first century, we have in it a valuable 
document in determining the environment and development of Christian 
origins.</P>
<P>Mr. G. R. S. Mead, author of&quot; Thrice Greatest Hermes&quot; says in a 
illuminating passage:-</P>
<P>&quot;The more one studies the best of these mystical sermons, casting aside 
all prejudices, and trying to feel and think with the writers, the more one is 
conscious of approaching the threshold of what may well be believed to have been 
the true adytum of the best in the mystery traditions of antiquity. Innumerable 
are the hints of the greatnesses and immensities lying beyond that 
threshold-among other precious things the vision of the key to Egypt's wisdom, 
the interpretation of apocalypsis by the light of the sun-clear epopteia of the 
intelligible cosmos.&quot;</P>

<P>Heydon, John :</B> English Astrologer (fl.-<B>1667</B>). In his useful if not 
invaluable Lives of the Alchemystical Philosophers, Waite speaks with great 
scorn of the English Astrologer, <I>John Heydon, </I>describing him as no better 
than a charlatan, and for that reason furnishing no facts whatsoever concerning 
his career.</P>
<P>The astrologer appears to have been born in <B>1629</B>, his father being 
Francis Heydon, owner of a small estate called Sidmouth, in Devonshire. It was 
not in that romantic shire, however, that the astrologer first saw the light of 
day, but at a house in London boasting the pleasant name of Green Arbour and 
after some years spent here <I>Heydon </I>went to Worcestershire, when his 
education was attended to by various clergymen. Being a clever boy, his parents 
naturally desired to send him to the University, but this was soon rendered 
virtually impossible by the outbreak of the great civil war, and thereupon 
<I>Heydon </I>took arms on behalf of the king, and fought in several battles. He 
is said to have been successful as a soldier, and to have won to the captaincy 
of a troop of horse under Prince Rupert, but on the ultimate triumph of the 
Roundhead party, the young man found it advisable to leave England, and for some 
years he sojourned in various countries on the Continent, notably Spain and 
Turkey. Indeed, if his contemporaneous biographers are to be trusted, he 
penetrated so far afield as Zante, the island in the Levant whose praise has 
been sung so beautifully by Edgar Allan Poe; but by <B>1652</B> <I>Heydon 
</I>was back in his native England, and in <B>1655</B> we find him studying law 
and established in the Temple, a place almost sacred by virtue of its many 
literary associations. Nor was law his only study, for soon he was deep in that 
craft of astrology wherewith his name was destined to become associated, and on 
one occasion, having prophesied that Cromwell would shortly die by hanging, he 
was straightway imprisoned accordingly. So, at least, says Thomas Carte in his 
life of the great-Marquis of Ormonde, that storehouse of information concerning 
England in Stuart and Cromwellian days.</P>
<P>Those who take an interest in the history of medicine will doubtless recall 
Nicholas Culpeper, who, after fighting for the Parliament in the Civil war, 
devoted a wealth of energy to compiling elaborate treatises on astrology and 
pharmacopoeia, arts which went hand in hand in the seventeenth century. And it 
was the widow of this Culpeper whom <I>Heydon </I>took to wife, the year of 
their marriage being <B>1656</B>, while it would seem that a daughter was born 
of their union, for among the astrologers' writings is a volume entitled 
<I>Advice to a Daughter (<B>1</I>658</B>). Whether <I>Heydon </I>continued 
living in the Temple after his marriage is not recorded, nor do we hear that he 
even attended greatly to legal business, and it is likely, on the contrary that 
astrology occupied all his time, while it appears that that imprisonment already 
mentioned was not the only one he suffered. He became intimate with many of the 
great scientists of the Restoration, but quarrelled with a number of them too; 
while, though he always maintained that he was not actually affiliated with the 
Rosicrucians, it is a fact that he explained their theories publicly. Little is 
known about his later years, while the date of his death is unknown, and, before 
turning to the subject of his writings, it only behoves to state that his 
portrait was engraved by Thomas Cross.</P>
<P>Mr. Waite declares that <I>Heydon's </I>writings are sorry <I>pasliches, 
</I>and it cannot be questioned that the bulk of his work is derivative, Sir 
Thomas Browne being one whom he apes particularly. Nevertheless <I>Heydon 
</I>must be credited with considerable assiduity, and his Rosicrucian books 
alone are numerous, the best of them being probably <I>The New Method of 
Rosie-Crucian Physick </I>(<B>1658</B>), <I>The Rosie-Crucian Infallible 
Axiomater </I>(<B>1660</B>), <I>The Wise Man's Crown, </I>or <I>The Glory of the 
Rosie-Cross </I>(<B>1664</B>), and <I>The Rosie- Cross Uncovered (I 
</I><B>662</B>). In addition to them he was author of <I>Theomagia or The Temple 
of Wisdom </I>(<B>1664</B>), and <I>The Prophetic Trumpeter, sounding an Allarum 
to England </I>(<B>1655</B>), the latter being dedicated to Henry Cromwell, 
while according to Wood's <I>Athenae Oxonicsis, Heydon </I>was likewise the 
compiler of <I>A Rosiecrucian Theological Dictionary. </I>Yet another book from 
his pen was <I>Idea of the Law, </I>and at the end of this we find 
advertisements of several works of his, probably pamphlets, none of which is 
known to exist nowadays, but whose titles are worth recording here. One is 
called <I>The Familiar Spirit, </I>another <I>The Way to Converse with Angels, 
</I>while the others are <I>A New Method of Astrology, Of Scandalous Nativities, 
</I>and <I>Cabballa, or the Art by which Moses and Elijah did so many Miracles. 
</I>It is quite possible, of course, that these pamphlets were advertised while 
yet in course of preparation, and that the author was prevented from bringing 
them to a finish, but their titles are significant, showing how far <I>Heydon 
</I>waded into the sea of mysticism, and suggesting that he was really more 
erudite therein than Mr. Waite imagines.</P>

<P>Hobgoblin, Robin Goodfellow, or Puck :</B> An English domestic fairy or 
brownie of nocturnal habits. He is of a happy disposition, and is believed to be 
one of the courtiers, probably the jester, at the court of Oberon. Reginald 
Scot, in his <I>Discovery of Witchcraft </I>says :-&quot; Your grandames' maids 
were wont to set a bowl of milk for him for his pains in grinding of malt and 
mustard, and sweeping the house at midnight. This white bread, and bread and 
milk, was his standard fee.&quot; He is perhaps best known in Britain by his 
appellation of Puck, and his qualities and attributes are represented under this 
name in Shakespeare's Midsummer's Night's Dream.&quot; By some he is believed to 
be the demon who leads men astray during the night. Sometimes he is clothed in a 
suit of leather close to his body, and sometimes he wore green. He is usually 
represented as full of tricks and mischief.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Hocus Pocus :</B> Words of magical import, which by some are believed to be 
derived from Ochus Bochus&quot; a magician and demon of the north. It is perhaps 
more probable, however, that as others say they are a corruption of the Latin 
words &quot;hoc est corpus,&quot; and are an imitation of the act of 
transubstantiation practised by the priests of the Church of Rome.</P>

<P>Spiritualism.-Since </I>the introduction of spiritualism into <I>Holland , 
</I>in <B>1857</B>-<B>8</B>, no small part of its history has been enacted in 
that country, notwithstanding that the phlegmatic and by no means impressionable 
temperament of the Dutchman would seem to make but an indifferent medium of him. 
The first Dutch spiritualist of whom we have record is one J. N. T. Marthese, 
who, after studying psychic phenomena in foreign countries, finally returned to 
his native Holland, bringing with him the American medium Home. The latter held 
<I>seances </I>at the Hague, before several learned societies, and by command of 
Queen Sophia, a <I>seance </I>was given in her presence. The medium himself, in 
an account of the performance, tells us that the royal lady was obliged to sit 
out seven <I>seances, </I>on consecutive evenings, before any results were 
obtained. These results, however, were apparently satisfactory, for the Queen 
was thereafter a staunch supporter of the movement. During Home's visit, 
spiritualism gained a considerable hold on the people of <I>Holland, </I>and the 
practice of giving small private <I>seances </I>became fairly wide-spread. 
Spirit voices were heard at these gatherings, the touch of spirit hands was 
felt, and musical instruments were played upon by invisible performers. 
Particularly were these <I>seances </I>appreciated which were held at the house 
of Mr. T. D. Van Herwerden, in the Hague, and which were attended by many 
enthusiastic students of spiritualistic phenomena. His medium was, as a rule, a 
Japanese boy of his household, about fourteen years old, and very ignorant. The 
manifestations ranged from spirit rapping and table turning in the earlier 
<I>seances </I>to form materialisation in those of a later date. One of the 
principal spirits purported to be a monk, Paurellus, who had been assassinated 
some three hundred years previously in that city. Afterwards Mr. Van Herwerden 
was induced by his friends to publish his diary, under the title of 
<I>Experiences and Communications on a still Mysterious Territory. </I>For a 
time, as has been said, spiritualistic <I>seances </I>were only conducted in 
family circles, and were of a quite private nature. But as the attention of the 
intellectuals became more and more directed to the new science, societies were 
formed to promote research, and to throw light upon that which was obscure and 
perplexing. The first of these was the society called the &quot;Oromase,&quot; 
or Ormuzd, which was founded by Major J. Revius, a friend of Marthese, in 
<B>1859</B>, and which included among its numbers many people of high repute. 
They met at the Hague, and the records of their transactions were carefully 
preserved. Major Revius was president and continued to act in that capacity till 
<B>1871</B>, the year of his death. The society's secretary, A. J. Rita, was 
also a prominent worker in &quot; the cause.&quot; The &quot; 
&quot;Oromase&quot; library contained a fine collection of works on 
spiritualism, mesmerism, and kindred subjects, and included American, French, 
German and English hooks. Another society, the &quot;Veritas,&quot; was founded 
in Amsterdam in <B>1869</B>. The studies of this latter association were 
conducted in a somewhat less searching and scientific spirit than those of the 
Oromase.&quot; Its mediums specialized in trance utterances and written 
communications from the spirits, and its members inclined to a belief in 
re-incarnation, which was at variance with the opinions of the older society. 
Rotterdam had, for a time, a society with similar objects known as the ' 
Research after Truth,&quot; but it soon came to an end, though its members 
continued to devote themselves privately to the investigation of spirit 
phenomena. Other equally short-lived societies were formed in Haarlem and other 
towns. In all of these, however, there was a dearth of mediums able to produce 
form materializations, and to supply the want a number of foreign mediums 
hastened to Holland. Hitherto the comparatively private nature of the 
<I>seances, </I>and the high standing of those who took part in them, had 
prevented the periodicals from making any but the most cautious comments on the 
<I>seances. </I>But the advent of professional mediums on the scene swept away 
the barrier and let loose a flood of journalistic ridicule and criticism. This 
in turn provoked the supporters of spiritualism to retort, and soon a lively 
battle was in progress between the spiritualists and the sceptics. The 
con-sequence was, that &quot;the cause&quot; was boomed as much by the articles 
which derided it as by those which were in favour of it. Such mediums as Mrs. 
Margaret Fox Kane, the Davenport brothers, Rita, Home, Miss Cook, and Henry 
Slade, came over to <I>Holland. </I>Writers arose who were prepared to devote 
their abilities to the defence of spiritualism. Such an one was Madame Ruse van 
Calcar, who not only wrote a novel expounding spiritualistic principles, but 
also conducted a monthly journal &quot;On the Boundaries of Two Worlds,&quot; 
and held a sort of spiritualistic salon, where enthusiasts could meet and 
discuss their favourite subject. Dr. H. de Grood, Dr. J. Van Veizen, Dr. Van der 
Loef, Herr Schimmel, are among the other prominent Dutch authors who wielded 
their pens in defence of the same opinions. The writings of Professors Varley, 
Crookes, and Wallace were translated into the Dutch language, and lecturers 
helped to spread the belief in communication with the Other World. A mesmerist, 
Signor Donata, carried on the practice of &quot;Animal Magnetism&quot; in 
<I>Holland, </I>and endeavoured to identify the magnetic force emanating from 
the operator with the substance of which disembodied spirits are composed. Many 
exposures were made of unscrupulous mediums, and these, naturally, cast 
discredit upon the entire movement. But on the whole the mediums, professional 
or otherwise, were well received. Such phases of psychic phenomena as haunted 
houses and poltergeists are also very common, but are <B>50</B> similar to these 
manifestations in other countries that they require no separate treatment.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Holly :</B> This name is probably a corruption of the word &quot;holy&quot; 
as this plant has been used from time immemorial as a protection against evil 
influence. It was hung round, or planted near houses, as a protection against 
lightning. Its common use at Christmas is apparently the survival of an ancient 
Roman custom, occurring during the festival to Saturn, to which god the holly 
was dedicated. While the Romans were holding this feast, which occurred about 
the time of the winter solstice, they decked the outsides of their houses with 
<I>holly </I>at the same time the Christians were quietly celebrating the birth 
of Christ, and to avoid detection, they outwardly followed the custom of their 
heathen neighbours, and decked their houses with <I>holly </I>also. In this way 
the <I>holly </I>came to be connected with our Christmas customs. This plant was 
also regarded as a symbol of the resurrection. The use of mistletoe along with 
<I>holly </I>is probably due to the notion that in winter the fairies took 
shelter under its leaves, and that they protected all who sheltered the plant. 
The origin of kissing under the mistletoe is considered to have come from our 
Saxon ancestors, who regarded this plant as dedicated to Freya, the goddess of 
love.</P>

<P>Home, Daniel Dunglas (1833-1886) :</B> One of the best known of 
spiritualistic mediums, was born near Edinburgh in <B>1833</B>. At the age of 
nine he was taken by his aunt to America, where in <B>1850</B> he became a 
convert to the new doctrine of spiritualism and himself developed mediumistic 
powers. The next five years saw him occupied in giving seances in New York and 
elsewhere. In <B>1855</B> some of his friends subscribed a sum of money to send 
him to Europe. In England his seances were attended by many notable people, and 
on the Continent also be was admitted into the highest society. Until 
<B>1859</B> he had subsisted on the bounty of his wealthy friends-for at no time 
did he take actual fees for his services-but in that year he married a Russian 
lady of noble birth, young, charming, and possessed of means. But on her death 
in <B>1862</B> his financial circumstances were altered again. Four years later 
he was adopted by a wealthy widow, Mrs. Lyon, who made him large money gifts. In 
a few mouths, however, she tired of her adopted son and sued him in the law 
courts for the recovery of her &quot;gifts.&quot; The charge of fraud was not 
proved, and many distinguished persons filed affidavits testifying to the 
actuality of <I>Home's </I>mediumistic powers, but the court was not satisfied 
that he had not influenced Mrs. Lyon, and judgment was given in her favour. 
During all this time he had largely exercised his faculties as a medium, and in 
<B>1870</B>-<B>72</B> he held a series of sittings with Sir William Crookes In 
<B>1871</B> he married again, and for the second time his wife was a Russian 
lady of means. From <B>1872</B> onwards he lived mostly on the Continent, where 
he died in <B>1886</B>, after a long and painful illness. <I>Home's 
</I>mediumship presents many remarkable features. His seances were productive of 
both trance and physical phenomena, the latter including raps and table-tilting, 
levitation and elongation, materialisation, the fire-ordeal, and practically 
every form of manifestation. Unlike other mediums, he was never detected in 
fraud, though his mediumship was spread over so many years, and his phenomena 
are among the best-attested in the records of spiritualism. But a more important 
factor in <I>Home's </I>success was his wonderful personality. Though of lowly 
birth, he early acquired an ease and charm of manner which fitted him for the 
good society wherein he was destined to move. Artless and spontaneous and very 
affectionate, of pleasing manners and generous disposition, he won the hearts of 
all with whom he came in contact, and inspired in his sitters an emotional 
confidence which seems frequently to have over-ruled their judgment. Sir W. 
Crookes said of him that he was &quot;one of the most lovable of men,&quot; 
whose &quot;perfect genuineness and uprightness were beyond suspicion.&quot; 
Whether a medium should ever be &quot; beyond suspicion&quot; to a scientific 
investigator is, of course, open to question, but the instance shows abundantly 
that even scientists are not immune from the influence of <I>personal 
magnetism.</P>

<P>Homunculas :</B> An artificial man supposed to have been made by the 
alchemists, and especially by Paracelsus. To manufacture one, he states that the 
needful spagyric substances should be taken and shut up in a glass phial, and 
afterwards be placed to digest in horse-dung for the space of forty days. At the 
end of this time, there will be something which will begin to move and live in 
the bottle. This something is a man, but a man who has no body and is 
transparent. Nevertheless, he exists, and nothing remains but to bring him 
up-which is not more difficult to do than to make him. You may accomplish it by 
daily feeding him-during forty weeks, and without extricating him from his 
dung-hill-with the arcanum of human blood. At the end of this time you shall 
have a veritable living child, having every member as well-proportioned as any 
infant born of a woman. He will only be much smaller than an ordinary child, and 
his physical education will require more care and attention.</P>

<P>Hopedale Community :</B> A socialistic and religious <I>community </I>founded 
in <B>1842</B> near Milford in Massachusetts, by the Rev. Adin Ballon. In 
<B>1850</B> various spirit manifestations made their appearance in the 
<I>Community, </I>while on the death of its founder in <B>1852</B>, 
communications of a spiritualistic cast, purporting to come from him, were 
received through the hand of a living member of the <I>Community. </I>The little 
hand at <I>Hopedale </I>did a good deal to help the advance of Spiritualism.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Hopkins, Matthew :</B> Called the Witchfinder; flourished in <B>1640</B>. Of 
him Godwin says, &quot;Nothing can place the credulity of the English nation on 
the subject of witchcraft in a more striking point of view, than the history of 
<I>Matthew Hopkins, </I>who, in a pamphlet published in <B>1647</B> in his own 
vindication, assumes to himself the surname of the Witchfinder. He fell by 
accident, in his native country of Suffolk, into contact with one or two reputed 
witches, and, being a man of an observing turn and an ingenious invention, 
struck out for himself a trade, which brought him such moderate returns as 
sufficed to maintain him, and at the same time gratified his ambition by making 
him a terror to many, and the object of admiration and gratitude to more, who 
felt themselves indebted to him for ridding them of secret and intestine 
enemies, against whom, as long as they proceeded in ways that left no footsteps 
behind, they felt they had no possibility of guarding themselves.&quot;</P>
<P>After two or three successful experiments, <I>Hopkins </I>engaged in a 
regular tour of the countries of Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex and Huntingdonshire. He 
united to him two confederates, a man named John Stern, and a woman whose name 
has not been handed down to us. They visited every town in their route that 
invited them, and secured to them the moderate remuneration of twenty shillings 
and their expenses, leaving what was more than this to the spontaneous gratitude 
of those who should deem themselves indebted to the exertions of <I>Hopkins 
</I>and his party. By this expedient they secured to themselves a favourable 
reception and a set of credulous persons who would listen to their dictates as 
so many oracles. Being three of them, they were enabled to play the game into 
one another's hands, and were sufficiently strong to overawe all timid and 
irresolute opposition. In every town to which they came, they inquired for 
reputed witches, and having taken them into custody, were secure for the most 
part of a certain number of zealous abettors, and took care that they should 
have a clear stage for their experiments. They overawed their helpless victims 
with a certain air of authority, as if they had received a commission from 
heaven for the discovery of misdeeds. They assailed the poor creatures with a 
multitude of questions constructed in the most artful manner. They stripped them 
naked, in search for the devil's marks in different parts of their bodies, which 
they ascertained by running pins to the head into those parts, that, if they 
were genuine marks, would prove themselves such by their insensibility. They 
swam their victims in rivers and ponds, it being an undoubted fact, that, if the 
persons accused were true witches the water, which was the symbol of admission 
into the Christian Church, would not receive them into its bosom. If the persons 
examined continued obstinate, they seated them in constrained and uneasy 
attitudes, occasionally binding them with cords, and compelling them to remain 
so without food or sleep for twenty-four hours. They walked them up and down the 
room, two taking them under each arm, till they dropped down with fatigue. They 
carefully swept the room in which the experiment was made, that they might keep 
away spiders and flies, which were supposed to be devils or their imps in that 
disguise.</P>
<P>The most plentiful inquisition of <I>Hopkins </I>and his confederates was in 
the years <B>1644</B>, <B>1645</B>, and <B>1646</B>. At length there were so 
many persons committed to prison upon suspicion of witchcraft, that the 
government was compelled to take in hand the affair. The rural magistrates 
before whom <I>Hopkins </I>and his confederates brought their victims, were 
obliged, willingly or unwillingly, to commit them for trial. A commission 
&quot;'as granted to the earl of Warwick and others to hold a session of 
jail-delivery against them for Essex at Chelmsford. Lord Warwick was at this 
time the most popular nobleman in England. He was appointed by the parliament 
lord high admiral during the civil war. He was much courted by the independent 
clergy, was shrewd, penetrating and active, and exhibited a singular mixture of 
pious demeanour with a vein of facetiousness and jocularity. With him was sent 
Dr. Calamy, the most eminent divine of the period of the Commonwealth, to see 
(says Baxter) that no fraud was committed, or wrong done to the parties accused. 
It may well be doubted, however, whether the presence of this clergyman did not 
operate unfavourably to the persons suspected. He preached before the judges. It 
may readily be believed, considering the temper of the times, that he insisted 
much upon the horrible nature of the sin of witchcraft, which could expect no 
pardon, either in the world or the world to come.</P>
<P>He sat on the bench with the judges, and participated in their deliberations. 
In the result of this inquisition sixteen persons were hanged at Yarmouth in 
Norfolk, fifteen at Chelmsford, and sixty at various places in the county of 
Suffolk. Whitlocke in his Memorials of English Affairs, under the date of 
<B>1649</B>, speaks of many witches being apprehended about Newcastle, upon the 
information of a person whom he calls the Witch-finder, who, as his experiments 
were nearly the same, though he is not named, we may reasonably suppose to be 
<I>Hopkins; </I>and in the following year about Boston in Lincolnshire. In 
<B>1652</B> and <B>1653</B> the same author speaks of women in Scotland, who 
were put to incredible torture to extort from them a confession of what their 
adversaries imputed to them.</P>
<P>The fate of Hopkins was such as might be expected in similar cases. The 
multitude are at first impressed with horror at the monstrous charges that are 
advanced. They are seized, as by contagion, with terror at the mischiefs which 
seem to impend over them, and from which no innocence and no precaution appear 
to afford them sufficient protection. They hasten, as with an unanimous effort, 
to avenge themselves upon these malignant enemies, whom Cod and man alike 
combine to expel from society. But, after a time, they begin to reflect, and to 
apprehend that they have acted with too much precipitation, that they have been 
led on with uncertain appearances. They see one victim led to the gallows after 
another, without stint or limitation. They see one dying with the most solemn 
asseverations of innocence, and another confessing apparently she knows not 
what, what is put into her mouth by her relentless persecutors. They see these 
victims old, crazy and impotent, harassed beyond endurance by the ingenious 
cruelties that are practised against them. They were first urged on by 
implacable hostility and fury, to be satisfied with nothing but blood. But 
humanity and remorse also have their turn. Dissatisfied with themselves, they 
are glad to point their resentment against another. The man that at first they 
hailed as a public benefactor, they presently come to regard with jealous eyes, 
and begin to consider as a cunning imposter, dealing in cool blood with the 
lives of his fellow-creatures for a paltry gain, and, still more horrible, for 
the lure of a perishable and short-lived fame. The multitude, we are told, after 
a few seasons, rose upon <I>Hopkins </I>and resolved to subject Mm to one of his 
own criterions. They dragged him to a pond and threw him into the water for a 
witch. It seems he floated on the surface, as a witch ought to do. They then 
pursued him with hootings and revilings. and drove him for ever into that 
obscurity and ignominy which he had amply merited.</P><B>

<P>Horse-Whispering :</B> A secret method by which certain persons are able to 
acquire power over refractory horses. As is well known to students of gypsy 
lore, that interesting people appear to be in possession of some secret by which 
they are enabled to render vicious horses entirely tame; and opinions are 
divided as to whether this secret consists in the application of a certain odour 
or balm to the horse's muzzle, or whispering into its ear a spell or 
incantation. It is said, indeed, that the gypsy horse-charmer applies aniseed to 
the nose of the animal. But besides being practised by gypsies, 
<I>horse-whispering </I>is in vogue amongst many other peoples. Camden in his 
<I>Recital of Irish Superstitions </I>says :-&quot; It is by no means allowable 
to praise a horse or any other animal unless you say 'God save him.' If any 
mischance befalls a horse in three days after, they find out the person who 
commended him, that he may whisper the Lord's Prayer in his right ear.&quot; It 
was said by Con Sullivan, a famous Irish horse-whisperer of the eighteenth 
century, that it is out of the power of the professors of the art to explain the 
source of their influence, -the same thing being affirmed by those who practise 
it in South America, where a couple of men will tame half a dozen wild horses in 
three days. The same art is widely practised in Hungary and Bohemia, and it was 
from a Bohemian gypsy that a family in the county of Cork claimed to hold a 
secret by which the wildest or most vicious horse could be tamed. For 
generations this secret was regularly transmitted as a parting legacy at the 
time of death from the father to the eldest son.</P>
<P>Throughout the North of Scotland there are disseminated members of a secret 
society for the breaking in of refractory horses, which is believed to be called 
the Horseman's Society, and which purports to be able to trace its origin away 
back into the dark ages Those only are admitted who gain their livelihood by the 
care and management of horses, and the more affluent and better educated are 
jealously excluded. Many farmers entertain a prejudice against the members of 
the society, but they are forced to admit that they are always very capable in 
the management of their teams, and can perform services which would otherwise 
require the calling in of a veterinary surgeon. They are usually skilled in the 
knowledge of herbs and simple&quot;, and a great deal of the marvellous is 
imputed to them. In fact it is stated that they hold their meetings at night and 
in the clear moonlight, going through various equestrian performances with 
horses borrowed for the occasion from their masters' stables. There is further 
said to be an inner circle in the society, where the black art and all the 
spells and charms of witchcraft are the objects of study, and the members of 
which can smite the horses and cattle with mysterious sickness, and even cast a 
glamour over human beings. Indeed a local writer goes so far as to say that the 
inner circle of the Horsemen employ hypnotic influence both on men and animals, 
as it is said certain North-American Indians, and some of the jungle tribes of 
Hindustan, do.</P>
<P>The famous Con Sullivan has already been alluded to, and his achievements 
were really wonderful. On one occasion his services were requisitioned by 
Colonel Westenra afterwards Earl of Rosmore, who possessed a racehorse called 
&quot; Rainbow,&quot; of the most savage description. which would attack any 
jockey courageous enough to mount him by seizing him by the leg with his teeth, 
and dragging him from the saddle. A friend of the Colonel's told him that he 
knew a person who could cure Rainbow, and a wager of <B>&pound;1</B>,<B>000</B> 
was laid on the matter. Con Sullivan, who was known throughout the countryside 
as &quot;The Whisperer&quot; was sent for, and after being shut up alone with 
the animal for a quarter of an hour, he gave the signal for the admission of 
those who had been waiting on the result. When they entered, they found the 
horse extended on his back, playing like a kitten with Sullivan, who was quietly 
sitting by him; but both horse and operator appeared exhausted, and the latter 
had to be revived with brandy. The horse was perfectly tame and gentle from that 
day. Another savage steed named &quot; King Pippin&quot; took an entire night to 
cure, but in the morning he was seen following Sullivan like a dog, lying down 
at the word of command, and permitting any person to put his hand into his 
mouth. Shortly afterwards he won a race at the Curragh. Sullivan is described by 
one who knew him well as an ignorant rustic of the lower class, but there can be 
no question as to his extraordinary powers.</P>
<P>The statement of Sullivan is probably correct, that the successful whisperer 
is not acquainted with the secret of his own power. &quot;The reason,&quot; says 
Rich, &quot;is obvious. A force proceeding immediately from the will or the 
instinctive life would be impaired by reflection in the understanding and broken 
up or at least diminished by one half. The violent trembling of the animal under 
this operation is like the creaking and shivering of the tables before they 
begin to ' tip,' and indicates a moral or nervous force acting physically, by 
projection perhaps from the spirit of the operator. None of these cases are, 
after all, more wonderful than the movement of our Own limbs and bodies by 
mental force, for how does it move them with such ease ? And may not the same 
power that place&quot; its strong but invisible little fingers on every point of 
our muscular frames, stretch its myriad arms a little further into the sphere 
around us, and operate by the same laws, and with as much ease, on the stalwart 
frame of a horse, or even a clothes-horse?</P>

<P>House of Wisdom :</B> The <I>tarik </I>or &quot;path&quot; of the <I>House of 
Wisdom </I>was founded by Moslem mystics at Cairo in the ninth century, and had 
seven initiatory degrees. The original founder appears to have been one 
Abdallah. a Persian, who, believing in the Gnostic doctrine of the Aeons or 
Sephiroths, applied the system to the successors of Mohammed, stating that 
Ismael was the founder of his <I>tarik </I>and one of his descendants as the 
seventh Imaum. He established an active system of propaganda and sent 
missionaries far and wide. He was succeeded in his office as chief of the 
society by his son and grandson. After the institution bad been in existence for 
some time it was transferred to Cairo, and assemblies were held twice a week, 
when all the members appeared clothed in white. They were gradually advanced 
through the seven degrees of which the <I>tarih </I>consisted, and over which a 
<I>Dai-al-doat </I>or &quot; Missionary of missionaries &quot; presided. A later 
chief. Hakem-bi-emir-Illah, increased the degrees to nine, and in <B>1004 
</B>erected a stately home for the society, which he elaborately furnished with 
mathematical instruments. As the institution did not meet with the approval of 
the authorities, it was destroyed in <B>1123 </B>by the then Grand Vizier, but 
meetings continued elsewhere. The officers of the society were <I>-Sheik, 
Dai-el-keber, </I>or Deputy, <I>Dai, </I>or Master, <I>Refik, </I>or Fellow, 
<I>Fedavie, </I>or Agent, <I>Lassik, </I>or Aspirant, <I>Muemini, </I>or 
Believer. The teaching was to the effect that there had been seven holy Imaums, 
that God had sent seven Lawgivers, who had each seven helpers, who in turn had

<P>Huet, Pierre-Daniel :</B> A celebrated bishop of Avrenches, who died in 
<B>1721. </B>One finds in his <I>Reminiscences </I>many interesting passages 
relating to the vampires by the Greek Archipelago. &quot;Many strange 
things,&quot; he says &quot;are told of the broucolagnes, or vampires of the 
Archipelago. It is said in that country that if one leads a wicked life, and 
dies in sin, he will appear again after death as he was wont in his lifetime, 
and that such a person will cause great affright among the living.&quot; <I>Huet 
</I>believed that the bodies of such people were abandoned to the power of the 
devil, who retained the soul within them for the vexation of mankind. Father 
Richard, a Jesuit, employed on a mission in these islands, provided <I>Huet 
</I>with details of many cases of vampirism. In the Island of St. Erini, the 
Thera of the ancients occurred one of the greatest chapters in the history of 
vampirism. He says that these people were tormented by vampires, that they were 
constantly disinterring corpses for the purpose of burning them <I>Huet 
</I>states that this evidence is worthy of credence as emanating from a witness 
of unimpeachable honesty, who has had ocular demonstrations of what he writes 
about. He further says that the inhabitants of these islands after the death of 
a person, cut off his feet, bands, nose, and ears, and they call this act 
<I>acroteriazein. </I>They hang all these round the elbow of the dead. It is 
noteworthy that the bishop appears to think that the modern Greeks may have 
inherited the practice of burning bodies from their fathers in classical times, 
and that they imagine that unless the corpse is given to the flames, all cannot 
be well with the soul of the deceased.</P>

<P>Huns :</B> The ancient historians credited the Huns with a monstrous origin. 
They were often called <I>children of the devil, </I>because it was said that 
they were born of a union between demons and hideous witches, the latter cast 
out of their own county by Philimer, king of the Goths, and his army. The old 
writers state that the Huns were of horrible deformity, and could not be 
mistaken for anything but the children of demons. Besoldus, following Servin, 
claims that their name of <I>Huns </I>comes from a Celtic or barbaric word 
signifying <I>great magicians. </I>Many stories are told of their magic prowess, 
and of their raising spectres to assist them in battle.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Hydromancy :</B> Divination by water, is said by Natalis Comes to have been 
the invention of Nereus, and according to Delrio, a most respectable authority 
in these matters, it is a method of divination than which <I>nulla faecundior 
imposturis. </I>Iamblichus, he says, mentions one kind of <I>hydromancy </I>to 
which the Emperor Andronicus Comnenus had recourse ; not in person, for regard 
for his character (a character richly demanding such caution !) forbade this 
humiliation. This worthy applied to Sethos, a diviner, who from his youth upward 
had been addicted to magic, and on that account had been deprived of sight by 
the Emperor Manuel. The question proposed by <I>hydromancy </I>was, who was to 
he the successor of Andronicus, a doubt which grievously perplexed the 
superstitious tyrant, and left him in hesitation as to the fittest victim whom 
his suspicious vengeance might first sacrifice. The evil spirit when summoned, 
showed upon the water the letters S.I., and upon being asked at what time the 
person so designated should succeed, he replied, before the Feast of the 
exaltation of the Cross. His prediction was verified, for, within the time 
named, Isaac Angelus had thrown Andronicus to be torn in pieces by the 
infuriated populace of Constantinople. It should be remembered here that the 
devil spells, as he repeats the Lord's Prayer, not in the natural order, but 
backwards. S.I., when inverted, would <I>fairly </I>enough represent Isaac, 
according to all laws of magic.</P>
<P>The same story is related with great spirit by Nicetas. The arts with which 
the tempter cheats the ear of his votary are vividly displayed, and there is one 
very picturesque touch, when the fiend is asked respecting time, which we are 
surprised should have escaped Delrio, who evidently burrows from this source, 
though he refers to lamblichus. The annalist has already remarked that he 
neither knows, nor indeed wishes to know, the method of practising hydromancy, 
but Delrio, on the contrary, describes several kinds. In one a ring was 
suspended by a thread in a vessel of water, and this being shaken, a judgment 
was formed according to the strokes of the ring against the sides of the vessel. 
In a second, three pebbles were thrown into standing water, and observations 
were drawn from the circles which they formed. A third depended upon the 
agitations of the sea, whence the learned Jesuit deduces a custom prevalent 
among the Oriental Christians of annually baptizing that element; at the same 
time taking especial care to show that the betrothment of the Adriatic by the 
Doge of Venice has a widely different origin. A fourth divination was taken from 
the colour of water, and certain figures appearing in it, which Varro says 
afforded numerous prognostics of the event of the Mithridatic War. But this 
branch was of sufficient importance to deserve a separate name, and we read 
accordingly of divination by fountains, these being the waters most frequently 
consulted. Among the most celebrated fountains for this purpose were those of 
Palicorus in Sicily, which invariably destroyed the criminal who ventured to 
adjure them falsely in testimony of his innocence. A full account of their usage 
and virtue is given by Macrobius. Pausanias has described a fountain near 
Epidaurus, dedicated to Ino, into which on her festival, certain loaves were 
wont to be thrown. It was a favourable omen to the applicant if these offerings 
were retained on the other hand, most unlucky if they were washed up again. So, 
also, Tiberius cast golden dice into the fountain of Apomus, near Padua, where 
they long remained as a proof of the imperial monster's good fortune in making 
the highest throw. Several other instances of divining springs may be found 
collected by the diligence of Boissard; and to a belief in them Delrio thinks a 
custom of the ancient Germans is referable, who threw their new-born children 
into the Rhine, with a conviction that if they were spurious they would sink, if 
legitimate they would swim. In a fifth method, certain mysterious words were 
pronounced over a cup full of water, and observations were made upon its 
spontaneous ebullition. In a sixth, a drop of oil was let fall on water in a 
glass vessel, and this furnished as it were a mirror upon which many wonderful 
objects became visible. This, says Delrio, is the <I>Modus Fessanus. </I>Clemens 
Alexandrinus is cited for a seventh kind, in which the women of Germany watched 
the sources, whirls, and courses of rivers, with a view to prophetic 
interpretation the same fact is mentioned by Vives in his <I>Commentary upon St. 
Agustine. </I>In modern Italy, continues the learned Jesuit, diviners are still 
to be found who write the names of any three persons suspected of theft upon a 
like number of little balls, which they throw into the water and some go to so 
profane an extent as to abuse even holy water for this most unsanctified 
purpose. Boissard, as cited above, has explained more fully than Delno two of 
these methods of <I>hydromancy, </I>that by the ring suspended in a vessel of 
water, and the method by its spontaneous ebullition. A very similar account is 
given by Wierus.</P>
<P>In a fragment of Varro's book, <I>de Cultu Deorum, </I>the practice of 
<I>hydromancy </I>is attributed to Numa. Upon this statement St. Augustine has 
commented in the passage to 'which we have already referred, and he mentions 
that the practice of <I>hydromancy </I>was attributed by Varro to the Persians, 
and afterwards to the philosopher Pythagoras. Strabo in like manner has ascribed 
the practice to the Persians</P><I>
<P>Hydromancy </I>is, in principle, the same thing as divination by the crystal 
or mirror, and in ancient times a natural basin of rock kept constantly full by 
a running stream, was a favourite medium. The double meaning of the 'word 
&quot;reflection&quot; ought here to be considered, and how gazing down into 
clear water, the mind is disposed to self-retirement and to contemplation, 
deeply tinctured with melancholy. Rocky pools and glomy lakes figure in all 
stories of witchcraft-witness the Craic-pol-nain in the Highland woods of 
Laynchork; the Devil's Glen in the county of Wicklow, Ireland; the Swedish 
Blokula; the witch mountains of Italy; and the Bibiagora, between Hungary and 
Poland. Similar resorts in the glens of Germany were marked, as Tacitus 
mentions, by salt springs; for this again there was an additional good reason, 
which would carry us far from the present subject to explain.</P>
<P>It was really only another form of divination by the gloomy water pool that 
attracted so much public attention at that time, when Mr. Lane, in his work on 
<I>Modern Egypt </I>testified to its success as practised in Egypt and 
Hindostan. That gentleman having resolved to witness the performance of this 
species of sorcery, the magician commenced his operations by writing forms of 
invocation to his familiar spirits or, six slips of paper, a chafing dish with 
some live charcoal in it was then procured, and a boy summoned who had not yet 
reached the age of puberty. Mr. Lane inquired who were the persons that could 
see in the fluid mirror, and was told that they were a boy not arrived at 
puberty, a virgin, a black female slave, and a pregnant woman. To prevent any 
collusion between the sorcerer and the boy, Mr. Lane sent his servant to take 
the first boy he met. When all was prepared, the sorcerer threw some incense and 
one of the strips of paper into the chafing-dish; he then took hold of the boy's 
right hand, and drew a square with some mystical marks on the palm; in the 
centre of the square he poured a little ink, which formed the magic mirror, and 
desired the boy to look steadily into it without raising his head. In this 
mirror the boy declared that he saw successively, a man sweeping, seven men with 
flags, an army pitching its tents, and the various officers of state attending 
on the Sultan. The rest must be told by Mr. Lane himself.</P>
<P>&quot;The sorcerer now addressed himself to me, and asked me if I wished the 
hey to see any person who was absent or dead. I named Lord Nelson, of whom the 
boy had evidently never heard, for it was with much difficulty that he 
pronounced the name after several trials. The magician desired the boy to say to 
the Sultan, ' My master salutes thee and desires thee to bring Lord Nelson; 
bring him before my eyes that I may see him speedily.' The boy then said so, and 
almost immediately added, 'A messenger has gone and brought back a man dressed 
in a black (or rather, dark blue) Suit of European clothes; the man has lost his 
left arm.' He then paused for a moment or two, and looking more intently and 
more closely into the ink, said No, he has not lost his left arm, but it is 
placed on his breast.' This correction made his description more striking than 
it had been without it; since Lord Nelson generally had his empty sleeve 
attached to the breast of Ills coat; but it was the right arm that he had lost. 
With out saying that I suspected the boy had made a mistake, I asked the 
magician whether the objects appeared in the ink as if actually before the eyes, 
or as if in a glass, which makes the right appear left. He answered that they 
appeared as in a mirror. This rendered the boy's description faultless. Though 
completely puzzled, I was somewhat disappointed with his performances, for they 
fell short of what he had accomplished in many instances in presence of certain 
of my friends and countrymen. On one of these occasions an Englishman present 
ridiculed the performance, and said that nothing would satisfy him but a correct 
description of the appearance of his own father, of whom he was sure no one of 
the company had any knowledge. The boy, accordingly, having called by name for 
the person alluded to, described a man in a Frank dress, with his hand placed on 
his head, wearing spectacles, and with one foot on the ground and the other 
raised behind him, as if he were stepping down from a seat. The description was 
exactly true in every respect; the peculiar position of the hand was occasioned 
by an almost constant headache, and that of the foot or leg by a stiff knee, 
caused by a fall from a horse in hunting. On another occasion Shakespeare was 
described with the most minute exactness. both as to person and dress, and I 
might add several other cases in with the same magician has excited astonishment 
in the sober minds of several Englishmen of my acquaintance.&quot; So far Mr. 
Lane, whose account may be compared with that given by Mr. Kinglake, the author 
of <I>Eothen.</I></P>
<P>It may be worth adding, that in another case of <I>hydromancy </I>known to 
Elihu Rich, the boy could see better without the medium than with it-though he 
could also see reflected images in a vessel of water. This fact may be admitted 
to prove that such images are reflected to the eye of the seer from his own mind 
and brain; how the brain becomes thus enchanted, or the eye disposed for vision, 
is another question; certainly it is no proof that the recollected image in the 
mind of the inquirer is transferred to the seer, as proofs can be shown to the 
contrary.</P>

<P>Hyperaesthesia :</B> An actual or apparent exaltation of the perceptive 
faculties, characteristic of the hypnotic state. The smallest suggestion, 
whether given by word, look, gesture, or even breathing or unconscious movement, 
is instantly seized upon and interpreted by the entranced subject, who for this 
reason is often termed &quot; sensitive.&quot; The phenomenon of 
<I>hyperaesthesia, </I>observed but wrongly interpreted by the early magnetists 
and mesmerists, was largely responsible for the so-called clairvoyance, 
thought-reading. community of sensation, and other kindred phenomena. The 
realisation of suggestion and <I>hyperaesthesia </I>was the great achievement of 
Beltrand and Braid, which brought hypnotism into the domain of scientific fact. 
The significance of <I>hyperaesthesia </I>in connection with every form of 
psychic phenomena can hardly be over estimated. Nor is it met with only in the 
trance state. It enters into the normal existence to an extent that is but 
imperfectly understood. Dreams, for instance, frequently reproduce impressions 
which have been recorded in some obscure stratum of consciousness, while much 
that we call intuition is made up of inferences subconsciously drawn from 
indications too subtle to reach the normal consciousness. <I>Hyperaesthesia 
</I>has been defined above as &quot;an actual or <I>apparent </I>exaltation of 
the perceptive faculties.&quot; The reason for this is that modern scientists 
declare that it is not known whether the senses are actually sharpened or not. 
Most probably the <I>hyperaesthetic </I>perception is merely a normal perception 
which by reason of the state of cerebal dissociation operates in a free field. 
Very slight sense-impressions may be recorded in the brain during normal 
consciousness, but such is the inhibiting effect of the excitement occasioned by 
other similar impressions, that they do not reach full consciousness.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Hypnosis :</B> <I>(See </I><B>Hypnotism.</B>)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Hypnotism : </B>A peculiar state of cerebral dissociation distinguished by 
certain marked symptoms, the most prominent and invariable of which is a highly 
increased suggestibility in the subject. The hypnotic state may be induced in a 
very large percentage of normal individuals, or may occur spontaneously. It is 
recognised as having an affinity with normal sleep, and likewise with a variety 
of abnormal conditions, among which may be mentioned somnambulism, ecstasy, and 
the trances of Hindu fakirs and savage medicine-men. In fact, in one or other of 
their forms, hypnosis and its kindred have been known in practically all 
countries and all times.</P><I>
<P>Hypnotism </I>is no longer classed with the occult sciences. It has gained, 
though only within comparatively recent years, a definite scientific status, and 
no mean place in legitimate medicine. Nevertheless its history is inextricably 
interwoven with occultism, and even to-day much hypnotic phenomena is classed as 
&quot;spiritualistic&quot;; so that the consideration of <I>hypnotism </I>in 
this place is very necessary to a proper understanding of much of the occult 
science of our own and former times.</P><I>
<P>The Early Magnetists - So </I>far back as the <B>16</B>th century hypnotic 
phenomena were observed and studied by men of science, who attributed them to 
<I>magnetism, </I>an effluence radiating from every object in the universe, in a 
greater or less degree, and through which all objects might exercise a mutual 
influence one on another. From this doctrine was constructed the 
&quot;sympathetic&quot; system of medicine, by means of which the magnetic 
effluence of the planets, of the actual magnet, or of the physician, was brought 
to bear upon the patient. Paracelsus is generally supposed to be the originator 
of the sympathetic system, as he was its most powerful exponent. Of the magnet 
he says:-</P>
<P>&quot;The magnet has long lain before all eyes, and no one has ever thought 
whether it was of any further use, or whether it possessed any other property, 
than that of attracting iron. The sordid doctors throw it in my face that I will 
not follow the ancients; but in 'what should I follow them ? All that they have 
said of the magnet amounts to nothing. Lay that which I have said of it in the 
balance, and judge. Had I blindly followed others, and had I not myself made 
experiments, I should in like manner how nothing more than what every peasant 
sees-that it attracts iron. But a wise man must enquire for himself, and it is 
thus that I have discovered that the magnet, besides this obvious and to every 
man visible power, that of attracting iron, possesses another and concealed 
power.&quot; -That of healing the sick.</P>
<P>And there is no doubt that cures were actually effected by Paracelsus with 
the aid of the magnet, especially in cases of epilepsy and nervous affections. 
Yet the word &quot;magnet&quot; is most frequently used by Paracelsus and his 
followers in a figurative sense, to denote the <I>magnes microcosmi, </I>man 
himself, who was supposed to be a reproduction in miniature of the earth, 
having, like it, his poles and magnetic properties From the stars and planets, 
he taught, came a very subtle effluence which affected man's mind or intellect, 
while earthly substances radiated a grosser emanation which affected his body. 
The human mummy especially was a &quot;magnet&quot; well suited for remedial 
purposes, since it draws to itself the diseases and poisonous properties of 
other substances. The most effective mummy was that of a criminal who had been 
hanged, and it was applied in the following manner. &quot;If a person suffer 
from disease, &quot; says Paracelsus, either local or general, experiment with 
the following remedy. Take a magnet impregnated with mummy, and combined with 
rich earth. In this earth sow some seeds that have a likeness to, or homogeneity 
with, the disease; then let this earth, well sifted and mixed with mummy, be 
laid in an earthen vessel, and let the seeds committed to it be watered daily 
with a lotion in which the diseased limb or body has been washed. Thus will the 
disease be transplanted from the human body to the seeds which are in the earth. 
Having done this, transplant the seeds from the earthen vessel to the ground, 
and wait till they begin to flourish into herbs. As they increase, the disease 
will diminish, and when they have reached their mature growth, will altogether 
disappear.&quot; The quaint but not altogether illogical idea of 
&quot;weapon-salve &quot; - anointing the weapon instead of the wound-was also 
used by Paracelsus, his theory being that part of the vital spirits clung to the 
weapon and exercised an ill effect on the vital spirits in the wound, which 
would not heal until the ointment had first been applied to the weapon; this 
also was an outcome of the magnetic theory.</P>
<P>Towards the end of the <B>16</B>th century Paracelsus was worthily succeeded 
by J. B. van Helmont, a scientist of distinction and an energetic protagonist of 
magnetism. Material nature,&quot; he writes, &quot;draws her forms through 
constant magnetism from above, and implores for them the favour of heaven; and 
as heaven, in like manner, draws something invisible from below, there is 
established a free and mutual intercourse, and the whole is contained in an 
individual.&quot; Van Helmont believed also in the power of the will to direct 
the subtle fluid. There was, he held, in all created things. a magic or 
celestial power through which they were allied to heaven. This power or strength 
is greatest in the soul of man, resides in a less degree in his body, and to 
some extent is present in the lower animals, plants, and inorganic matter. It is 
by reason of his superior endowment in this respect that man is enabled to rule 
the other creatures, and to make use of inanimate objects for his own purposes. 
The power is strongest when one is asleep, for then the body is quiescent, and 
the soul most active and dominant; and for this reason dreams and prophetic 
visions are more common in sleep. &quot;The spirit,&quot; he says, &quot;is 
everywhere diffused, and the spirit is the medium of magnetism; not the spirits 
of heaven and of hell, but the spirit of man, which is concealed in him as the 
fire is concealed in the flint. The human will makes itself master of a portion 
of its spirit of life, which becomes a connecting property between the corporeal 
and the incorporeal, and diffuses itself like the light.&quot; To this ethereal 
spirit he ascribes the visions seen by &quot;the inner man&quot; in ecstasy, and 
also those of the &quot; outer man&quot; and the lower animals. In proof of the 
mutual influence of living creatures he asserts that men may kill animals merely 
by staring hard at them for a quarter of an hour. That Van Helmont was not 
ignorant of the power of imagination is evident from many of his writings. A 
common needle, he declares, may by means of certain manipulations, and the 
will-power and imaginations of the operator, be made to possess magnetic 
properties. Herbs may become very powerful through the imagination of him who 
gathers them. And again:-</P>
<P>&quot;I have hitherto avoided revealing the great secret, that the strength 
lies concealed in man, merely through the suggestion and power of the 
imagination to work outwardly, and to impress this strength on others, which 
then continues of itself, and operates on the remotest objects. Through this 
secret alone will all receive its true illumination- all that has hitherto been 
brought together laboriously of the ideal being out of the spirit-all that has 
been said of the magnetism of all things--of the strength of the human soul-of 
the magic of man, and of his dominion over the physical world.&quot; Van Helmont 
also gave special importance to the stomach as the chief seat of the soul, and 
recounts an experience of his own in which, on touching some aconite with his 
tongue, he finds all his senses transferred to his stomach. In after years this 
was to be a favourite accomplishment of somnambules and cataleptic subjects. 
<I>(See </I><STRONG>Stomach, Seeing with.</STRONG>)</P>
<P>A distinguished English magnetist was Robert Fludd, who wrote in the first 
part of the <B>17</B>th century. Fluid was an exponent of the microcosmic 
theory, and a believer in the magnetic effluence from man. Not only were these 
emanations able to cure bodily diseases, but they also affected the moral 
sentiments; for if radiations from two individuals were, on meeting, flung back 
or distorted, negative magnetism, or antipathy resulted, whereas if the 
radiations from each person passed freely into those from the other, the result 
was positive magnetism, or sympathy. Examples of positive and negative magnetism 
were also to be found among the lower animals and among plants. Another 
magnetist of distinction was the Scottish physician, Maxwell, who is said to 
have anticipated much of Mesmer's doctrine. He declares that those who are 
familiar with the operation of the universal spirit can, through its agency cure 
all diseases, at no matter what distance. He also suggests that the practice of 
magnetism, though very valuable in the hand of a well-disposed physician, is not 
without its dangers, and is liable to many abuses.</P>
<P>While the theoretical branch of magnetism was thus receiving attention at the 
hands of the alchemical philosophers, the practical side was by no means 
neglected. There were in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries a number 
of&quot; divine healers,&quot; whose magic cures were without doubt the result 
of hypnotic suggestion. Of these perhaps the best known and most successful were 
Valentine Greatrakes, an Irishman, and a Swabian priest named Gassner. 
Great-rakes was born in <B>1628</B>, and on reaching manhood served for some 
time in the Irish army, thereafter settling down on his estate in Waterford. In 
<B>1662</B> he had a dream in which it was revealed to him that he possessed the 
gift of curing king's evil. The dream was repeated several times ere he paid 
heed to it, but at length he made the experiment, his own wife being the first 
to be healed by him. Many who came to him from the surrounding country were 
cured when he laid his hands upon them. Later the impression came upon him 
strongly that he could cure other diseases besides king's evil, News of his 
wonderful powers spread far and wide, and patients came in hundreds to seek his 
aid. Despite the fact that the Bishop of the Diocese forbade the exercise of 
these apparently magical powers, Greatrakes continued to heal the afflicted 
people who sought him. In <B>1666</B> he proceeded to London, and though not 
invariably successful, he seems to have performed there a surprising number of 
cures, which were testified to by Robert Boyle, Sir William Smith, Andrew 
Marvell, and many other eminent people. He himself describes them in a work 
entitled &quot;Val. Greatrakes, Esq., of Waterford, in the kingdom of Ireland, 
famous for curing several diseases and distempers by the stroak of his hand 
only: London, <B>1660</B>.&quot; His method of healing was to stroke the 
affected part with his hand, thus driving the disease into the limbs and so 
finally out of the body. Sometimes the treatment acted as though by magic, but 
if immediate relief was not obtained the rubbing was continued, and but few 
cases were dismissed as incurable. Even epidemic diseases he healed by a touch. 
It is said that during the treatment the patient's fingers and toes remained 
insensible to external stimuli, and frequently he himself showed every symptom 
of such a magnetic crisis as was afterwards to become a special feature of 
mesmeric treatment. Personally Greatrakes was a simple and pious gentleman, 
persuaded that his marvellous powers were a divinely-bestowed gift, and most 
anxious to make the best use of them. The other healer mentioned, Gassner, 
belongs to a somewhat later period-about the middle of the eighteenth century. 
Gassner was a priest of Bludenz in Vorarlberg, where his many cures gained for 
him a wide celebrity. All diseases, according to him, were caused by evil 
spirits possessing the patient, and his mode of healing thus consisted of 
exorcising the demons. He too was a man of kindly disposition and piety, and 
made a large use-of the Scriptures in his healing operations. The ceremony of 
exorcism was a rather impressive one. Herr Gassner sat at a table, the patient 
and spectators in front of him, A blue red-flowered cloak hung from his 
shoulders; the rest of his clothing, we are told, was &quot; clean, simple, and 
modest.&quot; On his left was a window, on his right, the crucifix. His fine 
personality, deep learning, and noble character inspired the faith of the 
patient and his friends and doubtless played no small part in his curative 
feats. Sometimes he made use of magnetic manipulations, stroking or rubbing the 
affected part, and driving the disease, after the manner of Greatrakes, into the 
limbs of the patient. The formula of exorcism he generally pronounced in Latin, 
with which language the demons showed a perfect familiarity. Not only could he 
control sickness by these means, but the passions also were amenable to his 
treatment. &quot;Now anger is apparent, now patience, now joy, now sorrow, now 
hate, now love, now confusion, now reason,-each carried to the highest pitch. 
Now this one is blind, now he sees, and again is deprived of sight, etc.&quot; 
These curious results suggest the phreno-magnetism of later years, where equally 
sudden changes of mood were produced by touching with the finger-tips those 
parts of the subject's head which phrenology associated with the various 
emotions to be called forth.</P>
<P>Hitherto it will be seen that the rational and supernatural explanations of 
magnetism had run parallel with one another, the former most in favour with the 
philosophers, the latter with the populace. It was reserved for Emanuel 
Swedenborg (q.v.) (<B>1688</B>-<B>1772</B>), the Swedish philosopher and 
spiritualist, to unite the doctrine of magnetism with that of spiritualism-i.e., 
the belief in the action in the external world of the discarnate spirits of 
deceased human beings. That Swedenborg accepted some of the theories of the 
older magnetists is evident from his mystical writings, from which the following 
passage has been extracted.</P>
<P>&quot; In order to comprehend the origin and progress of this influence 
<I>(i.e., </I>God's influence over man), we must first know that that which 
proceeds from the Lord is the divine sphere which surrounds us, and fills the 
spiritual and natural world. Ml that proceeds from an object, and surrounds and 
clothes it, is called its sphere.</P>
<P>&quot;As all that is spiritual knows neither time nor space, it therefore 
follows that the general sphere or the divine one-has extended itself from the 
first moment of creation to the last. This divine emanation, which passed over 
from the spiritual to the natural, penetrates actively and rapidly through- the 
whole created world, to the last grade of it, where it is yet to be found, and 
produces and maintains all that is animal, vegetable, and mineral. Man is 
continually surrounded by a sphere of his favourite propensities; these unite 
themselves to the natural sphere of his body, so that together they form one. 
The natural sphere surrounds every body of nature, and all the objects of the 
three kingdoms. Thus it allies itself to the spiritual world. This is the 
foundation of sympathy and antipathy, of union and separation, according to 
which there are amongst spirits presence and absence.</P>
<P>&quot;The angel said to me that the sphere surrounded man more 'lightly on 
the back than on the breast, where it was thicker and stronger. This sphere of 
influence peculiar to mail operates also in general and in particular around him 
by means of the will, the understanding, and the practice.</P>
<P>&quot;The sphere proceeding from God, which surrounds man and constitutes his 
strength, while it thereby operates on his neighbour and on the whole creation, 
is a sphere of peace, and innocence; for the Lord is peace and innocence. Then 
only is man consequently able to make his influence effectual on his fellow man, 
when peace and innocence rule in his heart, and he himself is in union with 
heaven. This spiritual union is connected with the natural by a benevolent man 
through the touch and the laying on of hands, by which the influence of the 
inner man is quickened, prepared, and imparted. The body communicates with 
others which are about it through the body, and the spiritual influence diffuses 
itself chiefly through the hands, because these are the most outward or 
<I>ultimum </I>of man; and through him, as in the whole of nature, the first is 
contained in the last, as the cause in the effect. The whole soul and the whole 
body are contained in the hands as a medium of influence.&quot;</P><I>
<P>Mesmerism or Animal Magnetism.-In </I>the latter half of the eighteenth 
century a new era was inaugurated in connection with the doctrine of a magnetic 
fluid. The fresh impetus which the science of magnetism received at that period 
was due in a very large measure to the works of Franz Aritoine Mesmer (q.v.), a 
physician from whose name the word &quot; mesmerism&quot; was taken. He was born 
at Wiel, near Lake Constance, in <B>1733</B>, and studied medicine at the 
University of Vienna, taking his doctor's degree in <B>1766</B>. In the same 
year he published his first work, <I>De Planetarum Influxu (.' </I>De 
l'influence des Planettes sur le corps humain&quot;). Though he claimed to have 
thereby discovered the existence of a universal fluid, to which he gave the name 
of <I>magnetisme animal, </I>there is no doubt that his doctrine was in many 
respects identical with that of the older magnetists mentioned above. The idea 
of the universal fluid was suggested to him in the first place by his 
observation of the stars, which led him to believe the celestial bodies 
exercised a mutual influence <B>0</B> each other and on the earth. This he 
identified with magnetism, and it was but a step-and a step which had already 
been taken by the early magnetists-to extend this influence to the human body 
and all other objects, and to apply it to the science of medicine. In 
<B>1776</B> Mesmer met with Gassner, the Swabian priest whose miraculous cures 
have already been considered; and, setting aside the supernatural explanation 
offered by the healer himself, Mesmer declared that the cures and severe crises 
which followed on his manipulations were attributable t<B>6</B> nothing but 
magnetism. Nevertheless this encounter gave a new trend to his ideas. Hitherto 
he himself had employed the magnet in order to cure the sick, but seeing that 
Gassner dispensed with that aid, he was led to consider whether the power might 
not reside in a still greater degree in the human body. Mesmer's first cure was 
performed on an epileptic patient, by means of magnets, but the honour of it was 
disputed by a Jesuit named Hell, who had supplied the magnetic plates, and who 
claimed to have discovered the principles on which the physician worked. 
Thereafter for a few years Mesmer practised in various European cities, and 
strove to obtain recognition for Ills theories, but without success. In 
<B>1778</B> however, lie went to Paris, and there attained an immediate and 
triumphant success in the fashionable world, though the learned bodies still 
refused to have anything to say to him. Aristocratic patients flocked in 
hundreds to Mesmer's consulting-rooms, which were hung with mirrors, it being 
one of the physicians' theories that mirrors augmented the magnetic fluid. He 
himself wore, it is said, a shirt of leather, lined with silk, to prevent the 
escape of the fluid, while magnets were hung about his person to increase his 
natural supply of magnetism. The patients were seated round a <I>baguet </I>or 
magnetic tub, of which the following description is given by Seifert, one of 
Mesmer's biographers.</P>
<P>&quot;This receptacle was a large pan, tub, or pool of water, filled with 
various magnetic substances, such as water, sand, stone, glass bottles (filled 
with magnetic water), etc. It was a focus within which the magnetism was 
concentrated, and out of which proceeded a number of conductors. These being 
bent pointed iron wands, one end was retained in the <I>baguet, </I>whilst the 
other was connected with the patient and applied to the seat of the disease. 
This arrangement might be made use of by any number of persons seated round the 
<I>baguet, </I>and thus a fountain, or any receptacle in a garden, as in a room, 
would answer for the purpose desired.&quot; For the establishment of a school of 
<I>Animal Magnetism </I>Mesmer was offered <B>20,000 </B>livres by the French 
government, with an annual sum of <B>10.000 </B>livres for its upkeep; but this 
he refused. Later, however, the sum of <B>340</B>,<B>000</B> livres was 
subscribed by prospective pupils, and handed over to him. One of Mesmer's 
earliest and most distinguished disciples was M. D'Eslon, a prominent physician, 
who laid the doctrines of animal magnatism before the Faculty of Medicine in 
<B>1780. </B>Consideration of Mesmer's theories was, however, indignantly 
refused, and D'Eslon warned to rid himself of such dangerous doctrine. Another 
disciple of Mesmer who attained to distinction in magnetic practise was the 
Marquis de Puysegur, who was the first to observe and describe the state of 
induced somnambulism now as well known as the hypnotic trance. It has been 
suggested, and seems not improbable, that Mesmer himself knew something of the 
induced trance, but believing it to be a state full of danger, steadfastly set 
his face against it. However that may be, Puysegur's ideas on the subject began 
to supersede those of Mesmer, and he gathered about him a distinguished body of 
adherents, among whom was numbered the celebrated Lavater. Indeed, his 
recognition of the fact that the symptoms attending the &quot;magnetic 
sleep&quot; were resultant from it, was a step of no small importance in the 
history of mesmerism. In <B>1784</B> a commission was appointed by the French 
government to enquire into the magnetic phenomena. For some reason or another 
its members chose to investigate the experiments of D'Eslon, rather than those 
of Mesmer himself. The commissioners, including among their number Benjamin 
Franklin, Lavoisier, and Bailly, observed the peculiar crises attending the 
treatment, and the <I>rapport </I>between patient and physician, but decided 
that imagination could produce all the effects, and that there was no evidence 
whatever for a magnetic fluid. The report, edited by M. Bailly, gives the 
following description of the crisis.</P>
<P>&quot;The sick persons, arranged in great numbers, and in several rows around 
the <I>baquet </I>(bath), received the magnetism by means of the iron rods, 
which conveyed it to them from the <I>baquet </I>by the cords wound round their 
bodies, by the thumb which connected them with their neighbours, and by the 
sounds of a pianoforte, or an agreeable voice, diffusing magnetism in the 
air.</P>
<P>&quot;The patients were also directly magnetised by means of the finger and 
wand of the magnetiser, moved slowly before their faces, above or behind their 
heads, or on the diseased parts.</P>
<P>&quot;The magnetiser acts also by fixing his eyes on the subjects; by the 
application of his bands on the region of the solar plexus; an application which 
sometimes continues for hours.</P>
<P>&quot;Meanwhile the patients present a very varied picture. Some are calm, 
tranquil, and experience no effect. Others cough and spit, feel pains, heat, or 
perspiration. Others, again, are convulsed.</P>
<P>&quot;As soon as one begins to be convulsed, it is remarkable that others are 
immediately affected.</P>
<P>&quot;The commissioners have observed some of these convulsions last more 
than three hours. They are often accompanied with expectorations of a violent 
character, often streaked with blood. The convulsions are marked with 
involuntary motions of the throat, limbs, and sometimes the whole body; by 
dimness of the eyes, shrieks, sobs, laughter, and the wildest hysteria. These 
states are often followed by languor and depression. The smallest noise appears 
to aggravate the symptoms, and often to occasion shudderings and terrible cries. 
It was noticeable that a sudden change in the air or time of the music had a 
great influence on the patients, and soothed or accelerated the convulsions, 
stimulating them to ecstasy, or moving them to floods of tears.</P>
<P>&quot;Nothing is more astonishing than the spectacle of these 
convulsions.</P>
<P>&quot;One who has not seen them can form no idea of them. The spectator is as 
much astonished at the profound repose of one portion of the patients as at the 
agitation of the rest.</P>
<P>&quot;Some of the patients may be seen rushing towards each other with open 
arms, and manifesting every symptom of attachment and affection.</P>
<P>&quot;All are under the power of the magnetizer; it matters not what state of 
drowsiness they may be in, the sound of his voice. a look, a motion of his 
hands, spasmodically affects them.&quot;</P>
<P>Though Mesmer, Puysegur, and their followers continued to practise magnetic 
treatment. the report of the royal commission had the effect of quenching public 
interest in the subject, though from time to time a spasmodic interest in it was 
shown by scientists. M. de Jussieu, at about the time the commission presented 
its report, suggested that it would have done well to enquire into the reality 
of the alleged cures, and to endeavour to find a satisfactory explanation for 
the phenomena they had witnessed ; while to remedy the deficiency he himself 
formulated a theory of &quot;animal heat,&quot; an organic emanation which might 
be directed by the human will. Like Mesmer and the others, he believed in action 
at a distance.</P>
<P>Mesmeric practitioners formed themselves into &quot;Societies of 
Harmony,&quot; until the political situation in France rendered their existence 
impossible. Early in the nineteenth century Petetin and Delenze published works 
on magnetism. But a new era was inaugurated with the publication in <B>1823 
</B>of Alexandra Bertrand's <I>Traite d</I>u <I>Somnambulisme, </I>followed 
three years later by a treatise <I>Da Magnetisme Animal en France. </I>Bertrand 
was a young physician of Paris, and to him belongs the honour of having 
discovered the important part played by suggestion in the phenomena of the 
induced trance. He had observed the connection between the magnetic sleep, 
epidemic ecstasy, and spontaneous sleep-walking, and declared that all the cures 
and strange symptoms which had formerly been attributed to &quot;animal 
magnetism,&quot; &quot;animal electricity,&quot; and the like, resulted from the 
suggestions of the operator acting on the imagination of a patient whose 
suggestibility was greatly increased. It is probable that had he lived longer-he 
died in <B>1831</B>, at the age of thirty-six-Bertrand would have gained a 
definite scientific standing for the facts of the induced trance; but as it was 
the practitioners of animal magnetism still held to the theory of a fluid or 
force radiating from magnetizer to subject, while those who were unable to 
accept such a doctrine, ignored the matter altogether, or treated it as vulgar 
fraud and charlatanry. Nevertheless Bertrand's works and experiments revived the 
flagging interest of the public to such an extent that in <B>1831 </B>a second 
French commission was appointed by the Royal Academy of Medicine. The report of 
this commission was not forth-coming till more than five years had elapsed, but 
when it was finally published it contained a definite testimony to the 
genuineness of the magnetic phenomena, and especially of the somnambulic state; 
and declared that the commission was satisfied of the therapeutic value of 
&quot;animal magnetism.&quot; The report was certainly not of great scientific 
worth. The name of Bertrand is not even mentioned therein, nor his theory 
considered; on the other hand, a good deal of space is given to the more 
supernatural phenomena clairvoyance, action at a distance, and the prediction by 
somnambulic patients of crises in their maladies. This is the more excusable, 
however, since these ideas were almost universally associated with somnambulism. 
Community of sensation (q.v.) was held to be a feature of the trance state, as 
was also the transference of the senses to the stomach-(See <STRONG>Stomach, 
seeing with</STRONG>) while thought-transference was suggested by some of these 
earlier investigators, notably by Deleuze, who suggested that thoughts were 
conveyed from the brain of the operator to that of the subject through the 
medium of the subtle magnetic fluid. Meanwhile the spiritualistic theory was 
becoming more and more frequently advanced to explain the&quot; magnetic&quot; 
phenomena, including both the legitimate trance phenomena and the multitude of 
supernormal phenomena which was supposed to follow the somnambulic state. This 
will doubtless account in part for the extraordinary animosity which the medical 
profession showed towards animal magnetism as a therapeutic agency. Its 
anesthetic properties they ridiculed as fraud or imagination, notwithstanding 
that serious operations, even of the amputation of limbs, could be performed 
while the patient was in the magnetic sleep. Thus Dr. John Elliotson was forced 
to resign his professorship at the University College Hospital; Dr. James 
Esdaile, a surgeon who practised at a government hospital at Calcutta, had to 
contend with much ignorance and stupid conservatism in his professional 
brethren; and similar contemptuous treatment was dealt out to other medical men, 
against whom nothing could be urged but their defence of mesmerism. In <B>1841 
</B>James Braid, a Manchester surgeon, arrived independently at the conclusions 
which Bertrand had reached some eighteen years earlier. Once more the theory of 
abnormal suggestibility was offered to explain the various phenomena of the 
so-called &quot; magnetic&quot; sleep ; and once more it was utterly ignored, 
alike by the world of science and by the public. Braid's explanation was 
essentially that which is offered now. He placed the new science-hypnotism, he 
called it, on a level with other natural sciences, above the mass of medieval 
magic and superstition in which he had found it. Yet even Braid does not seem to 
have entirely separated the chaff from the grain, for we find him countenancing 
the practice of phreno-magnetism (q.v.), a combination of mesmerism and 
phrenology wherein the entranced patient. whose head is touched by the 
operator's fingers, exhibits every sign of the emotion or quality associated 
with the phrenological organ touched. Braid asserts that a subject, entirely 
ignorant of the position of the phrenological organs, passed rapidly and 
accurately from one emotion to another, according to the portion of the scalp in 
contact with the hypnotist's fingers. His physiological explanation is a 
somewhat inadequate one, and we can only suppose that he was not fully 
appreciative of his owl, theory of suggestion. In <B>1843</B> two periodicals 
dealing with magnetism appeared-the <I>Zoist, </I>edited by Dr. Elliotson and a 
colleague, and the <I>Phreno-Magnet, </I>edited by Spencer T. Hall. The first, 
adopting a scientific tone, treated the subject mainly from a therapeutic point 
of view, while the latter was of a more popular character. Many of the adherents 
of both papers, and notably Elliotson himself, afterwards became spiritualists. 
In <B>1845</B> an additional impetus wag given to animal magnetism by the 
publication in that year of Baron von Reichenbach's researches. Reichenbach 
claimed to have discovered a new force, which he called <I>odyle, od, </I>or 
<I>odylic force, </I>and which could be seen in the. form of flames by 
&quot;sensitives.&quot; In the human being these emanations might be seen to 
radiate from the finger-tips, while they were also visible in animals and 
inanimate things. Different colours issued from the different poles of the 
magnet. Reichenbach experimented by putting his sensitives in a dark room with 
various objects-crystals, precious stones, magnets, minerals, plants, 
animals-when they could unerringly distinguish each object by the colour and 
size of the flame visible to their clairvoyant eye. These emanations were so 
invariable and so permanent that an artist might paint them, and this, indeed, 
was frequently done. Feelings of temperature, of heat or cold, were also 
experienced in connection with the odylic force. Baron von Reichenbach's 
experiments were spread over a number of years, and were made with every 
appearance of scientific care and precision, so that their effect on the 
mesmerists of the time was very considerable. But notwithstanding the mass of 
dubious phenomena which was associated with hypnotism at that time, there is no 
doubt but that the induced trance, with its therapeutic and anaesthetic value, 
would soon have come into its own had not two circumstances occurred to thrust 
it into the background. The first was the application of chloroform and ether to 
the purposes for which <I>hypnotism </I>had hitherto been used, a substitution 
which pleased the medical faculty greatly, and relieved its members from the 
necessity of studying <I>hypnotism. </I>The second circumstance was the 
introduction of the movement known as modern spiritualism, which so emphasised 
the occult side of the trance phenomena as to obscure for nearly half a century 
the true significance of induced somnambulism.</P><I>
<P>Modern Views of Hypnotism.-But </I>if the great body of medical and public 
opinion ignored the facts of <I>hypnotism </I>during the period following 
Braid's discovery, the subject did not fail to receive some attention from the 
more scientific portion of Europe, and from time to time investigators took upon 
themselves the task of enquiring into the phenomena. This was especially the 
case in France, where the science of mesmerism or <I>hypnotism </I>was most 
firmly entrenched, and where it met with least opposition. In <B>1858</B> Dr. 
Azam, of Bordeaux, investigated <I>hypnotism </I>from Braid's point of view, 
aided by a number of members of the Faculty of Paris. An account of his 
researches was published in <B>1860</B>, but cast no new light on the matter. 
Later the same set of facts were examined by Mesnet, Duval, and others. In 
<B>1875</B> Professor Richet also studied the science of artificial 
somnambulism. It is, however, from Bernheim and the Nancy school that the 
generally accepted modern view of <I>hypnotism </I>is taken. Bernheim was 
himself n disciple of Liebeault, who, working on independent lines, had reached 
the conclusions of Bertrand and Braid and once more formulated the doctrine of 
suggestion. Bernheim's work <I>De la Suggestion, </I>published in <B>1884</B>, 
embodied the theories of Liebeault and the result of Bernheim's own researches 
therein. According to this view, then, <I>hypnotism </I>is a purely 
psychological process. and is induced by mental influences. The 
&quot;passes&quot; of Mesmer and the magnetic philosophers, the elaborate 
preparations of the <I>baquet, </I>the strokings of Valentine Greatrakes, and 
all the multitudinous ceremonies with which the animal magnetists were wont to 
produce the artificial sleep, were only of service in inducing a state of 
expectation in the patient, or in providing a soothing and monotonous, or 
violent, sensory stimulus. And so also with the modern methods of inducing 
<I>hypnosis; </I>the fixation of the eyes, the contact of the operators hand, 
the sound of his voice, are only effective through the medium of the subject's 
mentality. Other investigators who played a large part in popularising 
<I>hypnotism </I>were Professor J. M. Charcot, of the Salpetriere, Paris, a 
distinguished pathologist, and R. Heidenhain, professor of physiology at 
Breslau. The former taught that the hypnotic condition was essentially a morbid 
one, and allied to hysteria; a theory which, becoming widely circulated, 
exercised a somewhat detrimental effect on the practice of hypnotism for 
therapeutic purposes, till it was at length proved erroneous. Even now a 
prejudice lingers, particularly in this country, against the use of the induced 
hypnotic trance in medicine. Heidenhain, again, laid stress on the physical 
operations to induce s<B>6</B>mnambulism, believing that thereby a peculiar 
state of the nervous system was brought about, wherein the control of the higher 
nerve centres was temporarily removed, so that the suggestion of the operator 
was free to express itself automatically through the physical organism of the 
patient. The physiological theory also is somewhat misleading; nevertheless its 
exponents have done good work in bringing the undoubted facts of hypnosis into 
prominence. Besides these theories there is another which is to be met with 
chiefly in its native France-the old doctrine of a magnetic fluid. But it is 
rapidly dying out. Among the symptoms which may safely, and without reference to 
the supernatural, be regarded as attendant on <I>hypnotism </I>are the 
<I>rapport </I>between patient and operator, implicit obedience on the part of 
the former to the smallest suggestion, whether given verbally or by look, 
gesture, or any unconscious action, anaesthesia, positive and negative 
hallucinations, the fulfillment of post-hypnotic promises, control of organic 
processes and of muscles not ordinarily under voluntary control. Other phenomena 
which have been allied from time to time with magnetism, mesmerism, or 
<I>hypnotism, </I>and for which there is not the same scientific basis; are 
clairvoyance, telekinesia, transference of the senses from the ordinary 
sense-organs to some other parts of the body, usually the finger tips or the pit 
of the stomach, community of sensation, and the ability to commune with the 
dead. The majority of these, like the remarkable phenomena of phreno-magnetism, 
can be directly traced to the effect of suggestion on the imagination of the 
patient. Ignorant as were the protagonists of mesmerism with regard to the great 
suggestibility of the magnetised subject, it is hardly surprising that they saw 
new and supernormal faculties and agencies at work during the trance state. To 
the same ignorance of the possibilities of suggestion and hyperaesthesia may be 
referred the common belief that the hypnotizer can influence his subject by the 
power of his will alone, and secure obedience to commands which are only 
mentally expressed. At the same time it must be borne in mind that if the 
growing belief in telepathy be accepted, there is a possibility that the 
operation of thought transference may be more freely carried out during 
hypnosis, and it is notable, in this respect, that the most fruitful of the 
telepathic experiments conducted by psychical researchers and others have been 
made with hypnotized percipients. <I>(See </I><STRONG>Telepathy.</STRONG>)</P>
<P>Among numerous explanations of the physiological conditions accompanying the 
hypnotic state there is one, the theory of cerebral dissociation, which is now 
generally accepted of science, and which may be briefly outlined as follows. The 
brain is composed of innumerable groups of nerve cells, all more or less closely 
connected with each other by means of nervous links or paths of variable 
resistance. Excitement of any of these groups, whether by means of impressions 
received through the sense organs or by the communicated activity of other 
groups, will, if sufficiently intense, occasion the rise into consciousness of 
an idea. In the normal waking state the resistance of the nervous 
association-paths is fairly low, so that the activity is easily communicated 
from one neural group to another. Thus the main idea which reaches the upper 
stratum of consciousness is attended by a stream of other, subconscious ideas, 
which has the effect of checking the primary idea and preventing its complete 
dominance. Now the abnormal dominance of one particular system of ideas-that 
suggested by the operator-together with the complete suppression of all rival 
systems, is the principal fact to be explained in hypnosis. To some extent the 
physiological process conditioning hypnosis suggests an analogy with normal 
sleep. When one composes himself to sleep there is a lowering of cerebral 
excitement and a proportionate increase in the resistance of the neural links; 
and this is precisely what happens during hypnosis, the essential passivity of 
the subject raising the resistance of the association-paths. But in normal 
sleep, unless some exciting cause he present, all the neural dispositions are at 
rest, whereas in the latter case such a complete suspension of cerebral 
activities is not permitted, since the operator, by means of voice, gestures, 
and manipulations of the patient's limbs, keeps alive that set of impressions 
relating to himself. One neural disposition is thus isolated, so that any idea 
suggested by the operator is free to work itself out in action, without being 
submitted to the checks of the sub-activity of other ideas. The alienation is 
less or more complete according as the degree of <I>hypnotism </I>is light or 
heavy, hut a comparatively slight raising of resistance in the neural links 
suffices to secure the dominance of ideas suggested by the hypnotizer. 
Hyperaesthesia, than which perhaps no phenomenon is more frequently mentioned in 
connection with the hypnotic state, really belongs to the doubtful class, since 
it has not yet been decided whether or no an actual sharpening or refining of 
the senses takes place. Alternatively it may be suggested that the accurate 
perception of very faint sense-impressions, which seems to furnish evidence for 
hyperaesthesia, merely recalls the fact that the excitement conveyed through the 
sensory nerve operates with extraordinary force, being freed from the 
restriction of sob-excitement in adjacent neural groups and systems. In 
accepting this view-point we concede that in normal life very feeble sensory 
stimuli must act on nerve and brain just as they do in hypnosis, save that in 
the former case they are so stifled amid a multitude of similar impressions that 
they fail to reach consciousness. In any case the occasional abnormal 
sensitiveness of the subject to very slight sensory stimuli is a fact of 
hypnotism as well authenticated as anesthesia itself, and the term 
hyperaesthesia,&quot; if not entirely justified, may for want of a better be 
practically applied to the observed phenomenon. The hypnotic state is not 
necessarily induced by a second person. &quot; Spontaneous&quot; hypnotism and 
&quot;auto-hypnotisation&quot; are well known to science. Certain Indian fakirs 
and the shamans of uncivilised races can produce in themselves a state closely 
approximating to hypnosis, by a prolonged fixation of the eyes, and by other 
means. The mediumistic trance is also, as will be shown hereafter, a case in 
point.</P><I>
<P>Hypnotism and Spiritualism.-Spiritualism </I>is a legacy directly bequeathed 
by the magnetic philosophers of medieval times, and through them, from the still 
older astrologers and magi. It has been shown that at a very early date 
phenomena of a distinctly hypnotic character were ascribed to the workings of 
spiritual agencies, whether angelic or demoniac, by a certain percentage of the 
observers Thus Greatrakes and Gassner believed themselves to have been gifted 
with a divine power to heal diseases. Cases of ecstasy, catalepsy and other 
trance states were given a spiritual significance &ndash; i.e., demons, angels, 
elementals, and so on, were supposed to speak through the lips of the possessed. 
Witchcraft, in which the force of hypnotic suggestion seems to have operated in 
a very large degree, was thought to result from the witches' traffic with the 
Prince of Darkness and his legions. Even in some cases the souls of deceased men 
and women were identified with these intelligences, though not generally until 
the time of Swedenborg. Though the movement known as &quot;modern 
spiritualism&quot; is usually dated from <B>1848</B>, the year of the 
&quot;Rochester Rappings,&quot; the real growth of spiritualism was much more 
gradual, and its roots were hidden in animal magnetism. Emanuel Swendenborg, 
whose affinities with the magnetists have already been referred to, exercised a 
remarkable influence on the spiritualistic thought of America and Europe, and 
was in a sense the founder of that faith. Automatic phenomena were even then a 
feature of the magnetic trance, and clairvoyance, community of sensation, and 
telepathy were believed in generally, and regarded by many as evidences of 
spiritual communication. In Germany Professor Jung-Stilling, Dr. C. Romer, Dr. 
Werner, and the poet and physician Justinus Kerner, were among those who held 
opinions on these lines, the latter pursuing his investigations with a 
somnambule who became famous as the &quot; Seerers of Prevorst &quot;-Frau 
Frederica Hauffe. Frau Hauffe could see and converse with the spirits of the 
deceased, and gave evidence of prophetic vision and clairvoyance. Physical 
phenomena were witnessed in her presence, knockings, rattling of chains, 
movement of objects without contact, and, in short, such manifestations as were 
characteristic of the poltergeist family. She was, moreover, the originator of a 
&quot;primeval&quot; language, which she declared was that spoken by the 
patriarchs. Thus Frau Hauffe, though only a somnambule, or magnetic patient, 
possessed had the qualities of a successful spiritualistic medium. In England 
also there were many circumstances of a supernatural character associated with 
mesmerism. Dr. Elliotson, who, as has been indicated, was one of the best-known 
of English magnetists, became in time converted to a spiritualistic theory, as 
offering an explanation of the clairvoyance and similar phenomena which he 
thought to have observed in his patients. France, the headquarters of the 
rationalist school of magnetism, had, indeed, a good deal less to show of 
spiritualistic opinion. Nonetheless even in that country the latter doctrine 
made its appearance at intervals prior to <B>1848</B>. J. P. F. Deleuze, a good 
scientist and an earnest protagonist of magnetism, who published his <I>Histoire 
Critique da Magnetisme Animal </I>in <B>1813</B>, was said to have embraced the 
doctrines of spiritualism before he died. Dr. G. P. Billot was another believer 
in spirit communication, and one who succeeded in obtaining physical phenomena 
in the presence of his somnambules. It is, however, in the person of Alphonse 
Cahagnet, a man of humble origin who began to study induced somnambulism about 
the year <B>1845</B>, and who thereafter experimented with somnambules, that we 
encounter the first French spiritualist of distinction. So good was the evidence 
for spirit communication furnished by Cahagnet and his subjects that it remains 
among the best which the annals of the movement can produce. In America, Laroy 
Sunderland, Andrew Jackson Davis, and others who became pillars of spiritualism 
in that country were first attracted to it through the study of magnetism. 
Everywhere we find hypnotism and spiritualism identified with each other until 
in <B>1848</B> a definite split occurs, and the two go their separate ways. Even 
yet, however, the separation is not quite complete. In the first place, the 
mediumistic trance is obviously a variant of spontaneous or self-induced 
hypnotism, while in the second, many of the most striking phenomena of tile 
seance-room have been matched time and again in the records of animal magnetism. 
For instance, the diagnosis of disease and prescription of remedies dictated by 
the control to the ' healing medium&quot; have their prototype in the cures of 
Valentine Greatrakes, or of Mesmer and his disciples. Automatic 
phenomena-speaking in &quot;tongues&quot; and so forth-early formed a 
characteristic feature of the induced trance and kindred states. While even the 
physical phenomena, movement without contact, apports, rappings, were witnessed 
in connection with magnetism long before the movement known as modern 
spiritualism was so much as thought of. In many instances, though not in all, we 
can trace the operation of hypnotic suggestion in the automatic phenomena, just 
as we can perceive the result of fraud in much of the physical manifestations. 
The question whether after the factors of hypnotism and fraud have been removed, 
a section of the phenomena remains inexplicable say by the hypothesis of 
communication with the spirit-world is one which has been in the past, and is 
to-day, answered in the affirmative by many men of the highest distinction in 
their various walks of life, and one which we would do well to treat with due 
circumspection. This, however, is reserved for consideration elsewhere, the 
scope of the present article being to show how largely spiritualism has borrowed 
from the fact of hypnotism. <I>(See </I><STRONG>Suggestion.</STRONG>)</P>
<P>In <I>M. </I>Larelig's biography of the celebrated painter, Wiertz, and also 
in the introductory and biographical note affixed to the <I>CataIogue Raisonne 
du Musee Wiertz </I>by Dr. S. Watteau, <B>1865</B>, is to be found a detailed 
description of an extremely curious hypnotic experiment in which Wiertz was the 
hypnotic subject and a friend, a doctor, the hypnotiser. Wiertz had long been 
haunted by a desire to know whether thought persisted in a head severed from the 
trunk. His wish was the reason of the following experiment being undertaken, 
this being facilitated through his friendship with the prison doctor in 
Brussels, and another outside practitioner. The latter had been for many years a 
hypnotic operator, and had more than once put Wiertz into the hypnotic state, 
regarding him as an excellent subject. About this time a trial for murder in the 
Place Saint-Gery had been causing a great sensation in Belgium and the painter 
had been following the proceedings closely. The trial ended in the condemnation 
of the accused. A plan was arranged and Wiertz, with the consent of the prison 
doctor, obtained permission to hide with his friend, Dr. D., under the 
guillotine, close to where the head of the condemned would roll into the basket. 
In order to carry out the scheme he had determined upon more efficiently, the 
painter desired his hypnotiser to put him through a regular course of hypnotic 
suggestion, and when in the sleep state to command him to identify himself with 
various people and tell him to read their thoughts and penetrate into their 
psychical and mental states. The following is a resume' given in <I>Le Progres 
Spirite </I>:-&quot; On the day of execution, ten minutes before the arrival of 
the condemned man, Wiertz, accompanied by his friend the physician with two 
witnesses, ensconced themselves underneath the guillotine, where they were 
entirely hidden from sight. The painter was then put to sleep, and told to 
identify himself with the criminal. He was to follow his thoughts and feel any 
sensations, which he was to express aloud. He was also suggested ' to take 
special note of mental conditions during decapitation, so that when the head 
fell in the basket he could penetrate the brain and give an account of its last 
thoughts. Wiertz became entranced almost immediately, and the four friends soon 
understood by the sounds overhead that the executioner was conducting the 
condemned to the scaffold, and in another minute the guillotine would have done 
its work. The hypnotized Wiertz manifested extreme distress and begged to be 
de-magnetised, as his sense of oppression was insupportable. It was too late, 
however-the knife fell. 'What do you feel? What do you see ? ' asks the doctor. 
Wiertz writhes convulsively and replies, 'Lightning ! A thunderbolt falls ! It 
thinks; it sees ! ' Who thinks and sees? 'The head. It suffers horribly. It 
thinks and feels but does not understand what has happened. It seeks its body 
and feels that the body must join it. It still waits for the supreme blow for 
death, but death does not come.' As Wiertz spoke the witnesses saw the head 
which had fallen into the basket and lay looking at them horribly; its arteries 
still palpitating. It was only after some moments of suffering that apparently 
the guillotined head at last became aware that is was separated from its body. 
Wiertz became calmer and seemed exhausted, while the doctor resumed his 
questions. - The painter answered :- I fly through space like a top spinning 
through fire. But am I dead ? Is all over ? If only they would let me join my 
body again! Have pity! give it back to me and I can live again. I remember all. 
There are the judges in red robes. I hear the sentence. Oh! my wretched wife and 
children. I am abandoned. If only you would put my body to me, I should be with 
you once more. You refuse? All the same I love you, my poor babies. Miserable 
wretch that I am I have covered you with blood. When will this finish! - or is 
not a murderer condemned to eternal punishment ? ' As Wiertz spoke these words 
the witnesses thought they detected the eyes of the decapitated head open wide 
with a look of unmistakable suffering and of beseeching. The painter continued 
his lamentations. 'No, such suffering cannot endure for ever; God is merciful. 
All that belongs to earth is fading away. I see in the distance a little light 
glittering like a diamond. I feel a calm stealing over me. What a good sleep I 
shall have I What joy I ' These were the last words the painter spoke. He was 
still entranced, but no longer replied to the questions put by the doctor. They 
then approached the head and Dr. D. touched the forehead, the temples, and teeth 
and found they were cold. The head was dead.&quot;</P>
<P>In the Wiertz Gallery in Brussels are to be found three pictures of a 
guillotined head, presumably the outcome of this gruesome experiment.</P>
