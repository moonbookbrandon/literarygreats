<P>Y-Kim, Book of : </B>A Chinese mystical book<B> </B>attributed to the Emperor 
Fo-Hi, and ascribed to the year, <B>1468</B> B.C. It consists of ten chapters, 
and is stated by Eliphas Levi in his <I>History of Magic </I>to be a complement 
and an appendix to the Kabalistic <I>Zohar, </I>or record of the utterances of 
Rabbi Simeon Ben Jochai. The <I>Zohar, </I>says Levi, explains universal 
equilibrium, and the <I>Y-Kim </I>is the hieroglyphic and ciphered demonstration 
thereof. The key to the <I>Y-Kim </I>is a pantacle known as the Trigrams of 
Fo-Hi. In the <I>Vay-Ky </I>of Leon-Tao-Yuen, composed in the Som dynasty (about 
eleventh century) it is recounted that the Emperor Fo-Hi was one day seated on 
the banks of a river, deep in meditation, when to him there appeared an animal 
having the parts of both a horse and a dragon. Its back was covered with scales, 
on each of which shone the mystic Trigrammic symbol. This animal initiated the 
just and righteous Fo-Hi into universal science. Numbering its scales, he 
combined the Trigrams in such a manner that there arose in his mind a synthesis 
of sciences compared and united with one another through the harmonies of 
nature. From this synthesis sprang the tables of the <I>Y-Kim. </I>The numbers 
of Fo-Hi are identical with those of the Kabala, and his pantacle is similar to 
that of Solomon. His tables are in correspondence with the subject-matter of the 
<I>Sephir Yetzirah </I>and the <I>Zohar. </I>The whole is a commentary upon the 
Absolute which is concealed from the profane, concludes Levi, but as he had 
little real acquaintance with the subject, these analogies must be taken as of 
small value.</P><B>

<P>Yaksha or Jak : </B>A<B> </B>species of Indian fiend or imp. Says Mr. Crookes 
: &quot; The <I>Jak </I>is the modern representative of the <I>Yaksha, </I>who 
in better times was the attendant of Kuvera, the god of wealth, in which duty he 
was assisted by the Guhyaka. The character of the <I>Yaksha </I>is not very 
certain. He was called Punya-janas, &quot;the good people,&quot; but he 
sometimes appears as an imp of evil. In the folk-tales, it must be admitted, the 
<I>Yakshas </I>have an equivocal reputation. In one story the female, or 
<I>Yahshini, </I>bewilders travellers at night, makes horns grow on their 
foreheads, and finally devours them; in another the <I>Yakshas </I>have, like 
the <I>Churel, </I>feet turned the wrong way and squinting eyes; in a third they 
separate the hero from the heroine because he failed to make due offerings to 
them on his wedding day. On the other hand, in a fourth tale the Yakshini is 
described as possessed of heavenly beauty; she appears again when a sacrifice is 
made in a cemetery to get her into the hero's power, as a heavenly maiden 
beautifully adorned, seated in a chariot of gold surrounded by lovely girls; and 
lastly, a Brahman meets some Buddhist ascetics, performs the <I>Uposhana 
</I>vow, and would have become a god, had it not been that a wicked man 
compelled him by force to take food in the evening, and so he was re-born as a 
<I>Guhyaha.</I></P>
<P>&quot;In the modern folk-lore of Kashmir, the <I>Yaksha </I>has turned into 
the <I>Yech </I>or <I>Yach, </I>a humorous, though powerful, sprite in the shape 
of a civet cat of a dark colour, with a white cap on his head. This small high 
cap is one of the marks of the Irish fairies, and the <I>Incubones </I>of Italy 
wear caps, ' the symbols of their hidden, secret natures. The feet of the 
<I>Yech </I>are so small as to be almost invisible, and it squeaks in a feline 
way. It can assume any shape, and if its white cap can be secured, it becomes 
the servant of the possessor, and the white cap makes him invisible.</P>
<P>&quot;In the <I>Vishnu Purana </I>we read that Vishnu created the <I>Yaks has 
</I>as beings emaciate with hunger, of hideous aspect, and with big beards, and 
that from their habit of crying for food they were so named. By the Buddhists 
they were regarded as benignant spirits. One of them acts as sort of chorus in 
the <I>Meghaduta </I>or &lsquo;Cloud Messenger ' of Kalidasa. Yet we read of the 
<I>Yaka Alawaka, </I>who, according to the Buddhist legend, used to live in a 
Banyan tree, and slay any one who approached it; while in Ceylon they are 
represented as demons whom Buddha destroyed. In later Hinduism they are 
generally of fair repute, and one of them was appointed by Indra to be the 
attendant of the Jaina Saint Mahavira.&quot;</P><B>

<P>Yeats, William Butler : </B>Irish Author and Mystic. <I>William Butler Yeats 
</I>was born at Dublin in <B>1866</B>, his father being John Yeats, a talented 
portrait-painter whose works include a fine likeness of Synge; and during his 
boyhood the future author lived chiefly at his native town, and occasionally 
with his grandparents in County Sligo. At first he intended to make painting his 
life's work, and accordingly he entered the Dublin Art School; but he soon left 
it, having realised that his true bent was for Literature; and in <B>1887</B> he 
went to London, where he became intimate with Mr. Arthur Symons, and 
subsequently with Mr. George Moore. Prior to this Mr. Yeats had issued a little 
play, <I>Mosada; </I>and now his gifts began to develop apace, the result being 
sundry volumes of beautiful poetry, notably <I>The' Wanderings of Oisin </I>and 
<I>The Wind among the' Reeds. </I>At this time, also, the author began to show 
himself an eminently thoughtful critic of literature ; while in <B>1870</B> he 
published a collection of Irish folk tales, and in the preface thereto he 
observed in relation to his compatriots that &quot;a true literary 
consciousness-national to the centre-seems gradually to be forming out of all 
this disguising and prettyfing this penumbra of half-culture. We are preparing 
likely enough for a new Irish literary movement.&quot; Nor was the prophecy 
unfulfilled, for, during the closing decade of the <B>19</B>th century, the 
intellectuals of Ireland began to manifest a tense interest in their country's 
legendary lore, while simultaneously it transpired that the rising generation of 
writers in Ireland included many men of fine promise. Most of these last 
regarded <I>Mr. Yeats </I>as their leader, they rallied round him, he returned 
from London to Ireland, and anon he achieved the founding of the Irish Literary 
Theatre in Dublin, its <I>raison d'etre </I>being the staging of plays by the 
new school of Hibernian authors.</P>
<P>This is not the place to detail the Irish artistic revival of the nineties of 
last century, and the reader may be referred to the monograph thereon by Mr. H. 
S. Krans, and more especially to Mr. George Moores' <I>Hail and Farewell. 
</I>Passing to speak of <I>Mr. Yeats' </I>contributions to the literature of 
Mysticism, these are mostly contained in a volume of collected essays, <I>Ideas 
of Good and Evil; </I>and prominent among them are studies of the mystic element 
in Blake and Shelley, while another notable paper is one concerned with 
&quot;The Body of the Father Christian Rosencrux.&quot; But still more important 
than these, perhaps, is a long study of &quot;Magic,&quot; contained in the same 
volume, and here the author begins by bravely stating his creed &quot; I believe 
in the practice and philosophy of what we have agreed to call magic, and what I 
must call the evocation of spirits, though I do not know what they are, in the 
power of creating magical illusions, in the visions of truth in the depths of 
the mind when the eyes are closed </P>
<P>After this declaration he tells how once an acquaintance of his, gathering 
together a small party in a darkened room, held a mace over&quot; a tablet of 
many coloured squares, at the same time repeating &quot;a form of words &quot; ; 
and straightway <I>Mr. Yeats </I>found that his&quot; imagination began to move 
of itself, and to bring before me vivid images. He goes on to descant on these 
visions, while in the remainder of his essay he offers some details about 
superstitions in remote parts of Ireland ; and also furnishes sundry examples of 
thought-transmission and the like, most of them fresh and interesting.</P>
<P>But the author's interest in the supernatural does not transpire only in his 
prose, and, turning to his poems, one finds them permeated by a curious kind of 
mysticism which is perhaps essentially Celtic. For <I>Mr. Yeats, </I>it would 
seem, is only incidentally interested in holding communications with the dead, 
or with the spirit-world ; yet, like old bards of his native Ireland, he seems 
to find inanimate nature a living reality, he seems to have a strange intimacy 
therewith. A dreamer of dreams and a beholder of visions, he frequently 
crystalises these in his verse ; but the mystic element in his output consists 
pre-eminently in this, that he appears to hold actual converse with all those 
things which to ordinary men are no more than lifeless with. flowers and trees, 
with rivers, lakes and mountains. W.G. B. M.</P><B>

<P>Yoga : </B>meaning &quot; union,&quot; is applied in theosophy to assistance 
rendered to evolutionary process. The theosophical idea of evolution postulates 
a universal consciousness from which particular consciousness has come and to 
which each is returning along the path of evolution. The journey along this path 
can be quickened by the <I>Yoga, </I>the union of each particular with the 
universal consciousness. By the concentration of thought on any particular idea, 
that idea, in course of time becomes worked into the constitution of the 
thinker, so that, if the thought be good he will correspondingly help on the 
process of evolution. This general principle, applied in the light of past 
experience to the multifarious activities of the human mind, is of vast 
importance and influence in the moulding of the characters both of individuals 
and communities. </P><I>
