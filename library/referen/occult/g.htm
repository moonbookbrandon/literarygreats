<P>Galactides or Galaricides :</B> Perhaps a species of emerald. It is greatly 
valued by magicians, its property being to make magical writings heard, and 
ghosts appear, to return answers. It promotes love and friendship.</P><B>

<P>Galeotti, Martius : </B>Italian Astrologer (<B>1442</B>-<B>1494</B>). Born in 
<B>1442</B>, this Italian astrologer and theologian, appears to have been a 
native of Narni, in Umbria; but it would seem that he left italy while a young 
man, and settled for a while at Boulogne. Here, he gave grave offence to the 
Church of Rome by promulgating the doctrine that good works are not the road to 
salvation, and that this is only to be obtained by faith in Christ; and, finding 
the priests around him growing daily more and more hostile, <I>Galeotti </I>saw 
fit to leave France for Hungary, where he became secretary to the king, Matthias 
Covirnus, and also tutor to the latter's son, Prince John. His secretarial and 
tutorial duties, however, did not occupy the whole of his time; and, besides 
making himself an expert astrologer, he wrote a book called, <I>De jocose Dictis 
et Foctis Regis Matchiae Covirni. </I>Some of the tenets contained therein were 
the means of his incurring fresh ill-will from the clergy ; and eventually, 
their rancour became so great, indeed, that the writer was seized and taken to 
Venice, where he was imprisoned for a while. He was released anon, chiefly owing 
to the influence of the Pope, Sixtus IV, whose tutor he is said to have been at 
an earlier and indeterminate date; and, thereupon, <I>Galeotti </I>returned to 
France, where he came under the notice of the king, Louis XI., who appointed him 
his state-astrologer. Thenceforth, for many years, the Italian acted in this 
onerous capacity, sometimes living within the precincts of the royal castle of 
Plessis-les-Tours, sometimes at the town of Lyons ; and once, in <B>1478</B>, 
while staying at the latter place, and being informed that Louis was 
approaching, he rode out to meet him, fell from his horse, and died shortly 
afterwards as a result of injuries sustained in the fall.</P>
<P>An especial interest attaches to <I>Galeotti </I>in that lie appears in Sir 
Walter Scott's inimitable story of mediaeval France, <I>Quentin Durward. 
</I>Early in the tale, soon after Quentin has entered the Scots Guard of Louis 
XI., the latter and his new guardsman are depicted as visiting the astrologer, 
the King being anxious for a prophecy regarding Quentin's immediate future. The 
scene is a very memorable and a one, among the best in the whole book; and it is 
historically valuable, moreover, containing, as it does, what is probably a 
fairly accurate description of the kind of study used generally by an astrologer 
in the middle ages. <I>Galeotti </I>is represented, curiously examining a 
specimen, just issued from the Frankfurt Press, of the newly invented art of 
printing&quot; ; and the King questions him about this novel process, whereupon 
the seer speaks of the vast changes it is destined to bring about throughout the 
whole world. Now, it was by no means thoughtlessly or carelessly, that Sir 
Walter introduced this passage, for, though the novelist himself does not refer 
to the matter in his notes, and though Andrew Lang says nothing thereon in those 
annotations which he furnished for the &quot;Border Waverley,&quot; it is a fact 
that Louis was keenly interested in printing; and, soon after the craft first 
made its appearance, the King commissioned the director of his mint, one 
Nicholas Janson or Jenson, to give up his present post in favour of studying 
typography, with a view to its being carried on in France. </P>

<P>Galigai, Leonora :</B> Wife of the -Marechal d'Ancre Concino Concini, who was 
killed by the populace, in <B>1617</B>. She was believed to be a sorceress, and 
was said to have bewitched the Queen. In her possession were found three volumes 
full of magic characters, besides charms and amulets. At her trial, it was 
established that the Marechal and his wife had consulted magicians, astrologers, 
and sorcerers, and had made use of waxen images, and that they had brought 
sorcerers from Nancy to sacrifice cocks, besides working many other sorceries 
and deeds of darkness. It is said that on. her own confession, she was 
condemned, and was beheaded and burnt in <B>1617</B>. But when President Courtin 
asked her by what charm she had bewitched the Queen, she replied, proudly : My 
spell was the power of a strong mind over a weak one.&quot; </P>

<P>Gargates :</B> A black species of electrum or amber, now called jet. To 
electrum are attributed many occult virtues of a tell-tale character, and 
according to Pliny, a cup of this substance had the property of discovering 
poison, by showing certain half-circles, like rainbows, in the liquor, which 
also sparkles and hisses as if on fire.</P>

<P>Garinet, Jules :</B> Author of a <I>History of Magic in France, </I>Paris, 
<B>1818</B>. In this curious work will be found a description of the Sabbath, a 
dissertation on demons, a discourse on the superstitions connected with magic 
among the ancients and the moderns.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Garlic :</B> A species of onion, cultivated throughout Europe, to which is 
attributed certain occult properties. It is believed by the Greeks and the Turks 
that the use of this vegetable, or even the mention of its name, is a sure charm 
against the evil eye,&quot; and against vampires (q.v.). New-built houses and 
the sterns of boats belonging to Greece and Turkey, have long bunches of 
<I>garlic </I>hanging from them as a preventive against the fatal envy of any 
ill-disposed person.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Gastromancy :</B> or Divination from the Belly, is now generally explained by 
ventriloquism, the voice in both cases sounding low and hollow, as if issuing 
from the ground. Salverte enforces this opinion, and adds: &quot;The name of 
<I>Engastrimythes, </I>given by the Greeks to the Pythiae (priestesses of 
Apollo) indicates that they made use of this artifice.&quot; The explanation is 
only partial, and the text of Isaiah: &quot;Thy voice shall die as one that hath 
a familiar spirit,&quot; is inapplicable in such an argument. Those who are 
experienced in clairvoyance are aware that the voice is often reduced very low, 
in consequence of a change in the respiration. This was the case with some of 
the ancient Pythonesses, though instances may have occurred when ventriloquism 
was resorted to, as by the wizards of Green-land in our own time.</P>
<P>Another method of practising the ancient <I>gastromancy </I>connects it with 
crystal-seeing, as vessels of glass, round, and full of clear water, were used, 
which were placed before several lighted candles. In this case, a young boy or 
girl was generally the seer, and the demon was summoned in a low voice by the 
magician. Replies were then obtained from the magical appearances seen in the 
illuminated glass vessels.</P>

<P>Gaudlllon, Pierre:</B> A sorcerer, who was burned in <B>1610</B>, for going 
about at night in the form of a hare.</P><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Gaufridi, Louis :</B> A French ecclesiastic, burned as a sorcerer at Aix, in 
<B>1611</B>. He was a cure at Marseilles, where his attractive person and 
manners gained for him a footing in high society, but for all his priestly garb, 
he led an evil life. A girl whom he had seduced was sent by her parents to a 
convent of Ursulines, and here <I>Gaufridi </I>followed her, making the 
credulous nuns believe that a legion of demons possessed the convent. At the 
instance of the exorcist, who relieved the &quot;possessed&quot; nuns 
<I>Gaufridi </I>was tried at Aix, and condemned to be burned alive.</P><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Gauher-Abad :</B> Meaning the Abode of Jewels. This was the name given to one 
of the capitals of the peris of Persian romance. These were beings of an angelic 
or well-disposed nature, who inhabited the earth, along with the divs or 
evil-disposed, before the creation of man. After this event, the peris became 
inhabitants of the aerial regions, and had three capitals: Shad-u-kam (pleasure 
and desire), Gauherabad, and Amber-abad (city of Ambergris).</P>

<P>Gauthier, Jean : </B>An alchemist. Charles IX. of France, deceived by his 
promises, had him provided with a hundred and twenty thousand pounds, with which 
to make gold, and the adept set to work. But after he had worked for a week, he 
ran away with the King's money. He was pursued, captured, and hanged.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Gauthier of Bruges :</B> It is related that a Franciscan monk, made a bishop 
by Pope Nicholas III., and deposed by Clement V., appealed to God against his 
deposition, and asked that he should be buried with his act of appeal in his 
hand. Some time after his death, Pope Clement V., visited Poitiers, and, finding 
himself one day in a Franciscan monastery, asked to see the remains of him whom 
he had deposed. He caused the tomb to be opened, and was horrified to see 
<I>Gauthier of Bruges </I>presenting his act of appeal, with a withered 
hand.</P>

<P>Gbalo :</B> An order of priests among the Ga people of the Gold Coast, west 
of Togoland.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Geber :</B> otherwise Abou Moussah Djafar al Sofi, was a native of Haman, in 
Mesopotamia, or, according to other accounts, a Spanish Moor, born at Savile, 
somewhere about the end of the eighth century, though all dates concerning him 
are extremely doubtful. Practically nothing is known of his life. He undertook 
wide experiments in metallurgy and chemistry, with the object of discovering the 
constituent elements of metals, in the course of which he stumbled upon nitric 
acid and red oxide of mercury. It is, indeed, upon actual discoveries that his 
reputation is based, and not upon the many spurious treatises which have been 
attributed to him, and which embrace the entire gamut of the sciences. His 
alleged extant works, which are in Latin, cannot but be regarded with suspicion, 
especially as several mediaeval writers adopted his name. It is believed, 
however, that the library at Leyden, and the Imperial Library at Paris, contain 
Arabic manuscripts, which might be referred to his authorship. His <I>Sum of 
Perfection, </I>and his <I>Investigation into the Perfection of Metals </I>are 
his most important works, a complete edition of which was published at Dantzic, 
in <B>1682</B>, and again in the <I>Bibliotheca Chemica Curiosa, of 
</I>Mangetus, published at Cologne, in <B>1702</B>. The <I>Sum of Perfection 
</I>professes to draw its inspiration from alchemical authors, who lived 
previous to <I>Geber, </I>but as alchemy was then not very far advanced, the 
derivation is an unlikely one. We are told in its pages that success in the 
great art is only to be achieved by rigid adherence to natural law. A spirit of 
great strength and a dry water are spoken of as the elements of the natural 
principle. The philosophical furnace and its arrangement is dealt with in 
detail, as is the philosopher's vessel, a vase of glass with several intricate 
details difficult of comprehension. There is no dubiety, however, regarding the 
absolutely physical basis of metallurgy, upon which the work is composed, and it 
contains no hint of allegory or the achievement of success through supernatural 
agency.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Gehenna (otherwise Hell) :</B> The word is derived from the Hebrew <I>ge 
</I>and <I>Hinnom, </I>the Valley of Hinnom-originally a valley in Palestine 
where the Jews passed their children through the fire to Moloch, the god of the 
Ammonites. <I>Gehenna </I>is popularly regarded as a place of torment to which 
the wicked are consigned when they leave this earth: it is pictured as a 
bottomless pit, lit only by the fire which is never quenched. In Dante and 
Milton, we have diverse descriptions of Hell-the one of unutterable anguish, 
horror and despair; the other more sublimely imaginative, and pierced with rays 
of faith and love. The locality of Hell, and the duration of its torments, have 
for centuries been the subject of much questioning. By some, it is believed, 
that there is a purgatorial region-a kind of upper <I>Gehenna, </I>&quot;in 
which the souls of just men are cleansed by a temporary punishment&quot; before 
they are admitted to Heaven. It was believed that during this period the soul 
could revisit the places and persons whom it had loved. By the Persians, 
<I>Geheisna </I>was understood as the place inhabited by the divs, or rebellious 
angels, and to which they had been confined when they refused to bow down before 
the first man. <I>Gehenna </I>is used in the New Testament for Hell, and is 
practically synonymous with the Greek &quot; Hades.&quot;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Gematria :</B> along with <I>temurah, </I>was the science of the dual 
interpretation of the Kabalistic alphabet, which composed the notary art, which 
is fundamentally the complete science of the <I>tarot </I>(q.v.) signs and their 
complex and varied application to the definition of all secrets.</P>

<P>Genealum Dierum :</B> <I>(See </I><B>Avicenna.</B>)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Genius :</B> Is generally used as the name of a superior class of aerial 
beings, holding an intermediate rank between mortals and immortals. That, at 
least, appears to be the signification of Daemon,&quot; the corresponding term 
in Greek. It is probable, that the whole system of Demonology was invented by 
the Platonic philosophers, and engrafted by degrees on the popular mythology. 
The Platonists professed, however, to derive their doctrines from the theology 
of the ancients,&quot; so that this system may have come originally from the 
East, where it formed a part of the tenets of Zoroaster. This sage ascribed all 
the operations of nature to the agency of celestial beings, the ministers of one 
supreme first cause, to whose most visible and brilliant image, Fire, homage was 
paid as his representative. Some Roman writers speak of &quot; the 
<I>Genius&quot; </I>as &quot; the God of Nature,&quot; or &quot; Nature&quot; 
itself but their notions seem to have been modified by, if not formed from, 
etymological considerations, more likely to mislead than to afford a certain 
clue to the real meaning of the term. At a later period, they supposed almost 
every created thing, animate or inanimate, to be protected by its guardian 
<I>genius, </I>a sort of demi-god. who presided over its birth, and was its 
constant companion till its death. Thus, Censorinus, who lived about the middle 
of the third century, wrote as follows: &quot; The <I>genius </I>is a god 
supposed to be attendant on everyone from the time of his birth.</P>
<P>Many think the <I>genius </I>to be the same as the lars of the ancients. We 
may well believe that its power over us is great, yea, absolute. Some ascribe 
two <I>genii </I>at least to those who live in the houses of married 
persons.&quot; Euclid, the Socratic philosopher, gives two to every one, a point 
on which Lucilius, in his &quot; Satires,&quot; insists we cannot be informed. 
To the <I>genius, </I>therefore, so powerful through the whole course of one's 
life, they offered yearly sacrifices. As the birth of every mortal was a 
peculiar object of his guardian <I>genius's </I>solicitude, the marriage bed was 
called the genial bed, &quot;lectus genialis&quot; the same invisible patron was 
supposed also to be the author of joy and hilarity, whence a joyous was called a 
genial life, &quot;genialis vita.&quot; There is a curious passage relating to 
the functions of the Greek demons in the <I>Symposium </I>of Plato, in which he 
says : <I>(Speech of Socrates) </I>from it <I>(i.e., </I>the agency of <I>genii) 
</I>proceed all the arts of divination, and all the science of priests, with 
respect to sacrifices, initiations, incantations, and everything, in short, 
which relates to oracles and enchantments. The deity holds no direct intercourse 
with man ; but, by this means, all the converse and communications between the 
gods and men, whether asleep or awake, take place ; and he who is wise in these 
things is a man peculiarly guided by his <I>genius.&quot; </I>We here see the 
origin of the connection between demonology and magic; an association 
perpetually occurring in the romances of the East, if the Jinns of the 
Mussulmans can be identified with the <I>genii </I>of the Platonists. <I>(See 
also </I><STRONG>Jinn.</STRONG>)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Germany :</B> For early German magic, see Teutons.</P>
<P>Magic as formulated and believed in by the Germans in the Middle Ages, bears, 
along with traces of its unmistakable derivation from the ancient Teutonic 
religion, the impress of the influence wrought by the natural characteristics of 
the country upon the mind of its inhabitants Deep forests, gloomy mountains, 
limitless morasses, caverned rocks, mysterious springs, all these helped to 
shape the weird and terrible imagination which may be traced in Teutonic 
mythology, and later in the darker and more repulsive aspects of magic and 
witchcraft, which first arose in <I>Germany, </I>and there obtained ready 
credence.</P>
<P>As the clash and strife of Teuton and Roman, of Christian and Heathen have 
left indelible records in folk-lore and history, so we may find them as surely 
in the magical belief of the Middle Ages. The earlier monkish legends are 
replete with accounts of magic and sorcery, indicating plainly the process by 
which the ancient deities had become evil and degraded upon the introduction of 
the newer religion. Miracles are recounted, where these evil ones are robbed of 
all power at the name of Christ, or before some blessed relic, then chained and 
prisoned beneath mountain, river and sea in eternal darkness, whilst it was told 
how misfortune and death were the unvarying rewards for those who still might 
follow the outcast gods.</P>
<P>Again, the sites and periods of the great religious festivals of the Teutons 
are perpetuated in those said to be the place and time of the Witches' Sabbath 
and other mysterious meetings and conclaves, Mountains especially retained this 
character-as the Venusberg, the Horselberg, and Blocksberg, now become the 
Devil's realm and abode of the damned. Chapels and cathedrals were full of 
relics, whose chief virtue was to exorcise the spirits of evil, while the bells 
must be blessed, as ordained by the Council of Cologne, in order that 
&quot;demons might be affrighted by their sound, calling Christians to prayers; 
and when they fled, the persons of the faithful would be secure; that the 
destruction of lightnings and whirlwinds would be averted, and the spirits of 
the storm defeated.&quot;</P>
<P>Storms were always held to be the work of the Devil, or the conjuration of 
his followers. In their fury might be heard the trampling of his infernal train 
above the tossing forests or holy spires, and here is seen the transformation 
Odin and his hosts had undergone. Another instance of this is found when the 
Valkyries, the Choosers of the Slain, riding to places of battle, have become 
the mediaeval witches riding astride broom-sticks, on their missions of evil. 
Castles of flames, where the Devil holds wild revel ; conclaves of corpses 
revivified by evil knowledge; unearthly growths, vitalized by hanged men's 
souls, springing to life beneath gallows and gibbets ; little men of the hills, 
malicious spirits, with their caps of mist and cloaks of invisibility ; in these 
may be seen the meeting of the Heathen and Christian stories, and the origins of 
that terrible belief in magic, and its train of terror and death, which is one 
of the darkest mysteries of the Middle Ages.</P>
<P>Witchcraft was at first derided as a delusion by men of sense and education, 
and belief in it was actually forbidden by some of the earlier councils, It was 
in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries that it attained prominence, helped 
greatly thereto by the fact that magic, sorcery and witchcraft had now become a 
crime in the eyes of the Church -a crime punishable by confiscation and death. 
It may be truly said that the Holy Fathers and Inquisitors first systematised 
and formulated Black Magic. Under such authority, belief in it flourished, 
filling the people with either an abject fear or unholy curiosity.</P>
<P>The motives for laying the charge of sorcery and witchcraft at a person's 
door were, of course, many besides that of care for the soul ; for personal 
feuds, political enmities, religious differences and treasury needs found in 
this an unfailing and sure means of achieving their infamous ends. However this 
might be, the charges were hurled at high and low, and death thereby reaped a 
plentiful harvest.</P>
<P>The famous Council of Constance began the years of terror with its 
proscription of the doctrines of Wyclif and the burniug of John Huss and Jerome 
of Prague. At this time, too, a work was published by one of the Inquisitors, 
called the <I>Formicarium, </I>a comprehensive list of the sins against religion 
and in the fifth volume an exhaustive account was given of that of sorcery. The 
list of crimes accomplished by witches is detailed, such as second sight, 
ability to read secrets and foretell events ; power to cause diseases, death by 
lightning and destructive storms ; to transform themselves into beasts and 
birds; to bring about illicit love, barrenness of living beings and crops their 
emnity against children and practice of devouring them.</P>
<P>Papal bulls appeared for the appointment of Inquisitors, who must not be 
interfered with by the civil authorities, and the Emperor and reigning princes 
took such under their protection. The persecutions rose to a ferocity 
unparallelled in other countries, till the following century, and hundreds were 
burned in the space of a few years. Two Inquisitors of this time, Jacob 
Sprenger, and Henricus Institor, compiled the famous <I>Malleus Maleficarum, 
</I>a complete system of witchcraft, also a perfect method of proving the 
innocent capable and guilty of any and every crime. Yet it was meant partly as 
an apology-a pointing out of the necessity for the extermination of such a horde 
of evil-doers. At this time, too, appeared the bull of Pope Innocent VIII., 
another comprehensive method and process for trials and tortures.</P>
<P>These persecutions were intermittent throughout the fifteenth and sixteenth 
centuries, breaking out again with renewed vigour in the seventeenth century. It 
was stimulated in this by the increasing strife between Catholics and 
Protestants and the condition of the country, </P>
<P>devastated by wars, plague and famine, was an ever-ready and fruitful source 
of charges that might be brought against sorcery. Two cities, Bamberg and 
Wurzburg attained an unenviable fame for sanguinary trials and number of 
victims.</P>
<P>In the first-named city, Prince-Bishop George II., and his suffragan, 
Frederic Forner, prosecuted the holy inquisition with such energy that between 
the years <B>1625</B> and <B>1630</B> nine hundred trials took place. six 
hundred people being burned. Confessions of whatever the holy fathers wished, 
were wrung from the victims under extreme and merciless torture. Rich and poor, 
learned and ignorant, were gathered into the toils, the number often being so 
great that names were never taken and written down, the prisoners being cited as 
No. <B>1</B>, <B>2</B>, <B>3</B>, and so on.</P>
<P>At Wurzburg, Lutheranism was gaining ground, and here again the charge of 
sorcery was brought against its followers. The bishop, Philip Adolph, who came 
to the see in <B>1623</B>, did not dare to openly prosecute them, so took this 
means of punishing those unfaithful to the Church. In Hauber's <I>Bibliotheca 
Magica </I>may be found a list of twenty-nine burnings, covering a short period 
prior to <B>1629</B>. Each burning consisted of several victims, the numbers 
ranging from two up to ten or more. It is a strange procession we see here, 
winding their way to death through the flames and bitter smoke, a procession 
pathetic and terrible. Old men and Women, little girls and boys and infants, all 
emissaries of the Evil One ; noble ladies and washerwomen ; vicars, canons, 
singers and minstrels; Bannach, a senator, &quot;the fattest citizen in 
Wurzburg</P>
<P>a very rich man, a keeper. of the pot-house, the bishop's own nephew and 
page, the most beautiful girl in Wurzburg,&quot; a huckster, a blind girl, 
living beings beside the decapitated dead-the procession is endless as the 
conditions were various.</P>
<P>Strangely, it was at Wurzburg, in <B>1749</B>, that the last trial for 
witchcraft took place, that of Malia Renata, of the Convent of Unterzell. She 
was condemned on all the old charges, of consorting with the Devil, bewitchments 
and other infernal practices, and burned there in the month of June, the last 
victim of cruel superstition.</P>
<P>Towards the end of the seventeenth century, disbelief in the troth of 
witchcraft and criticism of the wholesale burnings began to be heard, though 
earlier than this, souse had dared to lift their voices against the injustice 
and ignorance of it all. Cornelius Saos, a priest in Mainz, had, before 
<B>1593</B>, stated his doubt of the whole proceedings, but suffered for his 
temerity. Johannes Wier, physician to the Duke of Cleves, Thomas Erast, another 
physician, Adam Tanner, a Bavarian Jesuit, and last, but not least, Frederick 
Spree, also a Jesuit, who, more than all helped to end the reign of terror and 
superstition.</P>
<P>Alchemy, the forerunner of modern chemistry, belonged in those days to the 
realm of magic, and was therefore Satanic in its derivation, and its follower' 
liable to the charge of sorcery and the penalty of death. In this fraternity we 
find emperors and princes, often devoted to the study themselves, or taking into 
their service well-known practisers of the art, as when Joachim I. had Johannes 
Trithemius as teacher of astrology and &quot;defender of magic,&quot; and the 
Emperor Rudolph employing Michael Maier as his physician.</P><I>
<P>Germany </I>supplies a long roll of names famous for their discoveries made 
in the name of magic, men who by their search for knowledge and truth laid 
themselves open to much terrible Suspicion. Here we find Paracelsus,-that 
inexplicable figure who in his search for the Elixir of Life discovered 
laudanum, perhaps in some magical distillation of black poppies at midnight hour 
; the great Cornelius Agrippa; Basil Valentine, prior and chemist; Henry</P>
<P>Kuhnrath, physician and philosopher, and a train of students, all tirelessly 
searching for the elusive mysteries of life, the innermost secrets of 
nature.</P>
<P>These men were awesome figures to the ignorant mind. Popular imagination was 
ever busy weaving strange tales about their doings, such as infernal dealings 
and pacts with the Devil. Such knowledge as thc alchemists gained could only be 
acquired by infernal means, and the soul of the magician <I>was </I>often the 
price promised and inexorably demanded by the Evil One. These myths and 
imaginings centred themselves about one magician especially, and in the Faust 
legend we may find embalmed the general attitude and belief of the Middle Ages 
towards learning and any attempt to extend the realm of knowledge.</P>
<P>The Alchemists were also mystics as their writings abundantly testify, but 
most notable of all in this department of occultism was Jacob Bohme, the son of 
peasants, the inspired shoemaker.</P>
<P>During the Thirty Years&rsquo; War many wild preachers, seers and fanatics 
appeared, exhorting and prophesying. No doubt the condition of the country 
contributed towards producing these states of hallucination and hysteria, and in 
contrast to the terror, misfortune and sorrow on all sides we have accounts of 
ecstatics absorbed in supernatural visions. Anna Fleischer of Freiburg was such 
an one, as was Christiana Poniatowitzsch, who journeying throughout Bohemia and 
<I>Gcruiavy </I>related her visions and prophesied.</P>
<P>At the end of the seventeenth century the old tenets of magic were undergoing 
a gradual change. Alchemy began to separate itself from them, and became merged 
in the science of chemistry. The residue of the magical beliefs formed their 
protagonists in members of all kinds of secret Societies, many of which were 
founded on those of the Middle Ages. Freemasonry-whose beginnings are attributed 
by some to a certain guild of masons banded together for the building of 
Strasburg Cathedral, but by other authorities to Rosicrucianism - formed the 
basis and pattern for many other secret societies.</P>
<P>In the eighteenth century these flourished exceedingly. Occultism became 
rampant We hear of Frederick William working with Steinert in a house specially 
built for evocations; of Schroepfer proprietor of a cafe with his magic punch 
and circles for raising the spirits of the dead; of Lavater with two spirits at 
his command; of the Mopses, a society whose rites initiation were those of the 
Templars and Witches' Sabbath in a mild and civilized form; and of Carl Sand, 
the mystical fanatic who killed Kotzebue..</P>
<P>The Illuminati, whose teachings, spreading to France, did so much towards 
bringing about the many violent changes there, were banded together as a society 
by Adam Weishaupt and fostered by Baron von Knigge, a student of occultism. The 
object of this society is said to have originally been that of circumventing the 
Jesuits, but in its development it absorbed mysticism and supernaturalism. 
finally becoming political and revolutionary as it applied its philosophies to 
Civil and religious life. Though it was disbanded and broken up in <B>1784</B> 
its influence was incalculable and widespread in its effects for long 
afterwards.</P>
<P>Many other names occur, coming under the category of mysticism: Jung 
Stilling, seer, prophet and healer; Anton Mesmer, the discoverer and apostle of 
animal magnetism the Marquis de Puysegur, magnetist and spiritualist; Madame von 
Krudener, preacher of peace and clemency to monarchs and princes; Zschokke the 
mystical seer, and Dr. Justinus Kerner, believer in magnetism and historian of 
those two famous cases of possession and mediumship, the Maid of Orlach &quot; 
and the ' Seeress of Prevorst.&quot;</P>
<P>Early in the nineteenth century occurred the remarkable cures said to be 
affected by Prince Hohenlohe, a dignitary of the Church. He was led to believe 
in the power of healing through the influence of a peasant named Martin Michel. 
Most of these cures took place at Wurzburg, the scenes of former sanguinary 
witch-burnings, and it is said that up-wards of four hundred people, deaf, dumb, 
blind and paralytic were cured by the power of fervent prayer.</P>
<P>About this time also occurred the famous case of stigmata &quot; in the 
person of the ecstatic, Katherine Emerick, the nun of Dulmen. The remarkable 
features were the appearance of a bloody cross encircling the head marks of 
wounds in hands, feet and side, and crosses on the breast, with frequent 
bleedings therefrom. This persisted for many years and the case is mentioned by 
several notable men of the time.</P>
<P>In nineteenth century Occultism we find, as in the earlier periods, stories 
of hauntings and doings of mischievous sprites existing beside learned 
disquisitions by educated men; as that on the fourth &quot;dimension in 
space&quot; by Zollner in his <I>Transcendental Physics, </I>and another on the 
luminous emanations from material objects in Baron von Reichenbach's treatise on 
the Od <I>or Odylic Force; </I>thus betraying an unmistakeable likeness to its 
precursor, the magic of the Middle Ages.</P><I>
<P>Spiritualism. </I>The movement of modern spiritualism. which left such a deep 
impress on America, France and England, affected <I>Germany </I>in a much less 
degree. But it would be indeed surprising if the country which gave so great 
attention to magnetism, wherein somnambules and clairvoyants were so plentiful, 
the country of seers and mystics, did not interest itself in the wide-spread 
phenomena of spiritualism. And investigators there were in <I>Germany, 
</I>though we have no record of any in the period immediately following the 
Rochester Rappings. Fichte declared for the facts of spiritualism. Hartmann, 
also, the author of the <I>Philosophy' of the Unconscious, </I>desired to give 
the phenomena a definite place in philosophy. Carl du Prel, in his <I>Philosophy 
of Mysticism, </I>points to spiritualistic manifestations as evidence of a 
subconscious region in the human mind. Du Prel also founded a monthly magazine, 
<I>The Sphinx, </I>devoted to the interests of spiritualism, and Aksakoff, the 
well-known Russian spiritualist, published the results of his researches in 
<I>Germany, </I>and in the German language, because he was not permitted to 
publish them in Russian. Another philosophic exponent of the spiritualistic 
doctrine was Baron Hellenbach, who founded on its tenets a distinct hypothesis 
of his own-namely, that no change of world, or ' sphere,&quot; occurs at birth 
or death, but merely a change in the mode of perception. So much for the 
philosophical attitude towards the phenomena. The popular view-point was 
doubtless more influenced by the performances of the mediums who from time to 
time found their way to <I>Germany. </I>The most important of these was Henry 
Snide, who sought refuge in that country from his English persecutors. His 
remarkable manifestations in <I>Germany, </I>under the observation of Zollner 
the astronomer, left nothing to be desired from a spiritualistic point of 
view.</P>

Sabbath was killed on the way, the devil was in the habit of taking her shape 
and making her reappear and die in her own dwelling so as to preserve her good 
reputation. But if he who had killed her had a wax candle about him, and made 
with it the sign of the cross on the body of the witch, the devil could not with 
all his strength remove her, and so was forced to leave her there.</P>

revealed to a Norman knight, returning from a pilgrimage to Rome, by a hermit 
whom he met on the way, and who told him that on the previous night he had been 
disturbed by a vision of demons making a great noise. They had, they said, been 
carrying the body of <I>Gervais </I>from Rheims, but because of his good deeds 
he had been taken from them. On his return to Rheims the knight found that 
<I>Gerveis </I>was dead, and that the time of his death corresponded exactly 
with the time of the hermit's vision.</P>

Cabiri.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Ghost Seers :</B> Sir William Hamiliton has observed, &quot; however 
astonishing, it is now proved, beyond all rational doubt, that in certain 
abnormal states of the nervous organism, perceptions arc possible through other 
than the ordinary channels of the senses.&quot; But, without entering into this 
metaphysical question, folk-lore holds that persons born at a particular time of 
the day have the power of seeing ghosts. Thus it is said in Lancashire,&quot; 
says Mr. Thiselton Dyer, &quot;that children born during twilight are supposed 
to have this peculiarity, and to know who of their acquaintance will next die. 
Some say that this property belongs also to those who happen to be born exactly 
at twelve o'clock at night, or, as the peasantry say in Somersetshire, a child 
born in chime-hours will have the power to see spirits.&quot; The same belief 
prevails in Yorkshire, where it is commonly supposed that children born during 
the hour after midnight have the privilege through life of seeing the spirits of 
the departed. Mr. Henderson says that &quot;a Yorkshire lady informed him she 
was very near being thus distinguished, but the clock had not struck twelve when 
she was born. When a child she mentioned this circumstance to an old servant, 
adding that Mamma was sure her birthday was the <B>23</B>rd, not the 
<B>24</B>th, for she had inquired at the time.' ' Ay, Ay,' said the old woman, 
turning to the child's nurse, mistress would be very anxious about that, for 
bairns born after mid-night see more things than other folk.'</P>
<P>This superstition prevails on the Continent, and, in Denmark, Sunday children 
have prerogatives far from enviable. Thorpe, tells how in Fyer there was a woman 
who was born on a Sunday, and, like other Sunday children had the faculty of 
seeing much that was hidden from others. But, because of this property, she 
could not pass by a church at night without seeing a hearse or a spectre. The 
gift became a perfect burden to her; she therefore sought the advice of a man 
skilled in such matters, who directed her, whenever she saw a spectre to say, ' 
Go to Heaven! but when she met a hearse, ' Hang on ! &quot; Happening sometime 
after to meet a hearse, she, through lapse of memory cried out, ' Go to Heaven l 
&quot; and straightway the hearse rose in the air and vanished. Afterwards, 
meeting a spectre she said to it, Hang on! &quot; when the spectre clung round 
her neck, hung on her back, and drove her down into the earth before it. For 
three days her shrieks were heard before the spectre would put an end to her 
wretched life.&quot;</P>
<P>It is a popular article of faith in Scotland that those who are born on 
Christmas Day or Good Friday have the power of seeing spirits, and even of 
commanding them, a superstition to which Sir Walter Scott alludes in his 
<I>Marmion </I>(stanza <B>22</B>). The Spaniards imputed the haggard and 
downcast looks of their Philip II. to the disagreeable visions to which this 
privilege subjected him.</P>
<P>Among uncultured tribes it is supposed that spirits are visible to some 
persons and not to others. The &quot;natives&quot; of the Antilles believed that 
the dead appeared on the road when one went alone, but not when they went 
together; among the Finns the ghosts of the dead were to be seen by the Shamans, 
and not by men generally, unless in dreams. It is, too, a popular theory with 
savage races that the soul appears in dreams to visit the sleeper, and hence it 
has been customary for rude tribes to drink various intoxicating substances, 
under the impression that when thrown into the state of ecstasy they would have 
pleasing visions. On this account certain tribes on the Amazon use certain 
narcotic plants, producing an intoxication lasting twenty-four hours. During 
this period they are said to be subject to extraordinary visions, in the course 
of which they acquire information on any subject they may specially require. For 
a similar reason the inhabitants of North Brazil, when anxious to discover some 
guilty person, were in the habit of administering narcotic drinks to seers, in 
whose dreams the criminal made his appearance. The Californian Indians would 
give children certain intoxicants in order to gain from the ensuing vision 
information about their enemies. And the Darien Indians used the seeds of the 
<I>Datura sanguines </I>to produce in children prophetic delirium, during which 
they revealed the whereabouts of hidden treasures.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Gilles de Laval Lord of Raiz, and Marshal of France :</B> the &quot;Blue 
Beard&quot; of our nursery legends. and a famous sorcerer, was born about the 
year <B>1420</B>, of one of the most famous families of Brittany. His father 
died when he was in his twentieth year, and the impetuous lad found himself 
possessed of unlimited power and wealth. By birth, he was connected with the 
Roceys, the Craons, and the Montmorencys. Through his father's decease he became 
the lord of fifteen princely domains, yielding a revenue of three hundred 
thousand livres. He was handsome, lithe, well-limbed, but distinguished by the 
appendage of a beard of bluish black. His address was fascinating, his erudition 
extensive, his courage unimpeachable. Every thing seemed to promise a splendid 
and illustrious career, instead of that dark and miserable history which has 
associated the name of Blue Beard with so many traditions of horror and legends 
of atrocious crimes.</P>
<P>At the outset he did nothing to justify an evil augury. He served with zeal 
and gallantry in the wars of Charles VI. against the English, and had fought 
under Joan of Arc in the ever memorable Siege of Orleans. His exploits procured 
him from a grateful king the reward of the high dignity of Marshal of France. 
From this point his career tended downwards. He retired to his Castle of 
Champtoce and indulged in the display of the most luxurious state. Two hundred 
horsemen accompanied him on his travels, and his train, when he went hunting, 
exceeded in magnificence that of the King himself. His retainers wore the most 
sumptuous dresses; his horses were caparisoned with the richest trappings ; his 
castle gates were thrown open day and night to all comers, for whom an ox was 
daily roasted whole, and sheep, and pigs, and poultry, wine, mead, and hippocras 
provided in sufficient quantities for five hundred persons. He carried the same 
love of pomp into his devotion. His principal chaplain, whom he called a bishop, 
a dean, a chanter, two arch-deacons, four vicars, a schoolmaster, twelve 
assistant chaplains, and eight choristers, composed his ecclesiastical 
establishment. Each of these had his horse and his servant; all were dressed in 
robes of scarlet and furs, and had costly appointments. Sacred vessels, 
crucifixes, all of gold and silver, were transported with them wherever their 
lord went, together with many organs, each carried by six men. He was 
exceedingly desirous that all the priests of his chapel should be entitled to 
wear the mitre, and he sent many embassies to Rome to obtain this privilege, but 
without success. He maintained a choir of twenty-five young children of both 
sexes, and these he caused to be instructed in singing by the best masters of 
the day. He had also his comedians, his morris-dancers, and his jugglers, and 
every hour was crowned with Some sensual gratification or voluptuous 
pleasure.</P>
<P>In <B>1443</B>, this magnificent young seigneur wedded Catherine, the heiress 
of the noble House of Thouars, an event which afforded him fresh occasions of 
displaying his insane passion for luxurious pomp. He gave the most splendid 
banquets ; he figured in the most chivalric tournaments. His guests, who came 
from all parts to share in the revels of Champtoce', knew not which to admire 
the most, his skill in all knightly exercises, or his profound erudition.</P>
<P>He had espoused a young woman of high birth,&quot; says Eliphas Levi, and 
kept her practically shut up in his castle at Machecoul. which had a tower with 
the entrance walled up.&quot; A report was spread by the Marshal that it was in 
a ruinous state, and no one sought to penetrate therein. This, notwithstanding, 
Madame de Raiz, who was frequently alone during the dark hours, saw red lights 
moving to and fro in this tower; but she did not venture to question her 
husband, whose bizarre and sombre character filled her with extreme terror.</P>
<P>The legal state maintained by the Lord of Retz was ordered on so extensive a 
scale that it even exhausted his apparently inexhaustible revenues, and to 
procure the funds for his pleasures and his extravagance, he was compelled to 
sell several of his baronies. Then the Marshal attempted to dispose of his 
seignory of Ingrande. But his heirs-at-law, indisposed to see their valuable 
inheritance gradually pared away into nothing, solicited the interference of the 
King, and a royal edict prohibited him from selling his paternal estates. In 
this predicament, most men would have curtailed their profusion, and endeavoured 
to economize their income, but <I>Gilles de Retz </I>was unable to live in 
diminished splendour. The luxuries that surrounded him were all that for him 
made life. To have shorn him of his magnificence would have been to strike a 
death-blow at his heart. Money, therefore, became the principal object of his 
desires, and to obtain money it seemed to his excited imagination only necessary 
that he should turn alchemist.</P>
<P>He sent accordingly into Italy, Spain, and Germany, and invited the adopts in 
the great science to repair from every land to the splendours of Champtoce. 
Amongst those who obtained the summonses, and continued attached to him during 
the remainder of his career, were Prelati, an alchemist of Padua, and a 
physician of Poitou, whose name is not given. At their instigation he built a 
stately laboratory, and joined by other adepts, eagerly began the search for the 
Philosophers' Stone. For a twelve month the furnaces blazed away right merrily, 
and a thousand chemical combinations disposed of the Marshal's gold and silver. 
Meanwhile, the alchemists feasted on the most luxurious viands, and quaffed the 
rarest wines; and so admirable were their quarters that, as far as they were 
concerned, they would have prosecuted the quest of the elixir vitae, or the 
Philosophers' Stone, until death cut short their labours.</P>
<P>The impetuosity of the Lord of Retz could not abide such lingering processes. 
He wanted wealth, and he wanted it immediately. If the grand secret could not be 
discovered by any quicker method, he would have none of it, nor, indeed, as his 
resources were fast melting away, would it avail him much if the search occupied 
several years. At this junction the Poitousan physician and the Paduan alchemist 
whispered to him of quicker and bolder methods of attaining the desired 
alkehest. if he had the courage to adopt them. <I>Gilles de Retz </I>immediately 
dismissed the inferior adepts. and put himself in the hands of the two abler and 
subtler masters. These persuaded him that the Evil One could at once reveal to 
them the secret, and offered to Summons him <I>ex tenebris, </I>for the Marshal 
to conclude with him whatever arrangement he thought best. As long as he saved 
his soul, the Lord of Retz professed himself willing to do anything the devil 
might command.</P>
<P>In this frame of mind he went to the physician at midnight to a solitary 
recess in the neighbouring wood, where the physician drew the magic circle and 
made the customary conjurations. <I>Gilles </I>listened to the invocation with 
wonder, and expectant that every moment the Spirit of Darkness would burst upon 
the startled silence. After a lapse of thirty minutes, the physician manifested 
signs of the greatest alarm; his hair seemed to stand on end, his eyes glared 
with unutterable horror; he talked wildly, his knees shook, a deadly pallor 
overspread his countenance, and he sank to the ground. <I>Gilles </I>was a man 
of dauntless bravery, and gazed upon the strange scene unmoved. After awhile the 
physician pretended to recover consciousness. He arose, and turning to his 
master, inquired if he had not remarked the wrathful countenance of the devil. 
<I>De Retz </I>replied that he had seen no devil. Where-upon the physician 
declared he had appeared in the fashion of a wild leopard, and had growled at 
him horribly. &quot;You&quot;, he said to his lord, &quot;would have been the 
same, and hoard the same, but for your want of faith. You could not determine to 
give yourself up wholly to his service, and therefore he thrust a mist before 
your eyes.&quot; <I>De Retz </I>acknowledged that his resolution had somewhat 
faltered, but that now his choice was made, if indeed the Evil One could be 
coerced into speaking, and revealing the secret of the universal alkahest. The 
physician said that there grew certain herbs in Spain and Africa which possessed 
the necessary power, and offered to go in search of them himself if the Lord of 
Laval would supply the funds. As no one else would be able to detect the herbs 
so miraculously gifted, <I>De Retz </I>thanked the physician for his voluntary 
self-denial, and loaded him with all the gold he could spare. The physician then 
took leave of his credulous patron, who never saw him again.</P><I>
<P>De Retz, </I>as soon as the physician had quitted Champtoce, was once more 
seized with the fever of unrest. His days and nights were consumed in ceaseless 
visions of gold; gold, without which he must abandon his gilded pomp and unholy 
pleasures; gold, without which he could not hope to bravo his enemies or procure 
exemption from the just punishment of his crimes. He now turned for help to the 
alchemist Prelati, who agreed to undertake the enterprise. <I>De Retz 
</I>furnished him with the charms and talismans necessary in so troublesome a 
work. He was to sign with his blood a contract that he would obey the devil in 
all things, and to offer up a sacrifice of the hands, eyes, blood, heart and 
lungs of a young child. The madman having willingly consented to those terms, 
Prelati went out alone on the following night, and after an absence of three 
hours, returned to his impatient lord. His tale was a monstrously extravagant 
one, but <I>Do Retz </I>swallowed it greedily. The devil had appeared in the 
shape of a comely young man of twenty, who desired to be called Barron, and had 
pointed out to him a store of ingots of pure gold, buried under an oak in the 
neighbouring wood, which was to become the property of the Lord of Laval if he 
fulfilled the conditions of his Contract. But this bright prospect was 
over-clouded by the devil's injunction that the gold was not to be searched for 
until a period of seven times seven weeks had elapsed, or it would turn to 
slates and dust. <I>Do Retz </I>was by no means willing to wait so many months 
for the realisation of his wishes, and desired Prelati to intimate to the devil 
that he should decline any further correspondence with him if matters could not 
be expedited. Prelati persuaded him to wait for seven times seven days, and 
then, the two repaired with pick-axe and shovel to dig up the treasure. After 
Some hard work they lighted upon a load of slates inscribed with hieroglyphical 
characters. Prelati broke out into a fit of rage, and culuminated the Evil One 
as a liar, a knave, a rogue-De R<I>etz </I>heartily joining in his fierce 
denunciations. He persuaded his master, however, to give the devil a further 
trial, and led him on from day to day with dark oracular hints and pretended 
demoniac intimations, until he had obtained nearly all the valuables remaining 
to his unhappy dupe. He was then preparing to escape with his plunder, when a 
catastrophe occurred, which involved him in his lord's ruin.</P>
<P>On Easter Day, in the year <B>1440</B>, having communicated solemnly in his 
chapel, and bade farewell to the lady of Machecoul, telling her that he was 
departing to the Holy Land, the poor creature was even then afraid to question, 
so much did she tremble at his presence; she was also Several months in her 
pregnancy. The Marshal permitted her sister to come on a visit as a companion 
during his absence. Madame de Raiz took advantage of this indulgence, after 
which <I>Gilles de Laval </I>mounted his horse, and departed. To her Sister, 
Madame de Raiz communicated her fears and anxieties. What went on in the castle 
? Why was her lord so gloomy ? What signified his repeated absences ? What 
became of the children who disappeared day by day ? What were those nocturnal 
lights in the walled up tower ? These and the other problems excited the 
curiosity of both women to the utmost degree. What, all the Same, could be done 
? The Marshal had forbidden them expressly even to approach the tower, and 
before leaving he had expressed this injunction. It must assuredly have a secret 
entrance, for which Madame do Raiz and her sister Anne proceeded to search 
through the lower rooms of the castle, corner by corner, stone after stone. At 
last, in the chapel, behind the altar, they came upon a copper button, hidden in 
a mass of sculpture. It yielded under pressure, a stone slid back, and the two 
curiosity-seekers, now all in a tremble, distinguished the lowermost steps of a 
staircase, which led them to the condemned tower.</P>
<P>At the top of the first flight there was a kind of chapel, with a cross 
upside down and black candles; on the altar stood a hideous figure, no doubt 
representing the demon. On the second floor, they came upon furnaces, retorts, 
alembics, charcoal-in a word, all the apparatus of alchemy. The third flight led 
to a dark chamber where the heavy and fetid atmosphere compelled the young women 
to retreat. Madame do Raiz came into collision with a vase, which fell over, and 
she was conscious that her robe and foot were soaked by some thick and unknown 
liquid. On returning to the light at the head of the Stairs, she found that she 
was bathed in blood.</P>
<P>Sister Anne would have fled from the place, but in Madame do Raiz curiosity 
was even stronger than disgust or fear. She descended the stairs, took a lamp 
from the infernal chapel and returned to the third floor, where a frightful 
spectacle awaited her. Copper vessels filled with blood were ranged the whole 
length of the walls, bearing labels with a date on each, and in the middle of 
the room there was a black marble table, on which lay the body of a child, 
murdered quite recently. It was one of those basins which had fallen, and black 
blood had spread far and wide over the grimy and worm-eaten wooden floor. The 
two women were now half-dead with terror. Madame de Raiz endeavoured at all 
costs to efface the evidence of her indiscretion. She went in search of a sponge 
and water, to wash the boards, but she only extended the stain, and that which 
at first seemed black, became all scarlet in hue. Suddenly a loud commotion 
echoed through the castle, mixed with the cries of people calling to Madame de 
Raiz.</P>
<P>She distinguished the awe-stricken words : &quot; Here is Monseigneur come 
back.&quot; The two women made for the staircase, but at the same moment they 
were aware of the trampling of steps and the sound of other voices in the 
devil's chapel. Sister Anne fled upwards to the battlement of the tower Madame 
de Raiz went down trembling, and found herself face to face with her husband, in 
the act of ascending, accompanied by the apostate priest and Prelati.</P><I>
<P>Gilles de Laval </I>seized his wife by the arm, and without speaking, dragged 
her into the infernal chapel. It was then that Prelati observed to the Marshal : 
' It is needs must, as you see, and the victim has come of her own 
accord....&quot;&quot; Be it so,&quot; answered his master. &quot; Begin the 
Black Mass&quot; The apostate priest went to the altar, while <I>Gilles de Level 
</I>opened a little cupboard fixed therein, and drew out a large knife, after 
which he sat down close to his spouse, who was now almost in a swoon, and lying 
in a heap on a bench against the wall. The sacrilegious ceremonies began. It 
must be explained that the Marshal, so far from taking the road to Jerusalem had 
proceeded only to Nantes, where Prelati lived ; he attacked this miserable 
wretch with the uttermost fury and threatened to slay him if he did not furnish 
the means of extracting from the devil that which he had been demanding for so 
long a time. With the object of obtaining delay Prelati declared that terrible 
conditions were required by the infernal master, first among which would be the 
sacrifice of the Marshal's unborn child, after tearing it forcibly from the 
mother's womb. <I>Gilles de Laval </I>made no reply, but returned at once to 
Machecoul, the Florentine sorcerer and his accomplice, the priest, being in his 
train. With the rest we are acquainted.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Sister Anne, left to her own devices on the roof of the tower, and 
not daring to come down, had removed her veil, to make signs of distress at 
chance. They were answered by two cavaliers, accompanied by a posse of armed 
men, who were riding towards the castle they proved to be her two brothers, who, 
on learning the spurious departure of the Marshal for Palestine, had come to 
visit and console Madame de Raiz. Soon after they arrived with a clatter in the 
court of the castle, whereupon <I>Gilles de Level </I>suspended the hideous 
ceremony, and said to his wife : &quot; 'Madame, I forgive you, and the matter 
is at an end between us if you do now as I tell you. Return to your apartment, 
change your garments, and join me in the guest-room, whither I am going to 
receive your brothers, But if you say one word, or cause them the slightest 
suspicion, I will bring you hither on their departure; we shall proceed with the 
Black Mass at the point where it is now broken off, and at the consecration you 
will die. Mark where I place this knife.</P>
<P>He rose up and led his wife to the door of her chamber, and subsequently 
received her relations and their Suite, saying that this lady was preparing 
herself to come and salute her brothers. Madame de Raiz appeared almost 
immediately, pale as a spectre. <I>Gilles de Level </I>never took eyes off her, 
seeking to control her by his glance. When her brother suggested that she was 
ill, she answered that it was the fatigue of pregnancy, but added in an 
undertone:</P>
<P>&quot;Save me, he seeks to kill me.&quot; At the same moment, Sister Anne 
rushed into the hall, crying: Take us away; save us, my brothers, this man is an 
assassin,&quot; and she pointed to <I>Gilles de Level. </I>While the Marshal 
summoned his people, the escort of the two visitors surrounded the women with 
drawn swords, and the Marshal's people disarmed instead of obeying him. Madame 
de Raiz, with her sister and brothers, gained the drawbridge, and left the 
castle.</P>
<P>Terrible rumours were now bruited through all the country-side. It was 
noticed that many young girls and boys had disappeared. Some had been traced to 
the Castle of Champtoce, and not beyond. The public voice accused him of murder; 
and of crimes even worse than murder-of lust in its foulest and most disgusting 
shapes. It was true that no one dared openly accuse a baron so powerful as the 
Lord of Retz. It was true that whenever the circumstances of the disappearance 
of so many children were alluded to in his presence, he always manifested the 
greatest astonishment. But the suspicions of the people once aroused are not 
easily allayed ; and the Castle of Champtoce and its lord soon acquired a 
fearful reputation, and were surrounded with an appalling mystery.</P>
<P>The continued disappearance of young boys and girls had caused so bitter a 
feeling in the neighbourhood that the Church had felt constrained to intervene, 
and on the earnest representations of the Bishop of Nantes, the Duke of Brittany 
ordered <I>De Retz </I>and his accomplice to be arrested. Their trial took place 
before a commission composed of the Bishop of Nantes, Chancellor of Brittany, 
the Vicar of the Inquisition, and Pierre l'Hopital, the President of the 
Provincial Parliament. <I>De Retz </I>was accused of sorcery, sodomy, and 
murder. At first he displayed the most consummate coolness, denounced his judges 
as worthless and impure, and declared that rather than plead before such 
shameless knaves he would be hung like a dog, without trial. But the 
overwhelming evidence brought against him-the terrible revelations made by 
Prelati and his servants of his abandoned lust, of his sacrifices of young 
children for the supposed gratification of the devil, and the ferocious pleasure 
with which he gloated over the throbbing limbs and glazing eyes of those who 
were equally the victims of his sensuality and his cruelty-this horrible tale, 
as it unfolded day by day the black record of his enormities, shook even his 
imperturable courage, and he confessed everything. The blood-stained chronicle 
showed that nearly one hundred children had fallen victims to this madman and 
his insane greed of the Philosophers' Stone. Both <I>De Retz </I>and Prelati 
were doomed to be burned alive, but in consideration of his rank the punishment 
of the Marshal was somewhat mitigated. He was strangled before he was given over 
to the flames. On the scaffold, he exclaimed to Peralti, with a hideous 
assumption of religious confidence : &quot; Farewell, friend Francis. In this 
world we shall never meet again, but let us rest our hopes in God-we shall see 
each other in Paradise.&quot; The sentence was executed at Nantes, on the 
<B>23</B>rd of February, <B>1440</B>. &quot; Notwithstanding his many and 
atrocious cruelties,&quot; says the old chronicler, Monstrelet, &quot;he made a 
very devout end, full of penitence, most humbly imploring his Creator to have 
mercy on his manifold sins and wickedness. When his body was partly burned, some 
ladles and damsels of his family requested his remains of the Duke of Brittany, 
that they might be interred in holy ground, which was granted. The greater part 
of the nobles of Brittany, more especially those of his kindred, were hi the 
utmost grief and confusion at his shameful death.&quot;</P>
<P>The Castle of Champtoce still stands in its beautiful valley, and many a 
romantic legend flowers about its gray old walls. &quot;The hideous, half-burnt 
body of the monster himself,&quot; says Trollope, &quot; circled in flames, 
pale, indeed, and faint in colour, but more lasting than those the hangman 
kindled around his mortal form in the meadow under the walls of Nantes - is seen 
on bright moonlight nights, standing now on one topmost point of craggy wall, 
now on another, and is heard mingling his moan with the sough of the night-wind. 
Pale, bloodless forms, too, of youthful growth and mien, the restless, 
unsepulchred ghosts of the unfortunates who perished in these dungeons 
unassoiled, may at similar times be seen flitting backwards and forwards in 
numerous groups across the space enclosed by the ruined walls, with more than 
mortal speed, or glancing hurriedly from window to window of the fabric, as 
still seeking to escape from its hateful confinement.&quot;</P>

became a Church of England clergyman with charges at Frome Selwood and Streat 
and Walton. In <B>1666</B> he was appointed to the Abbey Church, Bath, was made

<P>Glas Ghairm :</B> A rhyme or spell of Scottish origin, by the use of which 
one could keep a dog from barking, and open a lock, and supposed to be of 
special value to young men in their courtship days. About twenty years ago a 
well-known character in Skye, named Archibald the Lightheaded, was believed to 
know this incantation; hut he repeated it so quickly that no one could 
understand what he said. This poor man was insane; but the fear which dogs had 
of him was ascribed to his knowledge of the <I>Glas Ghairm. </I>It was believed 
that this rhyme had some reference to the safety of the Children of Israel on 
the night before the Exodus: &quot;against any of the children of Israel shall 
not a dog move his tongue, against man or beast.&quot;</P>

<P>Glauber, Johann Rudolph :</B> German mediciner and alchemist, born at 
Carlstadt, in <B>1603</B>. No authentic records concerning his life appear to 
exist, although he was a profuse writer and left many treatises on medicine and 
alchemy. He discovered and prepared many medicines of great value to pharmacy, 
some of which are in common use, for example the familiar preparation known as 
Glauber's Salts. He was a firm believer in the Philosophers' Stone and elixir 
vitis. Concerning the former, he states: &quot; Let the benevolent reader take 
with him my final judgment concerning the great Stone of the Wise; let every man 
believe what he will and is able to comprehend. Such a work is purely the gift 
of God, and cannot be learned by the most acute power of human mind, if it be 
not assisted by the benign help of a Divine Inspiration. And of this I assure 
myself that in the last times, God will raise up some to whom He will open the 
Cabinet of Nature's Secrets, that they shall be able to do wonderful things in 
the World to His Glory, the which, I indeed, heartily wish to posterity that 
they may enjoy and use to the praise and honour of God.&quot;</P>
<P>Some of <I>Glauber's </I>principal works are, <I>Philosophical Furnaces, 
Commentary on Paracelsus, Heaven of the Philosophers, or Book of Vexation,

<P>Gloucester, Eleanor Cobham, Duchess of :</B> Wife of Humphrey of Gloucester, 
uncle of Henry VI., and Lord Protector of England during the King's minority. 
Though Humphrey was very popular in England, he was not without enemies, and one 
of the most bitter of these was Henry Beaufort, Cardinal of Winchester, 
great-uncle to the King. He it was who brought a charge of witchcraft against 
the <I>Duchess of Gloucester, </I>hoping thus to destroy her husband's power as 
the actual head of the realm and heir to the throne in the event of the King's 
death. It was Supposed that the <I>Duchess </I>had first resorted to witchcraft 
in order to gain the affections of Humphrey, whose second wife she was. Then, 
when she had married him, and the death of the Duke of Bedford had removed the 
last barrier but one between her and a crown, she set about the secret removal 
of that barrier, which was, of course, the unfortunate King. To assist her in 
her evil designs, she sought the advice of Margery Jourdain (the Witch of Eye), 
Roger Bolingbroke, Thomas Southwel, and John Hume, or Hun, a priest. All five 
were accused of summoning evil spirits, and plotting to destroy the King. They 
were also suspected of making a waxen image, which was slowly melted before a 
fire, in the expectation that as the image was consumed, the life of the King 
would also waste away. For the supposed practice of this common device of 
witches, they were put upon trial. The priest, Hun, turned informer, and 
Bolingbroke, having abjured his evil works, was called upon to give evidence. 
Margery Jourdain was burned as a witch, and the <I>Duchess of Gloucester </I>was 
sentenced to walk through the streets of London on three separate occasions 
bearing a lighted taper in her hand, and attended by the Lord Mayor, sheriffs, 
and others. Afterwards, she was banished to the Isle of Man.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Gnosticism : </B>Under the designation &quot; Gnostics,&quot; several 
widely-differing sects were included, the term, derived from the Greek, meaning, 
&quot;to know&quot; in opposition to mere theory, and sharing this significance 
with the words, wizard,&quot; &quot; witch,&quot; which also indicate in their 
original meaning: &quot;those who know.&quot;</P>
<P>Simultaneously with Christianity, these sects assumed a definite form, the 
eastern provinces of the Roman Empire being their sphere of operations at first. 
Their doctrines were an admixture of Indian, Egyptian, Babylonian, and Christian 
creeds, astrology and magic, with much of the Jewish <I>Kabbala </I>also. From 
Alexandria, that centre of mystic learning, much of their distinctive beliefs 
and ritual were derived, while it seems certain that to a certain extent they 
became affiliated with Mithraism (q.v.), to whose sheltering kindness Occidental 
Christianity also owed much. Most of the sects had a priesthood of the 
mysteries, and. these initiated priests practised magic arts astrology, 
incantations, exorcisms, the fashioning of charms talismans and amulets, of 
which many are extant at the present day. It is said that the Grecian mysteries, 
the Eleusinian and Cabiric, for instance, were celebrated by the Gnostic sects 
down to a late date. They were looked upon as heretics and sorcerers by the 
Church, and were the victims of relentless </P>
<P>persecution. In Persia also they were put to death, but some embraced 
Islamism, and transmitted their doctrines to the Dervish sects (q.v.). 
Manicheism, a later sect was founded by Manes, who belonged to the Order of the 
Magi, and was famous for his skill in astrology, medicines and magic. This sect 
was anathema to the Church, and its later variants, Paulicians, Cathari, 
Albigensis, Lollards, and later still the Carbonari, never failed to arouse the 
persecuting fervour of the Church.</P>
<P>Apollonius of Tyana (q.v.), a Pagan, was supposed to have some connection 
with the Gnostics. The first Gnostic of eminence was Simon Magus (q.v.) 
contemporary with the Christian apostles. The Simonians are said to have 
interpreted the Creation in Genesis as symbolic of the gestation of the foetus, 
the temptation of Eve and the Garden of Eden having a like character. The 
Carpocratians, one of the Gnostic sects, derived their mysteries and rites from 
Isis worship. They used Theurgic incantations, symbols and signs. The Ophites 
also adopted Egyptian rites, and, as their name indicates, these included much 
of serpent symbolism, an actual serpent being the central object of their 
mysteries. Marcos, disciple of Valentinus, and founder of the Marcian sect, 
celebrated Mass with two chalices, pouring wine from the larger into a smaller, 
and on pronouncing a magical formula, the vessel was fi]led with a liquor like 
blood, which swelled up seething. Other sects practised divination and prophecy 
by means of female somnambules. Some of the sects became degraded in doctrine 
and ritual, this often being of an orgiastic character.</P>
<P>The Gnostic talismans were mostly engraved on gems, the colour and 
traditional qualities of the jewel being part of its magical efficacy. They used 
spells and charms and mystic formulae, said to loose fetters, to cause blindness 
in one's enemies, to procure dreams, to gain favour, to encompass any desire 
whatsoever.&quot; In a Greek Gnostic Papyrus is to be found the following spell 
of Agathocles, for producing dreams &quot;Take a cat, black all over, and which 
has been killed prepare a writing tablet, and write the following with a 
solution of myrrh, and the dream which thou desirest to be sent, and put in the 
mouth of the cat. The text to be transcribed runs : ' Keimi, Keimi, I am the 
Great One, in whose mouth rests Mommom, Thoth, Nauumbre, Karikha, Kenyro, 
Paarmiathon, the sacred Ian ice ieu aeoi, who is above the heaven, Amekheumen, 
Neunana, Seunana, Ablanathanalba,' (here follow further names, then,) 'Put 
thyself in connection with N.N. in this matter (as to the substance of the dream 
named,) but if it is necessary then bring for me N.N. hither by thy power lord 
of the whole world, fiery god, put thyself in connexion with N.N.' Again, there 
follows a list of meaningless names, the formula ending : ' Hear me, for I shall 
speak the great name, Thoth l whom each god honours, and each demon fears, by 
whose command every messenger performs his mission. Thy name answers to the 
seven (vowels) a, e, e, i, o, u, o, <I>iauoeaao ouee oia. </I>I named thy 
glorious name, the name for all needs. Put thyself in connection with N.N., 
Hidden One, God, with respect to this name, which Apollobex also used.&quot; The 
repetition of apparently meaningless syllables was always held to be of great 
efficacy in magical rites, either as holding the secret name of the powers 
invoked, or of actual power in themselves. In Atanasi's <I>Magic Papyrus, 
</I>Spell VII., directs you to lay the link of a chain upon a leaden plate, and 
having traced its outline, to write thereon, round the circumference, the common 
Gnostic legend in Greek characters (reading both ways) continuously. Within the 
circle was written the nature of the thing which it was desired to prevent. The 
operation was called The Ring of Hermes.&quot; The link was then to be folded up 
on the leaden plate, and thrown into the grave of one dead before his time, or 
else into a disused well. After the formula above given, was to follow in Greek: 
Prevent thou such and such a person from doing such and such a thing &quot;-a 
proof that the long string of epithets all referred to the same power. These 
instances might be multiplied, although much of the more valuable parts of the 
Gnostic doctrines were destroyed by every persecutor who arose, and this was 
easily done, for the sacred and mystic teachings, the prayers and spells were 
inscribed on perishable parchments. That much of the evil was imputed to them by 
the Church because of their more philosophic habit of thought in opposition to 
faith and dogma, is beyond doubt.</P>

<P>Goat :</B> The devil is frequently represented under the shape of a <I>goat, 
</I>and as such presided over the witches' Sabbath. The <I>goat </I>is also the 
&quot; emblem of sinful men at the day of judgment.&quot; <I>(See </I>Baphomet; 
Witchcraft.)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Goblin :</B> A spirit formerly supposed to lurk in houses. They were 
generally of a mischievous and grotesque type. Hob-goblins, according to Junius, 
were so called because they were wont to hop on one leg.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>God :</B> According to the ancient magical conception of <I>God </I>in the 
scheme of the universe, evil is the inevitable contrast and complement of good. 
<I>God </I>permits the existence of the shadow in order that it may intensify 
the purity of the light. Indeed he has created both and they are inseparable the 
one being necessary to and incomprehensible without the other.</P>
<P>The very idea of goodness loses its meaning if considered apart from that of 
evil-Gabriel is a foil to Satan and Satan to Gabriel. The dual nature of the 
spiritual world penetrates into every department of life material and spiritual. 
It is typified in light and darkness, cold and heat, truth and error, in brief, 
the names of any two opposing forces will serve to illustrate the great primary 
law of nature-viz. the continual conflict between the positive or good and the 
negative or evil.</P>
<P>For a scriptural illustration of this point, let the story of Cain and Abel 
be taken. The moral superiority of his brother is at first irksome to Cain, 
finally intolerable. He murders Abel, thus bringing on his own head the wrath of 
<I>God </I>and the self-punishment of the murderer. For in killing Abel he has 
done himself no good, but harm. He has not done-away with Abel's superiority, 
but has added to himself a burden of guilt that can be expiated only by much 
suffering.</P>
<P>Suffering is shewn in the Scriptures to be the only means by which evil is 
overcome by good. Cain re-appears in the story of the prodigal son, who after 
privation and suffering is restored to his father who forgives him fully and 
freely.</P>
<P>The possibility of sin and error is therefore entirely consistent with and 
even inseparable from life, and the great sinner a more vital being than the 
colourless character, because having greater capacity for evil he has also 
greater capacity for good, and in proportion to his faults so wilt his virtues 
be when he turns to <I>God. </I>&quot; There is more joy in heaven over one 
sinner that repenteth than over ninety and nine just persons,&quot; because more 
force of character, more power for good or evil is displayed by the sinner than 
by the feebly correct. And that power is the most precious thing in life.</P>
<P>This great dual law, right and wrong, two antagonistic forces, call them what 
we will, is designated by the term duad. It is the secret of life and the 
revelation of that secret means death. This secret is embodied in the myth of 
the Tree of Knowledge in Genesis. At death the discord will be resolved, but not 
till then.</P>
<P>From the duad is derived the triad on which is based the doctrine of the 
Trinity. Two forces producing equilibrium, the secret of nature, are designated 
by the duad, and these Three, call them life, good. evil, constitute one law. By 
adding the conception of unity to that of the triad we arrive at the tetrad. the 
perfect number of four, the source of all numerical combinations. According to 
theology there arc three persons in <I>God, </I>and these three form one Deity. 
Three and one make four because unity is-required to explain the Three. Hence, 
in almost all languages, the name of <I>God </I>consists of four letters. Again, 
two affirmations mike two negations either possible or necessary. According to 
the Kabalists the name of the Evil one consisted of the same four letters 
spelled back-ward, signifying that evil is merely the reflection or shadow of 
good- The last reflection or imperfect mirage of light in shadow.&quot;</P>
<P>All which exists in light or darkness, good or evil, exists through the 
tetrad. The triad or trinity, then, is explained by the duad and resolved by the 
tetrad.</P>

<P>Godfrey :</B> A priest of Provence, who had seduced several women. One of 
them, a nun, to save herself, asserted that <I>Godirey </I>had bewitched 
her.</P>
<P>Arrested and imprisoned, he was tortured until he confessed that he was a 
magician, and that he had, by means of his breathing and other enchantments, 
corrupted this woman and several others. He was even induced, in his extreme 
agony, to speak of his presence at the Witches' Sabbath, and to give a long 
description of it. After these confessions had been cruelly extorted from the 
anguish of failing nature, the Parliament of Aix condemned him, on the 
<B>30</B>th of April, <B>1611</B>, to be burnt alive, as guilty of magic, 
sorcery. impiety, and abominable lust-a sentence which was carried into 
execution without delay.</P>
<P>This horrible affair gave rise to an adventure which has been related by the 
Abbe of Papon.</P>
<P>&quot;The process,&quot; said he, contained many depositions upon the power 
of the demons. Several witnesses protested that after being anointed with a 
magic oil, <I>Godfrey </I>transported himself to the Sabbath, and afterwards 
returned to his chamber down the shaft of the chimney. One day, when these 
depositions had been read to the Parliament, and the imagination of the judges 
excited by a long recital of supernatural events, there was heard in the chimney 
an extraordinary noise, which suddenly terminated with the apparition of a tall 
black man. The judges thought it was the devil come to the rescue of his 
disciple, and fled away swiftly, with the exception of a councillor Thorton, 
their reporter, who, finding himself entangled in his desk, could not follow 
them. Terrified by what he saw, with trembling body and staring eyes, and 
repeatedly making the sign of the cross, he in his turn affrighted the pretended 
demon, who was at a loss to understand the magistrate's perturbation. Recovering 
from the embarrassment he made himself known, and proved to be a chimney sweeper 
who, after having swept the chimney of the Messieurs des Comptes, whose chimneys 
joined those of the Tournelle, had by mistake descended into the chamber of the 
Parliament.&quot;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Goethe, Johann Wolfgang :</B> German Author, (<B>1749</B>-<B>1832</B>) 
<I>Johann Wolfgang Goeth, </I>probably the most celebrated of all German 
writers, was born at Frankfurt-on-the-Main in <B>1749</B>, his father being a 
lawyer of some eminence. At an early age the boy showed a persistent fondness 
for drawing, and assimilated the rudiments of learning with surprising ease; 
while in <B>1759</B>, on a French nobleman of aesthetic tastes coming to stay 
with the Goethes, a warm friendship between him and the future author sprang up, 
and proved the means of accelerating the latter's intellectual development. 
Shortly after this a French theatre was founded at Frankfurt, and here young 
Goethe became conversant with Racine; while simultaneously he made some early 
attempts at original writing, and began to learn Italian, Latin and Greek, 
English and even Hebrew. Very soon, however, a little cloud came to darken his 
horizon-just the cloud which has dimmed the blue skies for so many youths-for at 
the age of fifteen he became desperately enamoured of a young girl, and as his 
parents disapproved of the match the pair were separated straight-way. At first 
<I>Goethe </I>declared himself broken-hearted, and being intensely virile, as 
all men of might are, he sought consolation in loose-living. But a broken heart 
seldom proves a fatal malady, and the disappointed lover's restoration to mental 
health was facilitated betimes by his removal from his native town to Leipsic, 
where he entered the university, intending to become a lawyer.</P>
<P>At Leipsic <I>Goethe </I>showed slender affection for the actual curriculum, 
and instead he continued in essay writing and drawing, while he even took 
lessons in etching. He also found time for another love-affair, but this was cut 
short in <B>1768</B> by his undergoing a serious illness; and, on his recovering 
therefrom, he decided to leave his present <I>alma meter </I>in favour of that 
of Strasburg. Arrived there, he became intimate with Jung Stilling, while his 
taste for letters was strengthened, Homer and Ossian being the masters for whom 
he chiefly avowed affection; while, though lie continued to show himself callous 
as regards law, he succeeded in becoming an advocate in <B>1771</B>, whereupon 
he returned to Frankfurt.</P><I>
<P>Goethe </I>had already written a quantity of verse and prose, and now, in his 
native town, he began to do critiques for some of the newspapers there, while 
simultaneously he commenced writing <I>Goetz von Berlichingen </I>and 
<I>Werther. </I>These were followed shortly by <I>Prometheus, </I>and in 
<B>1774</B> the author started working at <I>Faust, </I>while the following year 
witnessed the production of some of his best love poems, these being addressed 
to Lilli Schonemann, daughter of a Frankfurt banker. Nothing more than poetry, 
however, was destined to result from this new devotion; and scarcely had it come 
and gone ere <I>Goethe's </I>whole life was changed, for meanwhile his writings 
had become famous, and now the young Duke Carl August of Weimar, anxious for a 
trusty henchman, invited the rising author to come to his court. The invitation 
was accepted, <I>Goethe </I>became a member of the privy-council, while 
subsequently he was raised to the rank of Geheimrath and then ennobled.</P><I>
<P>Goethe's </I>life at Weimar was a very busy one. Trusted implicitly by the 
Duke, he directed public roads and buildings, he attended to military and 
academic affairs, and he founded a court theatre. But though having all these 
outlets for his energy he continued to write voluminously, among the most 
important works he produced during his first years at the Duke's court being 
<I>Iphigenia </I>and <I>Wilhelm Meister; </I>while in <B>1787</B> he made a 
lengthy stay in Italy, visiting Naples, Pompei, Rome and Milan. Returning to 
Weimir, he began writing <I>Egmont; </I>while in <B>1795</B> he made the 
acquaintance of Schiller, with whom he speedily became very intimate, and along 
with whom he worked on the <I>Horen, </I>a journal designed to elevate the 
literary tastes of the masses. About this period, too, <I>Goethe </I>wrote his 
play of <I>Hermann und Dorothea, </I>and likewise did sundry translations from 
Voltaire, Diderot and Benvenuto Cellini; while the year <B>1806</B> is a 
significant one in his history, marked as it is alike by his marriage and by the 
entry of Napoleon into Weimar. The conquering general and the German poet each 
found much in the other to admire, and the latter was decorated with the cross 
of the Legion of Honour; nor did his literary activities show any signs of 
flagging as yet, for in <B>1811</B> he wrote <I>Dichtung end Wahrheit, </I>in 
<B>1821</B> <I>Wilhelm Meister's Wanderjahre, </I>and a little later he 
commenced working at a second part of <I>Faust, </I>During the time he was 
engaged thus he had two famous visitors, Beethoven coming from Vienna and 
Thackeray from London; and, though the composer imagined himself coldly 
received, the novelist on the contrary spoke with enthusiasm of the welcome 
accorded him. But <I>Goethe </I>was now well-stricken in years, his health was 
beginning to fail, and he died early in <B>1832</B>.</P>
<P>Few great writers, not even Disraeli or Sir Walter Scott, had fuller lives 
than <I>Goethe. </I>His love-affairs, besides those cited above, were countless, 
and his early taste for the graphic arts continued to the end of his days, 
resulting in his making a vast collection of treasures ; while his interest in 
mysticism, by virtue of which he is included in this volume, manifested itself 
in divers forms besides the writing of <I>Faust. </I>For, something of a 
nympholept as he was, Goethe's mind was essentially an aspirational and 
speculative one, and during his childhood at Frankfurt he used to do symbolical 
drawings of the soul's aspirations to the deity, while subsequently he became 
immersed in the study of the Christian religion. Anon he grew sceptical on this 
subject, his ideas being altered not only by his own ruminations but by his 
readings in various iconoclastic philosophers, especially Rousseau; and it would 
seem that latterly his intellect was less engaged by Christianity than by those 
other and probably more ancient Eastern faiths, his leanings in this direction 
being demonstrated by sundry works from his pen, notably his <I>West-ostliche 
Divan. </I>One of his note-books, moreover, shows that while a young man at 
Strassburg he made a close study of Giordano Bruno and other early scientists; 
while as a boy he was a keen student of alchemy, reading deeply in Welling and 
van Helmont, Basil Valentine and Paracelsus, and even fitting up a laboratory 
where he spent long hours in arduous experiments. No doubt it was while engaged 
in this way that he first conceived the idea of writing a drama on the subject 
of Dr. Faustus, but be that as it may, his alchemistic and other scientific 
researches certainly stood him in good stead when ultimately composing this 
work. The story's main outlines are so well known already-not only by reason of 
Calderon's and Marlowe's versions, but by the operas of Gounod, Schumann and 
Berlioz-that it were superfluous. if not impertinent to offer anything of the 
nature of a paraphrase or synopsis here; but it should be said, in drawing to a 
conclusion, that after all it is mainly on account of <I>Faust </I>that 
<I>Goethe </I>takes rank as a mystic, and a great mystic, for his rendering of 
the immortal theme is acknowledged as among the finest things in the whole of 
mystical literature.</P>

<P>Gormogons :</B> A Jacobite Masonic Society, perhaps related to the Lodges of

Letters to a Friend,&quot; and in the work of Prichard (<B>1730</B>). The Duke 
of Wharton and the Chevalier Ramsay who were well-known Jacobites, were members 
of the Order. They had a cipher and secret reception of their own, and used a 
jargon in which the names of places and individuals were hidden and transposed.

Merlin, a &quot; Book of the Sanctuary &quot; is referred to, but this is a book 
of records, not containing any special spiritual allusion.</P>
<P>If, and it is very doubtful if, such a book ever existed, it was most 
probably a. Mass hook, extant about <B>1100</B>. Its contents would relate to a 
Mass following the Last Supper, in which Christ gave Himself, the Priest 
serving. The mystery is threefold. (I) of Origin, which is part of the mystery

<P>Grail, Holy :</B> A portion of the Arthurian cycle of romance, of late origin 
embodying a number of tales dealing with the search for a certain vessel of 
great sanctity, called the grail&quot; or graal.&quot; </P>
<P>Versions of the story are numerous the most celebrated of them being the 
Conte del Graal, the Grand St. Graal, Sir Percyvalle, Quete del St. Graal, and 
Guyot; but there are many others. These overlap in many respects, but the 
standard form of the story may perhaps be found in the Grand St. Graal-one of 
the latest versions, which dates from the thirteenth century. It tells how 
Joseph of Arimathea employed a dish used at the last supper to catch the blood 
of the Redeemer which flowed from his body before his burial. The wanderings of 
Joseph are then described. He leads a band to Britain, where he is cast into 
prison, but is delivered by Evelach or Mordrains, who is instructed by Christ to 
assist him. This Mordrains builds a monastery where the <I>Grail </I>is housed. 
Brons, Joseph's brother-in-law, has a son Alain, who is appointed guardian of 
the <I>Grail; </I>and this Alain having caught a great fish, with which he feeds 
the entire household, is called the Rich Fisher, which title becomes that of the 
<I>Grail </I>keepers in perpetuity. Alain placed the <I>Grail </I>in the castle 
of Corbenic, and thence in due time come various knights of King Arthur's court 
in quest of the holy vessel, but only the purest of the pure can approach its 
vicinity; and in due time Percival attains to sight of the marvel.</P>
<P>It is probable that the <I>Grail </I>idea was originated by early medieval 
legends of the quest for talismans which conferred great boons upon the finder: 
as for example, the Shoes of Swiftness, the Cloak of Invisibility, the Ring of 
Gyges, and so forth ; and that these stories were interpreted in the light and 
spirit of medieval Christianity and mysticism. They may be divided into two 
classes: those which are connected with the quest for certain talismans, of 
which the <I>Grail </I>is only one, and which deal with the personality of the 
hero who achieved the quest; and secondly those which deal with the nature and 
history of the talismans.</P>
<P>A great deal of controversy has raged around the probable Eastern origin of 
the <I>Grail </I>Legend, and much erudition has been employed to show that 
Guyot, a Provencal poet who flourished in the middle of the twelfth century, 
found at Toledo in Spain an Arabian book by an astrologer, Flegitanis, which 
contained the <I>Grail </I>story. But the name &quot;Flegitanis&quot; can by no 
means be an Arabian proper name; and it might perhaps be the Persian 
<I>felekedaneh, </I>a Persian combined word which signifies&quot; 
astrology,&quot; and in this ease it would be the title of an astrological work. 
Professor Bergmann and others believed that the Holy Legend originated in the 
mind of Guyot himself; but this conclusion was strongly combated by the late 
Alfred Nutt. There is, however, good reason to believe that the story may have 
been brought from the East by the Knights Templar.</P>
<P>The <I>Grail </I>Legend has often been held by certain writers to buttress 
the theory that the Church of England or the Catholic Church has existed since 
the foundation of the world. From early Christian times the genealogy of these 
churches is traced back through the patriarchs to numerous apocryphal persons; 
but we are not informed as to whether it possessed hierophants in neolithic and 
paleolithic times, or how it originated. This mischievous and absurd theory, 
which in reality would identify Christianity with the grossest forms of 
paganism, is luckily confined to a small band of pseudo-mystics, comprising for 
the most part persons of small erudition and less liberality of outlook. The 
<I>Grail </I>Legend was readily embraced by those persons, who saw in it a link 
between Palestine and England and a plea for the special and separate foundation 
of the Anglican Church by direct emissaries from the Holy Land. Glastonbury was 
fixed as the headquarters of the <I>Grail </I>immigrants. and the finding of a 
glass dish in the vicinity of the cathedral there not many years ago was held to 
be confirmation of the story by many of the faithful. The exact date of this 
vessel cannot successfully be gauged, but there is not the least reason to 
suppose that it is more than a few hundred years old. <I>(See

two parts : the first containing the evocation of Lucifuge Rocofale <I>(See 
</I>&quot;Ceremonial Magic &quot; in article &quot;Magic&quot;) the second being 
concerned with the rite of making pacts with demons. The work is regarded as one 
of the most atrocious of its type but there is little reason for such heavy 
condemnation, as its childish and absurd. character must be patent to everyone.

surrender of the magician body and soul to the demon, and it is in this that the 
diabolical excellencies of the work consist. But the pact, as it stands, is 
grossly unfair to the devil, for the working of it is such, that the magician 
can very readily slip through his fingers.</P>

<P>Grandier, Urbaln :</B> <I>Urbain Grandier, </I>a canon of the French church, 
and a popular preacher of the town of Loudun in the district of Poiriers, was in 
the year <B>1634</B> brought to trial upon the accusation of magic. The first 
cause of his being thus called in question was the envy of his rival preachers, 
whose fame was eclipsed by his superior talents. The second cause was a libel 
falsely imputed to him upon cardinal Richelieu. <I>Grandier, </I>besides his 
eloquence, was distinguished for his courage and resolution, for the 
gracefulness of his figure, and the extraordinary attention he pied to the 
neatness of his dress and the decoration of his person, which last circumstance 
brought upon him the imputation of being so much devoted to the service of the 
fair About this time certain nuns of the convent of Ursulines at Loudun (q.v.) 
were attacked with a disease which manifested itself by very extraordinary 
symptoms, suggesting to many the idea they were possessed with devils. A rumour 
was immediately spread that <I>Grandier, </I>urged by some offence he had 
conceived against these nuns, was the author, by the skill he had in the arts of 
sorcery. of these possessions. It unfortunately happened that the same capuchin 
friar who assured cardinal Richelieu that <I>Greedier </I>was the writer of the 
libel against him, also communicated to him the story of the possessed nuns, and 
the suspicion which had fallen on the priest on their account. The cardinal, 
seized with avidity on this occasion of private vengeance, wrote to the 
counsellor of state at London, to cause a strict investigation to be made into 
the charges, and in such terms as plainly implied that what he aimed at was the 
destruction of <I>Grandier. </I>The trial took place in the month of August, 
<B>1634</B> and, according to the authorised copy of the trial, <I>Grandier 
</I>was convicted upon the evidence of Astaroth, a devil of the order of 
Seraphims, and chief of the possessing devils, of Easas, of Celsus, of Acaos, of 
Cedon, of Asmodens of the order of thrones, of Alex, of Zabulon, of Naphthalim, 
of Cham, of Uriel, and of Achas of the order of principalities. and sentenced to 
be burned alive. In other words, he was convicted upon the evidence of twelve 
nuns, who, being asked who they were, gave in these names, and professed to be 
devils that, compelled by the order of the court, delivered a constrained 
testimony. The. sentence was accordingly executed, and <I>Grandier </I>met his 
fate with heroic constancy. At his death an enormous drone fly was seen buzzing 
about his head. and a monk, who was present at the execution, attested that, 
whereas the devils are accustomed to present themselves in the article of death 
to tempt men to deny God their Saviour, this was Beelzebub (which in Hebrew 
signifies the God of flies), come to carry away to hell the soul of the 
victim.</P><B>
<P>Graterakes, Valentine :</B> An Irish mesmerist born in the county of 
Waterford in <B>1628</B>. In <B>1662</B>, he dreamed that he had received the 
gift of healing by laying on of hands. He ignored the dream, but as it occurred 
again on several occasions, he made an experiment upon his wife which was quite 
successful. He practised the laying on of hands for practically all diseases, 
and in <B>1666</B> went to London where he was summoned to court. Whilst there 
he healed many persons, but the insults of the courtiers proved too much for him 
and he was forced to withdraw to a house near London, where he continued his 
cures. In his <I>Critical History of Animal Magnetism </I>Pechlin says, Amongst 
the most astonishing cures which history records, are those of an Irish 
gentleman in London, Oxford, and other cities of England and Ireland. He himself 
published in London in <B>1666</B> a full account of them. &lsquo;<I>Val. 
Graterakes, </I>Esq., of Waterford, in the kingdom of Ireland, famous for curing 
several diseases and distempers by the stroak of his hand only: London 
<B>1660</B>'&quot;</P>
<P>Pechlin believes that no doubt whatever can be entertained of the reality of 
his cures, as they are related in his own work; and they are, therefore worthy 
of being translated into all languages. </P>
<P>Pechlin caused a number of letters and testimonials to be printed, which 
place the veracity and the character of <I>Graterakes </I>in the clearest light. 
In the first place, Job. Glanville, the author of <I>Scepsis Scientifica, </I>in 
which he treated all learning and human science as open to doubt, and who was 
also a chaplain to Charles II., says in a letter that <I>Graterakes </I>was a 
simple, amiable, and pious man, a stranger to all deceit. The same testimony was 
given to him by George Rust, Bishop of Dromore in Ireland. The bishop says that 
he was three weeks at his house, where he had an opportunity of observing his 
sound morals, and the great number of his cures of the sick. Through the simple 
laying on of hands he drove the pains to the extremities of the limbs. Many 
times the effect was very rapid and as if by magic. If the pains did not 
immediately give way, he repeated his rubbings, and always drove them from the 
nobler parts to the less noble, and finally into the limbs.</P>
<P>The Bishop relates still further :-&quot; I can as eyewitness assert that 
<I>Graterakes </I>cured dizziness, very bad diseases of the eyes and ears, old 
ulcers, goitre, epilepsy, glandular swellings, scirrhous indurations, and 
cancerous swellings. I have seen swellings disperse in five days which were many 
years old, but I do not believe by supernatural means; nor did his practice 
exhibit anything sacred. The cure was sometimes very protracted, and the 
diseases only gave way through repeated exertions; some altogether resisted his 
endeavours.'</P>
<P>It appeared to the bishop that something healing, something balsamic flowed 
from him. <I>Graterakes </I>himself was persuaded that his power was an especial 
gift of God. He healed even epdemic complaints by his touch, and on that account 
he believed it his duty to devote himself to the cure of diseases.</P>
<P>To the bishop's may be added the testimonies of two physicians, Faireklow and 
Astel, who very assiduously inquired into the reality of his cures.</P>
<P>&quot;I was struck,&quot; says Fairekiow, &quot; with his gentleness and 
kindness to the unhappy, and by the effects which he produced by his 
hand.&quot;</P>
<P>Astel says,- &quot;I saw <I>Graterakes </I>in a moment remove most violent 
pains merely by his hand. I saw him drive <I>a </I>pain from the shoulder to the 
feet. If the pains in the head or the intestines remained fixed, the endeavour 
to remove them was frequently followed by the most dreadful crises, which even 
seemed to bring the patient's life into danger; but by degrees they disappeared 
into the limbs, and then altogether. I saw a scrofulous child of twelve years 
with such swellings that it could not move, and he dissipated merely with his 
hand the greatest part of them. One of the largest, however, he opened, and so 
healed it with his spittle.&quot; Finally Astel says that he saw a number of 
other cures, and repeats the testimonies of Rust and Faireklow on the character 
of <I>Graterakes.</I></P>
<P>The celebrated Robert Boyle, President of the Royal Society of London, says 
:-' Many physicians, noblemen, clergymen, etc., testify to the truth of 
<I>Graterakes' </I>cures, which he published in London. The chief diseases which 
he cured were blindness, deafness, paralysis, dropsy, ulcers, swellings, and all 
kinds of fevers.&quot; Finally, it is said that 'he laid his hand on the part 
affected, and so moved the disease downwards.&quot;</P><I>
<P>Graterakes </I>was undoubtedly one of the most celebrated of the early 
mesmerists, and there is no question that the science owed considerable 
popularity to his cures. There was nothing of the charlatan about him, and he 
appears as an unaffected and simple person, whose whole desire was to make the 
best of the gift which he had received.</P>

<P>Greece :</B> That magic in its widest sense was native to the imagination and 
genius of the Greeks is apparent in their theogony and mythology, essentially 
magical in conception and meaning, in their literature, sculpture and history. 
The natural features of the country appealed powerfully to the quality of their 
imagination. Mountains and valleys, mysterious caves and fissures, vapours and 
springs of volcanic origin ; groves,-these according to their character, were 
dedicated to the gods. Parnassus was the abode of the sun-god, Apollo; the 
lovely vale of Aphaca that of Adonis; the oak-groves of Dodona favoured of Zeus, 
the gloomy caves with their roar of subterranean waters the Oracle of 
Trophonius. Innumerable instances of magical wonder-working are found in the 
stories of their deities and heroes. The power of transformation is shown in a 
multitude of cases, amongst them those of Bacchus who, by waving a spear, could 
change the oars of a ship into serpents, the masts into heavy-clustered vines, 
tigers, lynxes and panthers to appear amidst the waves, and the terrified 
sailors leaping overboard to take the shape of dolphins; in those wrought by 
Circe who by her magic wand and enchanted philtre turned her lovers into swine. 
The serpent-staff of Hermes gave, by its touch, life or death, sleep or waking; 
Medusa's head turned its beholders into stone; Hermes gave Perseus wings that he 
might fly and Pluto a helmet which conferred invisibility. Prometheus moulds a 
man of clay and to give it life steals celestial fire from heaven; Odysseus to 
peer into the future descends to Hades in search of Tiresias the Soothsayer; 
Achilles is made invulnerable by the Waters of the Styx.</P>
<P>Dedicated by immemorial belief there were places where the visible spirits of 
the dead might be evoked, Heraclea, Acheron, places where men in curiosity, in 
longing or remorse strove to call back for. a fleeting moment those who had 
passed beyond mortal ken. In the month of March, when the spring blossoms broke 
through the earth and snowed the trees with white, the Festival of the Flowers 
was held at Athens, also the Commemoration of the Dead, when their spirits were 
thought to rise from their graves and wander about the familiar streets, 
striving to enter the dwellings of man and temples of the gods but shut out 
therefrom by the magic of branches of whitethorn, or by knotted ropes and 
pitch.</P><I>
<P>Oracles: </I>Of great antiquity and eminently of Greek character and meaning 
were <I>the Oracles. </I>For centuries they ministered to that longing deeply 
implanted in human nature the longing to know the future, and to invoke divine 
foresight and aid in the direction of human affairs, from those of a private 
citizen to the multitudinous needs of a great state. Divination and prophecy 
were therefore the great features of the oracles. This was inspired by various 
means, by intoxicating fumes natural or artificial, by the drinking of mineral 
springs, by signs and tokens, by dreams. The most famous Oracles were those at 
Delphi, Dodona, Epidaurus, and that of Trophonius. but others of renown were 
scattered over the country. Perhaps one of the earliest was that of 
<I>Aesculapius </I>son of Apollo, and called the Healer, the Dream-sender 
because his healing was given through the medium of dreams that came upon the 
applicant while sleeping in the temple-courts, the famous temple-sleep. This 
temple, situated at Epidaurus. was surrounded by sacred groves and whole 
companies of sick persons lingered there in search of lost health and 
enlightment through divine dreams. Famous beyond all was that of Apollo, the 
<I>Delphian oracle </I>on the Southern Slopes of Parnassus where kings and 
princes, heroes and slaves of all countries journeyed to ask the questions as to 
the future and what it might hold for them. The temple was built above a 
volcanic chasm, amid a wildness of nature which suggested the presence of the 
unseen powers. Here the priestess, the Pythia, so named after the serpent Pytho 
whom Apollo slew, was seated on a tripod placed above the gaseous vapours rising 
from the chasm. Intoxicated to a state of frenzy, her mouth foaming. wild 
torrents of words fell from her lips, and these were shaped into coherence and 
meaning by the attendant priests and given to the waiting questioner standing 
before the altar crowned with laurel, the symbol of sleep and dreams and sacred 
to Apollo. Priests and priestesses were also crowned with these leaves, and they 
were burned as incense; before the Pythias chamber hung a falling screen of 
laurel branches while at the festival of the Septerion every ninth year a bower 
of laurel was erected ill the forecourt of the temple. One writer has left 
strange details such as the rule that the sacred fire within the temple must 
only he fed with firwood; and, though a woman was chosen as the medium of the 
prophetic utterance yet no woman might question the oracle. The <I>Oracle of the 
Pelasgic Zeus at Dodona, </I>the oldest of all, answered by signs rather than 
inspired speech, the rustling of the leaves in the sacred groves, by means of 
lots and the falling of water, by the wind-moved clanging of brazen-bowls, two 
hollow columns standing side by side. The three priestesses, Peliades, meaning 
doves, were given titles signifying the Diviner of the future ; the friend of 
man, Virtue the virgin-ruler of man, Chastity. For two thousand years this 
oracle existed, from the time when it was consulted by those heroes of the 
ancient myths, struggling in the toils of Fate, Hercules, Achilles, Ulysses and 
Aeneas, down to the latest vestiges of Greek nationality. The <I>Oracle of 
Trophonius </I>was also of great renown. Here there were numerous caverns filled 
with misty vapours and troubled by the noise of hidden waters far beneath. In 
this mysterious gloom the supplicants slept sometimes for nights and days, 
coming forth in a somnambulic state from which they were aroused and questioned 
by the attendant priests. Frightful visions were generally recounted, 
accompanied by a terrible melancholy, so that it passed into a proverb regarding 
a sorrowful man He has been in the cave of Trophonius.&quot; Thus it may be seen 
that magic in the sense of secret revelations, miraculous cures and prophetic 
gifts, of abnormal powers, had always existed for the Greeks, the oracles were a 
purely natural human way of communing with their gods upon earth. But magic in 
the lower sense of sorcery was unknown till Asiatic and Egyptian influences were 
introduced. The native conception of Fate as inexorable and inescapable for 
gods, kings and slaves alike was inimical to the spontaneous growth of a form of 
magic which had for its primary aim a certain command of the destinities of man. 
Good and evil and the perpetual strife between these two principles, the belief 
in demonology, these were foreign to the Greek mind, they were imported. It is 
said that to the Pythagorean school may be traced the first mention of good and 
evil demons and not till after the Persian War was there a word in the Greek 
language for magic. As these foreign beliefs were thus gradually introduced and 
assimilated they were ascribed to the native deities, gradually becoming 
incorporated with the ancient histories and rites.</P>
<P>After the invasion by the Persians, <I>Thessaly, </I>where their stay was of 
lengthy duration, became famous for its sorceresses and their practices which 
embraced a wide thanmaturgical field, from calling down the moon - brewing 
magical herbs for love or death, so much so that Apuleius in his romance, <I>The 
Golden Ass, </I>says, that when in Thessaly he was in the place &quot;where, by 
common report of the world, sorcery and enchantments were most frequent. I 
viewed the situation of the place in which I was, nor was there anything I saw 
that I believed to be the same thing which it appeared to be. Insomuch that the 
very stones in the street I thought were men bewitched and turned into that 
figure, and the birds I heard chirping, the trees with-out the walls, and the 
running waters, were changed from human creatures into the appearances they 
were. I persuaded myself that the statues and buildings could move ; that the 
oxen and other brute beasts could speak and tell strange tidings that I should 
bear and see oracles from heaven conveyed in the beams of the Sun.&quot;</P><I>
<P>Sorceresses.-Homer </I>tells the tale of Circe the enchantress, with her 
magic philtres and magic songs but makes no mention of Medea, the arch-sorceress 
of later times. Round her name the later beliefs clustered, to her were 
attributed all the evil arts, she became the witch par excellence, her infamy 
increasing from age to age. The same may be said of Hecate, the moon-goddess, at 
first sharer with Zeus of the heavenly powers, but later become an ominous shape 
of gloom, ruler and lover of the night and darkness, of the world of phantoms 
and ghouls. Like the Furies she wielded the whip and cord ; she was followed by 
hell hounds, by writhing serpents, by lamiae, strygae and empusae, figures of 
terror and loathing. She presided over the dark mysteries of birth and death ; 
she was worshipped at night in the flare of torches. She was the three-headed 
Hecate of the cross-roads where little round cakes or a lizard mask set about 
with candles were offered to her in propitiation, that none of the phantom mob 
might cross the threshold of man. <I>Love-magic and death-magic, </I>the usual 
forms of sorcery became common in Greece as else where. Love philtres and charms 
were eagerly sought, the most innocent being bitten apples and enchanted 
garlands. Means of protection against the evil eye became a necessity for tales 
of bewitchment were spread abroad, and of misfortune and death being brought 
upon the innocent and unwary by means of a waxen figure moulded in their image 
and tortured by the sorceress. In tombs and secret places leaden tablets were 
buried inscribed with the names of foes and victims, pierced through with a nail 
in order to bring disaster and death upon them. At this time it became law that 
none who practised sorcery might participate in the Eleusinian Mysteries, and at 
Athens, a Samian Sorceress, Theoris, was cast to the flames.</P><I>
<P>Orphic Magic.-The </I>introduction of Egyptian influences were due generally 
to the agency of Orpheus and Pythagoras, who, while in Egypt, had been initiated 
into the mysteries. The story of Orpheus shows him as pre-eminently the 
wonder-worker, but one of beneficence and beauty. To men of his time everything 
was enchantment and prodigy. By the irresistible power of his music he 
constrained the rocks, trees and animals to follow him, at his behest storms 
arose or abated. He was the necromancer, who by his golden music overcame the 
powers of darkness, and descending to the world of shades, found his beloved 
Eurydice, and but for the fatal and disobedient look into her face em they 
gained the upper air would have brought her back to the living world. Jealous 
women tore him limb from limb, and his head floating down the waters of the 
Hebrus was cast on the rocky shores of Lesbos where, still retaining the power 
of speech, it uttered oracles, the guidance of which people from all parts 
sought, even those of Babylon. He was said to have instructed the Greeks in 
medicine and magic, and for long afterwards remedies, magical formulae, 
incantations and charms were engraved upon Orphean tablets and the power of 
healing was ascribed to the Orphean Hymns. Pythagoras, Philosopher and 
geometrician, to the populace a magician, indefatigable in the pursuit of 
knowledge, wielded an immense influence on the thought of his time. After his 
return from Egypt he founded a school where to those who had previously 
undergone severe and drastic discipline he communicated his wide and varied 
knowledge. He was also credited with miraculous powers such as being visible at 
the same hour in places far apart as Italy and Sicily; of taming a bear by 
whispering in its ear ; of calling an eagle from its flight to alight on his 
wrist.</P><I>
<P>Mysteries.-Among </I>the greatest features of religious life were the 
mysteries held at periodic intervals in connection with the different deities, 
such as the <I>Semothracian, </I>the <I>Bacchic </I>and most famous of all, the 
<I>Eleusinian. </I>Their origin is to be traced mostly to a pre-historic 
nature-worship and vegetation-magic. All these mysteries had three trials or 
baptisms by water, fire and air, and three specially sacred emblems, the 
phallus, egg and serpent, generative emblems sacred in all secret rites. The 
Samothracian centred round four mysterious deities, Axieros the mother, her 
children Axiocersos, male, Axiocersa, female, from whom sprang Casindos the 
originator of the universe. The festival probably symbolized the creation of the 
world, also the harvest and its growth. Connected with this was the worship of 
Cybele, goddess of the earth, of the cities and fields. Her priests, the 
Corybantes, dwelt in a cave where they held their ceremonies, including a wild 
and orgiastic weapon-dance, accompanied by the incessant shaking of heads and 
clanging of swords upon shields. The cult of <I>Bacchus </I>Was said by some to 
have been carried into <I>Greece </I>from Egypt by Melampus. He is the god of 
the vine and vegetation, and his mysteries typified the growth of the vine and 
the vintage; the winter sleep of all plant life and its renewal in spring. Women 
were his chief attendants, the Bacchantes, who, clashing cymbals and uttering 
wild cries in invocation of their god, became possessed by ungovernable fury and 
homicidal mania. Greatest of all in their relation to Hellenic life were the 
<I>Eleusinian Mysteries. </I>These were the paramount interest and function of 
the state religion exerting the widest, strongest influence on people of all 
classes. The rites were secret and their details are practically unknown, but 
they undoubtedly symbolised the myth of Demeter, corn-goddess, and were held in 
spring and September. Prior to initiation a long period of purification and 
preparation was enforced, during which the higher meaning of the myth was 
inculcated, the original meaning having become exalted by the genius of the 
Greeks into an intimate allegory of the soul of man, its birth, life and death, 
its descent into Hades and subsequent release therefrom. After this there came 
the central point of the mysteries, the viewing of certain holy and Secret 
symbols; next, a crowning with garlands, signifying the happiness which arises 
from friendship with the divine. The festival also embodied a scenic 
representation of the Story of Demeter; the rape of Persephone, the sorrow of 
the mother, her complaints before Zeus, the final reconciliation. Women played a 
great part in this, the reason being that as they themselves produce,&quot; so 
by sympathetic magic their influence was conveyed to the corn, as when crying 
aloud for rain they looked upward to the skies, then down to the earth with 
cries of ' Conceive These priestesses were crowned with poppies and corn. 
symbolical attributes of the deity they implored. <I>(See </I>article 
Mysteries.)</P><I>
<P>Divination.-Besides </I>the priests and priestesses attached to the different 
temples there was an order of men called interpreters whose business it was to 
read futurity by various means such as the flight of birds and entrails of 
victims. These men often accompanied the armies in order to predict the success 
or failure of operations during warfare and thus avert the possibility of 
mistakes in the campaign: they fomented or repressed revolutions in state and 
government by their predictions. The most celebrated interpreters were those of 
Elis, where in two or three families this peculiar gift or knowledge was handed 
down from father to son for generations. But there were others who were 
authorised by the state-men who traded on the credulity of the rich and poor, 
women of the lowest dregs of humanity, who professed to read the future in 
natural and unnatural phenomena, in eclipses, in thunder, in dreams, in 
unexpected sight of certain animals, in convulsive movement of eyelids, tingling 
of the ears, in sneezing, in a few words casually dropped by a passer-by. In the 
<I>literature </I>and <I>philosophies </I>of <I>Greece </I>magic in all its 
forms is found as theme for imagination, discussion and belief. In the hands of 
the tragic poets, sorceresses such as Circe and Medea become figures of terror 
and death, embodiments of evil. Pythagoras left no writings but on his theories 
were founded those of Empedocles and Plato.</P>
<P>In the verses of Empedocles he teaches the theory of re incarnation, he 
himself remembering previous existences wherein he was a boy, a girl, a plant, 
fish and bird. He also claimed to teach the secrets of miraculous medicine, of 
the re-animation of old age, of bringing rain, storm, or sunshine, of recalling 
the dead. Aristides the Greek orator gives exhaustive accounts of the many 
dreams he experienced during sleep in the temples and the cures prescribed 
therein. Socrates tells of his attendant spirit or genius who warned him, and 
others through his agency, of impending danger, also foretelling futurity.</P>
<P>Xenophon, treating of divination by dreams, maintains that in sleep the human 
soul reveals her divine nature, and being freed from trammels of the body gazes 
into futurity. Plato, while inveighing against sorcery, took the popular 
superstitions relating to magic, demons and spirits and by his genius purified 
and raised them, using them as a basis for a spiritual and magical theory of 
things, unsurpassed for intellectual beauty. On his teaching was founded the 
school of Neo-Platonists who were among the most fervid defenders of magic. 
Aristotle states that prediction is a purely natural quality of the imagination, 
while Plutarch in his writings, wherein much may be found on magic and dreams, 
gives an exhaustive account or the somnambulic states of the oracular priestess, 
Pythia, attributing them to possession by the divinity. K.N.</P><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Greece. Modern :</B> Although superstition is rife in the Hellenic 
archipelago it partakes more of the nature of Slavonic tradition than that of 
the ancient inhabitants of the country, and is more or less petty and 
ill-defined. But the most notable circumstance in modern Greek superstition is 
that which relates to Vampirism. The Vampire is called <I>Broucolack </I>by the 
modern Hellenes, and appears to date from medieval times. Says Calmet, &quot; It 
is asserted by the modern Greeks, in defence of their schism, and as a proof 
that the gift of miracles, and the episcopal power of the keys, subsists in 
their church more visibly and evidently than in the church of Rome, that, with 
them, the bodies of excommunicated persons never rot, but swell up to an 
uncommon size, and are stretched like drums, nor ever corrupt or fall to dust, 
till they have received absolution from some bishop or priest. And they produce 
many instances of carcasses which have been in their graves uncorrupted, and 
which have afterwards putrefied as soon as the excommunication was taken 
off.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;They do not, however, deny that a body's not corrupting is sometimes a 
proof of sanctity, but in this case they expect it to send forth an agreeable 
smell, to be white or ruddy, and not black, stinking, and swelled like a drum, 
as the bodies of excommunicated persons generally are. We are told, that in the 
time of Manuel, or Maximus, patriarch of Constantinople, the Turkish emperor 
having the mind to know the truth of the Greek notion concerning the 
incorruption of excommunicated bodies, the patriarch ordered the grave of a 
woman, who had lived in a criminal commerce with an archbishop of 
Constantinople, to be opened. Her body being found entire, black and much 
swelled, the Turks put it into a chest, under the emperor's seal, and the 
patriarch having repeated a prayer, and given absolution to the deceased, the 
chest was opened three days after and the body was found reduced to ashes. It is 
also a notion which prevails among the Greeks, that the bodies of these 
excommunicated persons frequently appear to the living, both day and night, and 
speak to them, call upon them, and disturb them several other ways.</P>
<P>&quot;Leo Allatius is very particular upon this head, and says, that in the 
isle of Chio, the inhabitants never answer the first time they are called, for 
fear of its being a spectre but if they are called twice, they are sure it is 
not a Broucolack (this is the name they give these spirits). If any one appears 
at the first call, the spectre disappears, but the person certainly dies.</P>
<P>&quot;They have no way to get rid of these evil genii, but to dig up the body 
of the person that has appeared, and burn it after having repeated over it 
certain prayers. By this means the body being reduced to ashes, appears no more. 
And they look upon it as a clear case, that either these mischievous and 
spiteful carcasses come Out of their graves of their own accord, and occasion 
the death of the persons that see or speak to them ; or that the devil himself 
makes use of these bodies to frighten and destroy mankind. They have hitherto 
discovered no remedy which more infallibly rids them of these plagues, than to 
burn or mangle the bodies which were made use of for these cursed purposes. 
Sometimes the end is answered by tearing out the heart and letting the bodies 
rot above ground before they burn them again, or by cutting off the head, or 
driving a large nail through the temples.</P>
<P>Sir Paul Rycaut in his <I>History of the Present State of the Greek Church, 
</I>observes, that the opinion that, excommunicated bodies are preserved from 
putrefaction, prevails, generally, not only among the Greeks, but also among the 
Turks, and he gives us a fact which he had from a Caloyer of Candia, who 
confirmed it to him upon oath. The caloyer's name was Sophronius, a man well 
known and respected in Smyrna.</P>
<P>There died in the island of Milo, a man, who was excommunicated for a fault 
which he had committed in the Morea, and he was buried in a private place, 
without any ceremonies, and in unconsecrated ground. His relations and friends 
expressed great dissatisfaction at his being treated in this manner, and very 
soon after the inhabitants of the island were tormented every night by frightful 
apparitions, which they attributed to this unhappy man. Upon opening the grave 
his body was found entire, and his veins swelled with blood, and a consultation 
being held upon the subject, the caloyers dismembering his body, cutting it in 
pieces, and boiling it in wine, which, it seems, is the usual manner of 
proceeding there in those cases.</P>
<P>However, the friends of tile deceased prevailed upon them, by dint of 
entreaty, to delay the execution, and in the meantime sent to Constantinople to 
get absolution for him from the patriarch. Till the messenger could return the 
body was laid in the church and prayers and masses were said daily for the 
repose of his soul. One day while Sophronius the caloyer above mentioned, was 
performing the service, there was heard on a sudden a great noise in the coffin, 
and upon examination the body was found reduced to ashes, as if it had been dead 
seven years. Particular notice was taken of the time when the noise was heard, 
and it was found to be the very morning when the absolution was signed by the 
patriarch. Sir Paul Rycaut, who has recorded this event, was neither a Greek nor 
Roman Catholic, but a staunch Protestant of the Church of England</P>
<P>He observes upon this occasion, that the notion among the Greeks is, that an 
evil spirit enters into the excommunicated carcass and preserves it from 
corruption by performing the usual functions of the human soul in a living body. 
They fancy, moreover, that these corpses eat by night, and actually digest and 
are nourished by their food; that several have been found of a fresh, ruddy 
colour, with their veins ready to burst With blood, full forty days after their 
death, and that upon being opened there has issued from them as large a quantity 
of warm fresh blood as would come from a young person of the most sanguine 
constitution. And this opinion prevails so universally, that every one is 
furnished with a story to this purpose. Father Theophilus Raynard, author of a 
particular treatise upon this subject, asserts that this coming again of 
deceased persons is an undoubted truth, and supported by unquestionable facts. 
But to pretend that these spectres are always excommunicated persons, and that 
the schismatical Church of <I>Greece </I>has a privilege of preserving from 
putrefaction the bodies of those that die under her sentence, is what cannot be 
maintained, since it is certain that excommunicated bodies rot as well as 
others, and that several who have died in the communion of the church. Greek as 
well as Roman, have continued uncorrupted. There have even been instances of 
this nature among the heathens, and frequently among other animals, whose 
carcasses have been found unputrefied in the ground, and among the ruins of old 
buildings. Whoever will examine more accurately into this matter, may consult 
father Goard's <I>Rituel des Grecs, </I>p. <B>687</B>, <B>688</B>. Matthew 
Paris's <I>History of England, </I>t. ii. p.<B>687</B>. Adam of Bremen, c. ixxv. 
Albert of Stade, under the year <B>1050</B>; and M. Ducange, <I>Glossar. 
Latinit, </I>at the word &quot; Imblocatus.&quot;</P>
<P>M. De Tournefort has given, in his travels, an account of the digging up an 
imaginary Broucolack in the island of Mycone, where he was on the <B>1</B>st of 
January, <B>1701</B>. His words are as follow :-&quot; We were present at a very 
different scene in the same island, upon occasion of one of those dead corpses. 
which they suppose to come to life again after their burial. The man, whose 
story I am going to relate, was a peasant in Mycone, naturally ill-natured and 
quarrelsome (a circumstance of consequence in such cases); he was murdered in 
the fields, nobody knew how, or by whom.</P>
<P>&quot;Two days after his being buried in a chapel in the town it was noised 
about that he was seen in the night walking about in a great hurry; that he came 
into houses and tumbled about their goods,' griped people behind, and played a 
thousand little monkey tricks. At first it was only laughed at, but it soon grew 
to be a very serious affair when the better sort of people joined in the 
complaint. The Papas themselves gave credit to it, and no doubt had their 
reasons for so doing. Masses, to be sure, we said, but the peasant was 
incorrigible, and continued his old trade. After several meetings of the chief 
people of the town, and of the priests and monks, it was concluded to be 
necessary, in obedience to some old ceremonial, to Wait till nine days after the 
burial.</P>
<P>&quot;On the tenth day, a mass was said in the chapel where the body lay, in 
order to drive out the devil, which was imagined to have taken possession of it. 
When the mass was over the body was taken up, and preparations were made for 
pulling out its heart. The butcher of the town, an old clumsy fellow, began with 
opening the belly instead of the breast. He groped a long while among the 
entrails without finding what he looked for, till at 'last somebody said he 
should cut up the diaphragm, and then the heart was pulled out, to the 
admiration of the spectators. In the meantime the carcass stunk so abominably 
that they were obliged to burn frankincense but the smoke mixing with the fumes 
of the corpse. increased the stink and began to heat the poor people's brains. 
Their imagination, already affected with the spectacle before them, grew full of 
whimsies, and they took it into their heads that a thick smoke came from the 
body; nor durst we say that it was only the smoke of the incense.</P>
<P>&quot;In the chapel and the square before it they were incessantly bawling 
out Broucolack, which is the name they give to these pretended redivivi. From 
hence the bellowing was communicated to the streets and seemed to be invented on 
purpose to split the roof of the chapel. Several there present averred that the 
blood of the offender was red, and the butcher swore that the body Was still 
warm, whence they concluded that the deceased was guilty of a heavy crime for 
not being thoroughly dead, or rather for suffering himself to be re-animated by 
the devil, which is the notion they have of a Broucolack. They then roared out 
that Word in a stupendous manner. Just at this time there came in a flock of 
people. who loudly protested that they plainly saw the body was not grown stiff 
When it Was carried from the fields to the church to be buried, and that 
consequently it was a true Broucolack, Which word continued to be the burden of 
the song.</P>
<P>&quot;I question not but they would have sworn it did not stink if we hid not 
been there so thoroughly were their heads turned upon this occasion, and so 
strongly were they infatuated with the notion of these spectres. As for us, we 
got as close to the body as we could, that we might observe what passed more 
exactly, and were almost poisoned with the stink When they asked us what we 
thought of the corpse we told them we believed it to be completely dead, and 
having a mind to cure, or, at least, not to exasperate their prejudices, we 
presented to them that it was no wonder the butcher should feel some warmth, by 
groping in the entrails, which were then putrefying, that it Was no 
extraordinary thing for it to emit fumes since the same will happen upon turning 
up a dunghill, and that as for the pretended redness of the blood, it was still 
visible by the butcher's hands, that it was a mere stinking nasty smear.</P>
<P>&quot;After all our reasoning they resolved upon going to the sea-shore, and 
there burning the dead man's heart. But, notwithstanding this execution, he did 
not grow more peaceable, but made more noise than ever. He was accused of 
beating people in the night, breaking down doors, and even roofs of houses, 
shattering windows, tearing clothes, and emptying casks and bottles. It was a 
ghost of a very thrifty constitution, nor do <B>1</B> believe that he spared any 
house but the consul's, where we lodged. In the meantime nothing could be more 
deplorable than the condition of this island. Not a head in it but was turned 
the wisest among them were seized like the rest. In short, it was a real 
disorder of the brain, as dangerous as lunacy or madness. Whole families quitted 
their houses, and brought their beds from the remotest parts of the town into 
the great square, there to spend the night. Every one complained of some fresh 
insult, and nothing could be heard but groans at the approach of night. The most 
sensible people among them thought proper to retire into the country.</P>
<P>&quot;When the prepossesion was so general, we thought it our best way to 
hold our tongues. Had we opposed it we should have been treated not only as 
fools, but as infidels. Indeed, how was it possible to bring a whole nation to 
its senses ? Those who believed in their hearts that we doubted the truth of the 
fact, came and reproached us with our incredulity, and endeavoured to prove that 
there were such things as Broucolacks, by quotations out of the <I>Buckler of 
Faith, </I>written by father Richard, a Jesuit missionary. Their argument was 
this: He was a Latin, and therefore you ought to believe him, nor should we have 
got anything by denying the consequence. We were entertained every morning with 
a recital- of the new pranks of this night-bird, who was even charged with being 
guilty of the most abominable sins.</P>
<P>&quot;Some of the citizens, who were most zealous for the public good, took 
it into their heads that there had been a defect in the most essential part of 
the ceremony. They were of opinion that mass ought not to have been said, till 
after the heart had been pulled out. With this precaution they insisted that the 
devil must needs have been worsted, and would not have ventured to come again; 
whereas, by mass being said first, he had time enough given him to make off, and 
return to his post when the danger was over.</P>
<P>&quot;After all these wise reflections, they were as much perplexed as at 
first setting Out. They meet night and morning, debate, and make processions for 
three days and three nights. The Papas are obliged to fast, and run from house 
to house with sprinklers on their hands. Holy water is plentifully scattered 
about, even to the washing of the doors, and filling the mouth of the poor 
Broucolack.</P>
<P>&quot;We repeated it so often to the magistrates, that we should not fail in 
Christendom to appoint a watch by night upon such an occasion, in order to 
observe what passed in the town, that at last they apprehended some vagabonds 
who had certainly a hand in these disorders; but either they were not the 
principal agents, or they were dismissed too soon. For two days after, to make 
themselves amends for the fast they had kept in prison, they begun to empty the 
wine casks of such as had been silly enough to leave their houses in the night, 
so that nothing was left but to have recourse again to prayers.</P>
<P>&quot;One day, as they were repeating a certain form, after having stuck a 
number of naked swords in the grave where the carcass lay (which they dug up 
three or four times a day to gratify the whim of whoever came by), an Albanian, 
who happened to be at Mycone, took upon him to pronounce with an air of great 
wisdom, that it was ridiculous to make use of the swords of Christians in such a 
case as this. Ate you so blind,&quot; says he, as not to see that the hilt of 
these swords, being made in the form of a cross, hinders the devil from coming 
out of the carcass ? I am surprised that you do not take the Turkish 
sabres.&quot; But the expedient of this wise personage had no effect : the 
Broucolack was still unruly; the whole island continued in a strange 
consternation, and they were utterly at a loss what saint to invoke, when all of 
a sudden, as if they had given one another the word, they begun to bawl all over 
the city that they had waited too long, that the Broucolack should be burned to 
ashes, and then they defied the devil to harbour there any longer, and that it 
was better to have recourse to this extremity, than to have the island totally 
deserted. For, in fact, several whole families had begun to pack up in order to 
retire to Syra or Tinos.</P>
<P>&quot;The magistrates, therefore, gave orders to carry the Broucolack to the 
point of St. George's Island, where they got ready a great pile, with pitch and 
tar, for fear the wood should not burn fast enough of itself. The remnant of 
this miserable carcass was thrown into it and soon consumed. It was the 
<B>1</B>st of January, <B>1701</B>, and we saw the flame as we returned from 
Delos. It might properly be called a rejoicing bonfire, as no more complaints 
were heard of the Broucolack. They only said that the devil had at last met with 
his match, and some ballads were made to turn him into ridicule.</P>
<P>&quot;It is a notion which prevails all over the Archipelago that the devil 
re-animates no carcasses but those of the Greek communion. The inhabitants of 
Santorini are terribly afraid of these bug-bears : those of Mycone, after their 
whims Were dissipated, Were equally afraid of a prosecution from the Turks, and 
from the bishop of Tinos. Not a single Papas would venture to be at St. George's 
when the body was burnt, for fear the bishop should insist upon a fee for their 
taking up and burning a body without his leave. As for the Turks, they did not 
fail, at their next visit, to make the Myconians pay heavily for their treatment 
of this poor devil, who became in every respect an object of abomination and 
horror to all the country.&quot;</P>

<P>Gregory the Seventh :</B> A pope of the eleventh century. against whom a 
charge of necromancy was brought. He is chiefly notable for his bitter and 
prolonged struggle with Henry IV., Emperor of Germany. A quarrel arose between 
them regarding the gift by Henry of ecclesiastical dignities, to account for 
which he was summoned before Gregory. He refused to appear, was excommunicated, 
and, in return, had the pope kidnapped by brigands. <I>Gregory, </I>however, was 
rescued by the people of Rome, and on his release commanded the Germans to elect 
a new emperor, Rudolph, duke of Suabia. Henry, attended by a very small retinue, 
thereupon repaired to Canossa, where <I>Gregory </I>at that time resided, to 
arrange for terms of peace. He was there treated with such severity and studied 
neglect that his desire to come to terms with the pope left him, and on his 
return he elected an anti-pope, Clement III. In the struggle which ensued Henry 
defeated Rudolph in battle and <I>Gregory </I>was sentenced as a sorcerer. He 
died in exile at Salerno.</P>
<P>As a magician he is not very conspicuous, for his fame rests chiefly on a 
prophecy he made publicly that Rudolph would be victorious, and that before St. 
Peter's day,&quot; on the fulfillment of which saying he staked his papal crown. 
The unfortunate Rudolph, entirely trusting to <I>Gregory's </I>oracular 
utterance, renewed the battle six times and finally perished without having 
obtained the promised victory. Other stories credit <I>Gregory </I>with the 
power of making lightning with a motion of his hand, and causing thunder to dart 
from his sleeve. It is related by Benno that on one occasion he left his magical 
book behind him at his villa. 'Entrusting two of his servants with the task of 
returning for it, he warned them not to look into it on pain of the most awful 
punishment. However, curiosity overcame the fears of one of them, and, opening 
the book he pronounced some words. Immediately a band of imps appeared and asked 
what was their command. The terrified servants begged that the demons would cast 
down so much of the city wall as lay in their way. and thus they escaped the 
penalty of their disobedience.</P>
<P>Of a lofty and severe cast of mind, Gregory's motive was not so much fraud as 
profound enthusiasm and strength of purpose, which sustained him through the 
struggle with Henry to the end of his life.</P>

<P>Grihestha :</B> <I>(See </I><B>India.</B>)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Grimoire :</B> A text-book of Black Magic. The three best known grimoires are 
the <I>Grimorium Verum, </I>the <I>Grand Grimoire, </I>and the <I>Grimoire of 
Pope Honorius. </I>Black magic (q.v.) is of course an ignorant and superstitious 
perversion of the true science, and the grimoires well illustrate this-their 
most noticeable feature being their utter futility. The grimoires, in fact, 
cannot be taken seriously, and the diabolic practices contained in their pages 
are more absurd than fearsome. Before entering upon them, the rites of the 
church are practised as a preliminary and fasting is observed. The great object 
of the <I>grimoires </I>is to invoke the infernal powers, and at the same time 
to trick them. The fiends are treated as imbeciles. In the <I>grimoire, </I>the 
magician is instructed how, when selling them his soul, he may deceive them by a 
play upon words. One of the chief desires of the sorcerer of the middle ages was 
to discover hidden treasure by means of Satanic agency, and having found it to 
devote himself to good deeds and the distribution of his wealth among the 
poor.</P>
<P>Abstinence from every species of impurity is strongly insisted upon for the 
space of an entire quarter of the moon, and the sorcerer most solemnly promises 
the grand Adonai (q.v.), the Master of all Spirits, that he shall not eat more 
than two meals per diem, and that these shall be prefaced by prayer. The 
operator must change his apparel as seldom as possible, and sleep only on 
occasion, meditating continually on his undertaking. and centering all his hopes 
in the infinite goodness of Adonai, who is undoubtedly the supreme deity, and 
not as might be thought a master-fiend. But the <I>grimoires </I>teem with 
mystifications, and it is frequently difficult to discern their real meaning. In 
the three grimoires alluded to, the infernal hierarchy is described at 
length-(See Demonology) but the principal contents of these works are evocations 
and spells for the gaining over of the diabolical powers to the purposes of the 
sorcerer. That they were employed by veritable professors of the art of black 
magic is rather unlikely, as the real black magician had very much higher aims 
than the mere unearthing of buried treasure, and it is most probable that they 
were for the most part in use among amateurs of the art, who dabbled in it 
merely in the hope of enriching themselves.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Grimoire of Honorius :</B> The A magical work published at Rome in 
<B>1629</B>, and not, as is generally thought, connected in any way with 
Kabbalistic magic. The work is indeed permeated with Christian ideas. It is 
extremely unlikely that it is the work of the Roman Bishop known as Honorius. 
The work has been called &quot;a malicious and somewhat clever imposture,&quot; 
since it pretends to convey the sanction of the Papal Chair to the operators of 
necromancy. It deals with the evocation of the rebellious angels.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Grimorium Verum :</B> The This magical text-book was first published in 
<B>1517</B>, and purported to be translated from the Hebrew. it is based to some 
extent upon the Key of Solomon (q.v.). and is quite honest in its statement that 
it proposes to invoke ' devils,&quot; which it refers to the four elements, so 
that these would appear to be of the type of elementary spirits (q.v.). A part 
of the account it gives regarding the hierarchy of spirits is taken from the 
Lemegeton (q.v.). The work is divided into three portions: the first describing 
the characters and seals of the demons, with the forms of their evocation and 
dismissal; the second gives a description of the supernatural secrets which can 
be learned by the power of the demons; and the third is the key of the work and 
its proper application. But these divisions only outline what it purports to 
place before the reader as the whole work is a mass of confusion. The plates 
which supply the characters do not apply to the text The book really consists of 
two parts-the <I>Grimorium Verum </I>itself and a second portion, which consists 
of magical secrets. The first supplies directions for the preparation of the 
magician based on those of the Clavicle of Solomon Instructions for the 
manufacture of magical instrument,, and the composition of a parchment on which 
the characters and seals are to be inscribed, as well as the processes of 
evocation and dismissal. The second part contains the ' admirable secrets &quot; 
of the pretended Albertus Magnus, the ' Petit Albert&quot; and so forth. The 
work is only partially diabolical in character, and some of its processes might 
claim to be classed as White Magic.</P>

<P>Grossetete, Robert :</B> Bishop of Lincoln from <B>1235</B>, and generally 
known as Robert of Lincoln. Among his many accomplishments he is said to have 
numbered some proficiency in the art of magic. Born of poor parents, he was 
early compelled to earn his own living, and even at times to beg for bread. He 
was at length ' discovered &quot; by the Mayor of Lincoln, who was attracted by 
his appearance and the shrewdness of his remarks, and had him Sent to school, 
where his remarkable capacity for study so helped his advancement that he was 
enabled to complete his education at Oxford, Cambridge, and Paris. The 
illustrious Roger Bacon characterised him and his friend, Friar Adam do Marisco, 
as the most learned men of their time. He was well skilled in the sciences of 
mathematics and astronomy, and a master of Greek and Hebrew. As a member of the 
clergy he distinguished himself chiefly by his vigorous denunciation of the 
abuses in the court of Rome, and particularly of the pope, Innocent IV., whose 
rule added but little lustre to the church. <I>Grossetete </I>did not hesitate 
to point out the misdeeds of the ecclesiastical dignitaries, many of whom had 
never even visited their various sees. And he openly pronounced Innocent to be 
the Antichrist.</P>
<P>His essays in necromancy include (Gower tells us) the making of a brazen 
head, which would answer questions and foretell the future. However, this would 
appear to be no unique accomplishment, as both Pope Silvester II., and Roger 
Bacon are credited with it</P>

<P>Gruagach :</B> That is &quot;long haired one from the Gaelic gruag, a wig: a 
faery being with protective duties, to be met with in Scottish legends and which 
apparently may be of either sex. The <I>Gruagach </I>appears to have been 
particularly associated with cattle, and milk was laid aside for him every 
evening - otherwise no milk would be got at next milking. Usually this being was 
of a beneficent nature although occasionally it showed mischievous traits by 
loosing the cattle in the byres so that the herds had to get up, sometimes 
several times during a night, to tie them up : this apparently caused the 
<I>Gruagach </I>much delight. There are many tales in different parts of 
Scotland about the <I>Gruagach, </I>from which one gathers that this fairy 
commonly had long hair and was well dressed, of whichever sex it might happen to 
be. <I>(See </I>Scotland).</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Gualdi :</B> Dr. Campbel, in his well-known work <I>Hermippus Redivivus or 
the Sage's Triumph over old age and the grave </I>relates that this person was 
probably a Rosicrucian who lived for several hundreds of years. The particulars 
concerning him are as follows, but they cannot he verified, and are regarded by 
Godwin as apocryphal: - He sojourned at Venice for several months, and was known 
by the name of the &quot;Sober Signior&quot; among the common people, on account 
of the regularity of his life, the composed simplicity of his manners and the 
quietness of his costume : for he always wore dark clothes, and these of a 
plain, unpretending style. Three things were remarked of him during his stay at 
Venice. The first was that he had a small collection of fine pictures, which her 
readily showed to everybody that desired it : the next, that he was perfectly 
versed in all arts and sciences, and spoke always with such minute particularity 
as astonished nay, silenced-all who heard him, because he seemed to have been 
present at the things which he related, making the must unexpected corrections 
in small facts sometimes. And it was, in the third place, observed that he never 
wrote or received any letter, never desired any credit, but always paid for 
everything in ready money, and made no use of bankers, bills of exchange, or 
letters of credit. However, he always seemed to have enough, and he lived 
respectably, though with no attempt at splendour or show.</P>
<P>Signor <I>Gualdi </I>met, shortly after his arrival at Venice, one day, at 
the coffee-house which he was in the habit of frequenting, a Venetian nobleman 
of sociable manners, who was very fend of art, and this pair used to engage in 
sundry discussions, and they had many conversations concerning the various 
objects and pursuits which were interesting to both of them. Acquaintance 
ripened into friendly esteem, and the nobleman invited Signor <I>Gualdi </I>to 
his private house, whereat-for he was a widower-Signor <I>Gualdi </I>first met 
the nobleman's daughter, a very beautiful young maiden of eighteen, of much 
intelligence, and of great accomplishments. The nobleman's daughter was just 
introduced at her father's house from a convent, or pension, where she had been 
educated by the nuns. This young lady, in short, from constantly being in his 
society, and listening to his narratives, gradually fell in love with the 
mysterious stranger, much for the reasons of Desdemona; though Signor <I>Gualdi 
</I>was no swarthy Moor, but only a well-educated gentleman-a thinker rather 
than a doer. At times, indeed, his countenance seemed to grow splendid in 
expression, and he boasted certainly wondrous discourse, and a strange and weird 
fascination would grow up about him, as it were, when he became more than 
usually pleased and animated. Altogether, when you were set thinking about him, 
he seemed a puzzling person, and of rare gifts, though when mixing with the 
crowd you would scarcely distinguish him from the crowd; nor would you observe 
him unless there was something akin to him in you excited by his talk.</P>
<P>The Venetian nobleman was now on a footing of sufficient intimacy with Signor 
<I>Gualdi </I>to say to him one evening, at his own house, that he understood 
that he had a fine collection of pictures, and that, if agreeable, he would pay 
him a visit one day for the purpose of viewing them. The nobleman's daughter, 
who was present, and who was pensively looking down upon the table thinking 
deeply of something that the Signor had just said, raised her eyes eagerly at 
this expression of wish by her father, and, as accorded with her feelings, the 
appeared, though she spoke not, to be desirous to make one of the party to see 
the pictures. It was natural that she should secretly rejoice at this 
opportunity of becoming more intimately acquainted with the domestic life of one 
whom she had grown to regard with feelings of powerful interest. She felt that 
the mere fact of being his guest, and under the roof which was his, would seem 
to bring her nearer to him, and, as common with lovers, It seemed that their 
being thus together would, in feeling at least, appear to identify both. Signor 
<I>Gualdi </I>was very polite, and readily invited the nobleman to his house, 
and also extended the invitation to the young lady, should she feel disposed to 
accompany her father, since he divined from the expression of her face that she 
was wishful to that effect. The day for the visit was then named, and the Signor 
took his departure with the expression of friendship on all sides which usually 
ended their meetings</P>
<P>It followed from this arrangement, that on the day appointed, the father and 
daughter went to Signor <I>Gualdi's </I>house. They were received by the Signor 
with warm kindness, and were shown over his rooms with every mark of 
friendliness and distinction The nobleman viewed Signor <I>Gualdi's </I>pictures 
with great attention, and when he had completed his tour he expressed his 
satisfaction by telling the Signor that he had never seen a finer collection, 
considering the number of pictures. They were now in Signor <I>Gualdi's </I>own 
chamber-the last of his set of rooms,-and they were just on the point of turning 
to go out, and <I>Gualdi </I>was removing the tapestry from before the door to 
widen the egress, when the nobleman, who had paused to allow him thus to clear 
the way, by chance cast his eyes upwards over the door, where there hung a 
picture evidently of the stranger himself. The Venetian looked upon it with 
doubt, and after a while his face fell; but it was soon cleared, as if with 
relief. The gaze of the daughter was also riveted upon the picture, which was 
very like <I>Gualdi </I>but she regarded it with a blush. The Venetian looked 
from the picture to <I>Gualdi, </I>and back again from <I>Gualdi </I>to the 
picture. It was some time before he spoke.</P>
<P>&quot;That picture was intended for you, sir,&quot; said he at last, 
hesitating, to Signor <I>Gualdi. </I>A slight cold change passed over the eyes 
of the stranger; but he only made reply by a low bow. You look a moderately 
young man, -to be candid with you, sir, I should say about forty-five, or 
thereabouts-and yet I know, by certain means of which I will not now further 
speak, that this picture is by the hand of Titian who has been dead nearly a 
couple of hundred years. How is this possible?&quot; he added, with a polite, 
grave smile. ' It is not easy,&quot; said Signor <I>Gualdi</I> quietly, &quot; 
to know all things that are possible, for very frequent mistakes are made 
concerning such but there is certainly nothing strange in my being like a 
picture painted by Titian.&quot; The nobleman easily perceived by his manner, 
and by a momentary cloud upon his brow, that the stranger felt offence. The 
daughter clung to her father's arm, secretly afraid that this little unexpected 
demur might pass into coolness, and end with a consummation of estrangement, 
which she feared excessively she dreaded the rupture of their intimacy with the 
stranger; and, contradictory as it may seem, she wanted to withdraw, even 
without the point she dreaded being cleared up into renewed pleasant confidence. 
However, this little temporary misunderstanding was soon put to an end by Signor 
<I>Gualdi </I>himself, who, in a moment or two, resumed his ordinary manner, and 
he saw the father and daughter down-stairs, and forth to the entrance of his 
house, with his usual composed politeness - though the nobleman could not help 
some feeling of restraint, and his daughter experienced a considerable amount of 
mortification; and she could not look at Signor <I>Gualdi-, </I>rather, when she 
did, she looked too much.</P>
<P>This little occurence remained in the mind of the nobleman. His daughter felt 
body and dissatisfied afterwards, eager for the restoration of the same friendly 
feeling with Signor <I>Gualdi, </I>and revolving in her mind numberless schemes 
to achieve it. The Venetian betook himself in the evening to the usual 
coffee-house, and he could not forbear speaking of the incident among the group 
of people collected there. Their curiosity was roused, and one or two resolved 
to satisfy themselves by looking at the picture attentively the next morning. 
But to obtain an opportunity to see the picture on this next morning, it was 
necessary to see the Signor <I>Gualdi </I>somewhere, and to have his invitation 
to his lodgings for the purpose. The only likely place to meet with him was at 
the coffee-house; and thither the gentlemen went at the usual time, hoping, as 
it was the Signor's habit to present himself, that he would do so. But he did 
not come-nor had he been heard of from the time of the visit of the nobleman the 
day before to the Signor's house-which absence, for a first time almost that he 
had been in Venice, surprised everybody. But as they did not meet with him at 
the coffee-house they thought was sure-one of the persons who had the oftenest 
conversed with the Signor, and therefore was the freer in his acquaintance, 
undertook to go to his lodgings and inquire after him, which he did; but he was 
answered by the owner of the house, who came to the street-door to respond to 
the questioner, that the Signor had gone, having quitted Venice that morning 
early, and that he had locked up his pictures with certain orders, and had taken 
the key of his rooms with him.</P>
<P>This affair made a great noise at the time in Venice, and an account of it 
found its way into most of the newspapers of the year in which it occurred. In 
these newspapers, and elsewhere, an outline of the foregoing particulars may be 
seen. The, account of the Signor <I>Gualdi </I>will also be met with in Les 
Memoires historiques for the year <B>1687</B>.</P>

<P>Guinefort :</B> A strange story has been left on record by Father Etienne 
Bourbon, a Dominican, who died in <B>1262</B>. He relates that while he was 
preaching in the diocese of Lyons, many women came to him confessing that they 
had taken their children to <I>St. Guinefort. </I>Curious to know what sort of 
saint it might be whose cult called for confession, Father Bourbon enquired into 
the matter, and found that <I>Guinefort </I>was a dog! It was, in fact, that dog 
which had given rise to the well-known fable of the dog and the serpent, wherein 
a dog is killed under the unjust suspicion that it has slain a child, which in 
reality it has saved from the attack of a serpent. This dog-martyr it was to 
whose &quot;shrine&quot; the women brought their children.</P>
<P>A similar story is told of a dog named Ganelon, whose tomb was in Auvergne, 
in the neighbourhood of a fountain. The adventure took place during the reign of 
Louis Le Debonnaire. Two or three centuries later it was found that the waters 
of the fountain possessed medicinal virtues, but cures were attributed to the 
unknown occupant of the tomb-that is, until a certain bishop found among the 
archives of the Chateau the anecdote of Ganelon.</P>

<P>Guppy, Mrs. :</B> Nee Miss Nichol, a celebrated English medium Who began to 
exercise her powers about <B>1866</B>. At that time she lived with Mrs. Sim, a 
sister of Dr. Alfred Russel Wallace, who was a frequent witness of her 
phenomena. Thereafter her mediumistic powers developed apace and the circle of 
her sitters grew as the manifestations became more ambitious. Raps were beard 
and apports of fruit and flowers conveyed to the seance-room. A. R. Wallace 
states that on one occasion &quot;the room and the table shook violently,&quot; 
and Miss Nichol herself was several times levitated-(See Levitation). Soon after 
the formal commencement of her mediumship she married Mr. Samuel Guppy. In 
January, <B>1872</B> she gave a materialisation seance, the first serious 
attempt of the kind in this country. She and her husband were also instrumental 
in introducing spirit-photography (q.v.) into England. On the death of Mr. Guppy 
she was married a second time to Mr. W. Volckman.</P>

<P>Gurney, Edmund :</B> A distinguished psychologist and student of psychic 
science. He was born at Horsham in <B>1847</B>, and educated at Blackheath and 
Trinity College, Cambridge, where he obtained a fellowship. He devoted himself 
thereafter to the study of medicine and passed the second M.B. Cambridge 
examination in <B>1880</B>. . Thus equipped, he turned to the investigation of 
psychical research, seeking, in common with most psychical researchers, to find 
evidence for the survival of consciousness and personality after death. He chose 
for exploration the region of unconscious or subconscious activity-what Mr. 
Myers, himself a worker in the same field, has designated the &quot;subliminal 
consciousness.&quot; From <B>1874</B> to <B>1878</B> <I>Gurney </I>and Myers 
worked with professional mediums, getting but poor results, but on the founding 
of the Society for Psychical Research experiments of a more scientific nature 
were made. These resulted in two volumes of <I>Phantasms of the Living, by 
</I>Messrs. Myers, Podmore, and <I>Gurney, </I>which went some way towards 
establishing telepathy on a sound basis. To the same end were directed Mr. 
<I>Gurney's </I>careful hypnotic experiments between <B>1885</B> and 
<B>1888</B>, and his contributions to the <I>Proceedings </I>of the S.P.R. He 
was, indeed, an ideal student of psychic research, acute, patient, exact, 
logical, and entirely disinterested. Besides his psychological works he wrote 
<I>The Power of Sound </I>(<B>1880</B>), an essay on music, and a collection of 
essays entitled Tertium Quid (<B>1887</B>). He died in June, <B>1888</B>, from 
an overdose of narcotic medicine.</P>

<P>Gustenhover :</B> A goldsmith who resided at Strasburg in <B>1603</B>. In a 
period of much danger he gave shelter to one M. Hirschborgen who is described as 
good and religions. In return for the hospitality of his host he gave him some 
powder of projection and departed on his journey.</P><I>
<P>Gustenhover </I>indiscreetly made transmutation before many people, which in 
due course reached the ears of Rudolph II. himself, an amateur alchemist. He 
forthwith ordered the Strasburg magistrates to send the goldsmith to him. He was 
accordingly arrested and guarded with the greatest vigilance. On learning that 
he was to be sent to the Emperor at Prague he disclosed the whole business and 
requesting the magistrates to meet together asked them to procure a crucet and 
charcoal, and without his coming near them to melt some lead. On the metal being 
molten he then gave them a small quantity of a reddish powder on which being 
thrown into the crucet produced a considerable amount of pure gold.</P>
<P>On being brought into the presence of the Emperor he confessed that he had 
not himself prepared the magical powder and was wholly ignorant of the nature of 
its composition.</P>
<P>This the Emperor refused to believe in spite of the repeated protestations of 
the goldsmith. The powder being at length exhausted, <I>Gustenhover </I>was set 
to the now impossible task of making more gold. He sought refuge from the fury 
of the Emperor by an alchemical blasphemy accursed by all sons of the doctrine. 
Convinced that the alchemist was concealing his secret, the Emperor had him 
imprisoned for the rest of his life.</P>
<P>It is believed that Hirschborgen who presented <I>Gustenhover </I>with the 
powder was no other than Alexander Sethon (q.v.), who at that period was 
travelling Germany in various disguises.</P><B>

<P>Guyon, Madame (1648-1717) :</B> Jeanne Marie Bouvieres de la Mothe, a 
celebrated mystic and quietest who suffered much persecution at the hands of 
tile Church of Rome. She was born at Montargis on April <B>13</B>th, 
<B>1648</B>, and early showed a passion for martyrdom and religious exercises. 
As she grew older vanity took the place of devotion, for she was both witty and 
beautiful. At the age of sixteen She was forced into a marriage with the wealthy 
M. Guyon, more than twenty years her senior, in whose household she was exposed 
to insult and cruelty. Broken in spirit she turned once more to religion, and 
consulted a Franciscan, who advised her to seek God in her heart rather than in 
outward observances. From that time she became a mystic, aiming at the 
suppression of all human hopes and fears, and desires, and the attainment of a 
completely disinterested love of God. She embraced every form of suffering, 
physical and mental, and even eschewed spiritual joys. In <B>1680</B> M. Guyon 
died, and his widow was released from bondage. Henceforth she embraced the 
doctrine of quietism. In losing the gifts,&quot; she said, she had found the 
Giver, and had reached an ideal state of resignation and self-suppression.&quot; 
She went to Paris, expounded her theories with earnestness and charm, and 
gathered an Illustrious circle about her. Here also she made friends with 
Fenelon. But the persecutions of the Church increased. She herself requested 
that a commission be appointed to examine her doctrine and writings. Three 
commissioners were chosen, among them Bossuet, the champion of the Church, her 
erstwhile friend and now her bitter enemy. Her writings were condemned, and she 
herself incarcerated at Vincennes. For four years she lay in the dungeons of the 
Bastile, while Bossuet used every means to calumniate her name and doctrine. In 
<B>1702</B>, her health broken, she was released and sent to Blois where she 
died in <B>1707</B>. Her last years were blessed with peace and resignation, and 
such a submission to trials as she had ever shown.</P><B>

<P>Gwion Bach :</B> In Welsh romance and myth, son of Gwreang. Set by Ceridwin 
to stir the magic cauldron of science and inspiration intended to be drunk by 
her son, <I>Gwion </I>tasted the liquid and became gifted with supernatural 
sight. He fled, pursued by Ceridwin, and the pair were changed 'successively 
into a hare and a greyhound, a fish and an otter, a bird and a hawk, a grabs of 
wheat and a black hen, which ultimately swallowed the wheat. (Compare the 
metamorphose of Ceridwin and <I>Gwion Bach </I>with that of the Queen of Beauty 
and the Djinn in the <I>Arabian Nights; </I>Tale of the Second Calendar). Later 
<I>Gwion </I>was placed in a bag and flung into the sea by Ceridwin. He was 
drawn out by Elphin, son of Cwyddus, and was now called Taliesin (Radiant 
Brow).</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Gypsies :</B> The name Gypsy, an abbreviation of &quot; Egyptian,&quot; has 
been used for centuries by English-speaking people to denote a member of a 
certain carte of turbulent wanderers who travelled Europe during the Middle 
Ages, and whose descendants, in a much-decayed condition. are still found in 
most European countries. Many other names, such as Saracen&quot; and &quot; 
Zigeuner,&quot; or &quot; Cigan.&quot; have been applied to these people, but 
&quot; Egyptian&quot; is the most; widespread in time and place. It does not 
relate to Egypt, but to the country of&quot; Little Egypt&quot; or &quot; Lesser 
Egypt,&quot; whose identity has never been clearly established. Two 
Transylvanian references of the years <B>1417</B> and <B>1418</B> indicate that 
Palestine is the country in question, but there is some reason to believe that ' 
Little Egypt&quot; included other regions in the Levant. <I>Gypsies </I>speak of 
themselves as Romane', and of their language as Romani-tchib 
<I>(tchib=</I>tongue). Physically, they are black-haired and brown-skinned, 
their appearance, like their language, suggesting affinities with Hindustan. 
But, although possessing marked racial characteristics, for the most part, they 
must also be regarded as a caste or organization. In recent centuries, if not in 
earlier times, many of their over-lords were not of Gypsy blood, but belonged to 
the nobility and <I>petite noblesse </I>of Europe, and were formally appointed 
by the kings and governments of their respective countries to rule over all the 
<I>Gypsies </I>resident within those countries. The title of baron, count, or 
regent of the <I>Gypsies </I>was no proof that the official so designated was of 
Gypsy race. This fact must always be borne in mind in any consideration of the 
Gypsy system.</P>
<P>The rulers thus appointed. being empowered by Christian princes, and under 
Papal approval, were necessarily Christian. Moreover, their vassals were at 
least Christian by profession. Although their behaviour was often wildly 
inconsistent with such a profession, it was in the character of Christian 
pilgrims that they asked and obtained hospitality from the cities and towns of 
Medieval Europe. On the other hand, they seem to have practised rites which 
could not be described as Christian. This twofold character is illustrated in 
connection with the services which they still hold in the crypt of the church of 
Les Saintes Maries de la Mer, in the Ile de la Camargue, Bouche-du-Rhone. In 
this church the Festival of the Holy Marys is annually celebrated on <B>25</B>th 
May, and to it the <I>Gypsies </I>come in great numbers. The crypt is specially 
reserved for them, because it contains the shrine of Saint Sara of Egypt, whom 
they regard as their patron saint. Throughout the night of 
<B>24</B>th-<B>25</B>th May they keep watch over her shrine, and on the 
<B>25</B>th they take their departure. Among the Gypsy votive offerings 
presented in the crypt, some are believed to date back to about the <B>1450</B>. 
All this would appear to indicate that the <I>Gypsies </I>were Christians. 
Another statement, however, tends to<I> </I>qualify such a conclusion. This is 
the assertion that the shrine of Saint Sara rests upon an ancient altar 
dedicated to Mithra; that the <I>Gypsies </I>of that neighbourhood who are known 
as &quot;Calagues,&quot; are descended from the Iberians formerly inhabiting the 
Camargue and that their cult is really the Mithraic worship of fire and water, 
upon which the veneration of Saint Sara is super-imposed.</P>
<P>Confirmation of this view may be obtained from the worship of fire still 
existing among the <I>Gypsies </I>of Southern Hungary. The ceremonies observed 
at child-birth, in order to avert evil during the period between birth and 
baptism, may be taken as evidence. Prior to the birth of the child, the 
<I>Gypsies </I>light a fire before the mother's tent, and this fire is not 
suffered to go out until the rite of baptism has been performed. The women who 
light and feed the fire croon, as they do so, the following chant:-</P>
<P>&quot;Burn ye, burn ye fast, O Fire!</P>
<P>And guard the babe from wrathful ire</P>
<P>Of earthy Gnome and Water-Sprite,</P>
<P>Whom with thy dark smoke banish quite I</P>
<P>Kindly Fairies, hither fare,</P>
<P>And let the babe good fortune share,</P>
<P>Let luck attend him ever here,</P>
<P>Throughout his life be luck aye near!</P>
<P>Twigs and branches flow in store, </P>
<P>And still of branches many more,</P>
<P>Give we to thy flame, O Fire !</P>
<P>Burn ye, burn ye, fast and high,</P>
<P>Hear the little baby cry !&quot;</P>
<P>It will be noted that the spirits of the Earth and Water are here regarded as 
malevolent, and only to be overcome by the superior aid of fire. Nevertheless, 
those women who are believed to have learned their occult lore from the unseen 
powers of Earth and Water are held to be the greatest magicians of the tribe. 
Moreover, the water-being is not invariably regarded as inimical, but is 
some-times directly propititated. As when a mother, to charm away convulsive 
crying in her child, goes through the prescribed Ceremonial in all its details, 
of which the last is this appeal, as she Casts a red thread into the stream</P>
<P>&quot;Take this thread, O Water-Spirit, and take with it the Crying of my 
child ! If it gets well, I will bring thee apples and eggs!&quot; The 
water-spirit appears again in a friendly character when a man, in order to 
recover a stolen horse, takes his infant to a stream, and, bending over the 
water, asks the invisible genius to indicate, by means of the baby's hand, the 
direction in which the horse has been taken. In these two instances we have a 
clear survival of the worship of water and the watery powers. It may be 
questioned whether these rites ought to be ascribed to Mithraism in its later 
stages, or whether they own an earlier origin.</P>
<P>One definite Statement with regard to Gypsy lore is afforded by Joseph 
Glanvil, in a passage which inspired Matthew Arnold's poem of' &quot;The 
Scholar-Gypsy.&quot; &quot;There was lately a lad in the University of 
Oxford,&quot; says Glanvil <I>(Vanity of Dogmatising, </I><B>1661</B>),&quot;who 
was, by his poverty, forced to leave his studies there, and at last to join 
himself to a company of vagabond <I>Gypsies.&quot; </I>Glanvil goes on to say 
that&quot; after he had been a pretty while exercised in the trade,&quot; this 
scholar-gypsy chanced to meet two of his former fellow-students, to whom he 
stated :-&quot; that the people he went with were not such impostors as they 
were taken for, but that they had a traditional kind of learning among them, and 
could do wonders by the powers of imagination, their fancy binding that of 
others ; that himself had learned much of their art, and when he bad compassed 
the whole secret, he intended,&quot; he said, &quot; to leave their company, and 
give the world an account of what he had learned.&quot;</P>
<P>Here we have clear indications of the possession of a body of esoteric 
learning, which included the knowledge and exercise of hypnotism. Even among 
modern <I>Gypsies </I>this power is exercised. De Rochas states that the Catalan 
<I>Gypsies </I>are mesmerists and clairvoyants, and the present writer has 
experienced an attempt on the part of a South Hungarian Gypsy to exert this 
influence. The same power, under the name <I>of glamour, </I>was formerly an 
attribute of the Scottish <I>Gypsies. </I>Glamour is defined by Sir Walter Scott 
as &quot; the power of imposing on the eyesight of the Spectators, so that the 
appearance of an object shall be totally different from the reality.&quot; And, 
in explanation of a reference to &quot;the <I>Gypsies' glamour'd gang,</I>&quot; 
in one of his ballads, he remarks : Besides the prophetic powers ascribed to the 
<I>Gypsies </I>in most European countries, the Scottish peasants believe them 
possessed of the power of throwing upon bystanders a spell to fascinate their 
eyes and cause them to see the thing that is not. Thus in the old ballad of' 
Johnnie Faa,' the elopement of the Countess of Cassillis with a Gypsy leader is 
imputed to fascination:-</P>
<P>&quot;Sae Soon as they saw her weel-faur'd face,</P>
<P>They cast the <I>glamour </I>o'er her.&quot;</P>
<P>Scott also relates an incident of a Gypsy who exercised his glamour over a 
number of people at Haddington, to whom he exhibited a common dung-hill cock, 
trailing, what appeared to the spectators, a massy oaken trunk. An old man 
passed with a cart of clover, he stopped and picked out a four-leaved blade ; 
the eyes of the spectators were opened, and the oaken trunk appeared to be a 
bulrush.&quot; The quatrefoil, owing to its cruciform shape. acted as a powerful 
antidote to witchcraft. Moreover, in the face of this Sign of the Cross, the 
Gypsy was bound to desist from the exercise of what was an unlawful art. As to 
the possibility of hypnotizing a crowd, or making them &quot;to see the thing 
that is not,&quot; that feat is achieved to-day by African witch-doctors. What 
is required is a dominant will on the one hand and a sufficiently plastic 
imagination on the other. </P>
<P>Scott introduces these statements among his notes on the ballad of &quot; 
Christie's Will,&quot; in relation to the verse:-</P>
<P>&quot;He thought the warlocks o' the rosy cross,</P>
<P>Had fang'd him in their nets sae fast;</P>
<P>Or that the <I>Gypsies' </I>glamour'd gang</P>
<P>Had lair'd his learning at the last&quot;</P>
<P>This association of Rosicrucians with <I>Gypsies </I>is not inapt, for 
hypnotism appears to have been considered a Rosicrucian art. Scott has other 
Suggestive references in this place. &quot; Saxo Grammaticus mentions a 
particular sect of Mathematicians, as he is pleased to call them, who, 'per 
Summam ludificandorum oculorum peritiam, proprios alienosque vultus, varus rerum 
imaginibus, adumbraie callebant; illicibusque formis veros obscurare 
conspectus.&quot; Merlin, the son of Ambrose, was particularly skilled in this 
art, and displays it often in the old metrical romance of Arthour and Merlin. 
The jongleurs were also great professors of this mystery, which has in some 
degree descended, with their name, on the modern jugglers.&quot; (See also 
Scott's note <B>2</B>M appended to <I>The Lay the Last Minstrel.)</I></P>
<P>It will be seen that various Societies are credited with the possession, in 
an eminent degree, of the art of hypnotism, during the Middle Ages. Presumably, 
it was inherited from one common source. How much the <I>Gypsies </I>were 
associated with this power may be inferred from a Scottish Act of Parliament of 
the year <B>1579</B>, which was directed against &quot; the idle people calling 
themselves Egyptians, or any other that fancy themselves to have knowledge of 
prophecy, <I>charming, </I>or other abused sciences.&quot; For the term 
charming,&quot; like &quot;glamour&quot; and other kindred words <I>(e.g 
&quot;</I>enchantment,&quot; &quot;bewitched,&quot; spellbound&quot;) bore 
reference to the mesmeric influence.</P>
<P>The statement made by Glanvil's scholar-gypsy would lead one to believe that 
the <I>Gypsies </I>inhabiting England in the seventeenth century possessed other 
branches of learning. They have always been famed for their alleged prophetic 
power, exercised through the medium of astrology and chiromancy or palmistry, 
and also by the interpretation of dreams; this last-named phase being distinctly 
specified in Scotland in <B>1611</B>+. It does not appear that any modern 
<I>Gypsies </I>profess a knowledge of astrology. Nevertheless, it is interesting 
to note that Groome# was shown by a Welsh Gypsy-man the form of the written 
charm employed by his mother in her fortune-telling, and that form is 
unquestionably a survival of the horoscope. Both mother and son were obviously 
unaware of that fact, and made no profession of astrology ; but they had 
inherited the scheme of the horoscope from ancestors who were astrologers.</P>
<P>The practice of chiromancy is still a Gypsy art, as it has been for ages. A 
curious belief was current in medieval times to the effect that the three Kings 
or Magi who came to Bethlehem were <I>Gypsies, </I>and in more than one 
religious play they are represented as telling the fortunes of the Holy Family 
by means of palmistry. This circumstance has evoked the following suggestive 
remarks from C. G. Leland.%</P>
<P>&quot;As for the connection of the Three Kings with <I>Gypsies, </I>it is 
plain enough. <I>Gypsies </I>were from the East Rome and the world abounded in 
wandering Chaldean magi-priests, and the researches which I am making have led 
me to a firm conclusion that the <I>Gypsy </I>lore of Hungary and South Slavonia 
has a very original character as being. firstly, though derived from India, not 
<I>Aryan, </I>but Shamanic, that is, of an Altaic, or Tartar, or' Turanian' 
stock. Secondly, this was the old Chaldean-Accadian ' wisdom' or sorcery. 
Thirdly-and this deserves serious examination-it was also the old Etruscan 
religion whose magic formulas were transmitted to the Romans </P>
<P>&quot;The Venetian witchcraft, as set forth by Bernoni, is evidently of 
Sclavic-Greek origin. That of the Romagna is Etruscan, agreeing very strangely 
and closely with the Chaldean magic of Lenormant, and marvellously like the 
<I>Gypsies'. </I>It does not, when carefully sifted, seem to be like that of the 
Aryans&hellip;nor is it Semitic. To what degree some idea of all this, and of 
<I>Gypsy </I>connection with it, penetrated among the people and filtered down, 
even into the Middle Ages, no one can say. But it is very probable that through 
the centuries there came together some report of the common origin of <I>Gypsy 
</I>and ' Eastern' or Chaldean lore, for, since it was the same, there is no 
reason why a knowledge of the truth should not have been disseminated in a time 
of a traditions and earnest study in occultism.&quot;</P>
<P>These surmises on the part of a keen and accomplished student of every phase 
of magic, written and unwritten, are deserving of the fullest consideration. By 
following the line indicated by Leland it may be possible to reach an 
identification of the ' traditional kind of learning&quot; possessed by the 
<I>Gypsies </I>in the seventeenth century. DAVID MACRITCHIE</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Gyromancy :</B> Was performed by going round continually in a circle, the 
circumference of which was marked by letters. The presage was drawn from the 
words formed by the letters on which the inquirers stumbled when they became too 
giddy to stand. The object of this circumcursation was simply to exclude the 
interference of the will, and reduce the selection of letters to mere chance. In 
some species of enchantment, however, the act of turning round was to produce a 
prophetic delirium. The religious dances, and the rotation of certain fanatics 
on one foot, with their arms stretched out, are of this nature. These cases 
really indicate a magical secret, of which, however, the deluded victims rarely 
possessed any knowledge. In the phenomenon known as St. Vitus's Dance, and the 
movements of the convulsionaries, manifestations of spiritual intelligence were 
quite common. The tendency of the spiritual force is to act spirally, 
rhythmically, whether in the use of language or of the bodily members.</P>
