<P>Jacinth, or Hyacinth :</B> A stone which preserves from plague and from 
lightning, strengthens the heart, and brings wealth, honour, prudence, and 
wisdom. It is recommended by Albertus Magnus as a soporific, on account of its 
coldness, and is ordered by Psellus in cases of coughs, ruptures, and 
melancholy, to be drunk in vinegar. Marbodaeus describes the wonderful 
properties of three species of the <I>jacinth </I>Pliny and Leonardus are also 
particular in their account of it.</P><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Jacob's Ladder :</B> According to the kabalistic view, <I>Jacob's Ladder. 
</I>which was disclosed to him in a vision, <B>is </B>a metaphorical 
representation of the powers of alchemy, operating through visible nature. The 
&quot;Ladder&quot; was a &quot; Rainbow,&quot; or prismatic staircase, set up 
between heaven and earth. Jacob's Dream implied a history of the whole hermetic 
creation. There are only two original colours, red an(l blue, representing 
&quot; spirit &quot; and &quot; matter,&quot; for orange is red mixing with the 
yellow light of the sun, yellow is the radiance of the sun itself, green is blue 
and yellow, indigo is blue tinctured with red, and violet is produced by the 
mingling of red and blue. The sun is alchemic gold, and the moon is alchemic 
silver. In the operation of these two potent spirits, or mystic rulers of the 
world, it is supposed astrologically that all mundane things were produced.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Jakin and Boas :</B> The names of the two symbolical pillars of Solomon's 
Kabalistic temple, and which were believed to explain all mysteries. The one was 
black and the other white, and they represented the powers of good and evil. It 
is said that they symbolise the need of &quot;two&quot; in the world: Human 
equilibrium requires two feet; the worlds gravitate by means of two forces; 
generation needs two sexes.</P>

<P>James IV. of Scotland :</B> It was almost inevitable that the romantic nature 
of <I>James IV. of Scotland </I>should have encouraged the study of alchemy and 
the occult sciences in the manner he did. Dunbar in his <I>Remonstrance, 
</I>speaks of the patronage which he bestowed upon alchemists and charlatans, 
and in the Treasurer's accounts there are numerous payments for the &quot; 
Quinta Essentia,&quot; including wages to the persons employed, utensils of 
various kinds and so forth. In a letter to one Master James Inglis, <I>James 
</I>says:-</P>
<P>&quot;<I>James, </I>etc&hellip;..to dear Master James Inglis greeting. We 
graciously accept your kindness, by which in a letter brought to us you signify 
that you have beside you certain books learned in the philosophy of the true 
Alchemy, and that although most worthy men have sought them from you. you have 
nevertheless with difficulty kept them for our use, because you had heard of our 
enthusiasm for the art. We give you thanks; . . . and we have sent our familiar, 
Master James Merchenistoun, to you, that he may see to the transfer hither of 
those books which you wish us to have; whom receive in good faith in our name. 
Farewell, From our Palace at Edinburgh.&quot;</P><I>

<P>Japan :</B> All that the word &quot;magic&quot; defines is to be found 
amongst the Japanese, in their religious beliefs and rites in their conception 
of Nature and in the national customs. To them all forms and objects animate or 
inanimate possess, equally with man, a soul with good or evil tendencies, and 
these entities, either of their own volition or by evocation, come into close 
touch with man either to his advantage or detriment. Their folklore and 
traditions are wrought of the marvellous and the Japanese thought of to-day is 
still permeated with a belief in the supernatural.</P>
<P>The predominant feature of the Japanese religion, Shintoism, is the worship 
of ancestors. allied to that of Nature. There are twelve recognised sects of 
Shintoism-all with ancestor-worship as their cardinal principle. The belief of 
the Japanese is that the disembodied spirits acquire the powers of deities and 
possess supernatural attributes. They become potential for good or evil and they 
exercise their potentialities in the same mundane sphere upon which their 
interests and affections centred during life. They thus become guardian 
divinities, and as such the object of ceremonies in their honour is to show 
gratitude for their services whilst upon earth and to solicit a continuance of 
these services beyond the grave. On this point Lafcadio Hearn wrote :-&quot;. An 
intimate sense of relation between the visible and invisible worlds. is the 
special religious characteristic of Japan among all civilised countries. To 
Japanese thought the dead are not less real than the living. They take part in 
the daily life of the people, sharing the humblest sorrows and the humblest 
joys. They attend the family repasts, watch over the well-being of the 
household, assist and rejoice in the prosperity of their descendants. They are 
present at the public pageants, at all the sacred festivals of Shinto, at the 
military games, and at all the entertainments especially provided for them. And 
they are universally thought of as finding pleasure in the offerings made to 
them or the honours conferred upon them.&quot; Every morning, before the family 
shrine, to be found in all Japanese homes, flowers are set and food-emblems 
placed as offerings of pious affection, while ancient prayers are repeated, for 
on the shrine, beside the symbols of the Sun-goddess and the tutelary god of the 
family are put the memorial tablets containing names, ages and dates of death of 
members of the household. There are stories of the souls of ancestors taking 
material form and remaining visible through centuries. In the month of July 
three days are set apart for the celebration of the <I>Festival of the Dead. 
</I>At this time it is thought that the disembodied souls return from the dismal 
region of the Shades to gaze for a while upon the beauty of their country and to 
visit their people. On the first morning new mats are placed upon all altars and 
on every household shrine, while in all the homes tiny meals are prepared in 
readiness for the ghostly guests. The streets at night are brilliant with many 
torches; in front of every house gaily-coloured lanterns are lit in welcome.</P>
<P>Those who have recently lost some relative go to the cemeteries to pray and 
burn incense and leave offerings of water and flowers set in bamboo vases. On 
the third day the souls of those who are undergoing penance are fed, also those 
who have no friends 'among the living to care for them. The evening of this day 
is the time of the ghosts' departure, and for this thousands of little boats are 
fashioned and laden with food-offerings and tender messages of farewell. When 
the night falls, tiny lanterns are lit and hung at the miniature prows and the 
ghosts are supposed to step aboard. Then the craft are set free upon river, lake 
and sea, the water gleaming with glow of thousands of lights. On this day no 
sailor dreams of putting out to sea-for this one night it belongs to the dead. 
It is believed that if a ship fails to come to port before the sailing of the 
ghost-fleet the dead arise from the deep and the sailors can hear their mournful 
whispering, while the white breakers are their hands clutching the shores, 
vainly trying to return.</P>
<P>In the Shinto pantheon there are deities representing well nigh everything in 
heaven and earth; from the mountain of Fiyiama to the household kitchen, from 
Wisdom to Scarecrows, from Caligraphy to Poverty, Laughter to Small pox. When 
babes are a week old they are taken to the temple and placed under the 
protection of some god chosen by the parents, but in later years he may choose 
his patron god for himself beside the tutelary one.</P>
<P>In remote parts of <I>Japan </I>may still be found traces of an older form of 
Shinto in which phallic symbols had their place as representing life-giving 
power and therefore used as a magical exorcism of evil influences, especially 
that of disease. In this connection appears a dwarf-god who is said to have 
first taught mankind the art of magic and medicine In Shinto there are no idols, 
their place being taken by <I>shintia, </I>god-bodies, concrete objects in which 
the divine spirit is supposed to dwell, such as the mirror, jewel and sword of 
the Sun-goddess, worshipped at the famous Ise shrine. Pilgrims from all parts of 
<I>Japan </I>make their way to this shrine, acquiring merit and purification 
thereby. These pilgrims receive from the priests objects of talismanic 
properties called <I>harai, </I>these also serving as evidence of having been at 
the holy place. In former days they were recognised as passports. The term 
<I>harai </I>signifies to &quot; drive out,&quot; to &quot; sweep away,&quot; 
and has reference to the purification of the individual from his sins. These 
objects are in the form of small envelopes or paper boxes each containing 
shavings of the wands used by the Ise priests at the half-yearly festivals held 
to purify the nation in general from the consequences of the sins of the 
preceding six months. The list includes witchcraft, also wounding and homicide, 
these latter being regarded more as uncleanness than as a moral stigma. On the 
pilgrims return home the <I>harai </I>are placed upon the 
&quot;god's-shelf.&quot;</P>
<P>On fete-days are still practised the ancient <I>ordeals. </I>These are three 
in number, the <I>Kugadachi, </I>in which priests, wrought to ecstatic frenzy by 
participation in a rhythmic dance, pour upon their bodies boiling water without 
receiving harm from the process; the <I>Hiwatari </I>consisting of walking 
barefoot over a bed of live coals, priests and people alike participating, and 
<I>Tsurugi-watari, </I>the climbing of a ladder of sword-blades. These are 
regarded as tests of purity of character, this being thought to confer an 
immunity from hurt in these ordeals. The attendant rites consist of exorcism of 
evil spirits by the waving of wands and magical finger-knots, and invocation of 
the gods who are then believed to be actually present.</P><I>
<P>Possession by Divinities </I>-In connection with some of the Shinto sects 
occult rites are practised to bring about possession of a selected person by the 
actual spirits of the gods. Priests and laymen alike develop and practice this 
art, undergoing a period of purification by means of various austerities. 
Prophecy, divination and the cure of disease are the objects of these rites. The 
ceremony may take place in a temple or ordinary house where the &quot; gods' 
shelf&quot; makes the shrine. In the rites <I>gohei, </I>the Shinto symbols of 
consecration are used, the pendant form for purification and exorcism of evil 
influences, and an upright <I>gohei </I>affixed to a wand signifying the 
<I>shintai, </I>or god-body, is the central object. The medium, called <I>maeza 
</I>takes his Seat in the midst. Next him in importance is the functionary, the 
<I>maeza </I>who presides over the ceremony. It is he who builds the magical 
pyre in a brass bowl and burns in the flames strips of paper inscribed with 
characters, effigies of disease and trouble. There is a clapping of hands to 
call the attention of the gods and chants are intoned, accompanied by the 
shaking of metal-ringed crosiers and the tinkle of pilgrim bells. After the fire 
is burnt out, the bowl is removed and sheets of paper placed in symbolic form, 
upon which is then put the upright gohei wand. There is further chanting, the 
medium closes his eyes and clasps his hands into which the <I>maeza </I>now 
thrusts the wand. All then await the advent of the god which is indicated by the 
violent shaking of the wand and convulsive throes on the part of the medium, who 
is now considered to have become the god. The <I>maeza </I>reverently prostrates 
himself before the entranced <I>nahaza, </I>and asks the name of the god who has 
deigned to come. This done and answered, he next offers his petitions, to which 
the god replies. The ceremony is concluded by a prayer and the medium is 
awakened by beating upon his back and the massaging of his limbs out of their 
cataleptic contraction. These possession-rites are 'also conducted by the 
pilgrims who ascend the mountain of Ontake.</P><I>
<P>Buddhism, </I>which shares with Shinto the devotions of <I>Japan, </I>enjoins 
meditation as a means of attaining to supernatural knowledge and occult power. 
It is said that to those who in truth and constancy put in force the doctrines 
of Buddha the following ten powers will be granted. (<B>1</B>). They know the 
thoughts of others. <B>(2). </B>Their sight, piercing as that of the celestials, 
beholds without mist all that happens in the earth. (<B>3</B>). They know the 
past and present. (<B>4</B>). They perceive the uninterrupted succession of the 
ages of the world. (<B>5</B>). Their hearing is so fine that they perceive and 
can interpret all the harmonies of the three worlds and the ten divisions of the 
universe. (<B>6</B>). They are not subject to bodily conditions and can assume 
any appearance at will. (<B>7</B>). They distinguish the shadowing of lucky or 
unlucky words, whether they are near or far 'away. (<B>8</B>). They possess the 
knowledge of all forms, and knowing that form is void, they can assume every 
sort of form; and knowing that vacancy is form, they can annihilate and render 
nought all forms. (<B>9</B>). They possess a knowledge of all laws. (<B>10</B>). 
They possess the perfect science of contemplation. It is said that methods are 
thus known by which it is possible to so radically change the psychological 
condition of the individual that he is enabled to recognise the character of the 
opposition between subjective and objective. These two extremes are reconciled 
in a higher condition of consciousness, a higher form of life, a more profound 
and complete activity which concerns the inmost depths of the self. To the 
&quot; <I>Zen&quot; </I>monasteries, belonging to a Buddhist sect of that name, 
anyone who is so inclined may retire for temporary meditation and for the 
development of these special faculties, which are mainly produced by entering 
upon a calm mental state, not exactly passive, but in which the attention is not 
devoted to any one thing, but is evenly distributed in all directions, producing 
a sort of void and &quot;waiting.&quot; The spirit thus obtains entire repose 
and a satisfaction of the thirst for the ideal. This mystical retirement is 
sought by statesmen and generals, by scientific professional and business-men, 
and it is said that the force which accumulates within them by practising the 
<I>&quot;Zen&quot; </I>methods is of effective service to them in practical 
life.</P>
<P>Many of the customs of the Japanese have a magical significance. At the 
Festival of the New Year extending over three days it is considered of the first 
importance to insure good luck and happiness for the coming year by means of 
many traditional observances. Houses are thoroughly cleansed materially and 
spiritually, this last is getting rid of the evil spirits by throwing out beans 
and peas from the open slides of the houses. The gateways are decorated with 
straw ropes made to represent the lucky, Chinese numbers of three, five and 
seven. Mirror cakes, associated with the sun-goddess are eaten, 'also lobsters, 
longevity being symbolised by their bent and ancient, appearance, the pine-tree 
branches used for decoration at this time 'also signifying long life.</P><I>
<P>Divination </I>is performed by various methods: by divining rods, by the 
reading of lines and cracks in the shoulder-blade of a deer, and by the 
classical form taken from the Confucian <I>&quot; Yih-king &quot; </I>or <I>Book 
of Changes, </I>this involving the use of eight diagrams and sixty-four 
diagrams. One method of&quot; raising spirits&quot; used by the Japanese, 
especially by girls who have lost their lovers by death, is to put into a paper 
lantern a hundred rushlights and repeat an incantation of a hundred lines. One 
of these rushlights is taken out 'at the end of each line and the would-be 
ghost-seer then goes out in the dark with one light still burning and blows it 
out when the ghost ought to appear.</P><I>
<P>Charms </I>are everywhere, fashioned of all substances 'and in all forms, 
such as strips of paper bearing magical inscriptions to avert evil, fragments of 
temples, carven rice-grains representing the gods of Luck, <I>sutras </I>to 
frighten the demons, copies of Buddha's footprint, and paper tickets bearing the 
name of a god are often 'affixed outside the doors of houses to combat the god 
of Poverty.</P><I>
<P>Nature </I>and her manifestations are the result of indwelling soul-life and 
the Japanese mind, imbued with this belief has peopled nature with multiform 
shapes. There are dragons with lairs in ocean and river which yet can fly abroad 
in the air while from their panting breath come the clouds of rain and tempests 
of lightning. In the mountains and forests are bird-like gnomes who often beset 
way-faring men and women and steal away their wits. There are 'also mountain 
men, huge hairy monkeys, who help the wood-cutters in return for food, and 
mountain-women, ogres with bodies grown over with long white hair, who flit like 
evil moths in search of human flesh. Then legend tells of the <I>Senrim, 
</I>hermits of the mountains, who knew all the secrets of magic, wizards who 
were attended by wise toads and flying tortoises, who could conjure magical 
animals out of gourds, who could project their souls into space. To animals were 
also ascribed supernatural powers. The fox is believed to possess such gifts to 
an almost limitless extent, for he has miraculous vision and hearing, he can 
read the inmost thoughts of man, he can transform himself and assume any shape 
'at will. He loves to delude mankind and work destruction thereby to this end 
often taking the form of 'a beautiful and seductive woman whose embrace means 
madness and death. To the 'agency of this animal is attributed demoniacal 
possession, thu, occurring mostly among ignorant and superstitious women of the 
lower classes. The cat is not regarded with 'any kindly feeling by the Japanese, 
this being ascribed to the fact that this animal, together with the serpent, 
were the only creatures who did not weep at Buddha's death. This animal has also 
the power of bewitchment and possesses vampire proclivities. Among sailors, 
however, the cat is held in estimation, for it is thought to possess the power 
of warding off the evil spirits which haunt the sea. The images of animals are 
thought to be also endowed with life. There are tales of bronze horses and deer, 
of huge carven dragons and stone tortoises wandering abroad at night, 
terrorising the people and only laid to rest by summary decapitation. 
Butterflies are thought to be the wandering souls of the living who may be 
dreaming or sunk in reverie; white butterflies are the souls of the dead. 
Fireflies keep afar evil spirits, and an ointment compounded of their delicate 
bodies defies any poison.</P><I>
<P>Trees </I>occupy a foremost place in the tradition and legends of <I>Japan. 
</I>The people regard them with great affection, and there are stories of men 
who, seeing a tree they loved withering and dying, committed <I>hara-kiri. 
</I>before it praying the gods that their life so given might pass into the tree 
and give it renewed vigour. The willow is one of the most eerie of trees, the 
willow-spirit often becoming a beautiful maiden and wedding a human lover The 
pine tree brings good fortune, especially in the matte of happy marriages. It is 
also a token of longevity. Tree spirits can sometimes be inimical to man and it 
is recorded of one that to stay its disturbing wanderings it was necessary to 
cut it down, when from the stump flowed a stream of blood.</P>
<P>The element of <I>Fire </I>figures largely in the Japanese world of marvels. 
It is worshipped in connection with the rites of the Sun-goddess and even the 
kitchen-furnace becomes the object of a sort of cult. There is the lamp of 
Buddha while messages from Hades come to this world in the shape of fire-wheels, 
Phantom-fires flicker about and flames burn in the cemeteries; there are 
demon-lights fox-flames and dragon-torches. From the eyes and mouth of. certain 
birds, such as the blue heron, fire darts forth il white flames. Globes of fire, 
enshrining human faces and forms, sometimes hang like fruit in the branches of 
the trees. The <I>dolls </I>of Japanese children are believed to hi endowed with 
life, deriving a soul from the love expended upon them by their human 
possessors. Some of these doll were credited with supernatural powers, they 
could confer maternity upon a childless woman, and they could brin<SUB>g</SUB> 
misfortune upon any who ill-treated them. When old an faded, these dolls are 
dedicated to Kojin the many-armed who dwells in the <I>enokie </I>tree, and 
there are reverently laid upon his shrine, bodies which once held a tiny soul.

his soul made toilsom journeys. In the first he was tormented for having kept 
innocent prisoners in his dungeons, in the second, he was tortured still more 
for having ground the people under heavy tasks; during the third voyage he died, 
but his body disappeared mysteriously before he could be buried, and i was 
thought that the devil had taken him.</P>
<P></P><B>
<P>Jean d'Arras :</B> A French writer of the fourteenth century, who compiled a 
chronicle of <I>Melusine </I>from popular stories which he collected.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Jean de Meung :</B> <I>Jean </I>de <I>Meung </I>owes his celebrity to his 
poetical genius rather than his alchemical powers; to his <I>Roman </I>de <I>'a 
Rose, </I>rather than to his rhyming treatise upon the hermetic philosophy. He 
was born about <B>1280, </B>and flourished through the reigns of Louis X., 
Philip the Long, Charles IV., and Philip de Valois. He appears to have possessed 
a light and railing wit, and a keen appreciation of a jest; and it may well be 
doubted whether he was altogether sincere in his praises of alchemy. Having 
composed a quatrain on woman, which stigmatized her in the strongest terms, the 
ladies of Charles VI.'s court resolved to revenge their affronted honour, and 
surrounding him in the royal antechamber, desired the courtiers present to strip 
him preparatory to their inflicting a sound flagellation. <I>Jean </I>solicited 
to be heard before he was condemned and punished; and having obtained an 
interval of grace, set forth, with fluent eloquence, that he was certainly the 
author of the calumnious verses, but that they were not intended to vilipend all 
womankind. He referred only to the vicious and debased, and not to such models 
of purity as he saw around him. Nevertheless, if any lady present felt that the 
verses really applied to her, he was her very humble servant, and would submit 
to a well-deserved chastisement. Like most of the medieval poets, <I>Jean de 
Meung </I>was a bitter enemy of the priesthood, and he contrived with great 
ingenuity a posthumous satire upon their inordinate greed. He bequeathed in his 
will, as a gift to the Cordeliers, a chest of immense weight. As his fame as an 
alchemist was wide-spread, the brotherhood accepted the legacy in the belief 
that the chest contained the golden results of his quest of the Philosopher's 
Stone. But when they opened it. their dismayed eyes rested only on a pile of 
<I>slates, </I>covered with the most unintelligible hieroglyphics and cabalistic 
characters. The perpetrator of this practical joke was hardly, we think, a very 
sincere believer in the wonders of alchemy. <I>(See </I>Devon, Witchcraft 
In.)</P>
<P></P><B>
<P>Jeanne, D'Arc :</B> <I>Jeanne d'Arc </I>was born in the village of Domremy, 
near Vaucouleurs, on the border of Champagne and Lorraine, on Jan. <B>6</B>th, 
<B>1412. </B>She was taught to spin and sew, but not to read or write, these 
accomplishments being unusual and unnecessary to people in her station of life. 
Her parents were devout, and she was brought up piously. Her nature was gentle, 
modest, and religious but with no physical weakness or morbidity; on the 
contrary. she was exceptionally strong, as her later history shows.</P>
<P>At or about the age of thirteen, <I>Jeanne </I>began to experience what 
psychology now calls &quot;auditory hallucinations.&quot; In other words, she 
heard &quot;voices &quot;-usually accompanied by a bright light-when no visible 
person was present. This, of course, is a common symptom of impending mental 
disorder; but no insanity developed in <I>Jeanne d'Arc. </I>Startled she 
naturally was at first, but continuation led to familiarity and trust. The 
voices gave good counsel of a very commonplace kind. as, for instance, that she 
&quot;must be a good girl and go often to church.&quot; Soon, however, she began 
to have visions; saw St. Michael, St. Catharine, and St. Margaret; was given 
instructions as to her mission; eventually made her way to the Dauphin. put 
herself at the head of <B>6</B>,<B>000</B> men, and advanced to the relief of 
Orleans, which was surrounded by the victorious English. After a fortnight of 
hard fighting, the siege was raised, and the enemy driven off. The tide of war 
had turned, and in three months the Dauphin was crowned king at Rheims as 
Charles the Seventh.</P>
<P>At this point, <I>Jeanne </I>felt that her mission was accomplished. But her 
wish to return to her family was over-ruled by king and archbishop, 'and she 
took part in the further fighting against the allied English and Burgundian 
forces, showing great bravery 'and tactical skill. But in November, <B>1430, 
</B>in a desperate sally from Compiegne - which was besieged by the Duke of 
Burgundy- she fell into the enemy's hands, was sold to the English, and thrown 
into 'a dungeon 'at their headquarters in Rouen.</P>
<P>After a year's imprisonment she was brought to trial before the Bishop of 
Beauvais, in 'an ecclesiastical court. The charges were heresy 'and sorcery. 
Learned doctors of the Church, subtle lawyers, did their best to entangle the 
simple girl in their dialectical toils but she showed 'a remarkable power of 
keeping to her 'affirmations 'and of avoiding heretical statements. &quot; God 
has 'always been my Lord in all that I have done,&quot; she said. But the trial 
was only pretence, for her fate was 'already decided. She was condemned to the 
stake. To the end, she solemnly 'affirmed the reality of her &quot;voices,&quot; 
and the truth of her depositions. Her last word, 'as the smoke 'and flame rolled 
round her, was &quot;Jesus.&quot; Said an English soldier, 'awestruck by the 
manner of her passing: &quot; We 'are lost; we have burned 'a Saint.&quot; The 
idea was corroborated in popular opinion by events which followed, for speedy 
death-as if by Heaven's 'anger-overtook her judges 'and 'accusers. Inspired by 
her example and claims, 'and helped by dissension and weakening on the side of 
the enemy, the French took heart once more; 'and the English were 'all-but swept 
out of the country.</P><I>
<P>Jeanne's </I>family was rewarded by ennoblement, under the name of D Lys. 
Twenty-five years 'after her death, the Pope acceded to a petition that the 
<I>process </I>by which she was condemned should be re-examined. The result was 
that the judgment was reversed, and her innocence established and 
proclaimed.</P>
<P>The life of the Maid supplies 'a problem which orthodox science cannot solve. 
She was 'a simple peasant girl, with no 'ambitious hankering after a career. She 
rebelled pathetically 'against her mission. &quot; I had far rather rest 'and 
spin by my mother's side, for this is no work of my choosing, but I must go 'and 
do it, for my Lord wills it.,, She cannot be dismissed on the &quot;simple 
idiot&quot; theory of Voltaire, for her genius in war 'and her aptitude-in 
repartee undoubtedly prove exceptional mental powers, unschooled though she was 
in what we call education. We cannot call her a mere hysteric, for her health 
and strength were superb. It is on record that 'a man of science said to 'an 
Abbe &quot;Come to the Salpetriere Hospital, 'and I will show you twenty Jeannes 
d'Arc.&quot; To which the Abbe -responded: &quot;Has one of them given us back 
Alsace 'and Lorraine ?&quot; The retort was certainly neat. Still, though the 
Salpetriere hysterics have not won back Alsace 'and Lorraine, it is nevertheless 
true that many great movements have sprung from fraud or hallucination. May it 
not have been so with <I>Jeanne? </I>She delivered France, 'and her importance 
in history is great; but may not her mission 'and her doings have been the 
outcome of merely subjective hallucinations, induced by the brooding of her 
specially religious 'and patriotic mind on the woes of her country ? The army, 
being ignorant 'and superstitious, would readily believe in the Supernatural 
nature of her mission, 'and great energy and valour would result-for a man 
fights well when he feels that Providence is on his side.</P>
<P>This is the most usual kind of theory in explanation of the facts. But it is 
not fully satisfactory. How came it-one may ask-that this untutored peasant girl 
could persuade not only the rude soldiery, but also the Dauphin and the Court, 
of her Divine appointment? How came -she to be given the command of an army? 
Surely a post of such responsibility and power would not be given to an Ignorant 
girl of eighteen, on the mere strength of her own claim to inspiration. It 
seems, at least, very improbable.</P>
<P>Now it so happens (though the materialistic school of historians conveniently 
ignore or belittle it) that there is strong evidence in support of the idea that 
<I>Jeanne </I>gave the Dauphin some proof of the possession of supernormal 
faculties. In fact, the evidence is so strong that Mr. Andrew Lang called it 
&quot;unimpeachable &quot;-and Mr. Lang did not usually err on the side of 
credulity in these matters. Among other curious things, <I>Jeanne </I>seems to 
have repeated to Charles the words of 'a prayer which he had made 
<I>mentally;</I> and she also made some kind of clairvoyant discovery of a sword 
hidden behind the altar of Fierbois church. Schiller's magnificent dramatic 
poem-&quot; Die Jungfrau von Orleans &quot;-though unhistorical in some details, 
is substantially 'accurate on these points concerning clairvoyance and 
mind-reading.</P>
<P>The best books on the Maid are those of Mr. Anatole France (two vols.), 'and 
Mr. Andrew Lang, giving respectively the sceptical and the believing side as to 
the explanation of her experiences. There is also a very useful little book by 
Miss C. M. Antony, with preface by Father <I>R. </I>H. Benson.</P>

<P>Jelaleddin, Ruml : </B>A Sufi poet of the thirteenth century, A.D. He teaches 
the Suit doctrine that the chief end of man is so to emancipate himself from 
human thoughts and wishes, human needs and the outward impressions of the 
senses, that he may become a mere mirror for the Deity. So refined an essence 
does his mind become that it is 'as nearly as possible nothing ; yet while in 
this state it can, by a union with the Divine Essence, mysteriously become the 
All. In his teachings he declares that names and words must-not be taken for the 
things they represent:-&quot;Names thou mayst know; go, seek the truth they name 
Search not the brook, but heaven, for the moon.&quot;</P>

toothache, and tempered with wax cureth the swelling glandules named the king's 
evil. They say that the magicians use this jeat stone much in their sorceries, 
which they practice by the means of red hot axes, which they call axinomancia,

<P>Jinn :</B> Singular Jinnee, plural Jineeyeh, Arabian spirits, perhaps 
animistic, but more probably strictly mythological like the Persian divs (q.v.). 
The <I>jinn </I>were created out of fire, and occupied the earth for several 
thousand years before Adam; they were perverse, and would not reform, 'although 
prophets were sent to reclaim them; they were eventually driven from the earth, 
'and took refuge in the outlying islands of the sea. One of the number named 
Azazeel (afterwards called Iblees) had been carried off 'as a prisoner by the 
'angels; he grew up 'amongst them, 'and became their chief, but having refused, 
when commanded, to prostrate himself before Adam, he was degraded to the 
condition of a sheytan, and becomes the father of the sheytans, or devils. The 
<I>jinn </I>are not immortal, but destined ultimately to die: they eat and drink 
and propagate their species ; they live in communities, and are ruled over by 
princes: they can make themselves visible or invisible, and assume the forms of 
various animals, such as serpents, cats and dogs. There are good <I>jinn </I>and 
bad <I>jinns. </I>They frequent baths, wells, latrines, ovens, ruined houses, 
rivers, cross roads 'and market places. Finally, like the demons of the Rabbins, 
they ascend to heaven and learn the future by eavesdropping. But with all their 
power and knowledge, they are liable to be reduced to obedience by means of 
talismans or magic arts, and become obsequious servants until the spell is 
broken.</P>
<P>It is far from clear or certain, that the <I>jinn </I>of the east were 
borrowed from the mythology or philosophy of the west, and the practice of 
translating the Arabic word <I>jinn </I>by the Latin term </P>
<P>&quot;genius&quot; arose more from an apparent resemblance in the names, than 
from 'any identity in the nature and functions of those imaginary beings. This 
similarity of name, however, must have been purely accidental, for the Arabs 
knew little or nothing of the Latin language, and not a single term derived 
immediately from it; demon, therefore, and not genius was the word which they 
would have used if they had borrowed this part of their creed from the west. 
<I>Jinn </I>appears, moreover, to be a genuine Arabic word, derived from 'a root 
signifying &quot;to veil &quot; or conceal &quot; ; it, therefore, means 
properly, that which is veiled 'and cannot be seen.&quot; &quot; In one sense,' 
says Fruzabadi, author of the <I>Camus, </I>&quot;the word <I>Jinn </I>signifies 
'any 'spiritual being concealed from 'all our senses, 'and, for that reason, the 
converse of a material being. Taken in this extensive sense, the word <I>Jinn 
</I>comprehends devils as well 'as 'angels, but there are some properties common 
to both angels and <I>Jinn; </I>some peculiar to each. Every angel is a <I>Jinn, 
</I>but every <I>Jinn </I>is not an angel. In another sense, this term is 
applied peculiarly to a particular kind of spiritual beings ; for such beings 
are of three kinds; the good, which are angels; the bad, devils; and the 
intermediate, comprehending both good 'and bad, who form the class of 
<I>Jinn.&quot; </I>Thus the Arabs acknowledge good 'and bad genii, in that 
respect agreeing with the Greeks, but differing from the Persians. The genii, so 
long familiarized to European readers by the Arabian Nights, were not the same 
beings, mentioned by the Arabian lexicographer, but the Divs and Divatis of 
Indian romance, dressed up in a foreign 'attire, to please the taste of readers 
in Persia and Arabia.</P>
<P>The principal differences, therefore, between the genii of the west and the 
<I>jinn </I>of the east, seem to have been these; the genii were deities of an 
inferior rank, the constant companions and guardians of men, capable of giving 
useful or prophetic impulses, acting as a species of mediators 'and messengers 
between the gods and men. Some were supposed to be friendly, others hostile, 
'and many believed one of each kind to be 'attached, from his birth, to every 
mortal. The former was called Agathod'a<B>1</B>mon, the latter Cacodaemon; 'and 
one of the latter who appeared to Cassius is represented 'as a man of vast 
stature and of a black hue, whence, no doubt, that colour has been given, in 
latter times, to the devil. The good genius prompted men to good, the evil to 
bad 'actions. That of each individual was as a shadow of himself. Often he was 
represented 'as a serpent; his age 'also varied; he was generally crowned with a 
chaplet of plane leaves. In coins of Trajan and Hadrian the genius places a 
<I>patera </I>with his right hand on 'an 'altar, 'and holds 'a sort of scourge 
in his left. His sacrifices were wholly bloodless, consisting of wine and 
flowers, 'and the person who performed the oblation was the first to taste the 
cup. They were adored with prostrations, particularly on the birthday, which was 
placed under their especial care.</P>
<P>The Roman men swore by their Genius, the women by their Juno. The genius of 
the reigning Prince was an oath of extraordinary solemnity. There were local as 
well 'as individual genii, concerning whom many particulars may be found in<B> 
</B>&quot; Vossius,&quot; <I>de Idol.</I></P>
<P>The <I>Jinn, </I>on the contrary, who seem to be the linear descendants of 
the Devate's and Rakshasas of the Hindu mythology, were never worshipped by the 
Arabs, nor considered as anything more than the 'agents of the Deity. Since the 
establishment of Mohammedanism, indeed, they have been described 'as invisible 
spirits, 'and their feats and deformities which figure in romance 'are as little 
believed by Asiatics, as the tales of &quot; Arthur's Round Table&quot; are by 
ourselves. Their existence as superhuman beings is maintained by the Mussulman 
doctors, but that has little connection with their character 'and functions as 
delineated by poets.</P>

<P>Johannites :</B> A mystic sect who follow the tenets of the late Father John 
of Cronstadt, where they publish an organ, and pursue their propaganda by means 
of itinerant pamphlet-sellers. They are said to 'abduct Jewish children, and 
because of this rumour they have on more than one occasion come under police 
supervision. They have several times unsuccessfully fixed the date of the Last 
Judgment. They declared in Father John's life-time that all the powers of heaven 
had descended into Cronstadt, 'and were personified in the entourage of Father 
John. They exhorted all believers to make confession to Father John, who alone 
could rescue sinners from the depths of hell. The orthodox clergy would not know 
the Lord, but Father John would gather together in. Cronstadt 
<B>244</B>,<B>000</B> of the blessed, and then &quot; leave the earth.&quot; 
Another affirmation of theirs is that all children who 'are new-born 'are &quot; 
little devils,&quot; who must be &quot;stamped out&quot; immediately 'after 
birth. The Johannites urged the people to sell 'all their possessions and send 
the proceeds to Father John, or entrust them to the keeping of the 
pamphlet-sellers. Evidence is forthcoming tending to show that Father John was 
unaware of the abuse of his name, and on one occasion, in reply to a telegram 
from Bishop Nikander, of Perm, he strongly repudiated any connection with 
certain Johannite propagandists in the Perm Government.</P>

<P>John XXII., Pope :</B> Jacques Duese, subsequently <I>Pope John XXII. </I>was 
born at Cahors in France towards the close of the <B>12th </B>century. The exact 
date of his 'advent is indeterminate, but it is reported that his parents were 
in affluent circumstances, and it has even been suggested that they belonged to 
the <I>noblesse. </I>Jacques was educated first at a Dominican priory in his 
native village, and afterwards at Montpellier; while subsequently he proceeded 
to Paris, where he studied both law 'and medicine. Leaving the Sorbonne, he was 
still 'at 'a loss to know what profession to follow; but, chancing to become 
intimate with one Bishop Louis, a son of Charles II., King of Naples, the young 
man decided to enter the church, being doubtless prompted to this step by the 
conviction that his new friend's influence would help him forward in the 
clerical career. Nor was the future pontiff disappointed herein, for in the year 
<B>1300</B>, at<B> </B>the instance of the Neapolitan sovereign, he was elevated 
to the episcopal see of Frejus, while in <B>1308 </B>he was 'appointed 
Chancellor of Naples. He soon showed himself 'a man of no mean 'ability in 
ecclesiastical affairs, and in <B>1310 </B>Pope Clement V. saw fit to summon him 
to Avignon, being anxious to consult him anent certain points; while in <B>1312 
</B>Jacques was made Bishop of Porto, and four years later he was elected to the 
pontifical crown 'and sceptre.</P>
<P>Thenceforth he lived always at Avignon, but his life was by no means 'a quiet 
or untroubled one. Early in his reign the throne of Germany became vacant, Louis 
of Bavaria 'and Frederick of Austria both contended for it, and Jacques gave 
great offence by supporting the claims of the latter; while at a later date he 
raised a storm by preaching a somewhat heterodox sermon, its purport being that 
the souls of those who have died in 'a state of grace go straight into Abraham's 
bosom, 'and do not enjoy the beatific vision of the Lord till after the 
Resurrection and the last judgment. This doctrine was hotly opposed by many 
clerics, notably Thomas of England, who had the courage to preach against it 
openly at Avignon; and so great was the disfavour which John incurred, in fact, 
that for several years after his death in <B>1334</B> he was widely regarded as 
Anti-Christ.</P><I>
<P>Jacques </I>has frequently been credited with avarice, and it is true that he 
made stupendous efforts to raise money, imposing numerous taxes unheard of 
before his <I>regime. </I>Indeed, he manifested considerable ingenuity in this 
relation, and so the tradition that he dabbled in hermetic philosophy is 
probably founded on hard fact. It must be conceded, on the one hand, that in the 
course of his reign he issued a stringent bull against alchemists; but then, 
this was directed rather against the charlatans of the craft than against those 
who were seeking the philosopher's stone with real earnestness, and with the aid 
of scientific knowledge. It is more than likely, moreover, that <I>Jacques 
</I>sent forth this mandate largely with a view to blinding those who had 
charged him with essaying the practice at issue himself; 'and, be that as it 
may, it is certain that he believed in magic and was interested in science. His 
credulity as regards the former is demonstrated by his bringing a charge of 
sorcery against Geraud, Bishop of Cahors; while his scientific predilections are 
evinced by the fact that he kept up a laboratory in the palace at Avignon, and 
was wont to spend much time therein. Doubtless some of this time was given to 
physiological and pathological studies, for various works of a medical nature 
are ascribed to <I>Jacques, </I>in particular a collection of prescriptions, a 
treatise on diseases of the eye, and another on the formation of the foetus. But 
it may well be supposed that the avaricious prelate's activities in his 
laboratory were 'also bestowed in some measure on alchemistic researches, 'and 
the theory is buttressed by his having been a friend of Arnold de Villanova; 
while more important still, among the writings attributed to <I>Jacques </I>is 
<I>L' Art Transmutatoire, </I>published at Lyons in <B>1557</B>. Besides, the 
pontiff left behind him on his death a vast sum of money 'and a mass of 
priceless jewels, and it was commonly asserted, among the 'alchemists of the 
day, that these and also two hundred huge ingots had all been manufactured by 
the deceased. The story of the unbounded wealth he had 'amassed in this way 
gradually blossomed and bore fruit, and one of <I>Jacques' </I>medieval 
biographers credits him with having concocted a quantity of gold equivalent to 
<B>660</B>,<B>000</B> pound sterling.</P>
