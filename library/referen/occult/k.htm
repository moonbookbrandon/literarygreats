<P>Ka :</B> The Egyptian conception of one of the seven parts of man; 'a 
spiritual double or astral body. Not only did mankind possess a <I>Ka, </I>but 
'animals and inanimate objects as well. Every mortal received a <I>Ka </I>at 
birth. When he died his <I>Ka </I>left him, but was supposed to hover near the 
body and occasionally to reanimate it. For this purpose statues were placed near 
the mummy in which the <I>Ka </I>might find a temporary shelter. The <I>Ka 
</I>was provided with food by the friends of the deceased who left provisions in 
the tomb for its use. <I>(See </I><STRONG>Egypt</STRONG><I> </I>and

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Kabala, The :</B> A Hebrew 'and Jewish system of theosophy. The word 
signifies &quot;doctrines received from tradition.&quot; In ancient Hebrew 
literature tile name was used to denote the entire body of religions writings, 
the Pentateuch excepted. It is only in the early middle ages that the system of 
theosophy known as Kabalism was designated by that name. We will first consider 
the <I>Kabala </I>as a literary production before proceeding to examine it in 
the light of a hand-book of Hebrew occultism. The main sources which went to the 
making of' the <I>Kabala </I>'are the <I>Sepher Yesirah </I>or Book of Creation, 
which is a combination of medieval mysticism 'and science. The date of origin of 
this work has been matter of great 'argument, but. it is perhaps safest to say 
that it seems to be earlier than the ninth century A.D. The <I>Bahir </I>or 
brilliant is first quoted by Nabmanides, 'and is usually 'attributed to his 
teacher, Ezra. It owes much to the <I>Sepher Yesirah, </I>'and to a great extent 
foreshadows the <I>Zohar, </I>which is 'a commentary on the <I>Pentateuch, 
</I>including eleven dissertations on that book,-the most important of which 
'are the <I>Book of Secrets, </I>the <I>Secret of Secrets, </I>the <I>Mysteries 
of the Pentateuch</I> and the <I>Hidden Interpretation. </I>It pretends to the 
'authorship of Simon ben Yohai in the second century, and it is alleged that he 
drew his sources from traditional dialogues between God and Adam in Paradise. It 
is further stated that it was discovered in a cavern in Galilee where it had 
been hidden for one thousand years. It has been proved almost beyond doubt, 
however, that it was written in the thirteenth century, and the capture of 
Jerusalem by the Crusaders is 'alluded to. It is 'also believed that Moses de 
Leon, who died in <B>35</B>, and who circulated and sold the <I>Zohar, </I>was 
himself its author. At the same time there is no doubt that it enshrines a large 
number of very 'ancient and important Hebrew traditions. The matter contained in 
the <I>Kabala </I>deals with the nature of God, the <I>sephiroth </I>or divine 
emanations, of 'angels 'and of man. God, known in the <I>Kabala </I>as <I>En 
Soph, </I>fills and contains the universe. As he is boundless, mind cannot 
conceive him, so in a certain mystical sense he is non-existent. The doctrine of 
the <I>sephiroth </I>is undoubtedly the most important to be met with in the 
pages of the <I>Kabala. </I>To justify his existence the Deity had to become 
active 'and creative, 'and this he achieved through the medium of the ten 
sephiroth or intelligences which emanated from him like rays proceeding from a 
luminary. The first <I>sephiroth </I>or emanation was the wish to become 
manifest, and this contained nine other intelligences or sephiroth, which 'again 
emanate one from the other-the second from the first, the third from the second, 
'and so forth. These are known as the Crown, Wisdom, Intelligence, Love, 
Justice, Beauty, Firmness, Splendour. Foundation 'and Kingdom. From the junction 
of pairs of <I>sephiroth, </I>other emanations were formed thus from Wisdom 'and 
Intelligence proceeded Love or Mercy and from Mercy 'and Justice, Beauty. The 
<I>sephiroth </I>are 'also symbolical of primordial man and the heavenly man, of 
which earthly man is the shadow. They form three triads which respectively 
represent intellectual, moral, and physical qualities: the first, Wisdom, 
Intelligence and Crown; the second Love, Justice 'and Beauty; the third 
Firmness, Splendour and Foundation. The whole is circled or bound by Kingdom, 
the ninth <I>sephiroth. </I>Each of these triads symbolises a portion of the 
human frame: the first the head; the second the arms; the third the legs. It 
must be understood that though those <I>sephiroth </I>are emanations from God 
they remain a portion, and simply represent different aspects of the One 
Being.</P>
<P>Kabalistic cosmology posits four different worlds, each of which forms a 
sephiric system of a decade of emanations, which were verified in the following 
manner: the world of emanations or the heavenly man, a direct emanation from the 
<I>En Soph. </I>From it is produced the world of creation, or the <I>Briatic 
</I>world of pure nature, but yet not so spiritual as the first. The angel 
Metatron inhabits it and constitutes the world of pure spirit. He governs the 
visible world and guides the revolutions of The planets. From this is formed the 
world of formation or the <I>Yetziratic </I>world, still less refined, which is 
the abode of angels. Finally from these emanates the world of action or matter, 
the dwelling of evil spirits, which contains ten hells, each becoming lower 
until the depths of diabolical degradation is reached. The prince of this region 
is Samael, the evil spirit, the serpent of Genesis, otherwise &quot; the 
Beast.&quot; But the universe was incomplete without the creation of man; the 
heavenly Adam, that is the tenth <I>sephiroth </I>created the earthly Adam, each 
member of whose body corresponds to a part of the visible universe. The human 
form, we are told, is shaped after the four letters which constitute the Jewish 
tetragrammation, <I>Jhava, </I>thus, the letters J h a v a . The souls of the 
whole human race pre-exist in the world of emanations, and are all destined to 
inhabit human bodies. Like the <I>sephiroth </I>from which it emanates, every 
soul has ten potentces, consisting of a trinity of triad - spirit, soul, cruder 
soul or <I>neptesh. </I>Each soul, before its entrance into the world consists 
of male and female united into one being, but when it descends to this earth, 
the two parts are separated and animate different bodies. The destiny of the 
soul upon earth is to develop the perfect germs implanted in it, which must 
ultimately return to <I>En Soph. </I>If it does not succeed in acquiring the 
experience for which it has been sent to earth, it must re-inhabit the body 
three time till it becomes duly purified. when all the souls in the world of the 
<I>sephiroth </I>shall have passed through this period of probation and returned 
to the bosom of En Soph, the jubilee will commence; even Satan will be restored 
to his angelic nature, and existence will be a Sabbath without end. The 
<I>Kabala </I>states that these esoteric doctrines are contained in the Hebrew 
scriptures, but cannot be perceived by the uninitiated; they are, however, 
plainly revealed to persons of spiritual mind.</P>
<P>Next considering the <I>Kabala </I>as occult literature, we find it stated 
that the philosophical doctrines developed in its pages are found to have been 
perpetuated by the secret method of oral tradition from the first ages of 
humanity. &quot;The <I>Kabala,&quot; </I>says Dr. Ginsburg, when explaining the 
story of its birth, &quot;was first taught by God Himself to a select company of 
angels, who formed a theosophic school in Paradise. After the Fall the angels 
most graciously communicated this heavenly doctrine to the disobedient child of 
earth, to furnish the protoplasts with the means of returning to their pristine 
nobility and felicity. From Adam it passed over to Noah, and then to Abraham, 
the friend of God, who emigrated with it to Egypt, where the patriarch allowed a 
portion of this mysterious doctrine to ooze out. It was in this way that the 
Egyptians obtained some knowledge of it, and the other Eastern nations could 
introduce it into their philosophical systems. Moses, who was learned in all the 
wisdom of Egypt, was first initiated into the <I>Kabala </I>in the land of his 
birth, but became most proficient in it during his wanderings in the wilderness, 
when he not only devoted to it the leisure hours of the whole forty years, but 
received lessons in it from one of the angels. By the aid of this mysterious 
science the lawgiver was enabled to solve the difficulties which arose during 
his management of the Israelites, in spite of the pilgrimages, wars, and 
frequent miseries of the nation. He covertly laid down the principles of this 
secret doctrine in the first four books of the Pentateuch, but withheld them 
from Deuteronomy. Moses also initiated the seventy Elders into the secrets of 
this doctrine, and they again transmitted them from hand to hand. Of all who 
formed the unbroken line of tradition, David and Solomon were the most deeply 
initiated into the <I>Kabala. </I>No one, however, dared to write it down till 
Schimeon ben Jochai, who lived at the time of the destruction of the second. 
After his death, his son, Rabbi Eleazar, and his secretary, Rabbi Abba, as well 
as his disciples, collated Rabbi Simon Ben Jochai's treatises, and out of these 
composed the celebrated work called Z H R, <I>Zohar, </I>Splendour, which is the 
grand storehouse of Kabalism.&quot;</P>
<P>The history of Kabalistic origins, however, is as has been shown almost 
wholly fabulous, and no evidence worthy of the name can he adduced in its 
support. The mysticism of the <I>Mishna </I>and the <I>Talmud </I>must be 
carefully distinguished from that of the Kabalistic writings, as they are 
undoubtedly of very considerable antiquity. But the Kabala has certain claims 
upon the modern student of mysticism. Its philosophical value is not depreciated 
by its modern origin, and it is regarded by many as an absolute guide to 
knowledge in all the most profound problems of existence. Its thesis is 
extensive and profound, but examination unfortunately proves it to be merely a 
series of dogmatic hypotheses, a body of positive doctrine based on a central 
assumption which is incapable of proof. This tradition, says Eliphas Levi, 
wholly reposes on the single dogma of magic, that the Visible is for us a 
proportional measure of the Invisible. In fact it proceeds by analogy from the 
known to the unknown. At the same time, it is a most interesting effort of the 
human mind.</P>
<P>Medieval magic was deeply indebted to Kabalistic combinations of the divine 
names for the terms of its rituals, and from it derived the belief in a resident 
virtue in sacred names and numbers. Certain definite rules are employed to 
discover the sublime source of power resident in the Jewish scriptures. Thus the 
words of several verses in the scriptures which are regarded as containing an 
occult sense, are placed over each other, and the letters are formed into new 
words by reading them vertically; or the words of the text are arranged in 
squares in such a manner as to be read vertically or otherwise. Words are joined 
together and re-divided, and the initial and final letters of certain words are 
formed into separate words. Again, every letter of the word is reduced to its 
numerical value, and the word is explained by another of the same quantity. 
Every letter of a word too is taken to be an initial of an abbreviation of it. 
The twenty-two letters of the alphabet are divided into two halves, one half is 
placed above the other, and the two letters which thus become associated are 
interchanged. This a becomes <I>l, b, m, </I>and so on. This cipher alphabet is 
called <I>albm </I>from the first interchanged pairs. The commutation of the 
twenty-two letters is effected by the last letter of the alphabet taking the 
place of the first, the last but one the place of the second and so forth. This 
cipher is called <I>atbah. </I>These permutations and combinations are much 
older than the <I>Kabala, </I>and obtained amongst Jewish occultists from time 
immemorial.</P>
<P>Lastly, it should be pointed out that the <I>Kabala </I>has been condemned 
nowhere more strongly than among the Jews themselves. Jewish orthodoxy has 
always been suspicious of it, and as Mr. A. E. Waite has well said: &quot;The 
best lesson we can learn from it is the necessity of scrupulously separating the 
experimental knowledge of the mystics from their bizarre fields of 
speculation.&quot;</P>

it is which causes earthquakes. It is made of a single emerald. The mountain, 
which is frequently spoken of in Eastern tales, is said to be the habitation of 
genii. To reach it one must pass through dark wildernesses, and it is essential 
that the traveller be guided by a supernatural being.</P>

identified with a personage whose &quot;breath lasted nine nights and days under 
water&quot; and who &quot;could exist nine nights and nine days without 
sleep.&quot; A wound from his sword could not be cured he could make himself as 
tall as the highest tree, and so great was the heat of his nature that, during 
rain, whatever he carried remained dry. Originally a deity, a rain-and-thunder 
god, he had apparently degenerated, through a series of mythological processes, 
into a mere hero.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Kardec, Allen :</B> The nom <I>de guerre </I>of Denizard Rivail, the French 
spiritualist whose doctrines were largely accepted on the Continent and 
especially in France. The chief tenet in spiritism was the doctrine of 
re-incarnation. Rivail, before his conversion to spiritualism, had occupied 
himself a great deal with animal magnetism. In <B>1856</B> he was introduced 
into a spiritualistic circle by Victorien Sardon. His <I>Livre des Esprits 
</I>and the works with which he followed it were based largely on communications 
received through mediums. They had a wide circulation, and the doctrines of 
spiritism became much more popular, in France at least, than those of the rival 
spiritualism, which did not include reincarnation among its tenets. The names 
<I>A lien </I>and <I>Kardec </I>which M. Rivail assumed were names he had borne 
in two former incarnations, revealed to him by mediumistic communications. He 
was the editor of <I>La Revue Spirits, </I>and the founder and president of the 
Parisian Society for Spiritualistic Studies, at which M. Camille Flammarion, 
then nineteen years of age, made his first acquaintance with psychic science in 
<B>1861</B>. <I>Allan Kardec </I>died in <B>1869</B>, his doctrines having by 
that time become firmly established. In Britain, however, they made but little 
headway, his only disciple of note in this country being Miss Anna Blackwell. 
<I>(See </I>France and Spiritualism.)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Karma :</B> is a doctrine common to Brahmanism, Buddhism and Theosophy though 
theosophists have not adopted it wholly as it is taught in the two religions 
mentioned. The word <I>karma </I>itself means &quot;action,&quot; but it may be 
useful to remember that generally the doctrine teaches that everything done is 
done for eternity, that, in short, &quot; thou shalt reap as thou didst 
sow.&quot; Action is not homogeneous but on the contrary, contains three 
elements, the thought which conceives it, the will which finds the means of 
accomplishment, and the union of thought and will which brings the action to 
pass. It is plain, therefore, that thought is very potent for good or evil, for 
as the thought is, so will the action be. The miser, thinking of avarice, is 
avaricious, the libertine, thinking of vice, is vicious, and on the contrary, 
those of virtuous thoughts show virtue in their actions. Arising naturally from 
such teaching is the attention devoted to thought-power. Taking the analogy of 
the physical body which may be developed by regimen and training, based on 
natural scientific laws, theosophists teach that character may, in exactly the 
same way, be scientifically built up. Physical weakness can be eradicated and an 
opposite state of affairs brought about by special exercise of the weak part, 
and by a similar method, weakness of character may be converted into strength 
Every vice is considered to evidence the lack of a corresponding virtue, avarice 
for instance showing the absence of generosity. Instead, however, of allowing 
matters to rest at this, under the plea-arising from ignorance-that the man was 
naturally avaricious, theosophists, on the lines of scientific knowledge, teach 
that constant thought directed to generosity will in time change the man's 
nature in this respect. This result cannot, of course, be brought about in a 
day, and the length of time necessary depends on at least two factors, the 
strength of thought and the strength of the vice, for the latter may be the sum 
of the indulgence of many ages and hence correspondingly difficult to eradicate 
The doctrine of <I>karma </I>must, however, be considered not in its relation to 
one life only, but in the light of the theosophic teaching of reincarnation 
(q.v.). Re-incarnation is carried on under the law of <I>karma </I>as well as of 
evolution. The new-born man bears within him the seeds of what he formerly was. 
His character is the same as it was. It is as he made it in past existences and 
accordingly as he made it, so does it continue unless he himself change it as he 
had the power to do. Each succeeding existence finds that character more 
definite in one direction or another and if it be evil, the effort to change it 
becomes increasingly difficult, indeed a complete change may not be possible 
until many existences of effort have passed. In such cases as these, the 
promptings of evil may be too strong to be resisted, yet the man who has an 
intelligent knowledge of the workings of <I>Karma, </I>though he must eventually 
yield, does so only after the most desperate struggle of which his nature is 
capable, and thus, instead of yielding weakly and increasing the power of the 
evil, he has helped to destroy its potency. Only in the most rare cases can he 
free himself with one effort. <I>(See also </I><STRONG>Theosophy</STRONG> and

</I>who would always return to the stable before a storm. As she persisted in 
remaining on the cold hillside, grazing on the scanty grass till the lad was 
nearly frozen with cold, Grettir determined to make her return home regardless 
of the weather. One morning before turning out the horses he tore off a long 
strip of her skin from wither to flank, This bad the effect of making the mare 
soon seek her stable; and the same thing occurring the next day, no storm 
impending, Asmund himself let out the horses, when he discovered what had been 
done,</P>

<P>Kephalonomancy :</B> A method of divination which &quot;a practised by making

Lombard, substituted for it the head of a goat. The ancients placed lighted 
carbon on an ass's head, and pronounced the names of those who were suspected of 
any crime. If a crackling coincided with the utterance of a name, the latter was 
taken as being that of the guilty person.</P>

<P>Kepler, John-1571-1630 :</B> A great mathematician and astrologer. He was 
born at Weil in Wurtemburg and educated at a monastic school at Maulbrunn and 
afterwards at the university of Tubingen, where he studied philosophy, 
mathematics, theology and astronomy. In <B>1593</B> he became professor of 
mathematics and morals at Gratz in Styria, where he also continued his 
astrological studies. He had an unhappy home life, and was somewhat persecuted 
for his doctrines. In <B>1626</B> were printed the famous Rodolphine tables, 
which he had prepared along with Tycho de Brahe, the astronomer. He died at 
Ratisbon. The laws of the courses of the planets, deduced by Kepler from 
observations made by Tycho, and known as <I>The Three Laws of Kepler, </I>became 
the foundation of Newton's discoveries, as well as the whole modern theory of 
the planets. His services in the cause of astronomy have placed him high amongst 
the distinguished men of science, and in <B>1808</B> a monument was erected to 
his memory at Ratisbon. His most important work is his <I>Astronomia nova, seu 
Physica Coelestis tradita Commentariis de Motibus Stellae Martis 
</I>(<B>1609</B>) which is still regarded as a classic by astronomers.</P>

<P>Key of Solomon the King :</B> A magical treatise of medieval origin, of which 
a number of manuscripts are extant. It is supposed to be the work of King 
Solomon (q.v.), but is manifestly of comparatively modern origin, and was 
probably written in the fourteenth or fifteenth century. It is permeated with 
late Jewish ideas, and its chief intention appears to be the finding of 
treasure, and the making of such experiments as have for their object the 
interference with the free will of others. The power of the Divine Name is much 
in evidence, and the entire work is an absurd combination of pomposity and 
nonsense.</P>
<P>The <I>Lemegeton, </I>or Leeser Key of Solomon, is much more noteworthy. Its 
earliest examples date from the seventeenth century, and it invokes the 
hierarchies of the abyss by legions and millions. It is divided into four parts, 
which control the offices of all spirits at the will of the</P>
<P>operator. The first part, <I>Goetia, </I>contains forms of conjuration for 
seventy-two demons with an account of their powers and offices. The second part, 
<I>Theurgia Goetia, </I>deals with the spirits of the cardinal points, who are 
of mixed nature. The third hook is called the <I>Pauline Art-</I>the 
significance of which name is unaccountable. It deals with the angels of the 
hours of the day and night, and of the signs of the Zodiac. The fourth part is 
entitled <I>Almadel, </I>which enumerates four other choirs of spirits. The 
usual homilies regarding purity of life are insisted upon, as is the 
circumstance that none of the conjurations shall be applied to the injury of 
another.</P>

making Balor's daughter, Ethlinn, the mother of three sons. Of these two were 
drowned by Balor, and the third Lugh, escaping by falling into a bay, was wafted 
back to his father, <I>Kian. </I>Some years later, while fighting in Ulster, 
<I>Kian </I>fell in with the three sons of Turenn whose house was at enmity with 
him. To escape their notice, he turned himself into a pig, but they recognised 
him and he was wounded by one of them. He begged to be restored to his human 
shape before dying. This being granted, he rejoiced in having outwitted his 
enemies, as they would now have to pay the blood-fine for a man instead of a 
pig. The brothers, determined that there should be no blood-stained weapon to 
publish the deed, stoned <I>Kian </I>and buried his body.</P>

author unknown). It has never been printed. It tells how <I>King Robert of 
Sicily </I>was beguiled by pride into sneering at a priest who read mass. To 
punish him, an angel was sent down by God, and he, assuming <I>Robert's 
</I>shape, transformed the <I>King </I>into the likeness of his own fool he is 
sent out to lie with the dogs. He was at length allowed to resume his proper 
shape after a long and ignominious penance. See poem on the subject by 
Longfellow.</P>

<P>Kischuph :</B> In the <I>Kabala, </I>the higher magical influence. It is 
divided into two branches, an elementary and a spiritual, and includes exorcism. 
Sometimes <I>Kischuph </I>exhibits a striking resemblance to the witchcraft of 
medieval times. Sorcerers were said to change themselves into animals, and go 
long distances in a very short time'. They may also induce pain and disease and 
death in men and animals. Still further allied to witches are the &quot;women 
who make a contract with the Schedim, and meet them at certain times, dance with 
them, and visit these spirits who appear to them in the shape of goats. In many 
countries such women are killed.&quot; This form of <I>Kischuph </I>is true 
sorcery the other form, material <I>Kischuph, </I>is rather evil sympathy, 
consisting of disturbing influences on the natural elements produced by exciting 
false &quot; rapports&quot; in various substances.</P>

<P>Kiss, Bewitched by means of a :</B> Florence Newton, a notorious witch of the 
Middle Ages, was on several occasions accused of having bewitched people by 
means of a <I>kiss. </I>The first was a servant-maid who had refused alms to 
her. About a week later the witch kissed her violently, from which time she 
suffered from fits and was transported from place to place, now being carried 
mysteriously to the top of the house, now being placed between two feather beds, 
and so on. The witch also caused the death of one David Jones, who stood 
sentinel over her in prison, by kissing his hand, and by the same means brought 
about the death of the children of three Youghal aldermen.</P>

<P>Klinnrath, Henry :</B> A German alchemist and hierophant of the physical side 
of the <I>Magnum Opus. </I>He was certainly aware of the greater issues of 
Hermetic theorems and may be regarded as a follower of Paracelsus. He was born 
in Saxony about the year <B>1560</B>. At the age of <B>28</B> he graduated in 
medicine at the University of Basle. He practised in Hamburg and thereafter in 
Dresden where he died in poverty and obscurity in <B>1601</B>, at the age of 
forty-five. The most remarkable of his works, some of which are still in 
Manuscript, is the <I>Anphitheatrum Sapientiae AEternae solius verae Chnstiano 
Kabbalisticum divino magicum, &amp;c. </I>It is an unfinished work and appeared 
after his decease with a preface and conclusion by Erasmus Wohlfahrt. It is a 
purely mystical and magical treatise. The seven steps leading to the goal of 
universal knowledge are described in a commentary on the Wisdom of Solomon. The 
work has been described as being the voice of ancient chaos, and its curious 
folding plates are particularly suggestive.</P>

<P>Koons' Spirit Room :</B> A log seance-room erected in Dover, Athens County, 
Ohio, by a farmer, Jonathan Koons, in <B>1852</B>. Koons, an early convert to 
spiritualism, had been told that he and his eight children would develop 
mediumistic powers, and the <I>spirit-room </I>was intended to be used for 
manifestations produced by their mediumship. The room was furnished with the 
appliances incidental to the spiritualistic s&eacute;ance - table for rappings, 
tambourines, and other musical instruments; phosphorus, by means of which the 
spirits might show themselves. The phenomena witnessed by the sitters, including 
Charles Partridge, editor of the <I>Spiritual Telegraph, </I>were of a varied 
nature, but in the main identical with the other manifestations of the same 
period. The spirits who visited <I>Koon's </I>log building claimed to be a 
band-one hundred and sixty-five in number-of men who had lived before the time 
of Adam, and from whom were descended the well-known spirit personalities, John 
and Katie King.</P>

<P>Kostchtchie, or &quot; Deathless&quot; :</B> A Russian goblin of the 
bogle-boe species. This horrid monster is described as having a death's head and 
fleshless skeleton, &quot;through which is seen the black blood flowing and the 
yellow heart beating.&quot; He is armed with an iron club, with which he knocks 
down all who come in his path. In spite of his ugliness, he is said to be a 
great admirer of young girls and women. He is avaricious, hates old and young 
alike, and particularly those who are fortunate. His dwelling is said to be 
amongst the mountains of the Koskels and the Caucasus. where his treasure is 
concealed.</P>

<P>Kostka, Jean :</B> The pseudonym of Jules Doinel. A late Gnostic and initiate 
of the <B>33</B>rd degree, who, converted to the Christian standpoint, revealed 
his diabolic adventures in the pages of <I>La Verite </I>under the title of 
&quot; Lucifer Unmasked.&quot; He tells of diabolic happenings in the private 
chapel of a lady, &quot;Madame X.&quot; who figures frequently in his pages, and 
who is thought to be the late Countess of Caithness, of visions of Jansen, and 
the classical deities. It is certain from the evidence that M. <I>Kostka 
</I>never came into personal contact with a Satanic or Luciferian cultus, and 
that his diabolic experiences were merely those of the amateur Satanist.</P>

<P>Krata Repoa :</B> or Initiation into the ancient Mysteries of the Priests of 
Egypt, written by C. F. Koppen and J. W. B. Von Hymmen, and. published at Berlin 
in <B>1782</B>. The term <I>Krata Repoa, </I>said to be of Egyptian origin, 
possesses no affinity to that language so far as the present writer is aware. 
The work is divided into seven grades. That of Postophoris (a word used by 
Apuleius to signify a priest of Isis) corresponds to the apprentice or keeper of 
the sacred threshold. Secondly comes the degree of Neokaros, in which are to be 
found many ordeals and temptations. The third degree is the State of Death-of 
degree of judgment and of the passage of the Soul. The candidate was restored to 
light in the following degree, the Battle of. the Shadows. In the fifth grade a 
drama of Vengeance was enacted, and the sixth is that of the astronomer before 
the gate of the gods. In the final grade the whole scheme of initiation was 
expounded. It has been thought that these degrees corresponded to the actual 
procedure of a secret society, and it may be that in some measure they did, as 
one of their authors was a prominent member of The African Builders (q.v.), but 
although there would seem to be elements of real tradition in the work, most of 
it is probably mere invention.</P>
