<P>Dactylomancy :</B> A term covering various forms of divination practised with 
the aid of rings. One method resembles the table-rapping of modern spiritualism. 
A round table is inscribed with the letters of the alphabet, and a ring 
suspended above it. The ring, it is said, will indicate certain letters, which 
go to make up the message required. It was used, according to Ammianus 
Marcellinus, to find Valen's successor, and the name Theodosius was correctly 
indicated. Solemn services of a religious character accompanied this mode of 
divination. Another form of <I>dactylomancy, </I>of which there is no detailed 
account, was practised with rings of gold, silver, copper, iron or lead, which 
were placed on the finger-nails in certain conjunctions of the planets. A 
wedding ring is, however,' most in favour for purposes of this sort. Another way 
is to suspend the ring within a glass tumbler, or just outside of it so, that 
the ring on being swung may easily touch the glass. As with table-rapping, a 
code may then be, arranged, the glass being struck once for an affirmative, 
twice for a negative answer, and so on. Suspended above a sovereign, the ring 
will indicate the person from whose head hair has been taken, or, if requested, 
any other member of the company.</P><B>

<P>Dactyls :</B> A class of sorcerers and scientific physicians who had their 
origin in Phrygia. Their number is given differently by different authorities. 
Some say it equals the number of fingers on the hands-five male and five female. 
Pausanias says five, Perecydes fifty-two, twenty right and thirty-two left; 
while Orpheus the Argonaut mentions a large number. The dactyls were magicians, 
exorcists, conjurors, soothsayers .,.Plutarch says that they made their 
appearance in Italy as sorcerers; while their magical practices and mysteries 
threw the inhabitants of- Samothrace into consternation. They were credited with 
the discovery of minerals and the notes of the musical scale; also with the 
discovery and use of the Ephesian mines They introduced fire into Crete, musical 
instruments into Greece. They were good runners and dancers, skilled in science 
and learning, and from them came the first wise men. They are said by some to 
have been the magnetic powers and spirits, whose head was Hercules.</P><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Daemonologie :</B> by King James VI. and I.: It is customary nowadays to 
sneer at the writings of this royal author, and as Horace Walpole remarks, his 
majesty really has more critics than readers; while it should be borne in mind 
that in his own day the king's books were greatly admired, winning the encomiums 
of Bacon, Jzaak Walton, and numerous equally eminent men of letters. In general, 
however, it was <I>Besilicon -Doron </I>which elicited their homage, and 
compared to this last the king's study of demonology is but a mediocre 
performance. Published in <B>1597</B>, it is couched &quot;in forme of ane 
dialogue.&quot; the speakers being Philomathes and Epistemon; and the former, 
being very incredulous as regards all kinds of magic, asks Epistemon to 
enlighten him. Thereupon many famous acts of witchcraft are adduced, but, when 
Philomathes requests to be told precisely why the black art should be considered 
iniquitous, his interterlocutor fails conspicuously to give a satisfactory 
answer. He merely inveighs against the practice in question, and accordingly 
there is something distinctly trite in the subsequent pages, wherein Epistemon 
is represented as being converted to the other speaker's point of view, and 
declaring loudly that all sorcerers and the like &quot;ought to be put to death 
according to the Law of God, the eivill and imperiall Law, and. municipall Law 
of all Christian Nations.'</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Daiver-Logum :</B> The dwelling place of the, daivers (q.v.) a species of 
Hindoo genii.. Besides the daivers, who number three hundred and thirty 
millions, there dwell in <I>the Daiver-Logum </I>those heroes and prophets who' 
are not yet fit for the paradise of Shiva or of Vishnu.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Daivers and Daivergoel :</B> Hindoo genii inhabiting the Daiver-Logum, a 
world of their own. They are, it seems, related to the Persian divs, from which 
it is suggested that the word devil&quot; is derived. They possess material 
'bodies as well as spiritual, and have many human attributes, both good and 
evil. Their king is called Daivuntren, or Indiren, his wife jaderannee, and his 
son Seedcra-hudderen. The latter records the actions of human beings, by which 
they must at last be judged. In Daivuntren's immense court of audience there is 
room not only for the <I>daivers </I>themselves, but for a multitude of 
attendants, or companions These are the kuinarer, the musicians of Daiver-Logum 
Dumbarim, Nardir, tile drummers; Kimprusher winged beings of great beauty, who' 
wait on the <I>brie's </I>Kunda gaindoorer, similar beings, the messengers of 
Vishnu Paunner, the jugglers ; Viddiaser, the bards Tsettee those beings who 
attend them in their aerial flights. </P>
<P>Kannanader, or Dordanks, the messengers who lead devotees of Shiva and Vishnu 
to paradise, and the wicked to hell. There is yet another class of 
<I>daivergoel, </I>or genii, which comprises the eight keepers of the eight 
sides of the world, known by their general name of Aushtatiken-Pauligaur. These 
are Indiren, or Daivuntren, their king ; Augne-Bangauven, god of fire; Eemen, 
king of death and hell; Nerudee, the earth-element personified as a giant; 
Vaivoo, god of the air and winds; Varooner, god of the clouds and rain; 
Gooberen, god of riches; and Essaunien, . Shiva himself, in one of his 
<B>1</B>,<B>008</B> incarnations.</P>

<P>Dalan :</B> A druid who figures in the medieval Irish legend of Conary Mor 
(q.v.).</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Dalton, Thomas :</B> The history of this alchemist is veiled in obscurity, 
but he appears to have lived about the middle of the fifteenth century ; and, as 
he is mentioned in the <I>Ordin all of Alchimy </I>by Thomas Norton, it is 
likely that he was a pupil or at least a friend of the latter. <I>Dalton </I>was 
a churchman, resident at an abbey in Gloucester; and it is reported that, on one 
occasion, he was brought before the king, Edward IV., in whose presence he was 
charged with the surreptitious practice of magic, in those days a capital crime. 
His accuser was one Debois, to whom the unfortunate alchemist had at one time 
been chaplain, and this Debois affirmed upon oath that he had seen the accused 
create a thousand pounds of pure gold within the space of a single day. 
Thereupon <I>Dalton </I>reminded his accuser that he had sworn never to reveal 
this or any kindred facts. Debois acknowledged his perfidy herein, yet added 
that he was acting for the good of the commonwealth. The alchemist then 
addressed the king himself, telling him that he had been given the powder of 
projection by a certain Canon of Litchfield, and that since then he had been in 
so' constant a state of trepidation that he had ultimately destroyed the 
precious article. Edward accordingly granted him his freedom, at the same time 
giving him money sufficient for his journey home; but on his way there he was 
seized by a certain Thomas Herbert, who had heard of the accusations brought 
against the churchman, and was naturally inquisitive. Herbert carried his victim 
to the castle of Gloucester, and, incarcerating him in a cell there, tried every 
means to make him disclose the secret at issue. All was in vain, however, and 
lit length <I>Dalton </I>was condemned to death by his persecutor, and brought 
out to be beheaded in the courtyard of the castle. He placed his head on the 
block, and, crying out to' God to receive his soul, he called upon the 
executioner to strike speedily; but now a strange scene was enacted, for hardly 
was the axe raised ere Herbert sprang forward to avert it, at the same time 
declaring that he dared not shed innocent blood. In short, the projected 
execution was no more than a dastardly ruse, the persecutor imagining that the 
alchemist would confess all when his life was at stake; and, as the plan had 
failed, <I>Dalton </I>was allowed to go free. So' he returned to' his abbey in 
Gloucestershire, and there he lived quietly and unmolested for the rest of his 
days.</P>

<P>Danaans, The :</B> people of the goddess Dana, often mentioned in Irish 
medieval romance. They were one of the three Nemedian families who survived the 
Fomorian victory, and returned to Ireland at a later period. By some it was said 
that they came&quot; out of heaven,&quot; and by others that they sprang from 
four cities, in which they learned science and craftsmanship, and from each of 
which they brought away a magical treasure. From Falias they brought the Stone 
of Destiny (Lia Fail) (q.v.) ; from Gorias an invincible sword; from Finias a 
magical spear; and from Murias the Cauldron of the Dagda. They were believed to 
have been wafted to Ireland on li magic cloud, carrying their treasures with 
them. After a victorious battle they took possession of the whole of Ireland, 
except Connacht which was given to the vanquished. The <I>Daneans </I>were the 
representatives of power and beauty, of science and poetry, to the writer of the 
myth ; to the common people they were gods of earth. In their battles they were 
subject to death, but it was by magical powers that they conquered their mortal 
foes.</P>

<P>Davenport Brothers (Ian and William)</B> <B>:</B> Two American mediums who 
gave seances for physical phenomena in America and Britain during the decade 
<B>1860</B>-<B>70</B>. They seem to have attained to' a considerable measure of 
fame, and to have won a great many people to the belief that their performances 
were genuine spirit manifestations. On their coming to England in <B>1864</B> 
they were accompanied by a chaplain, the Rev. J. B. Ferguson, who helped to 
inspire confidence in their good faith. The usual plan of their seances was as 
follows The <I>Brothers Davenport </I>took their seats <I>vis-a-vis </I>in a 
small walnut cabinet &quot; made very like a wardrobe or clothes-press. Any two' 
gentlemen from among the audience were requested to' bind them firmly to their 
benches, so' as to' preclude any possibility of their freeing their hands. 
Musical instruments were then placed in the cabinet, apparently out of reach of 
the medium, and the lights were lowered. Soon the musical instruments began to 
play within the cabinet, dim &quot; spirit hands&quot; were seen in front of it. 
At the conclusion of the seance, however, the mediums were found tied as 
securely as ever. They met with a check, however, on their provincial tour, for 
at Liverpool there were two' men among the audience who' possessed the secret of 
a special knot. The&quot; Tom Fool's knot,&quot; as it was called, baffled the 
spirits, and the mediums were mobbed. Later in a seance given before a committee 
of the Anthropological Society, they shirked nearly all the conditions, and 
succeeded in accomplishing nothing which could not be done by a skilful 
conjurer. Tolmagne, Anderson, and other conjurers emulated their feats, and 
Maskelyne and Cooke so successfully that mediums had no resource but to class 
them as' &quot;fellow-adepts.&quot;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Davey, S. T. :</B> A member of the Society for Psychical Research who' in 
<B>1886</B> gave imitations of the slate-writing performances of Eglinton and 
Slade, with a view to exposing their fraudulent methods. By simple conjuring he 
succeeded in emulating all their feats. <I>(See </I>Slate-writing, 
Spiritualism.)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Davies, Lady :</B> Eleanor Tuchet, daughter of George, Lord Audley, married 
Sir John Davies, an eminent lawyer in the time of James the First, and author of 
a poem of considerable merit On the Immortality of the Soul. This lady was a 
person of many talents; but what she seems most to have valued herself upon, was 
her gift of prophecy; and she accordingly printed a book of Strange and 
Wonderful Predictions. She professed to' receive her prophecies from a spirit, 
who communicated to her audibly things about to' come to' pass,. though the 
voice could be heard by no' other person. Sir John Davies was nominated lord 
chief justice of the king's bench in <B>1626</B>. Before he was inducted into' 
the office, lady Eleanor, sitting with him on Sunday at dinner, suddenly burst 
into a passion of tears. Sir John asked her what made her weep. To which she 
replied &quot; These are your funeral tears.&quot; Sir John turned off the 
prediction with a merry answer. But in a very few days he was seized with an 
apoplexy, of which he presently died. She also predicted the death of the duke 
of Buckingham in the same year. For this assumption of the gift of prophecy, she 
was cited before the high-corn-mission-court and examined in <B>1634</B>.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Davis, Andrew Jackson :</B> Known as the &quot; Poughkeepsie Seer&quot; from 
his residence in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., was a prophet, clairvoyant, and mystic 
philosopher, who' commenced his mission to the world about <B>1844</B>, some 
time before the Rochester Rappings had inaugurated the movement known as&quot; 
modern spiritualism.&quot; In <B>1847</B> he published a volume of trance 
discourses, <I>The Principles of Nature, Her Divine Revelations, </I>and <I>A 
Voice to Mankind. </I>In the same year he issued the first number of the 
<I>Univercaelum, </I>a periodical devoted to clairvoyance and trance phenomena 
generally, which continued till <B>1849</B>. Not until <B>1850</B>, however, did 
<I>Davis </I>and his followers identify themselves with the spiritualists. In 
his <I>Revelations </I>the Poughkeepsie Seer propounds his Harmonial Philosophy, 
afterwards to be elaborated in many volumes. His mission, revealed to him by 
Galen and Swedenborg, was the prophesying of a new dispensation, preceded by a 
social revolution. He was associated, throughout his career, with many prominent 
spiritualists.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Death-Coach :</B> There is a widespread superstitious belief that death goes 
round in a coach picking up souls. The form of the belief varies, of course, 
with the locality. In some parts of England and Wales the death-coach passes 
silently at midnight, without sound of hoof or wheels. Both coach and horse are 
black, and a black hound runs in front. In some localities the horses and 
coachman are headless, which doubtless adds to' the effectiveness of the 
apparition. The Breton peasant hears the approach at midnight of a cart with a 
creaking axle. It is the <I>Ankon </I>death- and when the cart stops before a 
dwelling someone within must die.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Death-watch</B> <B>:</B> The ticking of the <I>death-watch-a </I>small insect 
found in decaying wood- is thought by the superstitious to presage death.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Decem Viri :</B> <I>(See </I><B>Sibylline</B> <B>Books</B>.)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Dectera : </B>A figure of Irish medieval romance. She was the daughter of 
Cathbad the Druid, and mother of Cuchulain (q.v.). She and fifty other maidens 
disappeared from the court of Conor mac Nessa. Three years later, while pursuing 
a flock of birds which were spoiling the crops, the king and courtiers came upon 
a magnificent palace inhabited by a youth of noble mien and a beautiful woman 
and fifty maidens. These were recognised as <I>Dectera </I>and her companions. 
and the youth as Lugh, the sun-god. Conor summoned <I>Dectera </I>to him, but 
she sent him instead her new-born son, Cuchulain.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Dee, John :</B> Born in London <B>1527</B>, this remarkable mathematician and 
astrologer is supposed to have been descended from a noble old Welsh House, the 
Dees of Nant y Groes in Radnorshire; while he himself affirmed that among his 
direct ancestors was Roderick the Great, Prince of Wales. <I>Dee's </I>father 
appears to' have been a gentleman server at the court of Henry VIII., and, being 
consequently in tolerably affluent circumstances, he was able to give his son a 
good education. So at the age of fifteen <I>John </I>proceeded to' Cambridge, 
and after two' years there he took his degree as Bachelor of Arts while a little 
later on his becoming intensely interested in astronomy and the like, he decided 
to leave England and go' and study abroad. In <B>1547</B>, accordingly, he went 
to the Low Countries, where he consorted with numerous scholars, and whence he 
eventually brought home the first astronomer's staff of brass, and also two' 
gloves constructed by Gerard Mercetor; but <I>Dee </I>was not destined to remain 
in his native land for long, and in <B>1548</B> lie lived for some time at 
Louvain, and in <B>1550</B> he spent several months in Paris, lecturing there on 
the principles of geometry. He was offered, indeed, a permanent post at the 
Sorbonne; but he declined this, and in <B>1551</B> he returned to England, 
where, having been recommended to Edward VI., he was granted the rectory of 
Upton-upon-Severn, Worcestershire.</P>
<P>The astrologer was now in a delightful and enviable position, having a 
comfortable home and assured income, and being able to devote himself 
exclusively to the studies he loved. But hardly had he begun to enjoy these 
benefits are an ugly cloud darkened his horizon, for, on the accession of Queen 
Mary in <B>1553</B>,<B> </B>be was accused of trying to take the new sovereign's 
life by thaumaturgic means, and was imprisoned at Hampton Court. He gained his 
liberty soon afterwards, but he felt very conscious that many people looked on 
him askance on account of his scientific predilections and, in a preface which 
he wrote for an English translation of Euclid, he complains bitterly of being 
regarded as a companion of the hehounds, a caller and a conjuror of wicked and 
damned spirits.&quot; However, during the reign of Queen Elizabeth his fortunes 
began tp improve again; and after making another long tour abroad, going on this 
occasion so far afield as St. Helena, he took a house at Mortlake on the Thames, 
and while staying there he rapidly became famous for his intimate knowledge of 
astronomy. In <B>1572 </B>on the advent of a new star, people flocked to hear 
<I>Dee </I>descant on the subject; while five years later, on the appearance of 
a mysterious comet, the scholar was again vouchsafed ample opportunity of 
displaying his learning, Elizabeth herself being among those who came to ask him 
what this addition to the stellar bodies might portend.</P>
<P>The most romantic circumstances in <I>Dee's </I>life, however, are those 
which deal with his experiments in crystallomancy. Living in comparative 
solitude-practising astrology for bread, but studying alchemy for pleasure 
brooding over Talmudic mysteries and Rosicrucian theories-immersed in constant 
contemplation of wonders which he longed to penetrate-and dazzled by visions of 
the elixir of life and the Philosopher's Stone, <I>Dee </I>soon attained to such 
a condition of mystic exaltation that his visions became to him as realities, 
and he persuaded himself that be was the favoured of the Invisible. In his 
<I>Diary </I>he records that he first saw in his crystal-globe-that is, saw 
spirits-on the <B>25</B>th<B> </B>of May, <B>1581</B>. In another year he had 
attained to' a higher level, and one day, in November, <B>1582</B>, while on his 
knees and fervently praying, he became aware of a sudden glory which filled the 
west window of his laboratory, and in whose midst shone the bright angel Uriel. 
It was impossible for <I>Dee </I>to speak. His tongue was frozen with awe. But 
Uriel smiled benignly upon him, gave him a convex piece of crystal, and told him 
that when he wished to' communicate with the beings of another world he had but 
to' examine it intently, and they would immediately appear and reveal the 
mysteries of the future. Then the angel vanished.</P><I>
<P>Dee, </I>however, found from experience that it was needful to' concentrate 
all one's faculties upon the crystal before the spirits would obey him. In other 
words, it was necessary to' stimulate the imagination to' the highest pitch, 
until the soul became a willing agent in its self-deception. Bring the will to' 
bear upon the imagination, and it is possible to' realize a spirit in every 
shadowy corner-to' hear the song of the spirits in the low crooning of the 
evening wind- to read in the starry heavens the omens and portents of the 
future. One may become with marvellous ease the deceiver of one-self,-the dupe 
of one's own delusions,-and brood upon a particular subject until one passes the 
mysterious border between sanity and madness passes from imagination into 
mania.</P><I>
<P>Dee </I>could never remember what the spirits said in their frequent 
conversations with him. When the excitement was over, he forgot the fancies with 
which he had been beguiled. He resolved, therefore, to discover some 
fellow-worker, or neophyte, who should converse with the spirits while he 
himself, in another part of the room, sat and recorded the interesting dialogue. 
He found the assistant he sought in one Edward Kelly, who unhappily possessed 
just the requisite boldness and cunning for making a dupe of the amiable and 
credulous enthusiast.</P>
<P>Edward Kelly was a native of Lancashire, born, according to <I>Dee's </I>own 
statement, in <B>1555</B>.<B> </B>We know nothing of his early years, but after 
having been convicted at Lancaster of coining-for which offence he lost his 
ears-he removed to Worcester, and established himself as a druggist. Sensual, 
ambitious, and luxurious, he longed for wealth, and despairing of securing it by 
honest industry, began to' grope after the Philosopher's Stone, and to employ 
what magical secrets he picked up in imposing upon the ignorant and profligate. 
<I>Dee </I>sought knowledge for the love of it; Kelly as a means to gratify his 
earthly passions. He concealed the loss of his ears by a black skull-cap, and 
being gifted with a good figure and tolerably handsome countenance, looked the 
very incarnation of mysterious wisdom, Before his acquaintance with <I>Dee 
</I>began, he had obtained some repute as a necromancer and alchymist, who could 
make the dead utter the secrets of the future. One night he took a wealthy dupe 
with some of his servants, into' the park of Walton le Dale, near Preston in 
Lancashire, and there alarmed him with the most terrific incantations. He then 
inquired of one of the servants whose corpse had been last buried in the 
neighbouring churchyard, and being told that a poor man had been interred there 
within a very few hours, exhumed the body, and pretended to' draw from it 
oracular utterances.</P><I>
<P>Dee </I>appears to have had a <I>shryer, </I>or seer before his introduction 
to Kelly, who was named Barnabas Saul. He records in his <I>Diary </I>On the 
<B>9</B>th of October, <B>1581</B>, that the unfortunate medium was strangely 
troubled by a spiritual creature&quot; about midnight. On the <B>2</B>nd of 
December he willed his skryer to look into the great crystalline globe&quot; for 
the apparition of the holy angel Anael. Saul looked and saw. But his invention 
appears to have become exhausted by the following March, when he confessed that 
he neither saw nor heard any spiritual creature any more; whereat the 
enthusiastic <I>Dee </I>grew strangely dissatisfied, and soon dismissed the 
unsatisfactory and unimaginative medium. Then came Edward Kelly (who' appears to 
have been also called Talbot), and the conferences with the spirits rapidly 
increased in importance as well as curiosity.</P>
<P>A clever rogue was Kelly. Gifted with a fertile fancy and prolific invention, 
he never gazed into' the &quot;great crystalline globe&quot; without making some 
wondrous discoveries, and by his pretended enthusiasm gained the entire 
confidence of the credulous <I>Dee. </I>The mathematician, despite his learning 
and his profound intellect, became the easy tool of the plastic, subtle Skryer. 
The latter would sometimes pretend that he doubted the innocent character of the 
work upon which he was engaged; would affect a holy horror of the unholy; and 
profess that the spirits of the crystal were not always &quot; spirits of 
health,&quot; but-perish the thought !-&quot; goblins damn'd;&quot; demons whose 
task it was to compass their destruction. The conferences held between Kelly and 
the spirits were meanwhile, carefully recorded by <I>Dr. Dee; </I>and whoever 
has stomach for the perusal of a great deal of absurdity and not a little 
blasphemy, may consult the folio published in <B>1659</B> by the learned Meric 
Casaubon, and entitled &quot; A True and Faithful Relation of what passed 
between <I>Dr. John Dee </I>and some Spirits; tending, had it succeeded, to a 
General Alteration of most States and Kingdoms in the World.&quot;</P>
<P>Two such shining lights could not hide themselves under a bushel, and their 
reputation extended from Mortlake even to the Continent. <I>Dee </I>now declared 
himself possessed of the <I>elixir vitae, </I>which he had found he said, among 
the ruins of Glastonbury Abbey; so' that the curious were drawn to his house by 
a double attraction. Gold flowed into' his coffers in an exhaustless stream, but 
his experiments in the transmutation of metals absorbed a great portion of his 
substance.</P>
<P>At this time the court of England was visited by a Polish nobleman named 
Albert Laski, Count Palatine of Siradz, who was desirous to see the magnificence 
of the famous</P>
<P>&quot;Gloriana.&quot; Elizabeth received him with the flattering welcome she 
always accorded to distinguished strangers, and placed him in charge of the 
splendid Leicester. He visited all the England of the sixteenth century worth 
showing, and especially her two' Universities, but was sorely disappointed at 
not finding the famous <I>Dr. Dee </I>at Oxford. I would not have come 
hither,&quot; he said to the Earl, had I wot that <I>Dee </I>was not here.&quot; 
Leicester undertook to' introduce him to the learned philosopher on their return 
to London, and so soothed his discontent.</P>
<P>A few days afterwards the Pole and Leicester were waiting in the ante-chamber 
at Whitehall for an audience of the Queen, when <I>Dr. Dee </I>arrived. 
Leicester embraced the opportunity, and introduced him to' Albert Laski. The 
interview between two' genial spirits was interesting, and led to' frequent 
visits from Laski to <I>Dee's </I>house at Mortlake. Kelly soon perceived what a 
Pactolus this Pole would prove, and as he was imbued with all the extravagant 
superstitions of the age relative to the elixir and the Philosopher's Stone, it 
was easy enough to play upon his imagination, and entangle him in the meshes of 
an inextricable deception. <I>Dee, </I>in want of money to' prosecute his 
splendid chimeras, and influenced by Kelly's artful suggestions, lent himself in 
some measure to the fraud, and speedily the great crystalling globe&quot; began 
to' reveal hints and predictions which inflamed the ardent fancy of the noble 
Polonian.&quot; But Kelly imposed upon <I>Dee </I>as well as upon Laski. He 
appears to' have formed some wild but magnificent projects for the 
reconstruction of Europe, to' be effected through the agency of the Pole, and 
thenceforth the spirits could converse upon nothing but hazy politics.</P>
<P>On a careful perusal of <I>Dee's Diary, </I>it is impossible to come to any 
other conclusion than that he was imposed upon by Kelly, and accepted his 
revelations as the actual utterances of the spirits ; and it seems probable that 
the clever, plastic, slippery Kelly not only knew something of the optical 
delusions then practised by the pretended necromancers, but possessed 
considerable ventriloquial powers, which largely assisted in his nefarious 
deceptions.</P>
<P>Kelly had undoubtedly conceived some extravagant notions of a vast European 
monarchy, in which Laski was to' play the part of a <I>Roi faineant </I>and he 
himself of a <I>Maire du Palais. </I>To this point all the spiritual revelations 
now tended, and they were managed, it must be owned, with consummate skill. 
Laski was proved, by the agency of Madinie, to be descended from the 
Anglo-Norman family of the Lacies. Then an angel named Murifre, who' was clothed 
like a husbandman, pointed out Laski as destined to effect the regeneration of 
the world.</P>
<P>But it did not answer Kelly's purposes to bring matters too' suddenly to a 
conclusion, and with the view of showing the extreme value of his services, he 
renewed his complaints upon the wickedness of dealing with spirits, and his fear 
of the perilous enterprises they might enjoin. He threatened, moreover, to' 
abandon his task, a threat which completely perturbed the equanimity of <I>Dr. 
Dee. </I>Where indeed, could he hope to' meet with another <I>skryer </I>of such 
infinite ability ? Once when Kelly expressed his desire of riding from Mortlake 
to Islington on some pretended business, the doctor grew afraid that it was only 
an excuse to cover his absolute evasion. Whereupon,&quot; says the doctor, I 
asked him why he so hasted to ride thither, and I said if it were to ride to 
<I>Mr. </I>Harry Lee I would go thither, and to be acquainted with him, seeing 
now I had so good leisure, being eased of the book writing. Then he said that 
one told him the other day that the duke (Laski) did but flatter him, and told 
him other things both against the duke and me. I answered for the duke and 
myself, and also' said that if the forty pounds annuity which Mr. Lee did offer 
him was the chief cause of his mind setting that way (contrary to many of his 
former promises to me), that then I would assure him of fifty pounds yearly, and 
would do' my best, by following of my suit, to' bring it to pass as soon as I 
possibly, could; and thereupon did make him promise upon the Bible.</P>
<P>&quot;Then Edward Kelly again upon the same Bible did swear unto' me constant 
friendship, and never to forsake me; and moreover said that unless this had so 
fallen about he would have gone beyond the seas, taking ship at New-castle 
within eight days next.</P>
<P>&quot;And so we plight Our faith each to the other, taking each other by the 
hand, upon these points of brotherly and friendly fidelity during life, which 
covenant I beseech God to turn to' his honour, glory, and service, and the 
comfort of our brethren (his children) here on earth.&quot;</P>
<P>Kelly now returned to his crystal and his visions, and Laski was soon 
persuaded that he was destined by the spirits to' achieve great victories over 
the Saracens, and win enduring glory. But for this purpose it was needful he 
should return to Poland, and to' Poland the poor dupe went, taking with him the 
learned <I>Dr. Dee, </I>the invaluable Edward Kelly, and their wives and 
families. The spirits continued to' respond to' their inquiries even while at 
sea, and so' they landed at the Brill on the <B>30</B>th of July <B>1583</B>, 
and traversed Holland and Friesland to the opulent free town of Lubeck. There 
they lived sumptuously for a few weeks,. and with recruited strength set out for 
Poland. On Christmas Day they arrived at Stettin, where they remained till the 
middle of January <B>1584</B>. They gained Lasco, the Pole's principal estate, 
early in February. Immediately the grand work commenced for the transmutation of 
iron into' gold, boundless wealth being obviously needful for so grand an 
enterprise as the regeneration of Europe. Laski liberally supplied them with 
means, but the alchymists always failed on the very threshold of success. Day by 
day the prince's trees melted away in the deceptive crucible; he mortgaged his 
estates, he sold them, but the hungry furnace continued to cry for&quot; More! 
more &quot; It soon became apparent to' the philosopher's that Laski's fortune 
was nearly exhausted. Madinte, Uriel, and their comrades made the same discovery 
at the same time, and, moreover, began to doubt whether Laski, after all, was 
the great regenerator intended to' revolutionize Europe. The whole party lived 
at Cracow from March <B>1584</B> until the end of July, and made daily appeals 
to' the spirits in reference to the Polish prince. They grew more and more 
discouraging in their replies, and as Laski began slowly to awake to the 
conviction that he had been a monstrous dupe, in order to rid himself of the 
burden, he proposed to furnish them with sufficient funds for a journey to 
Prague, and letters of introduction to the Emperor Rudolph. At this very moment 
the spirits discovered that it was necessary <I>Dee </I>should bear a divine 
message to the Emperor, and Laski's proposal was gladly accepted.</P>
<P>At Prague the two philosophers were well received by the Emperor. They found 
him very willing to believe in the existence of the famous stone, very courteous 
to <I>Dee </I>as a man of European celebrity, but very suspicious of the astute 
and plausible Kelly. They remained some months at Prague, living upon the funds 
which Laski had supplied, and cherishing hopes of being attached to the imperial 
service. At last the Papal Nuncio complained to' the countenance afforded to' 
heretical magicians, and the Emperor ordered them to quit his dominions within 
four-and-twenty hours. They precipitately complied, and by so doing escaped a 
prison or the stake, to' which the Nuncio had received orders from Rome to 
consign them (May <B>1586</B>).</P>
<P>They now proceeded to Erfurdt, and from thence to Cassel, but meeting with a 
cold reception, made their way once more to' Cracow. Here they earned a scantv 
living by telling fortunes and casting nativities; enduring the pangs of penury 
with an almost heroic composure, for they, the pretended possessors of the 
Philosopher's Stone, durst not reveal their indigence to the world, if they 
would not expose themselves to universal ridicule. After a while, they found a 
new dupe in Stephen, king of Poland, to whom Kelly's spirits predicted that the 
Emperor Rudolph would shortly be assassinated, and that the Germans would elect 
him to' the Imperial throne. But he in his turn grew weary of the ceaseless 
demands for pecuniary supplies. Then arose a new disciple in the person of Count 
Rosenberg, a nobleman of large estates at Trebona, in Bohemia. At his castle 
they remained for upwards of two years, eagerly pursuing their alchemical 
studies, but never approaching any nearer to' the desired result.</P><I>
<P>Dee's </I>enthusiasm and credulity had degraded him into' the tool and slave 
of Kelly; but the latter was nevertheless very wroth at the superior respect 
which <I>Dee, </I>as really a man of surprising scholarship and considerable 
ability, enjoyed. Frequent quarrels broke out between them, aggravated by the 
criminal passion which Kelly had conceived for the doctor's young and handsome 
wife, and which he had determined to' gratify. He matured at length an artful 
plan to obtain the fulfillment of his wishes. Knowing <I>Dee's </I>entire 
dependence upon him as a <I>skyer, </I>he suddenly announced his intention of 
resigning that honoured and honourable office, and only consented to' remain on 
the doctor's urgent entreaties. That day (April <B>18</B>, <B>1587</B>) they 
consulted the spirits. Kelly professed to be shocked at the revelation they 
made, and refused to' repeat it. <I>Dee's </I>curiosity was aroused, and he 
insisted upon hearing it, but was exceedingly discomposed when he found that the 
spirits enjoined the two' philosophers to' have their wives in common. Kelly 
expressed his own abhorrence of the doctrine, and when the spirits repeated it, 
with a mixture of socialistic extravagance to the effect that sin was only 
relative, and could not be sinful if ordered by God, protested they must be 
spirits of evil, not of good,-once more resigned his post as skryer,-and left 
the Castle.</P><I>
<P>Dee </I>now attempted to convert his son Arthur into a medium, but the lad 
had neither the invention, the faith, nor the deceptive powers for such an 
office, and the philosopher, deprived of those conferences with the other world 
which he had so long enjoyed, began to lament the absence of his old 
confederate. At this juncture Kelly suddenly returned. Again he consulted the 
crystal, and again was ordered to practise the socialistic role of all things in 
common. <I>Dee </I>was too delighted at his return to oppose any longer the will 
of the spirits. The two' wives resisted the arrangement for some time, but 
finally yielded to what was represented to be the will of Heaven, and <I>Dee 
</I>notes in his <I>Diary </I>that on Sunday the <B>3</B>rd of May, <I>anno 
</I><B>1587</B> (by the new account), I, <I>John Dee, </I>Edward Kelly, and our 
two' wives covenanted with God, and subscribed the same for indissoluble and 
inviolable unities, charity, and friendship keeping, between us four, and all 
things between us to be common, as God by sundry means willed us to 
do'.&quot;</P>
<P>The alchymists now resumed their pursuits with eagerness; but discord soon 
crept into this happy family of four. The wives, never very well content with 
the socialistic theory, quarrelled violently; the husbands began to' be pinched 
for want of means; and <I>Dee </I>turned his eyes towards England as a 
pleasanter asylum than the castle of Trebona was likely to prove for his old 
age. He obtained permission from Queen Elizabeth to return, and separated 
finally from Kelly. The latter, who' had been knighted at Prague, took with him 
an elixir found at Glastonbury Abbey, and ventured to proceed to the Bohemian 
capital. He was immediately arrested by order of the Emperor, and flung into 
prison. Obtaining his release after some months' imprisonment, he wandered over 
Germany, telling fortunes, and angling for dupes with the customary magical 
baits, but never getting a whit nearer that enjoyment of boundless resources 
which the possession of the Philosopher's Stone should have ensured him. 
Arrested a second time as a heretic and a sorcerer, and apprehending perpetual 
imprisonment, he endeavoured to escape, but fell from the dungeon-wall, and 
broke two of his ribs and both of his legs. He expired of the injuries he had 
received in February <B>1593</B>.</P><I>
<P>Dr. Dee </I>set out from Trebona with a splendid train, the expenses of his 
journey apparently being defrayed by the generous Bohemian noble. Three waggons 
carried his baggage; three coaches conveyed himself, his family, and servants. A 
guard of twenty-four soldiers escorted him; each carriage was drawn by four 
horses. In England he was well received by the Queen, as far as courteous 
phrases went, and settling himself at Mortlake, he resumed his chemical studies, 
and his pursuit of the Philosopher's Stone. But nothing prospered with the 
unfortunate enthusiast. He employed two <I>skryers at </I>first a rogue, named 
Bartholomew, and afterwards a charlatan named Beckman-but neither could discover 
anything satisfactory in the great crystalline globe.&quot; He grew poorer and 
poorer; he sank into' absolute indigence; he wearied the Queen with ceaseless 
importunities; and at length obtained a small appointment as Chancellor of St. 
Paul's Cathedral, which in <B>1595</B> he exchanged for the wardenship of 
Manchester College. He performed the duties of this position until age and a 
failing intellect compelled him. to resign it about <B>1602</B> or 
<B>1603</B>.</P>
<P>He then retired to' his old house at Mortlake, where he practised as a common 
fortune-teller, gaining little in return but the unenviable reputation of a 
wizard, &quot;a conjuror, a caller, or invocator of devils.&quot; On the 
<B>5</B>th of June <B>1604</B>, he presented a petition to' James the First, 
imploring his protection against such injurious calumnies, and declaring that 
none of all the great number of the very strange and frivolous fables or 
histories reported and told of him (as to have been of his doing) were 
true.&quot;</P><I>
<P>Dee </I>is an exceptionally interesting figure, and he must have been a man 
of rare intellectual activity. He made calculations to' facilitate the adoption 
in England of the Gregorian calendar; and he virtually anticipated the 
Historical Manuscripts Commission, addressing to the crown a petition wherein he 
wrote on the desirability of carefully preserving the old, unpublished records 
of England's past, many of which documents were at this period domiciled in the 
archives of monasteries. Moreover he was a voluminous writer on science, and, 
though lack of space makes it impossible to' give a full list of his works here, 
it certainly behoves to' mention the following : <I>Monas Hieroglyphica 
</I><B>1564</B>, <I>De Trigono </I><B>1565</B>, <I>Testamentum Johannis Dee

<P>De Lisle :</B> (circa. <B>1710</B>).<B> </B>French Alchemist. A considerable 
amount <I>of </I>matter concerning this French alchemist is contained in Langlet 
de Fresnoy's invaluable book, <I>Histoire de la Philosophie Hermetique, 
</I>while Figuier writes at some length on the subject ; but neither <I>of 
</I>these writers furnishes <I>de Lisle's </I>Christian name, and neither gives 
the exact date of his birth. The place where the event occurred is likewise 
unknown, although it is commonly held that the alchemist was a Provencal; while 
his position in the social hierarchy is likewise a matter of conjecture, the 
tradition that he sprang from humble peasant stock being practically vitiated by 
the <I>particule </I>in his name. True that this is usually spelt <I>Delisle, 
</I>but One may be fairly certain that that is a mere perversion, and that 
originally the two syllables were written separately.</P><I>
<P>De Lisle </I>is known to have been active during the first decade of the 
eighteenth century, so it may be assumed that he was born towards the close of 
<I>le grand siecle ; </I>while it would seem that, at an early age, he entered 
the service of a scientist whose name is unrecorded, but who' is supposed to' 
have been a pupil of Lascaris. This nameless scientist, it appears, got into 
trouble of some sort, the likelihood being that he was persecuted on account of 
his hermetic predilections ; and accordingly he left Provence and set out for 
Switzerland, taking with him his young henchman, <I>de Lisle. En route </I>the 
latter murdered his patron and employer, thereafter appropriating all his 
alchemistic property, notably some precious transmuting powder; and then, about 
the year <B>1708</B>, he returned to his native France, where he soon attracted 
attention by changing masses of lead and iron into' silver and gold. Noble and 
influential people now began to court his society and his scientific services, 
and betimes he found himself safely and comfortably housed in the castle of La 
Palud, where he received many visitors from day to day, demonstrating his skill 
before them. Anon, however, he grew weary of this life ; and, having contracted 
a <I>liaison </I>with a Madame Alnys, he commenced wandering with her from place 
to' place, a son being eventually born to the pair. At this time Madame Alnys' 
husband was still living, but that did not prevent <I>de Lisle </I>from 
continuing to elicit patronage and favour from the rich and great, and in 
<B>1710</B>,<B> </B>at the Chateau de St. Auban, he performed a curious 
experiment in the presence of one St. Maurice, then president of the royal mint. 
Going into the grounds of the <I>chateau </I>one evening, <I>de Lisle </I>showed 
St. Maurice a basket sunk in the ground, and bade him bring it into the 
<I>salle-d-manger </I>where it was duly opened, its contents transpiring to' be 
merely some earth of a blackish hue. No' very precious material! thought St. 
Maurice, accustomed to' handling ingots and nuggets; but <I>de Lisle, </I>after 
distilling a yellow liquid from the earth, projected this on hot quicksilver, 
and speedily produced in fusion three ounces of gold, while subsequently he 
succeeded in concocting a tolerable quantity of silver. Some of the gold was 
afterwards sent to Paris, where it was put through a refining process, and three 
medals were struck from it, one of which, bearing the inscription <I>Aurum Arte 
Factum, </I>was deposited in the cabinet of his most Christian majesty. 
Thereupon <I>de Lisle </I>was invited to come to Paris himself, and visit the 
court; but he declined the offer, giving as his reason that the southern climate 
he chiefly lived in was necessary to' the success of his experiments, the 
preparations he worked with being purely vegetable. The probability is that, 
having been signally triumphant in duping his <I>clientele </I>so far, he felt 
the advisability of refraining from endeavours which might prove futile, and 
vitiate his reputation.</P>
<P>We hear nothing of <I>de Lisle </I>later than <B>1760</B>, so presumably he 
died about that time; but his son by Madame Alnys seems to have inherited some 
part of his father's predilections, together with a fair quota of his skill. 
Wandering for many years through Italy and Germany, he affected transmutations 
successfully before various petty nobles; while at Vienna he succeeded in 
bringing himself under the notice of the Duc de Richelieu, who' was acting then 
as French ambassador to the Viennese court, and Richelieu afterwards assured the 
Abbe Langlet that he not only saw the operation of gold-making performed, but 
did it himself by carrying out instructions given him by Alnys. The latter 
gradually acquired great wealth, but, falling under suspicion, he was imprisoned 
for a space at Marseilles, whence he ultimately escaped to Brussels. Here he 
continued, not altogether unsuccessfully, to' engage in alchemy; while here too 
he became acquainted with Percell, the brother of Langlet du Fresnoy, to whom he 
is supposed to' have confided some valuable scientific secrets. Eventually, 
however, the mysterious death of one Grefier, known to' have been working in 
Alnys' laboratory, made the Brussels authorities suspicious about the latter's 
character, so he left the town stealthily, never to be heard of again.</P>

beings who are not deities. But, it is in regard to' its magical significance 
only that it falls to be dealt with here. The Greek term <I>Daimon, 
</I>originally indicated genius or spirit, but in England it has come to mean a 
being actively malevolent. Ancient <I>Demonology </I>will be found dealt with in 
the articles Egypt, Semites, Genius and Devil-Worship, and savage <I>demonology 
</I>under the beads of the various countries and races where it had its origin. 
According to Michael Psellus, demons are divided into' six great bodies. First, 
the demons of fire. Second, those of the air. Third, those of the earth. The 
fourth inhabit the waters and rivers, and cause tempests and floods; the fifth 
are subterranean, who prepare earthquakes and excite volcanic eruptions. The 
sixth, are shadows, something of the nature of ghosts. St. Augustine comprehends 
all demons under the last category. This classification of Psellus is not unlike 
that system of the middle ages, which divided all spirits into those belonging 
to the four elements, fire, air, earth, and water, or salamanders, sylphs, 
undines, and gnomes.</P>
<P>The medieval idea of demons was, of course, in a direct line from the ancient 
Christian and Gnostic supposition. The Gnostics, of early Christian times, in 
imitation of a classification of the different orders of spirits by Plato, had 
attempted a similar arrangement with respect to an hierarchy of angels, the 
gradation of which stood as follows -The first and highest order was named 
seraphim, the second cherubim, the third was the order of thrones, the fourth of 
dominions, the fifth of virtues, the sixth of powers, the seventh of 
principalities, the eighth of archangels, the ninth, and lowest, of angels. This 
classification was, in a pointed manner, censured by the apostles, yet still, 
strange to say, it almost outlived the pneumatologists of the middle ages. These 
schoolmen, in reference to the account that Lucifer rebelled against heaven, and 
that Michael, the archangel, warred against him, long agitated the momentous 
question: &quot; What orders of angels fell on this occasion ? &quot; At length, 
it became the prevailing opinion that Lucifer was of the order of Seraphim. It 
was also proved after infinite research, that Agares, Belial, and Barbatos, each 
of them deposed angels of great rank, had been of the order of virtues ; that 
Bileth, Focalor, and Phoenix, had been of the order of thrones; that Goap had 
been of the order of powers, and that Purson had been both of the order of 
virtues and of thrones; and Murmur, of thrones and of angels. The pretensions of 
many other noble devils were likewise canvassed, and, in equally satisfactory 
manner, determined. Afterwards, it became an object of enquiry to learn: &quot; 
How many fallen angels had been engaged in the contest? &quot; This was a 
question of vital importance, which gave rise to the most laborious research, 
and to a variety of discordant opinions. It was next agitated: &quot;Where the 
battle was fought-in the inferior heaven, in the highest region of the air, in 
the firmament, or in Paradise? &quot; &quot; How long it lasted ?-whether during 
one second, or moment of time <I>(punctum temporis), </I>two, three, or four 
seconds ? &quot; These are queries of very difficult solution, but the notion 
which ultimately prevailed was, that the engagement was concluded in exactly 
three seconds from the date of its commencement; and that while Lucifer, with a 
number of his followers, fell into hell, the rest were left in the air to tempt 
man. A still newer question rose out of all these investigations</P>
<P>Whether more angels fell with Lucifer, or remain in heaven with Michael ? 
&quot; Learned clerks, however, were inclined to think that the rebel chief bad 
been beaten by a superior force, and that, consequently, devils of darkness were 
fewer in number than angels of light.</P>
<P>These discussions which, during the number of successive centuries interested 
the whole of Christendom, too frequently exercised the talents of the most 
erudite persons in Europe. The last object of demonologists was to collect, in 
some degree of order, Lucifer's routed forces, and to reorganise them under a 
decided form of subordination or government. Hence, extensive districts were 
given to certain chiefs who fought under this general. There was Zimimar, 
&quot;the lordly monarch of the north,&quot; as Shakespeare styles him, who had 
his distinct provinqe of devils; there was Gorson, the King of the South 
Amaymon, the King of the East; and Goap, the Prince of the West. These 
sovereigns had many noble spirits subordinate to them, whose various ranks were 
settled with all the preciseness of heraldic distinction ; there were Devil 
Dukes, Devil Marquises, Devil Counts, Devil Earls, Devil Knights, Devil 
Presidents, and Devil Prelates. The armed force under Lucifer seems to have 
comprised nearly twenty-four hundred legions, of which each demon of rank 
commanded a certain number. Thus, Beleth, whom Scott bas described as &quot;a 
great king and terrible, riding on a pale horse, before whom go trumpets and all 
melodious music,&quot; commanded eighty-five legions; Agares, the first duke 
under the power of the East, commanded thirty-one legions; Leraje, a great 
marquis. thirty legions Morax, a great earl and a president, thirty-six legions; 
Furcas, a knight, twenty legions; and, after the same manner, the forces of the 
other devil chieftains were enumerated.</P>
<P>Such were the notions once entertained regarding the history, nature, and 
ranks of devils. Our next object will be to show that, with respect to their 
strange and hideous forms the apparitions connected with the popular belief on 
this subject, were derived from the descriptive writings of such demonologists, 
as either maintained that demons possessed a decided corporeal form, and were 
mortal, or that, like Milton's spirits, they could assume any sex, and take any 
shape they chose.</P>
<P>When, in the middle ages, conjuration was regularly practised in Europe, 
devils of rank were supposed to appear under decided forms, by which they were 
as well recognised as the head of any ancient family would he by his crest and 
armorial bearings. Along with their names and characters were registered such 
shapes as they were accustomed to adopt. A devil would appear, either like an 
angel seated in a fiery chariot, or riding on an infernal dragon, and carrying 
in his right hand a viper; or assuming a lion's head, a goose's feet, and a 
hare's tail; or putting on a raven's head, and mounted on a strong wolf. Other 
forms made use of by demons were those of a fierce warrior, or of an old man 
riding upon a crocodile with a hawk in his hand. A human figure would arise 
having the wings of a griffin; or sporting three heads, two of them being like 
those of a toad and of a cat; or defended with huge teeth and horns, and armed 
with a sword; or displaying a dog's teeth and a large raven's head; or mounted 
upon a pale horse, and exhibiting a serpent's tail; or gloriously crowned, and 
riding upon a dromedary; or presenting the face of a lion; or bestriding a bear, 
and grasping a viper. There are also such shapes as those of an archer, or of a 
Zenophilus. A demoniacal king would ride upon a pale horse; or would assume a 
leopard's face and griffin's wings; or put on the three heads of a bull, of a 
man, and a ram, with a serpent's tail, and the feet of a goose; and, in this 
attire, bestride a dragon, and bear in his hand a lance and a flag; or, instead 
of being thus employed, goad the flanks of a furious hear, and carry in his fist 
a hawk. Other forms were those of a goodly knight; or' of one who bore lance, 
ensigns, and even a sceptre; or of a soldier, either riding on a black horse, 
and surrounded by a flame of fire, or wearing on has head a duke's crown, and 
mounted on a crocodile or assuming a lion's face, and, with fiery eyes, spurring 
on a gigantic charger; or, with the same frightful aspect, appearing in all the 
pomp of family distinction, on a pale horse; or clad from head to foot in 
crimson raiment, wearing on his bold front a crown, and sallying along on a red 
steed. Some infernal duke would appear in his proper character, quietly seated 
on a griffin; another spirit of a similar rank would display the three heads of 
a serpent, a man, and a cat; he would also bestride a viper, and carry in his 
hand a firebrand. Another of the same type would appear like a duchess, 
encircled with a fiery zone, and mounted on a camel; a fourth, would wear the 
aspect of a boy, and amuse himself on the back of a two-headed dragon. A few 
spirits, however, would be content with the simple garbs of a horse, a leopard, 
a lion, an unicorn, a night raven, a stork, a peacock, or a dromedary, the 
latter animal speaking fluently the Egyptian language. Others would assume the 
more complex forms of a lion or of a dog, with a griffin's wings attached to 
each of their shoulders, or of a bull equally well gifted; or of the same 
animal, distinguished by the singular feature of a man's face; or of a crow 
clothed with human flesh; or of a hart with a fiery tail. To certain other noble 
devils were assigned such shapes as those of a dragon with three heads, one of 
these being human; of a wolf with a serpent's tail, breathing forth flames of 
fire; of a she-wolf exhibiting the same caudal appendage together with griffin's 
wings, and ejecting from her mouth hideous matter. A lion would appear, either 
with the head Of a branded thief, or astride upon a black horse, and playing 
with a viper, or adorned with the tail of a snake, and grasping in his paws two' 
hissing serpents.</P>
<P>These were the varied shapes assumed by devils of rank. &quot;It would, 
therefore,&quot; says Hibbert, &quot;betray too' much of the aristocratical 
spirit to' omit noticing the forms which the lower orders of such beings 
displayed. in an ancient Latin poem, describing the lamentable vision of a 
devoted hermit, and supposed to' have been written by St. Bernard in the year 
<B>1238</B>,<B> </B>those spirits, who' had no more important business upon 
earth than to' carry away condemned souls, were described as blacker than pitch; 
as having teeth like lions, nails on their fingers like those of a wild-boar, on 
their fore-head horns, through the extremities of which poison was emitted, 
having wide ears flowing with corruption, and discharging serpents from their 
nostrils. The devout writer of these verses has even accompanied them from. 
drawings, in which the addition of the cloven feet is not omitted. But this 
appendage, as Sir Thomas Brown has learnedly proved, is a mistake, which has 
arisen from the devil frequently appearing to the Jews in the shape Of a rough 
and hairy goat, this animal being the emblem of sin-offering.&quot;</P>
<P>It is worthy of further remark, that the form of the demons described by St. 
Bernard differs little from that which is no' less carefully portrayed by 
Reginald Scot, three hundred and fifty years later, and, perhaps, by the 
demonologists of the present day. &quot; In our childhood,&quot; says he, ' our 
mother's maids have so' terrified us with an ouglie divell having horns on his 
head, fier in his mouth, and a tail on his breech, eies like a bason, fangs like 
a dog, clawes like a beare, a skin like a niger, and a voice like a roaring 
lion-whereby we start and are afraid when we hear one cry bough.&quot;</P>
<P>Wit the view of illustrating other accounts of apparitions, we must advert 
to' the doctrines of <I>demonology </I>which were once taught. Although the 
leading tenets of this occult science may be traced to the Jews and early 
Christians, yet they were matured by our early communication with the Moors of 
Spain, who' were the chief philosophers of the dark ages, and between whom and 
the natives of France and Italy much communication subsisted. Toledo', Seville, 
and Salamanca, became the great schools of magic. At the latter city, 
prelections on the black art were, from a consistent regard to' the solemnity of 
the subject, delivered within the walls of a vast and gloomy cavern. The 
schoolmen taught that all knowledge and power might be obtained from the 
assistance of the fallen angels. They were skilled in the abstract sciences, in 
the knowledge of precious stones, in alchemy, in the various languages of 
mankind and of the lower animals, in the <I>belles lettres, </I>in moral 
philosophy, pneumatology, divinity, magic. history, and prophecy. They could 
control the winds, the waters, and the influence of the stars ; they could raise 
earthquakes, induce diseases, or cure them, accomplish all vaster mechanical 
undertakings, and release souls out of purgatory. They could influence the 
passions of the mind, procure the reconcilation of friends or foes, engender 
mutual discords, induce mania and melancholy, or direct the force and objects of 
the sexual affections. According to Wierus, demons are divided into a great many 
classes, and into' regular kingdoms and principalities, nobles and commoners. 
Satan is by no means the great sovereign of this monarchy, but his place is 
taken by Beelzebub. Satan is alluded to by Wierus as a dethroned monarch, and 
Chief of the Opposition; Moloch, Chief of the Army; and Pluto', Prince of Fire; 
and Leonard, Grand Master of the Sphere. The masters of these infernal courts 
are, Adramelech, Grand Chancellor; Astaroth, Grand Treasurer; and Nergal, Chief 
of the Secret Police; and Baal, Chief of the Satanic Army. According to' this 
authority, each state in Europe has also its infernal ambassadors. Belphegor is 
thus accredited to France, Mammon to' England, Belial to Turkey, Rimmon to 
Russia, Thamuz to Spain, Hutjin to Italy, and Martinet to Switzerland. 
Berbignier, writing in <B>1821</B>,<B> </B>has given a sketch of the Infernal 
Court. He says:</P>
<P>&quot;This court has representatives on earth. These mandatories are 
innumerable. I give nomenclature and degree of power of each: Moreau, magician 
and sorcerer of Paris, represents Beelzebub ; Pinel, a doctor of Salpetriere, 
represents Satan ; Bouge, represents Pluto'; Nicholas, a doctor of Avigum, 
represents Moloch; and so on. Altogether,&quot; says Wierus, &quot; there are in 
the infernal regions <B>6666</B> legions, each composed of the same number of 
devils.&quot;</P>

<P>Demonology and Witchcraft by Sir Walter Scott :</B> This work occupies a 
curious and pathetic place in Sir Walter Scott's vast literary output. Four 
years subsequent to his financial <I>debacle, </I>in <B>1826</B>, the author 
sustained a mild apoplectic shock, and it was shortly after this that John 
Murray, who' was then issuing a series known as &quot; The Family Library,&quot; 
asked Sir Walter to contribute thereto a volume on <I>demonology. </I>Consent 
was given readily, but, as an entry in Scott's journal makes manifest, he did 
not care greatly for the work, and really engaged in it just because he was 
still in the throes of writing off his debts, and had to accept every commission 
which was offered him. In short, the book was begun from a purely commercial 
motive, and was composed when the writer's mental faculties were perforce 
sluggish, the natural result being that it is infinitely inferior to his other 
writings. But despite its inferiority herein, Sir Walter's volume has its 
interest for students of occultism. The writer is lame enough in what might be 
called the speculative parts of his book-those pages, for instance, in which he 
tries laboriously to account for the prevalence in the middle-ages of belief in 
witchcraft and the like but his wonderful and well-stored memory stood him in 
good stead when writing those passages concerned purely with facts, and thus 
there is considerable value in his account of <I>demonology </I>in France and in 
Sweden, and in all that he says about Joan of Arc. Moreover, his intimate 
knowledge of early Scottish Literature gives a singular importance to all those 
of his chapters which are concerned with his native land, while it is interest 
mg to find that here and there, he offers something of &amp; sidelight on his 
own immortal novels, as for example, when he treats of those spectres which he 
had dealt with previously in <I>Woodstock.</P>

<P>Demonomancy :</B> Divination by means of demons. This. divination takes place 
by the oracles they make, or by the answers they give to' those who' evoke 
them.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Demonomania : </B>The mania of those who' believe all that is told concerning 
demons and sorcerers, such as Bodin,. Delancre, Leloyer, and others. Bodin's 
work is entitled <I>Demonomania of the Sorcerers, </I>but in this case it 
signifies devilry.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>De Morgan, Mrs. :</B> The author of a mystico-spiritual work entitled <I>From 
Matter to Spirit, </I>published in <B>1863</B>. <I>Mrs. de Morgan, </I>whose 
interest in spiritualism was awakened at the seances of Mrs. Hayden, was the 
wife of Professor de Morgan, who' himself offered emphatic testimony to' the 
genuineness of Mrs. Hayden's mediumship.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Deoca, or The Woman of the South :</B> A Princess of Munster, who' is 
mentioned in Irish medieval legend. It is said that she was betrothed to 
Lairgnan, and asked of him as a marriage gift the children of Lir, who' had been 
magically changed by their stepmother into' four wonderful singing swans. The 
hermit who' looked after them refused to give them to Lairgnan, who' then seized 
them. When brought into the presence of <I>Deoca </I>they were transformed into' 
their human form-withered, white-haired, miserable beings. The hermit baptised 
them before they died, and sorrowed for them so much that he himself was laid in 
their grave.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Dermot of the Love-spot :</B> Thc typical lover of Irish legend, and the hero 
of the myth of <I>Dermot </I>and Grania. It was in this wise that he got the 
love-spot. One night he and three companions entered a hut for a night's 
shelter, in which dwelt an old man, a young girl (Youth), a wether (the World) 
and a cat (Death). During the night the girl put the love-spot on Dermot's 
forehead, and henceforth, it is said, no woman could see him without loving him. 
He came to be loved by Grania, the betrothed of Finn, who' forced him to run 
away with her. They were pursued all over Ireland, but after sixteen years of 
outlawry, <I>Dermot </I>was allowed to return to' his patrimony. He was killed 
by the Boar of Ben, Bulben, (q.v.) an enchanted animal, who had been his 
step-brother. His body was borne away on a gilded bier by the People of Dana, 
and was given a soul by Angus Og, the Irish God of Love, that he might return 
each day and talk with him. <I>Dermot </I>was of the type of solar hero'; and 
the bier on which his body was borne away is, of course, the sunset.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Dervishes : </B>A sect of Mohammedan priests. In some cases they exercise a 
semi-esoteric doctrine. Their various paths&quot; or systems are of great 
antiquity, and probably are derived from the ancient rites of Persia and Egypt, 
bearing also' a strong resemblance to Magism. Taking the <I>Bektash </I>as 
typical of all, we find that in the fifteenth century <I>Bektash </I>of Bokhara 
received his mantle from Ahmed Yesevee, who' claimed descent from the 
father-in-law of Mohammed. He established a &quot;path,&quot; consisting 
nominally of seven degrees, only four of which, however, are essential. These 
aim at the establishment of an affinity between the aspirant and the Sheik, from 
whom he is led through the spirit of the founder, and that of the Prophet to 
Allah. The initiatory ceremony provides a severe test. The aspirant is tried for 
a year with false secrets, and his time of probation having expired, a lamb is 
slain, from the carcass of which a cord is made for his neck and a girdle of 
initiation for his loins. Two' armed attendants then lead him into' a square 
chamber, where he is presented to' the Sheik as &quot; a slave who' desires to' 
know truth.&quot; He is then placed before a stone altar, on which are twelve 
escallops. The Sheik, who' is attended by eleven others, grips the hand of the 
aspirant in a peculiar way, and administers the oath of the Order, in which the 
neophyte promises to be poor, chaste and obedient. He is then informed that the 
penalty of betraying the Order is death. He then says: &quot;Mohammed is my 
guide, Ah is my director,&quot; and is asked by the Sheik, Do you accept me as 
your guide? &quot; The reply being made in the affirmative, the Sheik says: 
&quot; Then I accept you as my son.&quot; He is then invested with a girdle on 
which are three knots, and receives an alabaster stone as a token. The sign of 
recognition is the same as that in the first degree of masonry. Amongst their 
important symbols are the double triangles and two triangles joined at the apex. 
One of their maxims is that ' the man must die that the saint must be 
born.&quot; As a jewel they make use Of a small marble cube with red spots, to 
typify the blood of the martyred Ah. These dervish sects are by no' means 
popular with the orthodox Mussulmans, as they devote themselves entirely to' the 
well-being of their order rather than to Mohammedanism.</P>
<P>A notable exercise indulged in by several Dervish sects, is that of gyration 
in circles for extended periods of time, or prolonged dancing. The object of 
this is obscure, some authorities contending that it is engaged in to bring 
about a condition of ecstasy, whilst others see in it a planetary or astronomic 
significance.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Desmond, Gerald : </B>sixteenth earl of <I>Desmond, </I>who was killed in 
<B>1583, </B>had some repute as a magician, and was known as the &quot; Great 
Earl.&quot; Many curious stories are current concerning him. He dwelt in his 
castle on a small island in Lough Gur, and there, in time, he brought his young 
bride, to' whom he was so' passionately attached that he could deny her nothing. 
Seeking him One day in the chamber where he worked his magic spells, she 
demanded to' know the secret of the Black Cat. In vain he told her of the 
terrible things she must witness; she would not be dissuaded. So he warned her 
solemnly that if she uttered a word the castle would sink to' the bottom of 
Lough Gur, and set to work. Terrible indeed were the sights she beheld, but she 
stood firm and uttered neither word nor cry, until her husband lay down on the 
floor and stretched till he reached almost from end to' end of the room. Then 
she uttered a wild shriek, and the castle sank instantly to the bottom of Lough 
Gur, where it still remains. Once in every seven yea's <I>Desmond, </I>mounted 
on a white horse; rises from the water and rides round the Lough. His horse is 
shod with silver shoes, and when these wear out the spell will be broken, 
<I>Desmond </I>will return, and his vast estates shall once more be restored to' 
him.</P><B>
<P>D'Espagnet, Jean :</B> A Hermetic philosopher who' left two' treatises 
<I>Enchiridion Physicae Restitutae </I>and <I>Arcanum Philosophiae Hernilacae 
</I>which have also' been claimed as the works of one calling himself the &quot; 
Chevalier Imperial.&quot; &quot; The Secret of Hermetic Philosophy&quot; 
embraces the practical side of the <I>Magnum Opus </I>and the Enchiridion treats 
of the physical possibility of transmutation. <I>D'Espagnet </I>also wrote the 
preface to' the <I>Tableau de <B>1</B>' Inconstance des Demons </I>by Pierre 
Delancre. The &quot;Arcanum&quot; is better known as the &quot; Canons of 
Espagnet&quot; and has been claimed as a treatise on mystical Alchemy. The 
Author states, however, that ' the science of producing Nature's grand Secret is 
a perfect knowledge of nature universally and of Art, concerning the realm of 
Metals; the practice whereof is conversant in finding the principles of Mietals 
by analysis.&quot;</P>
<P>The authorities cited by Espagnet are those who' like Trevisan are known to 
have devoted their lives to practical Alchemy. Nevertheless, it may be granted 
</P>
<P>that while much of the matter treats <B>6</B>f a physical object it may be 
extended to' the psychic side of Hermetic Art.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>&quot;Deuce Take You&quot; :</B> A vulgar saying which had its origin in 
antiquity. The <I>deuce </I>is practically synonymous with the devil, the word 
being derived from <I>Dusins, </I>the ancient name given by the Gauls to a sort 
of demon or devil.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Devas :</B> In Theosophy, constitute one of the rank's or orders of spirits 
who' compose the hierarchy which rules the universe under the Deity. Their 
numbers are vast and their functions are not all known to mankind, though 
generally these functions may be said to' be connected with the evolution of 
systems and of life. Of <I>Devas </I>there are three kinds-Bodiless Devas, Form 
Devas and Passion Devas. Bodiless Devas belong to the higher mental world, their 
bodies are composed of mental Elemental Essence, and they belong to' the first 
Elemental kingdom. Form Devas belong to the lower mental world, and while their 
bodies are composed also of mental Elemental Essence they belong to the second 
Elemental kingdom. Passion Devas belong to' the astral world and their bodies 
are composed of astral Elemental Essence. Devas are creatures superlatively 
great and superlatively glorious, of vast knowledge and power, calm yet 
irresistible, and in appearance altogether magnificent.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Devil :</B> A name derived from the Greek <I>Diabolos, 
</I>&quot;slanderer.&quot; The name for the supreme spirit of evil, the enemy of 
God and man. In primitive religious systems there is no conception of evil, and 
the gods are neither good nor bad, as we conceive these terms, but may possess 
&quot; good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; attributes at one and the same time. Thus 
we have very few traces of beings which are absolutely evil in the older 
religions, and it may be broadly stated that the conception of Satan as we have 
it to-day is almost purely Hebrew and Christian. In Egypt and Babylon, figures 
like Apepi and Tiawath, although clearly in the line of evolution of a Satanic 
personality, are by no means rulers of the infernal regions. Again the Hades of 
the Greeks is merely a ruler of the shades of the dead, and not an enemy of 
Olympus or mankind. It is strange that in Mexico, Mictlantecutli, lord of hell, 
is a much more directly Satanic figure than any European or Asiatic ruler of the 
realms of the dead. But in some mythologies, there are frequent allusions to 
monsters who may quite easily have coloured our conception of Satan. Such is the 
Hindu serpent Ahi, and the Hebrew Leviathan, the principle of Chaos. In the 
Teutonic mythology we have the menacing shape of Loki, originally a god of fire, 
but afterwards the personification of evil. The conception of Satan, too, 
appears to have some deeply-rooted connection with the ancient serpent-worship, 
which seems to have penetrated most oriental countries. Thus we find the Tempter 
in the Old Testament in the guise of a serpent. The serpent or dragon is being 
generally regarded as the personification of night who swallows the sun and 
envelopes the world in darkness.</P>
<P>The Hebrew conception of Satan it is thought, arose in the post-exilic 
period, and exhibits traces of Babylonian or Assyrian influence. It is not 
likely that before the captivity any specific doctrine respecting evil spirits 
was held by the Hebrews. Writing on this subject, Mr. F. T. Hall in his book 
<I>The Pedigree of the Devil </I>says</P>
<P>&quot;The term 'Satan' and 'Satans' which occur in the Old Testament, are 
certainly not applicable to the modern conception of Satan as a spirit of evil; 
although it is not difficult to detect in the Old Hebrew mind a fruitful soil, 
in which the idea, afterwards evolved, would readily take root. The original 
idea of a ' Satan' is that of an 'adversary,' or agent of ' opposition.' The 
angel which is said to have withstood Balaam is in the same breath spoken of as 
'The angel of the Lord,' and a 'Satan.' When the Philistines under Achish their 
king were about to commence hostilities against the Israelites under Saul and 
David and his men were about to march with the Philistines; the latter objected, 
lest, in the day of battle, David should become a Satan' to them, by deserting 
to the enemy. When David, in later life, was returning to Jerusalem, after 
Absalom's rebellion and death; and his lately disaffected subjects were) in 
turn, making their submission; amongst them came the truculent Shimei: Abishai, 
David's nephew, one of the fierce sons of Zeruiah, advised that Shimei should be 
put to death: this grated upon David's feelings, at a time when he was filled 
with exuberant joy at his own restoration; and he rebuked Abishai as a ' Satan.' 
Again Satan is said to have provoked David to number Israel, and at the same 
time, that 'the Lord moved David to number Israel; ' a course strenuously 
opposed by Joab, another of the sons of Zeruiah. Solomon in his message to 
Hiram, king of Tyre, congratulated himself on having no ' Satans' and that this 
peaceful immunity from discord enabled him to build the Temple, which had been 
forbidden to his warlike father, David. This immunity was, not, however, 
lasting; for Hadad, the Edomite, and Regon, of Zobah, became ' Satans' to 
Solomon, after his profuse luxury had opened the way for corruption and 
disaffection. In all these cases, the idea is simply identical with the plain 
meaning of the word: a Satan is an opponent, an adversary. In the elaborate 
curse embodied in the <B>109</B>th Psalm, the writer speaks of his enemies as 
his' Satans' and prays that the object of his anathema may have' Satan' standing 
at his right hand. The Psalmist himself, in the sequel, fairly assumes the 
office of his enemy's ' Satan,' by enumerating his crimes and failings, and 
exposing them in their worst light. In the <B>71</B>st Psalm, enemies (v., lo) 
are identified with' Satans' or adversaries (v.<B>13</B>).</P>
<P>&quot;The only other places in the Old Testament where the word occurs, are 
in the Book of Job, and the prophecy of Zechariah. In the Book of Job, Satan 
appears with a distinct personality, and is associated with the sons of God, and 
in attendance with them before the throne of Jehovah. He is the cynical critic 
of Job's actions, and in that character he accuses him of insincerity and 
instability; and receives permission from Jehovah to test the justice of this 
accusation, by afflicting Job in everything he holds dear. We have here the spy, 
the informer, the public prosecutor, the executioner; all embodied in Satan, the 
adversary: these attributes are not amiable ones, but the writer does not 
suggest the absolute antagonism between Jehovah and Satan, which is a 
fundamental dogma of modern Christianity.</P>
<P>&quot;In the prophecy of Zechariah, Satan again, with an apparent 
personality, is represented as standing at the right hand of Joshua, the 
high-priest, to resist him: he seems to be claiming strict justice against one 
open to accusation; for Joshua is clothed in filthy garments-the type of sin and 
pollution. Jehovah relents, and mercy triumphs over justice: the filthy garments 
are taken away, and fair raiment substituted. Even here, the character of Satan, 
although hard, is not devoid of virtue, for it evinces a sense of 
justice.&quot;</P>
<P>The Babylonians, among whom the Hebrews dwelt during the Captivity, believed 
in the existence of vast multitudes of spirits, both good and bad, but there is 
nothing to show that the Hebrews took over from them any extensive pantheon, 
either good or evil. Indeed the Hebrew and Babylonian religions possessed many 
things in common, and there was no necessity that the captive Jews should borrow 
an animism which they probably already possessed. At the same time it is likely 
that they adopted the idea of an evil agency from their captors, and as the 
genius of their religion was averse to polytheism, the probabilities are that 
they welded the numerous evil forces of Babylonian into one central figure. 
Again, it must have occurred to them that if the world contained an evil 
principle, it could not possibly emanate from God, whom they regarded as 
all-good, and it was probably with the intention of separating all evil from God 
that the personality of Satan (having regard to the amount of evil in the 
universe) was invested with such importance.</P>
<P>In later Judaism we find the conception of Satan strongly coloured by Persian 
dualism, and it has been supposed that Asmodeus of the Book of Tobit is the same 
as Aeshara Daewa of the Ancient Persians. Both &quot;Satan&quot; and 
&quot;Satans&quot; were mentioned in the Book of Enoch, and in Ecclesiasticus he 
was identified with the serpent of Genesis, and in the&quot; Book of the Secrets 
of Enoch &quot;his revolt against God and expulsion from Heaven are described. 
In the Jewish Targinn, Samael, highest of the angels, merges with Satan into a 
single personality. </P>
<P>The Satan of the New Testament is merely a reproduction of these later Jewish 
forms. In Matthew he is alluded to as the &quot; Prince of Demons,&quot; and in 
Ephesians is spoken of as ruling over a world of evil beings who dwell in the 
lower heavens. Thus he is prince of the powers of the air. In Revelation the war 
in Heaven between God and Satan is described, and his imprisonment is 
foreshadowed after the overthrow of the Beast and the Kings of the earth, when 
he will be chained in the bottomless pit for one thousand years. After another 
period of freedom he is finally cast into the lake of brimstone for ever. 
According to the orthodox Christian belief of the present day, Satan has been 
endowed with great powers for the purpose of tempting man to prove his 
fortitude. In the middle-ages. the belief in Satan and Satanic agencies was 
overwhelming, and was inherited by Protestantism from Roman Catholicism. This is 
not the place to enter into a discussion as to the likelihood of the existence 
of an evil being, but the great consensus of theological opinion is in favour of 
such a theory.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Devil Worship :</B> (<B>1</B>).<B> </B>The worship of Satan or Lucifer. 
(<B>2</B>).<B> </B>The worship by semi-civilised or barbarous people; of deities 
having a demoniac form.</P><I>
<P>The Worship of Satan </I>or diabolism is spasmodic and occasionally epidemic. 
It dates from the early days of dualism (q.v.) and perhaps originated in the 
Persian dual system when the opposing deities Ormuzd and Ahriman symbolised the 
good and bad principles respectively. Instances of pure Satanism are 
comparatively rare, and it must not be confounded with the Sabbatic orgies of 
witchcraft which partake more of the nature of (<B>2</B>),<B> </B>or with the 
evocation of the Evil One, for the purpose of making a pact with him. Modern 
groups practising Satanism are small and obscure, and, unorganised as they are, 
details concerning them are conspicuous by their absence.</P>
<P>Plentiful details, however, are forthcoming concerning the cultus of Lucifer, 
but much discrimination is required in dealing with these, the bulk of the 
literature on the subject being manifestly imaginative and willfully misleading. 
The members of the church of Lucifer are of two groups, those who regard the 
deity they adore as the evil principle, thus approximating to the standpoint of 
the Satanists, and those who look upon him as the true god in opposition to 
Adonai or Jehovah, whom they regard as an evil deity who has with fiendish 
ingenuity miscreated the world of man to the detriment of humanity.</P>
<P>Modern diabolic literature is written from the point of view of the Roman 
Catholic Church, and much may be said for the theory that it was composed to 
subserve the necessities of that institution. But this cannot be wholly true, as 
it is a substantial fact that hosts are frequently abstracted from Catholic 
churches for the purpose of Satanic rite which requires the destruction of the 
consecrated wafer as a ritual act. In <B>1894</B> a hundred consecrated hosts 
were stolen from Notre Dame by an old woman under circumstances that clearly 
proved that the vessels which contained them were not the objects of the theft, 
and an extraordinary number of such larcencies occurred in all parts of France 
about the end of last century, no less than thirteen churches in the diocese of 
Orleans being thus despoiled. In the diocese of Lyons measures were taken to 
transform the tabernacles into strong-boxes, and in eleven of the dioceses 
similar acts were recorded. In Italy, Rome, Liguria and Solerus suffered, and 
even in the Island of Mauritius an outrage of peculiar atrocity occurred in 
<B>1895</B>. It has been asserted by many writers such as Archbishop Meurin and 
Dr. Bataille that Freemasonry is merely a mask for Satanism, that is, that in 
recent years an organisation of which the ordinary mason is ignorant has grown 
up which has diabolism for its special object. This it is asserted is recruited 
from the higher branches of masonry and initiates women. Needless to say, 
thechange is indignantly denied by masons, but it must be remembered that the 
persons who bring it are Catholics, who have a direct interest in humiliating 
the fraternity. Bataille and Margiotta have it that the order of the Palladium 
or Sovereign Council of Wisdom, was constituted in France in <B>1737</B>,<B> 
</B>and this, they infer, is one and the same as the legendary Palladium of the 
Templars, better known by the name of Baphomet (q.v.) In <B>1801</B> one Isaac 
Long, a Jew, carried the &quot;original image&quot; of Baphomet to Charleston in 
the United States, and it is alleged that the lodge he founded then became the 
chief in the Ancient and Accepted Scotch Rite. He was succeeded in due course by 
Albert Pike, who, it is alleged, extended the Scotch Rite, and shared the 
Anti-Catholic Masonic chieftainship with the Italian patriot Mazzini. This new 
directory was established, it is asserted, as the new Reformed Palladium Rite or 
the Reformed Palladium. Assisted by Gallatin Mackey, one Longfellow, Holbrook 
and a Swiss, Phileas Walder by name, Pike erected the new rite into an occult 
fraternity with world-wide powers, and practised the occult arts so well that we 
are asked to believe that the head lodge at Charleston was in constant 
communication with Lucifer I Dr. Bataille in a wholly ludicrous work <I>Le 
Diable au XIX, </I>states among other things that in <B>1881</B> his hero 
&quot;Dr. Hacks&quot; in whom his own personality is but thinly disguised, 
visited Charleston in March <B>1881</B>, where he met Albert Pike, Gallatin 
Mackey and other Satanists. Mackey showed him his <I>Arcula Mystica </I>in 
appearance like a liqueur stand, but in reality a diabolical telephone, worked 
like the Urim and Thummim. Miss Diana Vaughan, once a Palladist, Grand Mistress 
of the Temple, and Grand Inspectress of the Palladium, was converted to Roman 
Catholicism, and in <I>Memoirs of an ex-Palladist, </I>(<B>1895</B>) she has 
given an exhaustive account of her dealings with the Satanists of Charleston. 
She clamns to be descended from the alchemist Thomas Vaughan, and recounts her 
adventures with Lucifer. These are so wholly absurd that we must request freedom 
from the necessity of recounting them. There is little doubt that Miss Vaughan 
was either the victim of hallucination or else the instrument of the Roman 
Catholic Church in its attempts to brand Masonry as a vehicle of Satanism. The 
publications of Margiotta and Gabriel Pages are equally puerile, and we may 
conclude that, if Satanism and the worship of Lucifer exists, that the rites of 
their churches are carried on in such a secret manner, that few, even mystics of 
experience, can be aware of them.</P>
<P>When applied to the ceremonies of barbarous races, devil-worship is a 
misnomer, as the &quot;devils&quot; adored by them are deities in their eyes, 
and only partake of the diabolic nature in the view of missionaries and others. 
But inasmuch as the gods possess a demoniac form they may be classed as 
diabolic. Among these may be enumerated many South American and African tribes. 
The Uapes of Brazil worship Jurupari, a fiend-like deity, to whom they 
consecrate tlleir young men. His cult is invested with the utmost secrecy. The 
myth of his birth states that he was horn of a virgin who conceived after 
drinking a draught of <I>chahiri, </I>or native beer. She possessed no sexual 
parts, and could not give birth to the god until bitten by a fish whilst 
bathing. When arrived at man's estate Jurupari invited the men of the tribe to a 
drinking-bout, but the women refused to provide the liquor, and thus gained his 
ill-will. He devoured the children of the tribe because they had eaten of the 
uacu tree which was sacred to him. The men, enraged at the loss of their 
offspring, fell upon him, and cast him into a fire, from the ashes of which grew 
the <I>paxiuba </I>tree, which the Uapes say is the bones of Jurupari. Whilst it 
was night the men cut down the tree and fashioned it into sacred instruments 
which must never be seen by the women, on account of the dislike Jurupari 
conceived for them. Should a woman chance to see the' sacred symbols pertaining 
to the worship of Jurupari, she is at once poisoned. On hearing the 
&quot;Jurupari music of the priests on the occasion of one of his festivals the 
women of the tribe wildly rush into concealment, nor dare to emerge from it 
until all chance of danger is past. In all probability this custom proceeds from 
the ancient usage common to most American tribes that the rites of initiation of 
the men of the tribe must not be witnessed by the women thereof, probably on 
account of some more or less obscure totemic reason or sex-jealousy analagous to 
the exclusion of women from the rites of freemasonry, to which, strange to say, 
the worship of Jurupari bears a strong resemblance.</P>
<P>This is a good example of the &quot; <I>devil worship&quot; </I>of savage 
races. The Chinese also placate devils <I>(see </I>China) as do the people of 
Burma and Cambodia (q.v.) but in no sense can their oblations to evil spirits be 
classed as &quot;worship,&quot; any more than the gods of classic times may be 
regarded a! devils, simply because they were so labelled by early Christianity.

<P>Devil's Bridge :</B> A bridge thrown across the Afon Mynach, near 
Aberystwyth. The story goes that an old woman who had lost her cow saw it on the 
opposite side of the chasm to that on which she stood, but knew not how to reach 
it. At that juncture the Evil One appeared to her in the shape of a monk, and 
promised to throw a bridge across, if she would give him the first living thing 
that would pass over it. The old lady agreed, the bridge was completed. and the 
crafty fiend begged that she would try it. But the old woman had observed his 
cloven hoof, and knee bent backwards, so she took a crust from her pocket and 
flung it across the ravine, bidding her little dog go fetch it. The Evil One was 
outwitted, as he generally is in such tales.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Devil's Chain :</B> There is a tradition in Switzerland that St. Bernard has 
the devil chained in some mountains in the neighbourhood of the Abbey of 
Clairvanx. From this comes the custom, observed by the farmers of the country, 
of striking three blows with the hammer on the anvil every Monday morning before 
setting to work. By this means the devil's chain is strengthened, so that he may 
not escape.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Devil's Girdle, The :</B> Witches in mediaeval times were often accused of 
wearing the <I>Devil's Girdle, </I>probably as a mark of allegiance to the Evil 
One. Magical girdles were commonly worn, and a modern writer suggests that the 
magnetic belts advertised at the present day had their origin in this 
practice.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Devil's Pillar : </B>There are preserved at Prague three stones of a pillar 
which the devil brought from Rome to crush a priest, with whom he had made a 
compact, and to kill him while he said mass. But St. Peter, says the legend, 
threw the devil and his pillar into the sea three times in succession, which 
diversion gave the priest time for repentance. The devil was so chagrined that 
he broke the pillar and saved himself.</P>

<P>Devon, Witchcraft</B> <B>in</B> <B>:</B> The belief in witchcraft is not yet 
dead in Devonshire, as was shown in a curious case heard in Crediton County 
Court not many years ago, when a young woman alleged that she was given a potion 
in a grocer's shop, and that as a result, either of the draught or of the 
incantation delivered while she was in the shop, she was getting thinner every 
day. Only those who have lived long in Devon can realise the widespread belief 
that still exists ill remote corners of the county of the power of the evil 
eye,&quot; and of the credence given to all kinds of weird superstitions. &quot; 
Witches &quot; are believed to be able to exercise a malign influence even after 
death unless they are buried with their toes downwards. Not very long ago, a 
woman suspected of being a witch, was buried in this way within twenty miles of 
Tiverton. In no part of the country is witchcraft more believed in than in the 
Culm Valley. There is a local saying that there are enough witches in the valley 
to roll a hogshead of cider up the Beacon Hill, at Culmstock, and old people 
living in the locality are not ashamed to say that they believe in witchcraft. 
The witches are of two kinds-&quot; black&quot; and white.&quot; The former 
profess to have the power to condemn those on whom they are asked to cast a 
spell, to all kinds of misfortunes ; the latter impose on credulous clients by 
making them believe that they can remove evil spells and bring good fortune-for 
a consideration, of course. For obvious reasons visits to &quot; witches &quot; 
are generally kept dark, but every now and again particulars leak out. In the 
Culmstock district, not so very long ago, a young girl went with her mother to a 
witch, in order to get a spell cast over an errant swain, who was suspected of 
bestowing his affections on another young lady. The witch professed to be able 
to bring the young man back to his first love, or to condemn him to all kinds of 
torture, but her price was prohibitive, and so the young man was left to marry 
whom he would. Farmers are the witches' most profitable clients, and it is a 
noteworthy fact that they generally contrive to visit the &quot; wise woman 
&quot; when they are away from home, &quot; at market.&quot; A few years ago, 
farmers used to go to Exeter for many miles round to consult a witch whenever 
they had any misfortune, and it is commonly reported that they can get the same 
sort of advice in the city at the present day. At many farmhouses Bibles are 
kept in the dairies to prevent witches from retarding the butter-making 
operations. &quot; I'm 'witched,&quot; or &quot; I must have been 
'witched,&quot; are expressions heard in Devon every day in the week. Generally 
speaking, it is animals that are supposed to sustain the most harm from being 
&quot;overlooked.&quot; The loss of cattle that have died has been put down to 
the power of evil spirits, and according to many superstitious people, witches 
have a peculiar power over pigs. A man who believed his pigs had been bewitched 
was told, not so long ago, to take the heart of a pig, stick it full of pins and 
needles, and roast it at the fire. He did this believing this would check the 
mortality among his swine.</P>

<P>Diadochus :</B> According to Marbodneus, this gem resembles the beryl in its 
properties, and was most valuable in divination. It serves for the invocation of 
spirits, and oracular responses could be discovered in it. Albertus Magnus 
writes it Diacodos, and it is possibly to this stone that Braithwaite alludes in 
his <I>English Gentleman: </I>&quot; For as the precious stone Diacletes, though 
it have many rare and excellent sovereiguties in it, yet loseth them all if put 
in a dead man's mouth.&quot; Marbodneus mentions this in his verses as a 
property of the <I>diadochus. </I>The words of Leonardus are too curious to 
omit: ' It disturbs devils beyond all other stones, for, if it be thrown in 
water, with the words of its charm sung, it shows various images of devils, and 
gives answer to those that question it. Being held in the mouth, a man may call 
any devil out of hell, and receive satisfaction to such questions as he may 
ask.&quot; He names it Diacodas or Diacodus.</P>

<P>Diagrams, Magical (</B>See<B> Magic.)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Diakka : </B>A<B> </B>term used by Andrew Jackson Davis to signify wicked, 
ignorant, or undeveloped spirits. It is believed that at death no sudden or 
violent change takes place in the character and disposition of an individual. 
Those who are mischievous, unprincipled, sensual, during their lives remain so, 
for a time at least, after they die. Hudson Tuttle says, &quot; As the spirit 
enters the spirit world just as it leaves this, there must be an innumerable 
host of low, undeveloped, uneducated, or in other words, evil spirits.&quot; 
There is, indeed, a special sphere or plane for these <I>diakka, </I>where they 
are put on probation. It is they who are responsible for the fraud and trickery 
often witnessed at seances; they not only deceive the sitters, but the medium as 
well. The way to avoid their influence is to live a pure, refined, and religious 
life, for these evil spirits are naturally attracted to those whose minds most 
resemble their own.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Diamond :</B> This gem possesses the most marvellous virtues. It gives 
victory to him who carries it bound on his left arm whatever the number of his 
enemies. Panics, pestilences, enchantments-all fly before it; hence, it is good 
for sleep-walkers and for the insane. It deprives the lodestone of its virtue, 
and one variety, the Arabian <I>diamond, </I>is said to attract iron more 
powerfully than the magnet itself. The ancients believed that neither fire nor 
blows would overcome its hardness, unless macerated with fresh goat's blood; and 
Cyprian, Austin, Isidore, and others of the fathers, adopting this notion, have 
used it to illustrate the method by which the blood of the Cross softens the 
heart of man. If bound to a magnet, the <I>diamond, </I>according to the belief 
of the ancients, will deprive it of its virtue.</P>

<P>Dickenson, Edmund <I>:</B> Dr. Edmund Dichenson, </I>physician to King 
Charles the Second, a professed seeker of the hermetic knowledge, produced a 
book entitled, <I>De Quinta Essentia. Philosophorum; </I>which was printed at 
Oxford in <B>1686</B>, and a second time in <B>1705</B>. A third edition of it 
was printed in Germany in <B>1721</B>. <B></B>In correspondence with a French 
adept, the latter explains the reasons why the Brothers of the Rosy Cross 
concealed themselves. As to the universal medicine, Elixir Vitae, or potable 
form of the preternatural menstruum, he positively asserts that it is in the 
hands of the Illuminated,&quot; but that, by the time they discover it, they 
have ceased to desire its uses, being far above them: and as to life for 
centuries, being wishful for other things, they decline availing themselves of 
it. He adds that the adepts are obliged to conceal themselves for the sake of 
safety, because they would be abandoned in the consolations of the intercourse 
of this world (if they were not, indeed, exposed to worse risks), supposing that 
their gifts were proven to the conviction of the bystanders as more than human, 
when they would become simply abhorrent. Thus, there are excellent reasons for 
the its conduct ; they proceed with the utmost caution, and instead of making a 
display of their powers, as vain-glory is the least distinguishing 
characteristic of these great men, they studiously evade the idea that they have 
any extraordinary or separate knowledge. They live simply as mere spectators in 
the world, and they desire to make no disciples, converts nor confidants. They 
submit to the obligations of life, and to relationships-enjoying the fellowship 
of none, admiring none, following none, but themselves. They obey all codes, are 
excellent citizens, and only preserve silence in regard to their own private 
beliefs, giving the world the benefit of their acquirements up to a certain 
point; seeking only sympathy at some angles of their multiform character, but 
shutting out curiosity where they do not desire its inquisitive eyes.</P><B>

<P>Didot Perceval :</B> So-called because the only MS. of this legend discovered 
belonged to A. F. Didot, the famous collector. This version of the Grail Legend 
lays great stress on the illness of the Fisher King. It tells how the Table 
Round was constructed, and relates the adventures of Sir Perceval, which are 
much the same as those told in the <I>Conte del </I>Graal and include the Good 
Friday incident. It is said that he, with his brother-in-law, Brons, were 
instructed in the mystic expressions which Christ whispered to Joseph of 
Arimathea when on the cross.</P>

<P>Direct Writing : </B>A<B> </B>term used in spiritualism for spirit writing 
which is produced <I>directly, </I>and not by the hand of a medium, or through a 
mechanical contrivance such as a psycho-graph or planchette.. The best known 
form of <I>direct writing </I>is that made popular by the mediums Slade and 
Eglinton-slate-writing (q.v.) But the spirits are not dependent solely on 
prepared materials, but can produce <I>direct </I>writing anywhere, and under 
any circumstances. Thus during a poltergeist disturbance at Stratford; Conn., in 
<B>1850</B>-<B>51, </B><I>direct writing </I>was found on turnips which sprang 
apparently from nowhere. An unfinished letter left for a few moments would he 
found completed in a different hand, though during the interval it might have 
been inaccessible to any normal agency. <I>Direct writing </I>may also be 
produced at spiritualistic seances, either by means of slate-writing. or by 
putting scraps of paper and pencil into a sealed drawer or a closed box. A sound 
as of writing will shortly be heard, and on the paper being withdrawn it will be 
found to contain some sort of message from the spirit world. Experiments on 
these lines were carried out by a noted spiritualist, Baron de Guldenstubbe, in 
<B>1856</B>. Paper and pencil he locked in a small box, the key of which he 
carried about with him. At the end of thirteen days he found some writing on the 
paper; and on that same day the experiment was repeatedly performed, each time 
with success. Another method he adopted was to visit galleries, churches, and 
other public places, and to leave writing materials on the pedestals of statues, 
on tombs, and <B>50</B> on. In this way he obtained writing in English, French, 
German, Latin, Greek, and other languages purporting to come from Plato, Cicero, 
St. Paul, Juvenal, Spencer, and Mary Stuart. The Baron was accompanied on these 
expeditions by the Comte d'Ourches and others of his friends, while on one 
occasion a medium is mentioned as being present. It is probable, indeed, that a 
medium was essential to these spirit performances; for, though the medium's 
physical organism is not used as an agent, the writings generally take place in 
the vicinity of one gifted with supernormal faculties. Not only is legible 
hand-writing produced in this way; sometimes mysterious hieroglyphs are 
inscribed, which can only be deciphered by those who possess mediumistic 
powers.</P><B>

<P>Dithorba : </B>Brother of Red Hugh and Kimbay of Irish medieval legend. He 
was killed by his niece Macha, and his five sons expelled from Ulster. They 
resolved to wrest the sovereignty of Ireland from Macha, but she discovers them 
in the forest, overpowers them by her mesmeric influence, and carries them to 
her palace on her back. They build the famous Irish city of Emain Macha under 
her supervision.</P>

<P>Divination :</B> The method of obtaining knowledge of the unknown or the 
future by means of omens. Astrology (q.v.), and oracular utterances <I>(See 
</I><B>Oracles</B>), may be regarded as branches of <I>divination. </I>The 
derivation of the word supposes a direct message from the gods to the diviner or 
augur. It is practised in all grades of barbarism and civilisation. The methods 
of <I>divination </I>are many and various, and strangely enough in their variety 
are confined to no one portion of the globe. Crystal-gazing has been relegated 
to a separate article. Shell-hearing and similar methods are allied to 
crystal-gazing and may be classed with it, as that method of <I>divination 
</I>which arises from the personal consciousness of the augur. Of the same class 
are <I>divination </I>by dreams, automatic writing, and so forth. What might be 
called <I>divination </I>by &quot; luck&quot; is represented by the use of 
cards, the casting of lots, the use of knuckle-hones as in Africa and elsewhere, 
cocoanuts as in Polynesia. Haruspication, or the inspection of entrails, 
<I>divination </I>by foot-print in ashes, by the flight of birds, by meeting 
with ominous animals, represents the third class of augury.</P>
<P>The art of <I>divination </I>is usually practised among savages by the shaman 
caste; among less barbarous people by the augur, as in Rome and ancient Mexico; 
and even amongst civilised people by persons who pretend to <I>divination, 
</I>such as the spiritualistic medium or the witch. The art is undoubtedly of 
great antiquity. It was employed in ancient Egypt side by side with astrology, 
and <I>divination </I>by dream was constantly resorted to, a class of priests 
being kept apart, whose office it was to interpret dreams and visions. We find 
instances of dreams recorded in the Egyptian texts: as for example those of 
Thothmes IV. king of Egypt in <B>1450 </B>B.C.; and Nut-Amen, king of the 
Eastern Soudan and Egypt about <B>670</B> B.C. The Egyptian magician usually set 
himself to procure dreams for his clients by such devices as the drawing of 
magical pictures and the reciting of magical words ; and some of these are still 
extant, such as that in the British Museum papyrus NO.<B>122</B>.<B> </B>We 
find, however, that in Egypt augury was usually effected by astrological 
methods.</P>
<P>In ancient China the principal method of <I>divination </I>was by means of 
the oracles; but we find such forms as the examination of the marks on the shell 
of a tortoise, which reminds us of the examination of the back of a peccary by 
the Maya of Central America. We find a Chinese monarch consulting the fates in 
this manner in <B>1146</B> B.C. and finding them unfavourable; but as in Egypt, 
most soothsaying was accomplished by means of astrology. Omens, however, were by 
no means ignored, and were given great prominence, as many tales in the ancient 
books testify.</P>
<P>In ancient Rome a distinct caste or college of priests called Augurs was set 
apart to interpret the signs of approval or disapproval sent by the gods in 
reference to any coming event. This college probably consisted originally of but 
three members, of whom the king himself was one; and it was not until the time 
of Caesar that the members were increased to sixteen. The college remained in 
existence as late as the fourth century, and its members held office for life. 
The tenets of the Roman augurs were, that for signs of the gods one must look 
towards the sky and glean knowledge of the behests of the divine beings from 
such omens as the lightning-flash, and the flight of birds. On a windless night, 
the augur took up his position on a hill which afforded an extensive view. 
Marking out a space for himself, he pitched a tent within it, and seating 
himself therein with covered head requested the gods for a sign, and waited for 
an answer. He faced southwards, thus having the east, or lucky quarter, on his 
left, and the west, or unfavourable portion of the sky, on his right. He 
carefully observed every sign which came within the purview of his vision: such 
as lightning, the appearance of birds, and so forth. The song or utterance of 
birds was also carefully hearkened to; and these were divided into birds of good 
omen and evil omen: while others referred to definite persons and events. The 
reading of omens was also effected by the feeding of birds and observing the 
manner in which they ate. The course of animals and the sounds uttered by them 
were also closely watched, and all unusual phenomena were regarded as omens or 
warnings. Sortilege or the casting of lots was often resorted to by the caste of 
augurs. The election of magistrates was nearly always referred to the Auspices 
or College of Diviners, as were the setting out of an army for war, and the 
passing of laws.</P>
<P>In the East generally, <I>divination </I>appears to have been effected by 
crystal-gazing, dreams. and similar methods of self-hallucination, or 
self-hypnotism. <I>Divination </I>flourished in Chaldea and Assyria among the 
Babylonians and Ethiopians, and appears to have been very much the same as in 
Egypt. In the Jewish <I>Talmud </I>we notice that witches are said to divine by 
means of bread-crumbs. Among The Arabs, the future is often foretold by means of 
the shapes seen in sand. The Burmese and Siamese. pierce an egg at each end, and 
having blown the contents on the ground, trace within them the outline of things 
to be. <I>(See </I>Burma.) </P><I>
<P>Divination </I>by astrology too is very common in oriental countries, and 
prophetic utterance is likewise in great favour.</P>
<P>It is remarkable that among the native races of America. the same arts of 
<I>divination </I>as are known to the peoples of the Old World were and are in 
vogue. These arts, as a rule, are the preserve of the medicine-man and priestly 
class. In ancient Mexico there was a college of augurs corresponding in purpose 
to the Auspices of ancient Rome, the members of which occupied themselves with 
observing the flight and listening to the songs of birds. from which they drew 
their conclusions. in Mexico, the <I>Calmecac </I>or college of priests had a 
department where divination was taught in all its branches, but there were many 
of <I>officio </I>prophets and augurs, and the reader is referred to the article 
on Mexico for an account of the astrological. methods of casting nativities, and 
so forth. Oracles were. common, and in this connection an amusing Peruvian story 
may be recalled. A certain <I>huaca </I>or oracle was reported to be of evil 
influence orders were given to. destroy it; and upon its being broken up a 
parrot found means to escape from within it,-thus giving us a pretty shrewd idea 
of the means employed by the priesthood to effect oracular utterance. In Peru, 
still other classes of diviners predicted by means of the leaves of tobacco, or 
the grains or juice of coca, the shapes of grains of maize, taken at random, the 
forms assumed by the smoke rising from burning victims, the viscera of animals, 
the course taken by spiders, and the direction in which fruits might fall. The 
professors of these several methods were distinguished by different ranks and 
titles, and their training was a long and arduous one. The American tribes as a 
whole were very keen observers of bird life. Strangely enough the bird and 
serpent are combined in their symbolism, and indeed in the names of several of 
their principal deities. The bird appeared to the American savage as a spirit, 
in all probability under the spell of some potent enchanter-a spell which might 
be broken by some great sorcerer or medicine man alone. As among the ancient 
Romans, the birds of America were divided into those of good and evil omen; and 
indeed certain Brazilian tribes appear to think that the souls of departed 
Indians enter into the bodies of birds. The shamans of certain tribes of 
Paraguay act as go-betweens between the members of their tribes and such birds 
as they imagine enshrine the souls of their departed relatives. This usage would 
appear to combine the acts of augury and necromancy.</P>
<P>The priesthood of Peru practised oracular methods by &quot;making idols 
speak,&quot; and this they probably accomplished by ventriloquial arts. The 
<I>piages </I>or priests of the Uapes of Brazil have a contrivance known to them 
as the <I>paxiuba, </I>which consists of a tree-stem about the height of a man, 
on which the branches and leaves have been left. Holes are bored in the trunk 
beneath the foliage, and by speaking through these the leaves are made to 
tremble, and the sound so caused is interpreted as a message from Jurupari one 
of their principal deities. But all over the American continent from the Eskimos 
to the Patagonians, the methods of oracular <I>divination </I>are practically 
identical. The shaman or medicine-man raises a tent or hut which he enters 
carefully closing the aperture after him. He then proceeds to make his 
incantations, and in a little while the entire lodge trembles and rocks, the 
poles bend to breaking point, as if a dozen strong men were straining at them, 
and the most violent noise comes from within, seemingly now emanating from the 
depths of the earth, now from the air above, and now from the vicinity of the 
hut itself. The reason for this disturbance has never been properly accounted 
for; and medicine-men who have been converted to Christianity have assured 
scientific workers amongst Indian tribes that they have not the least idea of 
what occurred during the time they occupied these enchanted lodges, for the 
simple reason that they were plunged in a deep sleep. After the supernatural 
sounds have to some extent faded away, the medicine-man proceeds to question The 
spirit he has evoked,-the answers of whom for sheer ambiguity are equal to those 
of the Pythonesses of ancient Greece. There is little doubt that the shamans who 
practise this method of oracular utterance are the victims of hallucination, and 
many cases are on record in which they have excited themselves into a condition 
of permanent lunacy.</P>
<P>America is the touchstone of the science of anthropology, and since we have 
adopted it as the continent from which to draw the majority of our 
illustrations, it will be as well if we conclude the article on American lines 
for the sake of comparison. We find then that <I>divination </I>by hypnosis is 
well-known in the western continent. Jonathan Carver, who travelled among the 
Sioux about the latter end of the eighteenth century, mentions it as in use 
amongst them. The &quot; Ghost Dance&quot; religion of the Indians of Nevada had 
for one of its tenets the belief in hypnotic communion with the dead. 
<I>Divination </I>by means of dreams and visions is extremely common in both 
sub-continents of the western hemisphere, as is exemplified by the derivation of 
the word priest &quot;in the native languages: by the Algonquians they are 
called &quot;dreamers of the gods,&quot; by the Maya &quot; listeners,&quot; and 
so forth. The ability to see visions was usually quickened by the use of drugs 
or the swallowing or inhalation of cerebral intoxicants, such as tobacco, 
<I>maguey, </I>coca, the snake-plant, and so forth. Indeed many Indian tribes, 
such as the Creeks, possessed numerous plants which they cultivated for this 
purpose. A large number of instances are on record in which Indian medicine-men 
are said to have divined the future in a most striking manner, and perhaps the 
following will serve to illustrate this</P>
<P>In his autobiography, Black Hawk, a celebrated Sac chief, relates that his 
grandfather had a strong belief that in four years' time ' he should see a white 
man, who would be to him as a father.' Supernaturally directed, as he said, he 
travelled eastward to a certain spot, and there, as he had been informed in 
dreams, met with a Frenchman who concluded an alliance on behalf of his country 
with the Sac nation. Coincidence is certainly possible here, but it can hardly 
exist in the circumstances of Jonathan Carver. While he was dwelling with the 
Killistenoes, they were threatened with a famine, and on the arrival of certain 
traders, who brought them food in exchange for skins and other goods, their very 
existence depended. The diviners of the tribe were consequently consulted by</P>
<P>the chief, and announced that the next day, at high noon exactly, a canoe 
would make its appearance with news of the anxiously looked-for expedition. The 
entire population came down to the beach in order to witness its arrival, 
accompanied by the incredulous trader, and, to his intense surprise, at the very 
moment forecasted by the shamans, a canoe rounded a distant headland, and, 
paddling speedily shorewards, brought the patient Killistenoes news of the 
expedition they expected.</P>
<P>John Mason Brown has put on record an equally singular instance of the 
prophetic gift on the part of an American medicine-man. <I>(See Atlantic 
Monthly, </I>July, <B>1866</B>.) He was engaged several years previously in 
searching for a band of Indians in the neighbourhood of the Mackenzie and 
Coppermine rivers ; but the difficulties of the search induced the majority of 
his band to return, until out of ten men who originally set out only three 
remained. They had all but concluded to abandon their search when they stumbled 
upon a party of braves of the very tribe of which they were in search. These men 
had been sent out by their medicine-men to find three whites, of whose horses, 
accoutrements, and general appearance the shaman had given them an exhaustive 
account ere they set out, and this the warriors related to Brown before they saw 
his companions. Brown very naturally inquired closely of the medicine-man how he 
had been able to foretell their coming. But the latter, who appeared to be a 
frank and simple-minded man,' could only explain that 'he saw them coming, and 
heard them talk on their journey.</P>
<P>Crystal-gazing is in common use amongst many Indian tribes. The Aztecs of 
Mexico were wont to gaze into small polished pieces of sandstone, and a case is 
on record where a Cherokee Indian kept a divining crystal wrapped up in buckskin 
in a cave, occasionally &quot;feeding&quot; it by rubbing over it the blood of a 
deer. At a village in Guatemala, Stephens saw a remarkable stone which had been 
placed on the altar of the church there, but which had previously been used as a 
divining-stone by the Indians of the district. <I>Divination </I>by arrow was 
also commonly resorted to.</P>
<P>According to Fuentes, the chronicler of Guatemala the reigning king of Kiche, 
Kicah Tanub, when informed by the ambassador of Montezuma II. that a race of 
irresistible white men had conquered Mexico and were proceeding to Guatemala, 
sent for four diviners, whom he commanded to tell him what would be the result 
of this invasion. They asked for time to discover the future fate of his 
kingdom, and taking their bows discharged some arrows against a rock. They 
returned to inform their master that, as no impression had been made upon the 
rock by the arrowheads, they must prognosticate the worst and predicted the 
ultimate triumph of the white man-a circumstance which shows that the class to 
which they belonged stood in no fear of royalty. Kicah Tanub, dissatisfied, sent 
for the ' priests,' obviously a different class from the diviners, and requested 
their opinions. From the ominous circumstance of an ancient stone - which had 
been brought from afar by their forefathers-having been broken, they also 
augured the fall of the Kiche empire.</P>
<P>Many objects such as small clay birds, boats or boat-shaped vessels, etc., 
have been discovered in sepulchral mounds in North America, and it is 
conjectured that these may have been used for purposes of <I>divination. </I>As 
any object might become a fetish, it is probable that any object might become a 
means of augury. The method employed appears to have been so to treat the object 
that the probable chances for or against the happening of a certain event would 
be discovered-much, indeed, as some persons will toss coins to &quot; find 
out&quot; whether an expected event will come to pass or not. Portents, too, 
were implicitly believed in by the American races, and this branch of augury 
was, we <I>find, </I>one of the accomplishments of Nezahualpilli, king of 
Tercuco, near Mexico, whom Montezuma consulted concerning the terrible prodigies 
which startled his people prior to the advance of the Spaniards upon his 
kingdom, and which were supposed to predict the return of Quetzacloatl, the 
legendary culture-hero of Anahuac, to his own again. These included earthquakes, 
tempests, floods, the appearances of comets and strange lights, whilst 
mysterious voices were heard in the air-such prodigies, indeed, as tradition 
usually insists upon as the precursors of the downfall of a mighty empire.</P>
<P>The various methods of <I>divination </I>have each been accorded a separate 
article : thus the reader is referred to Axinomancy, Belomancy, Capnomaney, and 
so forth; and in the articles dealing with the various countries a goodly number 
of instances of divinatory practice will be discovered.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Divine Name, The :</B> In Jewish mysticism great stress is laid upon the 
importance of the <I>Divine Name. </I>It consists of forty-two letters ; not, as 
Moses Maimonides points out, comprised in one word, but in a phrase of several 
words, which conveyed an exact notion of the essence of God. With the priestly 
decadence in the last days of the Temple, a name of twelve letters was 
substituted for the <I>Divine Name, </I>and as time went on even this secondary 
name was not divulged to every priest, but only to a few. The longer name was 
sometimes said to contain forty-five or seventy-two letters. The ten Sefiroth 
are also supposed, in a mystical sense, to be the names of the Deity. The 
<I>Divine Name Jahveh </I>is greater than &quot; I am that I am, since the 
latter signifies God as He was before the creation, the Absolute, the 
Unknowable, the Hidden One; but the former denotes the Supreme Manifestation, 
the immanence of God in the Cosmos.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Divine World :</B> Formerly known as the Adi Plane-is in the theosophic 
scheme of things, the first or highest world, (in Theosophy) the world first 
formed by the divine impulse in the creative process. It is unattainable by man 
in his present state. <I>(See </I>Theosophy and Solar System.)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Divining Rod :</B> A forked rod, or branch of tree, which in the hands of 
certain people is said to indicate, by means of spasmodic movements of varying 
intensity, the presence of water and minerals underground. Traces of the rod 
used for purposes of divination are to be found in the records of Ancient Egypt. 
Cicero and Tacitus both wrote of the rod &quot;virgule divina.&quot; This 
ancient <I>diviing rod </I>was a form of rhabdomancy (q.v.) or divination by 
means of little pieces of stick. In Germany it was known as the 
&quot;wishing-rod&quot; and was used just as fortune-tellers use cards, coffee 
or tea-grounds at the present day. Agricola's <I>De Re Metallica </I>published 
at Basle, at the beginning of the sixteenth century, makes reference to another 
rod which be calls the virgula furcata,&quot; the forked, rod to distinguish it 
from the &quot; virgula divina.&quot; This rod, he said, was used by miners to 
discover mineral lodes; rhabdomancy having nothing to do with this use of the 
<I>divining rod. </I>Melancthon mentions this use of the rod and ascribed the 
behaviour of the&quot; instrument&quot; in the discovery of metallic ores to the 
law of sympathy, according to the belief then obtaining that metals, trees and 
other natural objects had certain subtle relationships with each other; and 
believers in this theory pointed to the fact that trees which grew above mineral 
lodes droop as though attracted downwards; the modern scientific explanation of 
this natural phenomenon being that it is due to the poverty of the soil. In 
Sebastian Minister's <I>Cosmography, </I>also of the sixteenth century, may be 
found engravings of these &quot;mineral diviners &quot; at work. The priests of 
that time persecuted them as demons in disguise; they were also included in the 
witchcraft persecutions, suffering tortures and burning</P>
<P>to death. Among miners on the Continent the use of the &quot;virgula 
furcata&quot; became universal, especially in the Harz Mountains and throughout 
Saxony. In Germany it was called the Schlag-Ruthe, &quot; striking-rod&quot; 
from the fact of its appearing to strike when held over mineral ores.</P>
<P>Robert Boyle, the ' father of chemistry&quot; is the first to make mention of 
the <I>divining rod </I>in England. In an essay of his published in <B>1663</B> 
may be found the following</P>
<P>&lsquo;A forked hazel twig is held by its horns, one in each hand, the holder 
walking with it over places where mineral lodes may be suspected, and it is said 
that the fork by dipping down will discover the place where the ore is to be 
found. Many eminent authors, amongst others our distinguished countryman Gabriel 
Plat, ascribe much to this detecting wand, and others, far from credulous or 
ignorant, have as eye-witnesses spoken of its value. When visiting the 
lead-mines of Somersetshire I saw its use, and one gentleman who employed it 
declared that it moved without his will, and I saw it bend so strongly as to 
break in his hand. It will only succeed in some men's hands, and those who have 
seen it may much more readily believe than those who have not.&quot; Some 
authorities on the subject state that it was first brought into England in the 
time of Queen Elizabeth. In the State papers of that reign may be found recorded 
the fact that commissioners were sent to Germany to study the best methods of 
mining and brought back with them German miners from the Harz Mountains; and 
that these &quot; foreigners introduced the <I>divining rod </I>into England 
seems highly probable. It was first used for water finding, however in Southern 
France, and not until a century later was it used in England for this purpose. 
It became the ' dowsing rod in England and Somersetshire might be called the 
home of the ' dowser.&quot; Locke the philosopher, a Somersetshire man referred 
in <B>1691 </B>to the dowsing rod and De Quincey, also belonging to the county, 
tells of singular cases of &quot; jousers &quot; as he calls them. Down to the 
present day this means of finding water is used, farmers and owners of large 
estates sending for a &quot;dowser&quot; when they wish to find a spring of 
water. These men are not geologists, who might have a scientific knowledge of 
the locality, they are often merely labourers. The rods are mostly cut from the 
hazel, but all kinds of nut and fruit trees have been used, white and black 
thorn and privet also being favourites. Pieces of watch-spring and copper-wire 
are also used ; and in some cases the forked rod is dispensed with, the peculiar 
sensation felt in the arms, hands and body being sufficient to indicate the 
water. These dowsers wander over the ground with the ends of the fork grasped in 
the palms of the hands and the rod downwards and when this moves, turning 
suddenly in his hand, upwards, it is said for water, downwards for minerals, at 
that spot will be found the desired object, absolute correctness frequently 
bring achieved. In later years attempts have been made to scientifically 
investigate the question and amongst amateur &quot; dowsers&quot; we find the 
names of Lord Ferrer and the late Mr. Andrew Lang. As to the theory for these 
movements the electrical or magnetic theory was exploded by Father Kircher in 
<B>1654</B> who balanced the rod on a frictionless support like a delicate pair 
of scales and found that in this position nothing would induce it to move over 
hidden water or metal. It must be held by some human being before the movements 
take place. Chevreul, the French savant, in <B><I>1854</B> </I>put forward the 
theory of involuntary muscular action. A modern scientist gives his opinion that 
very possibly it is due to a faculty in the &quot; dowser&quot; akin to that 
possessed by a medium: &quot; some transcendental perceptive power unconsciously 
possessed by certain persons, a faculty analogous to what is called 
clairvoyance. Not exactly to be described as ' clear-seeing' but rather, a dim, 
obscure impression not reaching the brain through the organ of vision, seldom 
ever rising to the level of a conscious impression, but one able to start the 
nervous reflex action which caused the muscles to twitch and the rod or other 
&lsquo;autoscope' to move. Doubtless, changes of blood pressure and pulse rate 
also occur in the dowser and if this be so, quite possibly modern instrumental 
appliances for recording these will ultimately supersede the primitive forked 
<I>twig.&quot; </I>He goes on to say that: &quot; The dowser' in fact, 'feels 
for ' and subconsciously discerns the hidden object, whether it be water, hidden 
treasure or even a malefactor concealing himself from justice, who was pursued 
and discovered by the agency of the famous dowser Jacques Aymar, using his 
supernormal powers in <B>1692.&quot; </B><I>See </I>Sir W. F. Barrett F.R.S.

<P>Divs :</B> The <I>div </I>of ancient Persia, pronounced <I>deo, den, </I>or 
<I>dive, </I>is supposed to be the same as the European devil of the middle 
ages. In the romances of Persia they are represented as male and female, but the 
male <I>divs </I>are considered the more dangerous, and it is from their 
character, personified in a supposed chief, that the devil is painted with his 
well-known attributes. The male <I>divs, </I>according to the legends of Persia, 
were entrusted with the government of the world for seven thousand years 
anterior to the creation of Adam, and they were succeeded by the female <I>divs 
</I>or pens, who under their chief, Gian ben Gian, ruled other two thousand 
years. The dominion of the pens was terminated by Eblis (the devil of the Koran) 
who had been created from the elements of fire, and whose abode was previously 
with the angels. Eblis or Hans, as he is also called,. became the leader of the 
rebellious angels when they were commanded to do homage to the first created 
man, and being joined by the whole race of genii, the male and female <I>divs, 
</I>whom he had formerly subjugated, he was like them deprived of grace. Eblis 
and his immediate followers were condemned to suffer for a long period in the 
infernal regions, but the remainder were allowed to wander over the earth, a 
constant source of misery to themselves and to the human race, whose obedience 
is put to the test by their devices, and secured by the example of their 
degradation and sufferings. They are supposed to assume various forms, 
especially that of the serpent, and in the drawings annexed to the Persian 
romances they are represented much as our own devils, ogres, and giants, in the 
tales of the middle ages. The writers of the later ages, both Arabian and 
Persian, have localised the abode of these evil genii in the mountain Kaf their 
capital is Aherman-abad, the abode of Aherman their chief, who is identified 
with the Ahremanes of the Manicheans, that remarkable sect being said to have 
borrowed their doctrines from Zoroaster. The distinction of sex is a remarkable 
characteristic of the <I>divs, </I>and its evil results in a system of diabolic 
superstition may be read in the stories of the Ephialtae and Hyphialtae, or 
nightmare.</P>
<P>Evidently the same in origin as the Persian <I>dius; </I>are the daivers of 
the Hindoos, who inhabit a world which is called, after them, Daiver-Logum. We 
may borrow a brief account of them from Kindersicy's <I>Specimens of Hindon 
Literature. &quot; </I>The daivers,&quot; he says, &quot; perpetually recur in 
their romances, and other literary works, and are represented as possessing not 
only material bodies, but as being subject to human frailties. Those saints and 
heroes who may not as yet be considered worthy of the paradises of Shivven or of 
Veeshnoo, are represented as inhabiting the Daiver-Logum (or Sorgum). These 
daivers are in number no less than three hundred and thirty, millions. The 
principal are- <B>1</B>..' Daivuntren ' or Indiren their king; to whom report is 
made of all that happens among them. His court of audience is so capacious as 
to</P>
<P>contain not only the numerous daivers, but also the prophets, attendants, 
etc. They are represented in the mythological romances of the Hindoos, as having 
been engaged in bloody wars) and with various success against the giants 
(Assoores). The family of Daivuntren consists of his wife Inderaunee,' and his 
son ' Seedera-budderen' (born from a cow), who records the actions of men, by 
which they ave finally to he judged. II. The attendants or companions of these 
daivers are-I. The 'Kinnarer,' who sing and play on musical instruments. <B>2. ' 
</B>Dumbarim Nardir,' who also perform on a species of drum. <B>3</B>. ' 
Kimprusher,' who wait on the daivers and are represented with the wings and fair 
countenances of angels. <B>4</B>. ' Kunda-gaindoorer,' similar winged beings who 
execute the mandates of Veeshnoo. <B>5</B>. ' Paunner' a species of jugglers, 
who amuse the daivers with snake dancing, etc. <B>6</B>. &lsquo;Viddiaser,' 
their bards, who are acquainted with all arts and sciences, and entertain them 
with their histories and discourses. <B>7</B>. ' Tsettee,' who attend them in 
their aerial journeys. <B>8</B>. ' Kanuanader,' or ' Dovdanks,' messengers, who 
conduct the votaries of Veeshnoo and Shivven to their respective paradises, and 
the wicked to hell (Narekah), of which ' Eemen' is sovereign. III. The third 
class of daivergoel, daivers, or genii, are the eight keepers of the eight sides 
of the world, literally signified by their general name of ' 
Aushtatikcu-Pauligaur; they are-I. ' Indiren,' who is no other than Daivuntren, 
named above. <B>2.' </B>Augne-Baugauven,' the god of fire. <B>3</B>. 'Femen' 
king of death and the infernal regions. <B>4</B>. ' Nerudee,' the element of 
earth represented under the figure of a giant. <B>5</B>. Vaivoo,' god of air and 
winds. <B>6</B>. ' Varoonen,' god of clouds and rain. <B>7</B>. 'Gooberen,' god 
of riches. <B>8</B>. 'Essaunien,' or Shivven himself, in one of his 
<B>1</B>,<B>008</B> appearances on earth.&quot; To these principal daivers, 
Kindersley adds without sufficient reason the ' Reeshees' of the Hindoos, and 
their tutelary god of virtue, &quot; Derma-Daive.&quot;</P>
<P>For the true oriental doctrine of these evil genii the <I>Zend-Avesta </I>may 
be consulted, which associates the idea of evil more especially with the pens or 
female <I>divs, </I>contrary to the later romances of Islamism. This anomaly 
reappears in our own fairy tales, the same characters, which at times, are 
invested with the most malignant attributes, being often described under forms 
of sylph-like grace and beauty.</P>

<P>Djemscheed, The Cup of :</B> A divination cup, which has been the subject of 
many of the poems and myths of ancient Persia. It was believed to have been 
found while digging the foundations of Persepolis, filled with the elixir of 
immortality. In this magical cup was mirrored the whole world, and everything, 
good and evil, was revealed therein. The Persians had great faith in these 
revelations; and attributed the prosperity of their empire to the possession of 
this famous cup.</P>

champions were out hunting one day, and followed a beautiful faun until it 
vanished under ground. Seeking shelter in a noble mansion, they were entertained 
by <I>Donn mac Midir </I>and his brother; and their aid was asked against the 
rest of the Danaan folk. It seems that thrice in the year they had to fight 
their fairy foes, and all their followers had been killed excepting the 
eight-and-twenty warriors themselves. The faun which they had followed had been 
an enchanted maiden sent to entice them. After a year of successful fighting, 
the Danaans were obliged to make peace.</P>

<P>Draconites :</B> otherwise dentrites, draconius, or obsianus, is described by 
Albertus Magnus as a shining black stone of pyramidal figure. It is not<B> 
</B>very easy to obtain, as it must be taken out of the head of a dragon, cut 
off while the beast is still panting. It subdues all sorts of poison, and endows 
its possessor with invincible courage. The kings of the East esteemed it a great 
treasure.</P><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Dragon :</B> A purely fabulous monster of enormous size, common to almost all 
countries. Descriptions of its appearance vary; but it appears to have been of a 
reptilian nature. often of a red or green colour, sometimes with several heads 
which vomited forth fire and vapours, and a large and clumsy tail. It was of 
enormous strength; but the ancients believed that it could be charmed by music, 
and the <I>dragon </I>which guarded the golden fleece was soothed by the voice 
of Medea. In India at the time of Alexander the Great, a <I>dragon </I>was 
worshipped as a god; and in occult history it is the manifestation of hell. The 
<I>dragon, </I>however, is best known in legendary history as the terrible 
monster, whose duty it was to provide the hero with opportunities of valour, and 
in this capacity it has figured in many a tale. The legend of St. George and the 
Dragon is familiar to everyone, and also the <I>dragon </I>that was slain by Sir 
Lancelot, one of the knights of King Arthur's Round Table. In Revelation the 
<I>dragon, </I>a representation of the Evil One, is overcome by the Archangel 
Michael. On one side of the coin given to those who were cured of possession, 
about the time of Henry VII., there was portrayed an angel standing with both 
feet on a <I>dragon. </I>The idea of the dragon is perhaps evolved from the 
conception of the earth, as a living being, a notion which would gain currency 
from Earthquake and related phenomena.</P><B>

<P>Dreams :</B> The occult significance of <I>dreams </I>was a matter of 
speculation among the wise at an early period in the history of civilisation. In 
the articles upon Babylonia and Egypt we have to some extent outlined the 
methods by which the wise men of those countries divined the future from visions 
seen in sleep, and to these we must refer the reader, as well as to the articles 
dealing with other countries, savage and civilised, where he will discover a 
good deal of data relating to <I>dreams </I>and dream-lore. In this place we can 
only indicate some of the more outstanding theories of antiquity regarding the 
nature and causes of <I>dreams </I>and the manner in which the ancient diviners 
generally interpreted them.</P><I>
<P>Dreams </I>were regarded as of two kinds-false and true, in either case 
emanating from a supernatural intelligence, evil or good. By the ancients sleep 
was regarded as a second life, in which the soul was freed from the body and 
therefore much more active than during the waking state. The acts it observed 
and the scenes through which it passed were thought to have a bearing on the 
future life of the dreamer, but it is possible that the dream-life was regarded 
as supernatural and &quot;inverted,&quot; and that the events which the bodiless 
spirit beheld were the opposites of those which would later occur on the 
earth-plane. The idea thus originated that <I>&quot;dreams </I>go by 
contraries,&quot; as both popular belief, and the many treatises upon the 
subject of nightly visions assure us is the case.</P>
<P>However the belief in the divinatory character of <I>dreams </I>arose, there 
is every proof that their causes and nature exercised some of the greatest minds 
of antiquity. Aristotle believed them to arise solely from natural causes. 
Posidonius the Stoic was of the opinion that they were of three kinds, the first 
automatic, and coming from the clear sight of the soul, the second from spirits 
and the third from God. Cratippus, Democritus, and Pythagoras held doctrines 
almost identical or differing only in detail, Later, Macrobus divided <I>dreams 
</I>into five kinds: the dream, the vision, the ocular dream, the insomnium and 
the phantasm. The first is a figurative and mysterious representation which 
requires an interpretation ; the second was an exact representation of a future 
event in sleep; the third was a dream representing some priest or divinity, who 
declared to the sleeper things to come; the fourth was an ordinary <I>dream 
</I>not deserving of attention, and the fifth was a disturbed half-awake 
<I>dream, </I>a species of nightmare. Other writers divide <I>dreams </I>into 
accidental <I>dreams </I>and those which were induced for the purposes of 
divination. We are told by Herodotus that in the temple of Bel in Babylon a 
priestess lay on a bed ready to dream visions of the second class, and that the 
beds of such soothsayers were often made of the skin of a ram is well known. The 
ancient Hebrews obtained such <I>dreams </I>by sleeping among tombs, and this 
especial gateway to the supernatural world seems to have been, and still is 
known to the majority of nations, barbarous and the reverse, as intimately as 
hypnotic and other methods of reaching its, planes and hearing its 
pronouncements. Sleep was, of course, often induced by drugs. whether the soma 
of the Hindoos, the peyollotl of the ancient Mexicans, the haschish of the 
Arabs, or the opium of the Malays or Chinese, and these narcotics which have the 
property of inducing speedy sleep and of heightening inward vision were and are 
greatly prized by professional dreamers all over the world, especially as they 
rendered dreaming almost immediately possible.</P>
<P>With .the nature of ecstatic vision we have dealt under the heading of 
Hypnotism and now that we have outlined the older theories regarding the cause 
and nature of <I>dreams </I>(for with the modern and purely physiological 
theories on the subject we have no concern in this place), we may pass on to 
consider the methods by which <I>dreams </I>were read or divined. As has been 
remarked, this was generally undertaken by a special class of diviners, who in 
ancient Greece were known as Oneiocritikoi, or interpreters of dreams. The first 
treatise on the subject is that of Artemidorus, who lived in the time of 
Antoninus Pius. He differentiates between the <I>dreams </I>of Kings and those 
of commoners, as he believes that the visions of royalty must have reference to 
the commonwealth and nut to the individual. Dreams which represent something as 
happening to the individual who <I>dreams </I>them show that they have a 
personal significance, whereas if the <I>dream </I>relates to another it will 
concern him alone. He details the numerous species of <I>dreams </I>throughout 
five hooks, and then adduces numerous exam-pies. Neither for rule nor 
illustration have we any space here, and indeed, the literature, popular and 
otherwise, which treats of oneiromancy is so extensive and so readily accessible 
that no necessity arises for so doing. Suffice it to say that the rules of 
Artemidorus are far from clear, and according to them, any dream might signify 
any event, and any interpretation of the same might be considered justifiable. 
The method of testing <I>dreams </I>according to Amyraldus is his <I>Discours 
sur les Songes divins </I>(Saumur, <B>1625</B>)<B> </B>is whether the 
instructions and advice that they contain make for good or ill-a test it is 
impossible to apply until after the result is known. But Amyraldus surmounts 
this difficulty by proposing to test <I>dreams </I>by the evidence they show of 
divine knowledge-by asking oneself in short, whether the <I>dream </I>it was 
desired to examine gave any evidence of such things as God alone could know. It 
would seem from an examination of such <I>dreams </I>as were submitted to the 
diviners of antiquity that the symbolism they exhibited was of a character so 
profound that it could only be unriddled by an interpreter who received divine 
aid, such as was afforded in the case of Moses or Daniel. It is plain, however, 
that the most farfetched interpretations were given to many of the most 
epoch-making <I>dreams </I>of antiquity, and indeed, the oneiocritical system is 
one of the weakest spots in the armour of occult science, and was the first of 
its departments to fall into disrepute and become the prey of the charlatan. 
There are not wanting serious students of the occult who doubt entirely the 
occult significance of <I>dreams, </I>and it must be granted that no good reason 
exists for classing them generally with the vision, or a condition of second 
sight or ecstasy. <I>See </I>H. Hutchinson, <I>Dreams and their Meanings, 
</I>London, <B>1901</B> J. C. Colquohoun, <I>Magic, Witchcraft and Animal 
Magnetism, </I>London, <B>1851 </B>H. Christmas, <I>The Cradle of the Twin 
Giants, </I>London, <B>1849</B>, and many other popular and more advanced 
handbooks on the subject.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Dreams of Animals :</B> It was believed by many that animals dreamed. Pliny 
says: &quot; Evident it is, that horses, dogs, kine, oxen, sheepe and goats, doe 
dreame. Whereupon it is credibly also thought that all creatures that bring 
forth their young quicke and living, doe the same. As for those that lay egges, 
it is not so certian that they dreame; but resolved it is that they doe 
sleepe.&quot;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Dress, Phantom :</B> The question of the apparel worn by apparitions has of 
late years aroused considerable controversy. Says Mr. Podmore: &quot;The 
apparition commonly consists simply of a figure. clothed as the percipient was 
accustomed to see the agent clothed whereas to be true to life the phantasm 
would as a rule have to appear in bed. In cases where the vision gives no 
information as to the agent's clothing and surroundings generally-and, as 
already said, such cases form the great majority of the well attested 
narratives-we may suppose that what is transmitted is not any part of the 
superficial content of the agent's consciousness, but an impression from the 
underlying massive and permanent elements which represent his personal identity. 
The percipient's imagination is clearly competent to clothe such an impression 
with appropriate imagery, must indeed so clothe it if it is to rise into 
consciousness at all.&quot; &quot; The ghosts, it will have been observed, 
always appear clothed. Have clothes also ethereal counterparts ? Such was and is 
the belief of many early races of mankind, who leave clothes, food, and weapons 
in the graves of the dead, or burn them on the funeral pile, that their friends 
may have all they require in the spirit world. But are we prepared to accept 
this view ? And again, these ghosts commonly appear, not in the clothes which 
they were wearing at death-for most deaths take place in bed-but in some others, 
as will he seen from an examination of the stories already cited Are we to 
suppose the ethereal body going to its wardrobe to clothe its nakedness withal ? 
or that, as in the case of Ensign Cavalcante's appearance to Frau Reiken, the 
ghost will actually take off the ethereal clothes it wore at death and replace 
them with others ? It is scarcely necessary to pursue the subject. The 
difficulties and contradictions involved in adapting it to explain the clothes 
must prove fatal to the ghost theory.&quot;</P>
<P>Mr. Thistleton Dyer says on the subject</P>
<P>&quot;It is the familiar dress worn in lifetime that is, in most cases, one 
of the distinguishing features of the ghost, and when Sir George Villiers wanted 
to give a warning to his son, the Duke of Buckingham, his spirit appeared to one 
of the Duke's servants ' in the very clothes he used to wear. Mrs. Crowe, in her 
<I>Night Side of Nature </I>gave an account of an apparition which appeared at a 
house in Sarratt, Hertfordshire. It was that of a well-dressed gentleman, in a 
blue coat and bright gilt buttons, but without a head. It seems that this was 
reported to be the ghost of a poor man of that neighbourhood who had been 
murdered, and whose head had been cut off. He could, therefore, only be 
recognised by his ' blue coat and bright gilt buttons.' Indeed, many ghosts have 
been nicknamed from the kinds of dress in which they have been in the habit of 
appearing. Thus the ghost at Allan-bank was known as ' Pearlin Jean,' from a 
species of lace made of thread which she wore; and the 'White Lady' at Ashley 
Hall-like other ghosts who have home the same name-from the white drapery in 
which she presented herself. Some lady ghosts have been styled Silky,' from the 
rustling of their silken costume, in the wearing of which they have maintained 
the phantom grandeur of their earthly life. Their was the ' Silky' at Black 
Heddon who used to appear in silken attire, oftentimes ' rattling ill her silks 
'; and the spirit of Denton Hall--also termed ' Silky '-walks about in a white 
silk dress of antique fashion. This last ' Silky' was thought to be the ghost of 
a lady who was mistress to the profligate Duke of Argyll in the reign of William 
III., and died suddenly, not without suspicion of murder, at Chirton, near 
Shields-one of his residences. The ' Banshee of Loch Nigdal,' too, was arrayed 
in a silk dress, green in colour. These traditions date from a period when silk 
was not in common use, and therefore attracted notice in country places. Some 
years ago a ghost appeared at Hampton Court. habited in a black satin dress with 
white kid gloves. The White 'Lady of Skipsea&rsquo; makes her midnight serenades 
clothed in long, white drapery. Lady Bothwell, who haunted the mansion of 
Woodhouselee, always appeared in white; and the apparition of the mansion of 
Houndwood, in Berwickshir - bearing the name of </P>
<P>Chappie '-is clad in silk attire.</P>
<P>&quot;One of the ghosts seen at the celebrated Willington Mill was that of a 
female in greyish garments. Sometimes she was said to be wrapped in a mantle, 
with her head depressed and her hands crossed on her lap. Walton Abbey had its 
headless lady who used to haunt a certain wainscotted chamber, dressed in 
blood-stained garments, with her infant in her arms; and, in short, most of the 
ghosts that have tenanted our country houses have been noted for their 
distinctive dress.</P>
<P>&quot;Daniel Defoe. in his <I>Essay on the History and Reality of 
Apparitions, </I>has given many minute details as to the dress of a ghost. He 
tells a laughable and highly amusing story of come robbers who broke into a 
mansion in the country, and, while ransacking one of the rooms, they saw, in a 
chair, 'a grave, ancient man, with a long full-bottomed wig, and a rich, 
brocaded gown,' etc. One of the robbers threatened to tear off his ' rich 
brocaded gown,' another hit at him with a firelock, and was alarmed at seeing it 
pass through the air ; and then the old man changed into the most horrible 
monster that ever was seen, with eyes like two fiery daggers red hot.' The same 
apparition encountered them in different rooms, and at last the servants, who 
were at the top of the house, throwing some ' hand grenades' down the chimneys 
of these rooms, the thieves were dispersed. Without adding further stories of 
this kind, which may be taken for what they are worth, it is a generally 
received belief in ghost lore that spirits are accustomed to appear in the 
dresses which they wore in their lifetime-a notion credited from the days of 
Pliny the Younger to the present day.</P>
<P>&quot;But the fact of ghosts appearing in earthly raiment has excited the 
ridicule of many philosophers, who, even admitting the possibility of a 
spiritual manifestation, deny that there can be the ghost of a suit of clothes. 
George Cruikshank, too, who was no believer in ghosts, sums up the matter thus : 
As it is clearly impossible for spirits to wear dresses made of the materials of 
earth, we should like to know if there are spiritual outfitting shops for the 
clothing of ghosts who pay visits on earth.' Whatever the objections may be to 
the appearance of ghosts in human attire, they have not hitherto overthrown the 
belief in their being seen thus clothed, and Byron, describing the Black Friar' 
who haunted the cloisters and other parts of Newstead Abbey, tells us that he 
was always arrayed In cowl, and beads, and dusky garb.</P>
<P>Indeed, as Dr. Tylor remarks, ' It is an habitual feature of the ghost 
stories of the civilised, as of the savage world, that the ghost comes dressed, 
and even dressed in well-known clothing worn in life.' And he adds that the 
doctrine of object-souls is held by the Algonguin tribes, the islanders of the 
Fijian group, and the Karens of Burmah -it being supposed that not only men and 
beasts have souls, but inorganic things. Thus, Mariner, describing the Fijian 
belief, writes: ' If a stone or any other sup-stance is broken, immortality is 
equally its reward; nay, artificial bodies have equal good luck with men, and 
hogs, and yams. If an axe or a chisel is worn out or broken up, away flies its 
soul for the service of the gods. The Fijians can further show you a sort of 
natural well, or deep hole in the ground, at one of their islands, across the 
bottom of which runs a stream of water, in which you may clearly see the souls 
of men and women, beasts and plants, stocks and stones, canoes and horses, and 
of all the broken utensils of this frail world, swimming, or rather tumbling 
along, one over the other, pell-mell, into the regions of immortality.' As it 
has been observed, animistic conceptions of this kind are no more irrational 
than the popular idea prevalent in civilised communities as to spirits appearing 
in all kinds of garments.&quot;</P>

<P>Drummer of Tedworth :</B> A poltergeist who haunted the house of Mr. John 
Mompesson, of Tedworth, Wilts, about the year <B>1661</B> and onwards. In March 
of that year Mompesson had had a vagrant drummer brought before a justice of the 
peace, whereby his drum was confiscated. The instrument was taken to the house 
of Mompesson, during the latter's absence, and immediately a violent poltergeist 
disturbance broke out. Apparitions were seen by members of the household, pieces 
of furniture were seen to move of themselves, small objects were flung about by 
invisible hands, the younger children were levitated as they lay in their beds, 
and there was a continual sound of drumming every night. The drummer, understood 
to be the cause of the trouble, was transported, when peace once more reigned in 
the afflicted household; but ere long he managed to return, when the 
disturbances broke out with renewed vigour. There is no first-hand account of 
this poltergeist, save that of Joseph Glanvil-<I>Sadducismus Triumphatus, 
</I><B>1668</B>-and though Glanvil is our authority for the whole story, that 
part of it which he himself declares to have witnessed is certainly not the most 
marvellous, but describes scratchings and pantings heard in the vicinity of the 
children&rsquo;s beds.</P>

<P>Dual Personality :</B> In every form of cerebral dissociation there is a 
disturbance of consciousness. Sometimes, and especially in the trance, there 
occurs what is known as &quot;split consciousness,&quot; and the split may be so 
pronounced that the subject seems to have two or more distinct personalities. 
The secondary personality may differ from the primary in many ways, and possess 
entirely distinct intellectual and moral characteristics. The entranced subject 
may allude to his normal consciousness in the third person, may criticise its 
opinions and attitude, or even express direct antagonism towards it. The 
secondary personality sometimes alternates with the primary in such a way as to 
suggest that two spirits are struggling to possess the same physical 
organisation. Another peculiarity of this state is that whereas the normal 
consciousness generally knows nothing of the others, the secondary personalities 
have full knowledge of each other and of the normal conciousness. <I>Dual 
personality </I>is not confined to the trance state, but may arise 
spontaneously. R. L. Stevenson makes effective use of it in his <I>Strange Case 
of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.</P>

<P>Duguid, David :</B> A Glasgow painting medium who achieved considerable 
success in his line. He was a cabinet-maker, who in <B>1866</B> found himself 
possessed of mediumistic faculties. At first an ordinary rapping medium, he 
speedily developed the power of painting in trance, even in the dark. A still 
higher stage of mediumship was reached when direct drawings were produced in his 
presence. These drawings, generally copies of Dutch masters, purporting to be 
done by the original artists, are said not to have been without some merit, 
apart from the fact that they were done in complete darkness. The two principal 
controls were Ruysdael and Steen. In <B>1869</B> control of the medium's 
organism was taken by Hafed, prince of Persia at the beginning of the Christian 
era, and Archmagus. Hafed related his many adventures througn <I>Duguid 
</I>mediumship in a series of sittings extending over some years. A Persian of 
princely birth, he had borne arms in his country's defence. After extensive 
travels, he was admitted to the magi, and ultimately became Archmagus. He was of 
those who bore rich gifts to Bethlehem at the birth of Christ. Finally he met 
his death in the arena at Rome. <I>Hafed, Prince of Persia, </I>was afterwards
