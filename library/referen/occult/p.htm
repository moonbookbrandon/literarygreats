<P>Paigoels, The :</B> The devils of Hindustan. Some of the Hindus believe that 
the Paigoels were originally created devils others that they were put out of 
heaven because of their great sin, and of all worlds that the earth is the only 
one with which they are allowed intercourse. Some of these devils have 
individual names, and are the tempters of men to special sins, - others again 
enter into the bodies of men and take possession of them. The Hindus also 
believe that the souls of wicked men go to join the number of the 
<I>paigoels.</I></P><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Palingenesy :</B> A term employed by the philosophers of the seventeenth 
century to denote the 't resurrection of plants,&quot; and the method of 
achieving their astral appearance after destruction; In very early times, we 
find philosophers inclined to doubt if apparitions might not be accounted for on 
natural principles, without supposing that a belief in them was either referable 
to hallucinations, to human imagination, or to impositions that might have been 
practised. At length Lucretius attacked the popular notion entertained of 
ghosts, by maintaining that they were not spirits returned from the mansions of 
the dead, but nothing more than thin films, pellicles, or membranes, cast off 
from the surface of all bodies like the exuviae or sloughs of reptiles.</P>
<P>An opinion, by no means dissimilar. to that of the Epicureans, was revived in 
Europe about the middle of the <B>17</B>th century. It had its origin in 
<I>Palingenesy, </I>or the resurrection of plants, a grand secret known to 
Digby, Kircher, Schot, Gaflerel, Vallemont, and others. These philosophers. 
performed the operation of Palingenesy after the following manner:-They took a 
plant, bruised it, burnt it, collected its ashes, and, in the process of 
calcination, extracted from it a salt. This salt they then put into a glass 
phial, and mixed with it some peculiar substance, which these chemists have not 
disclosed. When the compound was formed, it was pulverulent, and possessed a 
bluish colour. The powder was next submitted to a gentle heat, when its 
particles being instantly put into motion, there then, gradually arose, as from 
the midst of the ashes, a stem, leaves and flowers; or, in other words, an 
apparition of the plant which had been submitted to combustion. But as soon as 
the heat was taken away, the form of the plant, which had been thus sublimed, 
was precipitated to the bottom of the vessel. Heat was then re-applied, and the 
vegetable phoenix was resusitated; it was withdrawn, and the form once more 
became latent among the ashes. This notable experiment was said to have been 
performed before the Royal Society of England, and it satisfactorily proved to 
this learned body, that the presence of heat gave a sort of life to the 
vegetable apparition, and that the absence of caloric caused its death.</P>
<P>Cowley was quite delighted with the experiment of the rose and its ashes, and 
in conceiving that he had detected the same phenomenon in the letters written 
with the juice of lemons, which were revived on the application of heat, he 
celebrated the mystic power of caloric after the following manner:-</P>
<P>&quot;Strange power of heat, thou yet dost show,</P>
<P>Like winter earth, naked, or cloth'd with snow,</P>
<P>But as the quick'ning sun approaching near,</P>
<P>The plants arise up by degrees,</P>
<P>A sudden paint adorns the trees,</P>
<P>And all kind nature's characters appear.</P>
<P>So nothing yet in thee is seen,</P>
<P>But when a genial heat warms thee within,</P>
<P>A new-born wood of various lines there grows;</P>
<P>Here buds an A, and there a B,</P>
<P>Here sprouts a V, and there a T,</P>
<P>And all the flourishing letters stand in rows.&quot;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The rationale of this famous experiment made on the ashes of roses was 
attempted by Kircher. He supposed that the seminal virtue of every known 
substance, and even its substantial form, resided in its salt. This salt was 
concealed in the ashes of the rose. Heat put it in motion. The particles of the 
salt were quickly sublimed, and being moved about in the phial like a vortex, at 
length arranged themselves in the same general form they had possessed from 
nature. It was evident, then, from the result of this experiment, that there was 
a tendency in the particles of the salt to observe the same order of position 
which they had in the living plant. Thus, for instance, each saline corpuscle, 
which in its prior state bad held a place in the stem of the rose-slip, 
sympathetically fixed itself in a corresponding position when sublimed in the 
chemist's vial. Other particles were subject to a similar law, and accordingly, 
by a disposing affinity, resumed their proper position, either in the stalk, the 
leaves, or the flowers, and thus, at length, the entire apparition of a plant 
was generated.</P>
<P>The next object of these philosophers was to apply their doctrine to the 
explanation of the popular belief in ghosts. As it was incontestably proved that 
the substantial form of each body resided in a sort of volatile salt, it was 
perfectly evident in what manner superstitious notions must have arisen about 
ghosts haunting churchyards. When a dead body had been committed to the earth, 
the salts of it, during the heating process of fermentation, were exhaled. The 
saline particles then each resumed the same relative situation they had held in 
the living body, and thus a complete human form was induced, calculated to 
excite superstitious fear in the minds of all but Palingenesists.</P>
<P>It is thus evident that <I>Palingenesy </I>was nothing more Lucretius had 
made, with regard to the filmy substances than a chemical explanation of the 
discovery which that he bad observed to arise from all bodies.</P>
<P>Yet, in order to prove that apparitions might be really explained on this 
principle, the <I>experimentum crucis </I>was still wanting. But this deficiency 
was soon supplied. Three alchemists had obtained a quantity of earth-mould from 
St. Innocent's Church, in Paris, supposing that this matter might contain the 
true philosopher's stone. They subjected it to a distillatory process. On a 
sudden they perceived in their vials forms of men produced, which immediately 
caused them to desist from their labours. This fact coming to the knowledge of 
the Institute of Paris, under the protection of Louis XIV., this learned body 
took up the business with much seriousness, and the result of their labours 
appears in the M<I>iscellania Curiosa. </I>Dr. Ferrier, in a volume of the 
<I>Manchester Philosophical Transactions, </I>went to the trouble of making an 
abstract of one of these French documents, which we prefer giving on account of 
its conciseness, rather than having recourse to the original dissertation.</P>
<P>&quot;A malefactor was executed, of whose body a grave physician got 
possession for the purpose of dissection. After disposing of the other parts of 
the body, he ordered his assistant to pulverize part of the cranium, which was a 
remedy at that time admitted in dispensatories. The powder was left in a paper 
on the table of the museum, where the assistant slept. About midnight he was 
awakened by a noise in the room, which obliged him to rise immediately. The 
noise continued about the table, without any visible agent; and at length he 
traced it to the powder, in the midst of which he now beheld, to his unspeakable 
dismay, a small head with open eyes staring at him; presently two branches 
appeared, which formed into arms and hands; then the ribs became visible, which 
were soon clothed with muscles and integuments; next the lower extremities 
sprouted out, and when they appeared perfect, the puppet (for his size was 
small) reared himself on his feet; instantly his clothes came upon him, and he 
appeared in the very cloak he wore at his execution. The affrighted spectator, 
who stood hitherto mumbling his prayers with great application, now thought of 
nothing but making his escape from the revived ruffian; but this was impossible, 
for the apparition planted himself in the way, and, after divers fierce looks 
and threatening gestures, opened the door and went out. No doubt the powder was 
missing next day.&quot;</P>
<P>But older analogous results are on record, indicating that the blood was the 
chief part of the human frame in which those saline particles resided, the 
arrangements of which gave rise to the popular notion of ghosts. Dr. Webster, in 
his book on witchcraft, relates an experiment. given on the authority of Dr. 
Flud, in which this very satisfactory conclusion was drawn.</P>
<P>&quot;A certain chymical operator, by name La Pierre, near that place in 
Paris called Le Temple, received blood from the hands of a certain bishop to 
operate upon. Which he setting to work upon the Saturday, did continue it for a 
week with divers degrees of fire. But about midnight, the Friday following, this 
artificer, lying in a chamber next to his laboratory, betwixt sleeping and 
waking, heard a horrible noise, like unto the lowing of kine, or the roaring of 
a lion; and continuing quiet, after the ceasing of the sound in the laboratory, 
the moon being at the full, and, by shining enlightening the chamber suddenly, 
betwixt himself and the window he saw a thick little cloud, condensed into an 
oval form, which, after, by little and little, did seem completely to put on the 
shape of a man, and making another and a sharp clamour, did suddenly vanish. And 
not only some noble persons in the next chambers, but also the host with his 
wife, lying in a lower room of the house, and also the neighbours dwelling in 
the opposite side of the street, did distinctly hear as well the bellowing as 
the voice; and some of them were awaked with the vehemency thereof. But the 
artificer said, that in this he found solace, because the bishop, of whom he had 
it, did admonish him, that if any of them from whom the blood was extracted 
should die, in the time of its putrefaction, his spirit was wont often to appear 
to the sight of the artificer, with perturbation. Also forthwith, upon Saturday 
following, he took the retort from the furnace, and broke it with the light 
stroke of a little key, and there, in the remaining blood, found the perfect 
representation of an human head, agreeable in face, eyes, nostrils, mouth, and 
hairs, that were somewhat thin, and of a golden colour.&quot;</P>
<P>Regarding this narrative Webster adds :-&quot; There were many ocular 
witnesses, as the noble person, Lord of Bourdalone, the chief secretary to the 
Duke of Guise; and he (Flud) bad this relation from the Lord of Menanton, living 
in that house at the same time, from a certain doctor of physic, from the owner 
of the house, and many others.&quot;</P><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Palladino, Eusapia :</B> The most famous physical medium of recent years, and 
one whose phenomena, investigated at length by some of the most distinguished 
scientists of Britain, France, and Italy, have led many to conclude that they 
are genuine manifestations from the spirit world, or that they illustrate the 
workings of some unknown force. <I>Eusapia </I>was a Neapolitan peasant woman 
who from her childhood had shown herself possessed of mediumistic powers. In 
<B>1892</B> a group of scientist - Professors Schiaparelli, Broffeno, Geroso, 
the well-known spiritualist M. Aksakoff, and others-held a series of sittings at 
Milan, with <I>Eusapia </I>as medium. Some of the seances were also attended by 
Professors Richet and Lombroso. The phenomena consisted of raps, materialisation 
of hands, levitation of the table and other furniture within a radius of three 
or four feet, and fluctuation of the medium's weight in the balance, to the 
extent of some </P><B>
<P>17</B>lbs. It was evident even then that <I>Eusapia </I>would not lose an 
opportunity of using fraud. Nevertheless Professor Richet was so impressed that 
in <B>1894</B> he organised a further series of sittings with the same medium at 
his house on the Ile Rouband, and on this occasion were present Professor-now 
Sir Oliver-Lodge, Mr. Myers, Dr. Ochorowicz, and at a later stage, Professor and 
Mrs. Sidgwick. The seances were held in darkness or semi-darkness, but the 
medium's hands and feet were controlled by the investigators. Mrs. Sidgwick, 
indeed, declared that <I>Eusapia </I>herself might easily have produced the 
phenomena, if she had the use of her hands, but Professor Lodge and others were 
inclined to attribute them to some external agency. In the following year 
further seances were held at Mr. Myer's house at Cambridge, and when it became 
evident that <I>Eusapia </I>frequently freed a foot or a hand Mr. Myer's own 
faith in the phenomena was temporarily-though only temporarily-destroyed. 
Professor Richet and Sir Oliver Lodge, however, retained their convictions 
unshaken. Dr. Hodgson, who had already suggested that <I>Eusapia </I>might use 
some such method, was also present at the Cambridge sittings. Besides the 
already mentioned, many prominent Continental scientists investigated 
<I>Eusapia's </I>manifestations among them being M. Camille Flammarion. 
Professor Morselli, and M. and Mme. Curie. The two last mentioned were members 
of a committee of <I>the lnstitut General Psychologique of Paris, </I>which held 
an important series of sittings with the medium in <B>1905</B>, <B>1906</B>, and 
<B>1907</B>. In <B>1908</B> and <B>1909</B> again, the Society for Psychical 
Research instituted a fresh enquiry into <I>Eusapia's </I>methods. On the whole, 
scientific opinion is still much divided as to the genuineness or otherwise of 
the phenomena. Some authorities, taking into consideration the many times the 
Italian medium has been caught cheating, and the absense of really conclusive 
tests, incline to the belief that <I>Eusapia </I>is merely a clever conjurer. 
Such were Dr. Hodgson, Mr. Podmore, Professor and Mrs. Sidgwick. Others, again, 
such as Professors Richet and Lombroso, M. Camille Flammarion and Sir Oliver 
Lodge, are of the opinion that the instances of fraud are mere incidents in the 
career of a true medium, whose performances plainly demonstrate the operation in 
the material world of strange, unknown forces.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Palmistry :</B> The science of divination by means of lines and marks on the 
human hand. It is said to have been practised in very early times by the 
Brahmins of India, and to be known to Aristotle, who discovered a treatise on 
the subject written in letters of gold, which he presented <B>10</B> Alexander 
the Great, and which was afterwards translated into Latin by Hispanus. There is 
also extant a work on the subject by Melampus of Alexandria, and Hippocrates, 
Galen, and several Arabian commentators have also dealt with it, In the Middle 
Ages the science was represented by Hartlieb (circa <B>1448</B>), and Codes 
(circa <B>1054</B>), and Fludd, Indigane, Rothmann, and many others wrote on 
cheiromancy. D'Arpentigny, Desbarolles, Carus, and others kept the science alive 
in the earlier half of the nineteenth century, since when a very large number of 
treatises upon it have been written. Since <B>1860</B>, or thereabouts, 
<I>palmistry </I>has become very much more popular than ever before in these 
islands, and indeed is practised nearly all over the habitable globe.</P><I>
<P>Palmistry </I>is sub-divided into three lesser arts-cheirognomy, cheirosophy 
and cheiromancy. The first is the art of recognising the type of intelligence 
from the form of the hands; the second is the study of the comparative value of 
manual formations; and the third is the art of divination from the form of the 
hand and fingers, and the lines and markings thereon. The palmist first of all 
studies the shape and general formation of the hand as a whole, afterwards 
regarding its parts and details,-the lines and markings being considered later. 
From cheirognomy and cheirosophy the general disposition and tendencies are 
ascertained, and future events are foretold from the reading of the lines and 
markings.</P>
<P>There are several types of hands: the elementary or large-palmed type; the 
necessary with spatulated fingers; the artistic with conical-shaped fingers ; 
the useful, the fingers of which are square-shaped; the knotted or 
philosophical; the pointed, or psychic; and the mixed, in which the .types are 
blended. The principal lines are: those which separate the hand from the forearm 
at the wrist, and which are known as the rascettes, or the lines of health, 
wealth and happiness. The line of life stretches from the centre of the palm 
around the base of the thumb almost to the wrist, and is joined for a 
considerable part of its course by the line of the head. The line of the heart 
runs across two-thirds of the palm, above the head line; and the line of fate 
between it and the line of the head. nearly at right angles extending towards 
the wrist. The line of fortune runs from the base of the third finger towards 
the wrist parallel to the line of fate. If the lines are deep, firm and of 
narrow width the significance is good - excepting that a strong line of health 
shows constitutional weakness.</P>
<P>At the base of the fingers, beginning with the first, lie the mounts of 
Jupiter, Saturn, Apollo, and Mercury; at the base of the thumb the mount of 
Venus; and opposite to it, that of Luna. If well-proportioned they show certain 
virtues, but if exaggerated they indicate the vices which correspond to these. 
The first displays religion, reasonable ambition, or pride and superstition; the 
second wisdom and prudence, or ignorance and failure; the third when large makes 
for success and intelligence, when small for meanness or love of obscurity; the 
fourth desire for knowledge and industry, or disinterestedness and laziness. The 
Lunar mount indicates sensitiveness, imagination, morality or otherwise; and 
self-will: and the mount of Venus, charity and affection, or if exaggerated 
viciousness. The phalanges of the fingers are also indicative of certain 
faculties. For example, the first and second of the thumb, according to their 
length, indicate the value of the logical faculty and of the will; those of the 
index finger in their order-materialism, law, and order; of the middle 
finger-humanity, system, intelligence; of the third finger-truth economy, 
energy; and of the little finger goodness, prudence, reflectiveness. There are 
nearly a hundred other marks and signs, by which certain qualities, influences 
or events can be recognised. The line of life by its length indicates the length 
of existence of its owner. If it is short in both hands, the life will be a 
short one; if broken in one hand and weak in the other, a serious illness is 
denoted. If broken in both hands, it means death. If it is much chained it means 
delicacy. If it has a second or sister line, it shows great vitality. A black 
spot on the line shows illness at the time marked. A cross indicates some 
fatality. The line of life coming out far into the palm is a sign of long life. 
The line of the head, if long and well-coloured, denotes intelligence and power. 
If descending to the mount of the Moon it shows that the head is much influenced 
by the imagination. Islands on the line denote mental troubles. The head line 
forked at the end indicates subtlety and a facility for seeing all sides of the 
question. A double line of the head is an indication of good fortune. The line 
of the heart should branch towards the mount of Jupiter. If it should pass over 
the mount of Jupiter to the edge of the hand and travel round the index finger, 
it is called &quot; Solomon's ring&quot; and indicates ideality and romance; it 
is also a sign of occult power. Points or dots in this line may show illness if 
black, and if white love affairs; while islands on the heart line indicate 
disease. The line of fate, or Saturn, if it rises from the Lunar mount and 
ascends towards the line of the heart is a sign of a rich marriage. If it 
extends into the third phalange of Saturn's finger it shows the sinister 
influence of that planet. A double line of fate is ominous.</P>
<P>In such an article as this it would be out of place to mention the very 
numerous lesser lines and marks which the hand contains, especially when so many 
excellent books of reference on the subject have recently been published. It but 
remains to say that practitioners of the science of <I>palmistry </I>are 
execeedingly numerous. Some of these work on strictly scientific lines, while 
others pick it up in a merely empirical way, and their forecasts of events to 
come are only so much patter.&quot;</P>

<P>Paracelsus :</B> In the history of alchemy there is not a more striking or 
picturesque figure than Auroelus Philippus Theophrastus Paracelsus Bombast von 
Hohenheim, the illustrious physician and exponent of the hermetic philosophy who 
has chosen to go down to fame under the name of <I>Paracelsus. </I>He was born 
at Einsideln, near Zurich, in the year <B>1493</B>. His father, the natural son 
of a prince, himself practised the &quot; art of medicine,&quot; and was 
desirous that his only son should follow the same profession. To the fulfillment 
of that desire was directed the early training of <I>Paracelsus-a </I>training 
which fostered his imaginative rather than his practical tendencies, and which 
first cast his mind into the alchemical mould. It did not take him long to 
discover that the medical traditions of the time were hut empty husks from which 
all substance had long since dried away. &quot; I considered with myself,&quot; 
he says, that if there were no teacher of medicine in the world, how would I set 
about to learn the art ? No otherwise than in the great open book of nature, 
written with the finger of God.&quot; Having thus freed himself from the 
constraining bonds of an outworn medical orthodoxy, whose chief resources were 
bleeding, purging, and emetics, he set about evolving a new system to replace 
the old, and in order that he might study the book of nature to better advantage 
he travelled extensively from <B>1513</B> to <B>1524</B>, visiting almost every 
part of the known world, studying metallurgy, chemistry, and medicine, and 
consorting with vagabonds of every description. He was brought before the Cham 
of Tartary, conversed with the magicians of Egypt and Arabia, and is said to 
have even reached India. At length his protracted wanderings came to a close, 
and in <B>1524</B> he settled in Basle, then a favourite resort of scholars and 
physicians, where he was appointed to fill the chair of medicine at the 
University. Never had Basle witnessed a more brilliant, erratic professor. His 
inflated language, his eccentric behaviour, the splendour of his conceptions 
flashing through a fog of obscurity, at once attracted and repelled, and gained 
for him friends and enemies. His antipithy to the Galenic school became ever 
more pronounced, and the crisis came when he publicly burned the works of Galen 
and Avicenna in a brazen vase into which he had cast nitre and sulphur. By such 
a proceeding he incurred the hatred of his more conservative brethren, and cut 
himself off for ever from the established school of medicine. He continued his 
triumphant career, however, till a conflict with the magistrates brought it to 
an abrupt close, He was forced to flee from Basle, and thereafter wandered from 
place to place, gaining a living as best he might. An element of mystery 
surrounds the manner of his death, which took place in <B>1541</B>, but the best 
authenticated account states that he was poisoned at the instigation of the 
medical faculty.</P>
<P>But interesting as were the events of his life, it is to his work that most 
attention is due. Not only was he the founder of the modern science of medicine; 
the magnetic theory of Mesmer, the &quot; astral&quot; theory of modern 
spiritualists, the philosophy of Descartes, were all foreshadowed in the 
fantastic, yet not always illogical, teaching of Paracelsus. He revived the 
&quot; microcosmic &quot; theory of ancient Greece, and sought to prove the 
human body analogous to the Solar System, by establishing a connection between 
the seven organs of the body and the seven planets. He preached the doctrines of 
the efficacy of will-power and the imagination in such words as these: &quot; It 
is possible that my spirit, without the help of my body, and through an ardent 
will alone, and without a sword, can stab and wound others. It is also possible 
that I can bring the spirit of my adversary into an image and then fold him up 
or lame him at my pleasure.&quot; &quot; Resolute imagination is the beginning 
of all magical operations.&quot; &quot; Because men do not perfectly believe and 
imagine, the result is, that arts are uncertain when they might be wholly 
certain.&quot; The first principle of his doctrine is the extraction of the 
quintessence, or philosophic mercury, from every material body. He believed that 
if the quintessence were drawn from each animal, plant, and mineral, the 
combined result would equal the universal spirit, or &quot; astral body&quot; in 
man, and that a draught of the extract would renew his youth. He came at length 
to the conclusion that &quot;astral bodies&quot; exercised a mutual influence on 
each other, and declared that he himself had communicated with the dead, and 
with living persons at a considerable distances. He was the first to connect 
this influence with that of the magnet, and to use the word 
&quot;magnetism&quot; with its present application. It was on this foundation 
that Mesmer built his theory of magnetic influence. While <I>Paracelsus 
</I>busied himself with such problems, however, he did not neglect the study and 
practice of medicine. Indeed, astrology and the magnet entered largely into his 
treatment. When he was sought by a patient, his first care was to consult the 
planets, where the disease had its origin, and if the patient were a woman he 
took it for granted that the cause of her malady lay in the moon. His 
anticipation of the philosophy of Descartes, consisted in his theory that by 
bringing the various elements of the human body into harmony with the elements 
of nature - fire, light, earth, etc.-old age and death might be indefinitely 
postponed. His experiment in the extraction of its essential spirit from the 
poppy resulted in the production of laudanum, which he prescribed freely in the 
form of &quot; three black pills.&quot; The recipes which he gives for the 
Philosopher's Stone, the Elixir of Life, and various universal remedies, are 
exceedingly obscure. He is deservedly celebrated as the first physician to use 
opium and mercury, and to recognise the value of sulphur. He applied himself 
also to the solution of a problem which still exercises the minds of scientific 
men-whether it is possible to produce life from inorganic matter, <I>Paracelsus 
</I>asserted that it was, and has, left on record a quaint recipe for a 
<I>homunculus, </I>or artificial man. By a peculiar treatment of certain 
&quot;spagyric substances&quot; -which he has unfortunately omitted to 
specify-he declared that he could produce a perfect human child in. miniature. 
Speculations such as these, medical, alchemical and philosophical, were 
scattered so profusely throughout his teaching that we are compelled to admit 
that here was a master-mind, a genius, who was a charlatan only incidentally, by 
reason of training and temperament. Let it be remembered that he lived in an age 
when practically all scholars and physicians were wont to impose on popular 
ignorance, and we cannot but remark that <I>Paracelsus </I>displayed, under all 
his arrogant exterior, a curious singleness of purpose, and a real desire to 
penetrate the mysteries of science. He has left on record the principal points 
of the philosophy on which he founded his researches in his </P>
<P>&quot;<I>Archidoxa Medicinae.&quot; </I>It contains the leading rules of the 
art of healing, as he practised and preached them. &quot;I had resolved,&quot; 
he says, &quot;to give ten books to the ' <I>Archidoxa,' </I>but I have reserved 
the tenth in my head. It is a treasure which men are not worthy to possess, and 
shall only be given to the world when they shall have abjured Aristotle, 
Avicenna, and Galen-, and promised a perfect submission to <I>Paracelsus.&quot; 
</I>The world did not recant, but <I>Paracelsus </I>relented, and at the 
entreaty of his disciples published this tenth book, the key to the nine others, 
but a key which might pass for a lock. and for a lock which we cannot even pick. 
It is entitled the &quot; <I>Tenth Dooh of the Arch-Doctrines </I>or, <I>On the 
Secret Mysteries of Nature.&quot; </I>A brief summary of it is as follows:-</P>
<P>He begins by supposing and ends by establishing that there is a universal 
spirit infused into the veins of man, forming within us a species of invisible 
body, of which our visible body, which it directs and governs at its will, is 
but the wrapping-the casket. This universal spirit is not simple-not more 
simple, for instance, than the number <B>100</B>, which is a collection of 
units. Where, then, are the spiritual units of which our complex spirit is 
composed ? Scattered in plants and minerals but principally in metals, There 
exists in these inferior productions of the earth a host of sub-spirits which 
sum themselves up in us, as the universe does in God. So the science of the 
philosopher has simply to unite them to the body-to disengage them from the 
grosser matter which clogs and confines them, to separate the pure from the 
impure.</P>
<P>To separate the pure from the impure is, in other words, to seize upon the 
soul of the heterogeneous bodies-to evolve their &quot; predestined 
element,&quot; &quot; the seminal essence of beings,&quot; &quot; the first 
being, or quintessence.&quot;</P>
<P>To understand this latter word &quot; quintessence,&quot; it is needful for 
the reader to know that every body, whatever it may be, is composed of four 
elements, and that the essence compounded of these elements forms a fifth, which 
is the soul of the mixed bodies, or, in other words, its mercury,&quot; &quot; I 
have shown,&quot; says <I>Paracelsus, </I>&quot;in my book of' Elements,' that 
the quintessence is the same thing as mercury. There is in mercury whatever wise 
men seek.&quot; That is, not the mercury of modern chemists, but a philosophical 
mercury of which every body has its own. 'There are as many mercuries as there 
are things. The mercury of a vegetable, a mineral, or an animal of the same 
kind, although strongly resembling each other, does not precisely resemble 
another mercury, and it is for this reason that vegetables, minerals, and 
animals of the same species are not exactly alike. . . . The true mercury of 
philosophers is the radical humidity of each body, and its veritable <I>semen, 
</I>or essence.&quot;</P><I>
<P>Paracelsus </I>now sought for a plant worthy of holding in the vegetable 
kingdom the same rank as gold in the metallic-a plant whose &quot; predestined 
element&quot; should unite in itself the virtues of nearly all the vegetable 
essences Although this was not easy to distinguish, he recognised at a glance - 
we know not by what signs-the supremacy of excellence in the <I>melissa, </I>and 
first decreed to it that pharmaceutical crown which at a later period the 
Carmelites ought to have consecrated. How he obtained this new specific may be 
seen in the <I>Life of Paracelsus, </I>by</P>
<P>Savarien:-</P>
<P>&quot;He took some balm-mint in flower, which he had taken care to collect 
before the rising of the sun. He pounded it in a mortar, reduced it to an 
impalpable dust, poured it into a long-necked vial which he sealed hermetically, 
and placed it to digest (or settle) for forty hours in a heap of horse-dung. 
This time expired, he opened the vial, and found there a matter which he reduced 
into a fluid by pressing it, separating it from its impurities by exposure to 
the slow heat of a <I>bain-niarie. </I>The grosser parts sunk to the bottom, and 
he drew off the liqueur which floated on the top, filtering it through some 
cotton. This liqueur having been poured into a bottle he added to it the fixed 
salt, which he had drawn from the same plant when dried. There remained nothing 
more but to extract from this liqueur the first lief or being of the plant. For 
this purpose <I>Paracelsus </I>mixed the liqueur with so much' water of salt' 
(understand by this the mercurial element or radical humidity of the salt), put 
it in a matrass, exposed it for six weeks to the sun, and finally, at the 
expiration of this term, discovered a last residuum which was decidedly, 
according to him, the first life or supreme essence of the plant. But at all 
events, it is certain that what he found in his matrass was the genie or spirit 
he required; and with the surplus, if there were any, we need not concern 
ourselves.&quot;</P>
<P>Those who may wish to know what this <I>genie </I>was like, are informed that 
it as exactly resembled, as two drops of water, the spirit of aromatic wine 
known to-day as <I>absinthe suisse. </I>It was a liquid green as emerald,-green, 
the bright colour of hope and spring-time. Unfortunately, it failed as a 
specific in the conditions indispensable for an elixir of immortality; but it 
was a preparation more than half-celestial, which almost rendered old age 
impossible.</P>
<P>By means and manipulations as subtle and ingenious as those which he employed 
upon the melissa, <I>Paracelsus </I>did not draw, but learned to extract, the 
&quot;predestined element&quot; of plants which ranked much higher in the 
vegetable aristocracy,-the &quot; first life&quot; of the gillyflower, the 
cinnamon, the myrrh, the scammony, the celandine. All these supreme essences, 
which, according to the <B>5</B>th book of <I>&quot;Archidoxa,&quot; </I>unite 
with a mass of &quot;magisteries&quot; as precious as they are rude, are the 
base of so many specifics, equally reparative and regenerative. This depends 
upon the relationship which exists between the temperament of a privileged plant 
and the temperament of the individual who asks of it his rejuvenescence.</P>
<P>However brilliant were the results of his discoveries, those he obtained or 
those he thought he might obtain, they were for <I>Paracelsus </I>but the a b c 
of Magic. To the eyes of so consummate an alchemist vegetable life is nothing; 
it is the mineral - the metallic life - which is all. So we may assure ourselves 
that it was in his power to seize the first life-principle of the moon, the sun, 
Mars, or Saturn; that is, of silver, gold, iron, or lead. It was equally facile 
for him to. grasp the life of the precious stones, the bitumens. the sulphurs, 
and even that of animals.</P><I>
<P>Paracelsus </I>sets forth several methods of obtaining this great arcanum. 
Here is the shortest and most simple as recorded by Incola Francus</P>
<P>&quot;Take some mercury, or at least the element of mercury, separating the 
pure from the impure, and afterwards pounding it to perfect whiteness. Then you 
shall sublimate it with sal-ammoniac, and this so many times as may be necessary 
to resolve it into a fluid. Calcine it, coagulate it, and again dissolve it, and 
let it strain in a pelican during a philosophic month, until it thickens and 
assumes the form of a hard substance. Thereafter this form of stone is 
incombustible, and nothing can change or alter it; the metallic bodies which it 
penetrates become fixed and incombustible, for this material is incombustible, 
and changes the imperfect metals into metal perfect. Although I have given the 
process in few words, the thing itself demands a long toil, and many difficult 
circumstances, which I have expressly omitted, not to weary the reader, who 
ought to be very diligent and intelligent if he wishes to arrive at the 
accomplishment of this great work.&quot;</P><I>
<P>Paracelsus </I>himself tells us in his &quot; <I>Archidoxa,&quot; </I>when 
explaining his own recipe for the completion of it, and profiting by the 
occasion to criticise his fellow-workers.</P>
<P>&quot;I omit,&quot; he writes, &quot; what I have said in different places on 
the theory of the stone; I will sy only that this <I>arcanum </I>does not 
consist in the blast <I>(rouille) </I>or flowers of antimony. It must be sought 
in the mercury of antimony, which, when it is carried to perfection, is nothing 
else than the <I>heaven </I>of metals ; for even as the heaven gives life to 
plants and minerals, so does the pure quintessence of antimony vitrify 
everything. This is why the Deluge was not able to deprive any substance of its 
virtue or properties, for the heaven being the life of all beings, there is 
nothing superior to it which can modify or destroy it.</P>
<P>&quot;Take the antimony, purge it of its arsenical impurities in an iron 
vessel until the coagulated mercury of the antimony appears quite white, and is 
distinguishable by the star which appears in the superficies of the regulus, or 
semi-metal. But although this regulus. which is the -element of mercury, has in 
itself a veritable hidden life, nevertheless these things are in virtue, and not 
actually.</P>
<P>&quot;Therefore, if you wish to reduce the power to action, you must 
disengage the life which is concealed in it by a living fire like to itself or 
with a metallic vinegar. To discover this fire many philosophers have proceeded 
differently, but agreeing to the foundations of the art, have arrived at the 
desired end. For some with great labour have drawn forth the quintessence of the 
thickened mercury of the regulus of antimony, and by this means have reduced to 
action the mercury of the antimony: others have considered that there was a 
uniform quintessence in the other minerals, as for example in the fixed sulphur 
of the vitriol, or the stone - of the magnet, and having extracted the 
quintessence, have - afterwards matured and exalted their <I>heaven </I>with it, 
and reduced it to action. Their process is good, and has had its result. 
Meanwhile this fire-this corporeal life-which they seek with toil, is found much 
more easily and in much greater perfection in the ordinary mercury, which 
appears through its perpetual fluidity-a proof that it possesses a very powerful 
fire and a celestial life similar to that which lies hidden in the regulus of 
the antimony. Therefore, he who would wish to exalt our <I>metallic heaven, 
</I>starred, to its greatest completeness, and to reduce into action its 
potential virtues, he must first extract from ordinary mercury its - corporeal 
life, which is a celestial fire; that is to say the - quintessence of 
quicksilver, or, in other words, the metallic - vinegar, that has resulted from 
its dissolution in the water which originally produced it, and which is its own 
mother; that is to say, he must dissolve it in the arcanum of the salt I have 
described, and mingle it with the ' stomach of Anthion,' which is the spirit of 
vinegar, and in this menstruum melt and filter and consistent mercury of the 
antimony, strain it in the said liquor, and finally reduce it into crystals of a 
yellowish green, of which we have spoken in our manual.&quot;</P>
<P>As regards the Philosopher's<SUB> </SUB>Stone, he gives the following 
formula:</P>
<P>&quot;Take,&quot; said he, &quot; the electric mineral not yet mature 
(antimony), put it in its sphere, in the fire with the iron, to remove its 
ordures and other superfluities, and purge it as much as you can, following the 
rules of chymistry, so that it may not suffer by the aforesaid impurities. Make, 
in a word, the regulus with the mark. This done, cause it to dissolve in the ' 
stomach of the ostrich' (vitriol), which springs from the earth and is fortified 
in its virtue by the sharpness of the eagle' (the metallic vinegar or essence of 
mercury). As soon as the essence is perfected, and when after its dissolution it 
has taken the colour of the herb called <I>calendule, </I>do not forget to 
reduce it into a spiritual luminous essence, which resembles amber. After this, 
add to it of the ' spread eagle' one half the weight of the election before its 
preparation, and frequently distil the 'stomach of the ostrich' into the matter, 
and thus the election will become much more spiritualized. When the 'stomach of 
the ostrich' is weakened by the labour of digestion, we must strengthen it and 
frequently distil it. Finally, when it has lost all its impurity, add as much 
tartarized quintessence as will rest upon your fingers, until it throws off its 
impurity and rises with it. Repeat this process until the preparation becomes 
white, and this will suffice; for you shall see yourself as gradually it rises 
in the form of the ' exalted eagle,' and with little trouble converts itself in 
its form (like sublimated mercury) ; and that is what we are seeking.</P>
<P>&quot;I tell you in truth that there is no greater remedy in medicine than 
that which lies in this election, and that there is nothing like it in the whole 
world. But not to digress from my purpose, and not to leave this work imperfect, 
observe the manner in which you ought to operate.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The election then being destroyed, as I have said, to arrive at the 
desired end (which is, to make of it a universal medicine for human as well as 
metallic bodies), take your election, rendered light and volatile by the method 
above described.</P>
<P>&quot;Take of it as much as you would wish to reduce it to its perfection, 
and put it in a philosophical egg of glass, and seal it very tightly, that 
nothing of it may respire; put it into an athanor until of itself it resolves 
into a liquid, in such a manner that in the middle of this sea there may appear 
a small island, which daily diminishes, and finally, all shall be changed to a 
colour black as ink. This colour is the raven, or bird which flies at night 
without wings, and which, through the celestial dew, that rising continually 
falls back by a constant circulation, changes into what is called ' the head of 
the raven,' and afterwards resolves into ' the tail of the peacock,' then it 
assumes the hue of the ' tail of a peacock,' and afterwards the colour of the 
feathers of a swan' ; finally acquiring an extreme redness, which marks its 
fiery nature, and in virtue of which it expels all kinds of impurities, and 
strengthens feeble members. This preparation, according to all philosophers, is 
made in a single vessel, over a single furnace, with an equal and continual 
fire, and this medicine, which is more than celestial, cures all kinds of 
infirmities, as well in human as metallic bodies; wherefore no one can 
understand or attain such an arcanum without the help of God: for its virtue is 
ineffable and divine.&quot;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Paradise :</B> From old Persian (Zeud) <I>pairedaeza </I>an enclosure, a 
walled-in place; Old Persian <I>pain, </I>around <I>dig, </I>to mould, form, 
shape (hence to form a wall of earth).</P><I>
<P>Paradise </I>has been sought for or located in many regions of the earth. In 
Tartary, Armenia, India, and China on the banks of the Euphrates and of the 
Ganges; in Mesopotamia, Syria, Persia, Arabia, Palestine, and Ethiopia, and near 
the mountains of Libanus and Anti-libanus. Perhaps the most noteworthy tradition 
is that which fixes its situation in the Island of Ceylon, the Serendib of the 
ancient Persians, and the Taprobane of the Greek geographers. It is from the 
summit of Hamalleel or Adam&rsquo;s Peak,&quot; says Percival in his history of 
Ceylon, that Adam took his last view of <I>Paradise </I>before he quitted it 
never to return. The spot on which his feet stood at the moment is still 
supposed to be found in an impression on the summit of the mountain, resembling 
the print of a man's foot, but more than double the ordinary size. After taking 
this farewell view, the father of mankind is said to have gone over to the 
continent of Judea, which was at that time joined to the island, but no sooner 
had he passed Adam's Bridge than the sea closed behind him, and cut off all 
hopes of return. This tradition, from whatever source it was derived, seems to 
be interwoven with the earliest notions of religion entertained by the 
Cingalese; and it is difficult to conceive that it could have been engrafted on 
them without forming an original part. I have frequently had the curiosity to 
converse with black men of different castes concerning this tradition of Adam. 
All of them, with every appearance of belief, assured me that it was really 
true, and in support of it produced a variety of testimonies, old sayings, and 
prophecies, which have for ages been current among them. The origin of these 
traditions I do not pretend to trace; but their connection with Scripture 
history is very evident, and they afford a new instance how universally the 
opinions with respect to the origin of man coincide.&quot; We are further 
informed by this writer that a large chair fixed in a rock near the summit of 
the mountain is said to be the workmanship of Adam. It has the appearance of 
having been placed there at a very distant period, but who really placed it 
there, or for what purpose, it is impossible for any European to 
discover.&quot;</P><I>
<P>Paradise </I>is a word of Persian origin, adopted by the Greeks, and 
literally denotes an inclosure or park planted with fruit-trees, and abounding 
with various animals. Eden is not termed <I>Paradise </I>in Genesis, but simply 
a garden planted eastwards in the country or district so called; and it is this 
apparently indefinite locality which has caused so many conjectures as to its 
exact site. Some place it in Judea, where is now the sea of Galilee; others in 
Armenia, near Mount Ararat; and others in Syria, towards the sources of the 
Orontes, the Chrysorrhoas, and Barrady. Some think that by Eden is meant the 
whole earth, which was of surprising beauty and fertility before the Fall; and 
it is curious that a notion proved to a great extent among the various nations, 
that the Old World was under a curse, and that the earth became very barren. We 
are also assured that the Hindoos and Chinese believe that all nature is 
contaminated, and that the earth labours undre some dreadful defilement-a 
sentiment which could only result from obscure traditions connected with the 
first human pair. Josephus gravely says that the Sacred Garden was watered by 
one river which ran round the whole earth, and was divided into four parts but 
he appears to think <I>Paradise </I>was merely a figurative or allegorical 
locality. Some of the natives of Hindostan have traditions of a place resembling 
<I>Paradise </I>on the banks of the Ganges; but their accounts are so completely 
blended with their superstitions, and with their legends respecting the Deluge 
and the second peopling of the world, as to be, to a certain extent, 
unintelligible. A writer who had diligently studied the Indian Puranas for many 
years, opened a new source of information, and placed Eden on the Imaus 
Mountains of India. ' It appears from Scripture,&quot; he says, &quot;that Adam 
and Eve lived in the countries to the eastward of Eden ; for at the eastern 
entrance of it God placed the angel with the flaming sword This is also 
confirmed by the Puranics, who place the progenitor of mankind on the 
mountainous regions between Cabul and the Ganges, on the banks of which, in the 
hills, they show a place where he resorted occasionally for religious purposes. 
It is frequented by pilgrims. At the entrance of the passes leading to the place 
where I suppose was the Garden of Eden, and to the eastward of it, the Hindoos 
have placed a destroying angel, who appears, and it is generally represented 
like a cherub; I mean Garudha, or the Eagle, upon whom Vishnu and Jupiter are 
represented riding. Garudha is represented generally like an eagle, but in his 
compound character somewhat like the cherub. He is represented like a young man, 
with the countenance, wings, and talons of the eagle. In Scripture the Deity is 
represented riding upon a cherub, and flying upon the wings of the wind. Garudha 
is called Vahan (literally the Vehicle) of Vishnu or Jupiter, and he thus 
answers to the cherub of Scripture; for many commentators derive this word from 
the obsolete root c&rsquo;harab, in the Chaldean language, a word implicitly 
synonymous with the Sanscrit Vahan.&quot; We may here add, that the Puranics 
considered the north-west part of India, about Cashmere, as the site of 
<I>Paradise, </I>and the original abode of the first human pair; and that there, 
at the offering of a sacrifice Daksha was murdered by his jealous brother, who 
was inconsequence doomed to become a fugitive on the earth.</P>
<P>In the fabled Meru of the Hindoo mythology, on the other hand, we have also a 
descriptive representation of the Mosaical Garden of Eden. Meru is a conical 
mountain, the exact locality of. which is not fixed; but as the Hindoo 
geographers considered the earth as a flat table, and the sacred mountain of 
Meru rising in the middle, it became at length their decided conviction that 
Meru was the North Pole, from their action that the North Pole was the highest 
part of the world. So firmly we are told, was this tradition believed, that 
although some Hindoo writers admitted that Mount Meru must be situated in the 
central part of Asia, yet rather than relinquish their notion of and 
predilection for the North Pole as the real locality of their <I>Paradise, 
</I>they actually forced the sun out of the ecliptic, and placed the Pole on the 
elevated plains of the Lesser Bokhara. If we, however, examine the Hindoo 
description of this <I>Paradise, </I>we shall at once be able to trace its 
origin and its close analogy to the Mosaic account.</P>
<P>The summit of Meru is considered as a circular plain of vast extent, 
surrounded by a belt of hills-a celestial earth, the abode of immortals, and is 
designated Ida-Vratta, or the Circle of Ida. It is of four different colours 
towards the cardinal points, and is believed to be supported by four enormous 
buttresses of gold, silver, copper and iron. Yet doubts exist as to its real 
appearance, some alleging that its form is that of a square pyramid, others 
maintain that its shape is conical; others that it resembles an inverted cone; 
while others thought, that instead of a circular belt of mountains, Meru 
terminated in three lofty peaks. The Sawas assert that a vast river rises from 
the head of their deity Siva, and the Vaishnawas that it springs' from beneath 
the feet of Vishnu, and, after passing through the circle of the moon, falls 
upon the summit of Meru, and divides itself into four streams, flowing towards 
the four cardinal points. Others believe that the four rivers of the sacred 
mountain spring from the roots of Jambri, a tree of immense size which, they 
say, conveys the most extensive and profound knowledge, and accomplishes the 
most desirable of human aspirations. The reader will recollect the Mosaical 
account of the Tree of Knowledge, which stood in the middle of the Garden, and 
of the river which went out of Eden to water it, dividing itself into four 
branches or streams of other rivers.</P>
<P>The river thus rising in Meru, the Hindoos further say, flows in four 
opposite directions to the four cardinal points and is supposed to issue from 
four rocks, carved in the shape of so many different animals, one of which is a 
cow; and this, they allege, is the origin of the Ganges. Some among them, 
however, think that this river first flows round the sacred city of Brahma, and 
then discharges itself into a lake called Mansarovara, from which it issues 
through the rocky heads of four animals to the different divisions of the globe. 
The cow's head, from which issues the Ganges, they place towards the south; and 
towards the north is the tiger, or lion's head. The horse's head is on the west, 
and on the east is that of the elephant.</P>
<P>The traditions of Cashmere represent that country as the original site of 
<I>Paradise, </I>and the abode of the first human pair; and the Buddhists of 
Thibet hold opinion respecting the mountain Meru similar to those of the 
Hindoos. They locate the sacred Garden, however, at the foot of the mountain, 
near the source of the Ganges; but the four holy rivers are made to issue 
through the heads of the same animals, which are believed to be the guardians of 
the divisions of the world. The tree of knowledge, or of life, they designate 
Zambri, which, they say, is a celestial tree, bearing immortal fruit, and 
flourishes near four vast rocks, from which issue the several rivers which water 
the world.</P>
<P>The Mussulmans inhabiting the adjacent countries have adopted the popular 
belief that <I>Paradise </I>was situated in Cashmere, adding that when the first 
man was driven from it, he and his wife wandered separately for some time. They 
met at a place called Bahlaka, or Balk, so called because they mutually embraced 
each other after a long absence. Two gigantic statues, which they say, are yet 
to be seen between Bahlaka and Bamiyan, represent Adam and Eve, and a third of 
smaller dimensions is that of their son Seish or Seth, whose tomb, or its site, 
is pointed out near Bahlaka.</P>
<P>Some of the writers seriously maintained that <I>Paradise </I>was under the 
North Pole, arguing upon an idea of the ancient Babylonians and Egyptians, that 
the ecliptic or solar way was originally at right angles to the Equator, and so 
passed directly over the North Pole. The opinion generally entertained by the 
Mahomedans that it was in one of the seven heavens, is not more ridiculous than 
the preceding supposition. Dr. Clarke sums up the extravagant theories 
respecting the locality of <I>Paradise. &quot; </I>Some place it as follows :-In 
the third heaven, others in the fourth, some within the orbit of the moon, 
others in the moon itself, some in the middle regions of the air, or beyond the 
earth's attraction, some da the earth, others under the earth, and others within 
the earth.&quot;</P>
<P>Before leaving the East, it may be observed that the Orientals generally 
reckon four sites of <I>Paradise </I>in Asia the first Ceylon, already mentioned 
; the second in Chaldea the third in a district of Persia, watered by a river 
called the Nilab; and the fourth about Damascus in Syria, and near the springs 
of the Jordan. This last supposed site is not peculiar to the Oriental writers, 
as we find it maintained by some Europeans, especially Heidegger, Le Clerc, and 
Hardouin. The following are the traditions believed by the inhabitants of the 
city of Damascus-a city which the Emperor Julian the Apostate styled the Eye of 
all the East, the most sacred and most magnificent Damascus.</P>
<P>&quot;I understand,&quot; says Lamartine,&quot; that Arabian traditions 
represent this city and its neighbourhood to form paradise the site of the lost 
<I>Paradise, </I>and certainly I should think that no place upon earth was 
better calculated to answer ones ideas of Eden. The vast and fruitful plain, 
with the seven branches of the blue stream which irrigate it-the majestic 
framework of the mountains-the glittering lakes which reflect the heaven upon 
the earth-its geographical situation between the two seas-the perfection of the 
climate - every thing indicates that Damascus has at least been one of the first 
towns that were built by the children of men - one of the natural halts of 
fugitive humanity in primeval times. It is, in fact, one of those sites pointed 
out by the hand of God for a city-a site predestined to sustain a capital like 
Constantinople.&quot; According to the Orientals, Damascus stands on the site of 
the Sacred Garden, and without the city is the most beautiful meadow divided by 
the river Barrady, of the red earth of which Adam is alleged to have been 
formed. This field is designated Ager Damascenus by the Latins, and nearly in 
the centre of it a pillar formerly stood, intended to mark the precise spot 
where the Creator breathed into the first man the breath of life.</P>
<P>The numerous traditions which existed among ancient nations of the Garden of 
Eden doubtless originated those curious and. magnificent gardens designed and 
planted by the Eastern princes, such as the Golden Garden of Aristobulus, King 
of the Jews, which was consecrated by Pompey to Jupiter Capitolinus. Nor is 
mythology deficient in similar legends. We have the Gardens of Jupiter, of 
Alcinous, and of the Fortunate Islands, but especially of the Hesperides, in 
which not oily the primeval <I>Paradise, </I>but traditions of the Tree of 
Knowledge of good and evil, and of the original promise made to the woman, are 
prominently conspicuous. The Garden of the Hesperides produced golden fruit, 
guarded by a dangerous serpent-that this fierce reptile encircled with its folds 
a mysterious tree - and that Hercules procured the fruit by encountering and 
killing the serpent. The story of the constellation, as related by Eratosthenes, 
is applicable to the Garden of Eden, and the primeval history of mankind. 
&quot;This serpent,&quot; says that ancient writer, alluding to the 
constellation, &quot;is the same as that which guarded the golden apples, and 
was slain by Hercules. For, when the gods offered presents to Juno on her 
nuptials with Jupiter, the Earth also brought golden apples. Juno, admiring 
their beauty, commanded them to be planted in the garden of the gods; but 
finding that they were continually plucked by the daughter of Atlas, she 
appointed a vast serpent to guard them. Hercules overcame and slew the monster. 
Hence, in this constellation the serpent is depicted rearing its head aloft, 
while Hercules, placed above it with one knee bent, tramples with his foot upon 
its head. and brandishes a club in his right hand.&quot; The Greeks placed the 
Garden of the Hesperides close to Mount Atlas, and then removed it far into the 
regions of Western Africa yet all knowledge of its Asiatic site was not erased 
from the classical mythologists, for Apollodorus tells us that certain writers 
situated it not in the Libyan Atlas, hut in the Atlas of the Hyperboreans; and 
he adds, that the serpent had the faculty of uttering articulate sounds.</P>
<P>Our Teutonic ancestors believed that the world was originally a <I>Paradise, 
</I>and its first inhabitants more than human, whose dwelling was a magnificent 
hall, glittering with fine gold, where love, and joy, and friendship presided. 
The most insignificant of their utensils were made of gold, and hence the 
appellation of the Golden age. But this happiness was soon overthrown by certain 
women from the country of the giants, to whose seductions the first mortals 
yielded, and their innocence and integrity were lost for ever. The transgression 
of Eve is the obvious prototype of the fatal curiosity of Pandora; and the 
arrival of women <I>from </I>the country of the giants, and their intercourse 
with a distinct and purer line of mortals, can scarcely fail of bringing 
forcibly to our recollection the marriages of the sons of Seth with the 
daughters of Cain, with were the principal causes of the universal depravity of 
the Antediluvians.</P>
<P>The legends of Hindostan also supply us with accounts of the happiness of 
<I>Paradise </I>in the Golden Age of the classic mythology. &quot; There can 
arise little doubt,&quot; says Maurice, &quot;that by the Satya age, or Age of 
Perfection, the Brahmins obviously allude to the state of perfection and 
happiness enjoyed by man in <I>Paradise. </I>It is impossible to explain what 
the Indian writers assert concerning the universal purity of manners, and the 
luxurious and unbounded plenty prevailing in that primitive era, without this 
supposition. Justice, truth, philanthrophy, were then practised among all the 
orders and classes of mankind. There was then no extortion, no circumvention, no 
fraud, used in the dealings one with another. Perpetual oblations smoked on the 
altars of the Deity; every tongue uttered praises, and every heart glowed with 
gratitude to the Supreme Creator. The gods, in token of their approbation of the 
conduct of mortals, condescended frequently to become incarnate, and to hold 
personal intercourse with the yet undepraved race, to instruct them in arts and 
sciences; to unveil their own sublime functions and pure nature; and to make 
them acquainted with the economy of those celestial regions into which they were 
to be immediately translated, when the period of their terrestial probation 
expired.&quot;</P>

<P>Paraskeva, Saint :</B> A saint of the Russian Calendar, whose feast day is 
August <B>3</B>rd. On that day pilgrims from all parts of Russia congregate in 
St. Petersburg for the purpose of casting out devils. A newspaper report of the 
proceedings as they. occurred in <B>1913</B> is as follows:-</P>
<P>&quot;Another <I>St. Paraskevas </I>day has come and gone. The usual 
fanatical scenes have been enacted in the suburbs of St. Petersburg, and the 
ecclesiastical authorities have not protested, nor have the police intervened. 
Special trains have again been run to enable thousands of the lower classes to 
witness a spectacle, the toleration of which will only be appreciated by those 
acquainted with the writings of M. Pobiedonostzeff, the late Procurator of the 
Holy Synod. The Church of <I>St. Paraskeva </I>is situated in a factory district 
of the city. On the exterior side of one of the walls is an image of the Saint, 
to whom is attributed the power of driving out devils and curing epileptics, 
neurotics, and others by miraculous intervention. At the same time, the day is 
made a popular holiday, with games and amusements of all sorts, booths and 
lotteries, refreshment stalls and drinking bars. The newspapers publish detailed 
accounts of this year's proceedings without comment, and it is perhaps 
significant that the <I>Novoe Vremya, </I>a pillar of orthodoxy, ignores them 
altogether. Nor is this surprising when one reads of women clad in a single 
undergarment with bare arms being hoisted up by stalwart peasants to the level 
of the image in order to kiss it, and then having impure water and unclarified 
oil forced down their throats. The treatment of the first sick woman is typical 
of the rest. One young peasant lifted her in the air, two others held her arms 
fully extended, while a fourth seized her loosened hair, and, dragging her head 
from side to side and up and down, shouted &quot; Kiss, kiss <I>St. 
Paras</I>keva &quot; The woman's garment was soon in tatters. She began 
groaning. One of the men exclaimed : &quot; Get out I Satan I Say where thou art 
lodged I &quot; The woman's head was polled back by the hair, her month was 
forced open. and mod-coloured water (said to be holy water) was poured into it. 
She spat the water out, and was heard to moan, &quot; Oh, they are drowning 
me!&quot; The young man exultantly exclaimed, &quot;So we've got you, devil, 
have we? Leave her at once or we will drown you!&quot; He continued pouring 
water into the victim's mouth, and after that unclarified oil. Her lips were 
held closed, so that she was obliged to swallow it. The unfortunate woman was 
again raised and her face pressed against the image. &quot; Kiss it ! kiss it!, 
she was commanded, and she obeyed. She was asked who was the cause of her being 
&quot;possessed.&quot; &quot;Anna,&quot; was the whispered reply. Who was Anna? 
What was her village ? In which cottage did she live? A regular inquisition. The 
physical and mental sufferings of the first victim lasted about an hour, at the 
end of which she was handed over to her relatives, after a cross had been given 
to her, as it was found that she did not own one. According to accounts 
published by the <I>Retch, Molva, </I>etc., many other women were treated in the 
same fashion, the exercises lasting a whole day and night. The men &quot; 
pilgrims&quot; would seem to have been less severely handled. It is explained 
that the idea of unclothing the woman is that there should be no knot, bow, or 
fastening where the devil and his coadjutors could find a lodgment. And one is 
left with the picture of scores of women crawling around the church on their 
knees, invoking the aid of the Almighty for the future or His pardon for sins 
committed in the past.&quot;</P>
<P>The treatment of the &quot; possessed&quot; is analogous to that employed by 
many barbarous peoples for the casting out of devils, and notably among the 
Chams of Cambodia (q.v.) who force the possessed to eat garbage in order to 
disgust the fiend they harbour. <I>(See </I>also Obsession.)</P>

<P>Pasqually, Martinez de :</B> (Kabalist and Mystic). [<B>1715</B> 
?-<B>1779</B>]. The date of <I>Martinez Pasqually&rsquo;s </I>birth is not known 
definitely while even his nationality is a matter of uncertainty. It is commonly 
supposed, however, that he was born about <B>1715</B>, somewhere in the south of 
France ; while several writers have maintained that his parents were Portuguese 
Jews, but this theory has frequently been contested. It is said that from the 
outset he evinced a predilection for mysticism in its various forms, while it is 
certain that, in <B>1754</B>, he instituted a Kabalistic rite, which was gleaned 
from Hebraic studies, and whose espousers were styled <I>Cohens, </I>this being 
simply the Hebrew for priests. He propagated this rite in (livers masonic lodges 
of France, notably those of Marseilles, Toulouse, Bordeaux and Paris; while in 
<B>1768</B> we find him settled in the French capital, gathering round him many 
people addicted to mysticism. and impregnating them with his theories. His 
sojourn here was cut short eventually, nevertheless, for he heard that some 
property had been bequeathed to him in the island of St. Dominique, and he 
hastened thither with intent to assert his rights ; but he did not return to 
France, his death occurring in <B>1779</B> at Port-au-Prince, the principal town 
in the island aforesaid.</P><I>
<P>Pasqually </I>is credited with 'having written a book, <I>La Reintigration, 
</I>but this was never published. As regards the philosophy which he 
promulgated, he appears to have believed partly in the inspiration of the 
Scriptures, the downfall of the angels, the theory of original sin, together 
with the doctrine of justification by faith ; but he seems to have held that man 
existed in an elemental state long before the creation detailed in Genesis, and 
was gradually evolved into his present form. In short, <I>Pasqually </I>was 
something of an anticipator of endless modern theorists nor did he fail to find 
a disciple who regarded him as a prophet and master, this being Louis Claude de 
St. Martin, a theosophist frequently styled in France &quot; le philosophe 
inconnu,&quot; who founded the sect known as Martinistes. The reader will find 
some account of St. Martin in an article headed with his name.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Path, The :</B> Is a term which represents an important theosophical 
teaching, and it is used in different senses to denote not only the <I>Path 
</I>itself but also the Probationary Path along which a man must journey before 
he can enter on the former. Impelled by profound longing for the highest, for 
service of God and his fellows, man first begins the journey and he must devote 
himself wholeheartedly to this service. At his entrance on the Probationary 
Path, he becomes the chela or disciple of one of the Masters or Perfected men 
who have all finished the great journey, and he devotes himself to the acquiring 
of four qualifications which are (<B>1</B>) knowledge of what only is real; 
(<B>2</B>) rejection of what is unreal ; (<B>3</B>) the six mental attributes of 
control over thought, control over outward action, tolerance, endurance, faith 
and balance, these attributes though all necessary in some degree, not being 
necessary in perfect degree; and (<B>4</B>) the desire to be one with God. 
During the period of his efforts to acquire these qualifications, the chela 
advances in many ways, for his Master imparts to him wise counsel; he is taught 
by meditation to attain divine heights unthought of by ordinary man; he 
constantly works for the betterment of his fellows, usually in the hours of 
sleep, and striving thus and in similar directions, he fits himself for the 
first initiation at the entrance to the <I>Path </I>proper, but it may be 
mentioned that he has the opportunity either during his probation or afterwards 
to forego the heavenly life which is his due and so to allow the world to 
benefit by the powers which be - has gained, and which in ordinary course, he 
would utilise in the heavenly life. In this case, he remains in the astral 
world, from whence he makes frequent returns to the physical world. Of 
initiations there are four, each at the beginning of a new stage on the <I>Path, 
</I>manifesting the knowledge of that stage. On the first stage there are three 
obstacles or, as they are commonly termed, fetters, which must be cast aside and 
these are the illusion of self which must be realised to be only an illusion; 
doubt which must be cleared away by knowledge; and superstition which must be 
cleared away by the discovery of what in truth is real. This stage traversed, 
the second initiation follows, and after this comes the consciousness that 
earthly life will now be short, that only once again will physical death be 
experienced, and the man begins more and more to function in his mental body. 
After the third initiation, the man has two other fetters to unloose-desire and 
avension; and now his knowledge becomes keen and piercing and he can gaze deep 
into the heart of things. After the fourth initiation, he enters on the last 
stage and finally frees himself of what fetters remain-the desire for life 
whether bodily or not, and the sense of individual difference from his fellows. 
He has now reached the end of his journey, and is no longer trammelled with sin 
or with anything that can hinder him from entering the state of supreme bliss 
where he is reunited with the divine consciousness. <I>(See

<P>Peter of Apono :</B> Born in <B>1250</B>, at Apono, near Padua, a 
philosopher, mathematician, and astrologer of no mean skill. He practised physic 
in Paris with so great success that he soon became very rich, but his wealth and 
attainments were annulled by the accusation of sorcery which was brought against 
him. He was said to receive instruction in the seven liberal arts from seven 
spirits which he kept in crystal vessels. To him was ascribed also the curious 
and useful faculty of causing the money he spent to return to his own purse. His 
downfall was brought about by an act of revenge for which he was called to 
account by the Inquisition.' A neighbour of his had been possessed of a spring 
of excellent water in his garden, from which he allowed <I>Peter of Apono </I>to 
drink at will. For some reason or another the permission was withdrawn, and 
<I>Peter, </I>with the assistance of the Devil, caused the water to leave the 
garden and flow uselessly in some distant street. Ere the trial was finished the 
unfortunate physician died, but so hitter were the inquisitors against him that 
they ordered his bones to be dug up and burned. This public indignity to his 
memory was averted by some of his friends, who, hearing of the vindictive 
sentence, secretly removed his remains from the burying-ground where they lay. 
The inquisitors thereupon satisfied their animosity by burning him in 
effigy.</P>

<P>Philalethes, Eirenaeus :</B> (circa, <B>1660</B>) Alchemist. The life of this 
alchemist is wrapped in mystery, albeit a considerable mass of writing stands to 
his credit. The heading of this article is, of course, mere pseudonym, and, 
though some have tried hard to identify the writer who bore it with one Thomas 
Vaughan, a brother of Henry Vaughan, the &quot;Silurist &quot; poet, this theory 
is not supported by any very sound evidence. Others have striven to identify 
<I>Philalethes </I>with George Starkey, the quack doctor and author of <I>Liquor 
Alchahest; </I>but then, Starkey died of the plague in London in <B>1661</B>, 
whereas it is known that <I>Eirenaeus </I>was living for some years after that 
date. He appears, also, to have been on intimate terms with Robert Boyle, and, 
though this points to his having spent a considerable time in England, it is 
certain on the other hand that he emigrated to America. Now Starkey, it will be 
remembered, was born in the Bermudas, and practised his spurious medical crafts 
in the English settlements in America, where, according to his contemporary 
biographers, he met <I>Eirenaeus Philalethes. </I>This meeting, then, may have 
given rise to the identification at issue; while it is probably Starkey to whom 
<I>Eirenaeus </I>refers when, in a preface to one of his books, he tells of 
certain of his writings falling into the hands of one who, I conceive, will 
never return them,&quot; for in <B>1654</B> Starkey issued a volume with the 
title, <I>The Marrow of Alchemy by Eirenaeus Philopenus Pizilalethes.</I></P>
<P>It is to these prefaces by <I>Philalethes </I>that we must chiefly look for 
any information about him, while in the thirteenth chapter of his <I>Introitus 
Apertus ad Occlusum Regis Palatium </I>(Amsterdam, <B>1667</B>) he makes a few 
autobiographical avowals which illuminate his character and career. For we are 
like Cain, driven <I>from </I>the pleasant society we formerly had,&quot; he 
writes, and this suggests that he was persecuted on account of his alchemistic 
predilections; while elsewhere he heaps scorn on most of the hermetic 
philosophers of his day, and elsewhere, again, he vituperates the popular 
worship of money-getting. &quot; I disdain, loathe, and detest the idolizing of 
silver and gold,&quot; he declares, &quot;by which the pomps and vanities of the 
world are celebrated. Ah! filthy, evil, ah! vain nothingness.&quot; That is 
vigorously written, and indeed nearly everything from the pen of <I>Philalethes, 
</I>whether in Latin or in English, proclaims him a writer of some care, skill 
and taste; while his scholarship was considerable also, and it is interesting to 
find that, in his preface to <I>Ripley Revived </I>(London, <B>1678</B>), lie 
gives some account of the authors to whom he felt himself chiefly indebted. 
&quot; For my own part,&quot; he says, &quot; I have cause to honour Bernard 
Trevisan, who is very ingenious, especially in the letter to Thomas of Boulogne, 
when I seriously confess I received the main light in the hidden secret. I do 
not remember that ever I learnt anything from Raymond Lully. . . . I know of 
none like Ripley, though Flamel be eminent.&quot;</P>
<P>Langlet du Fresnoy, in his <I>Histoire de la Philosophie Hermetique, 
</I>refers to numerous unpublished manuscripts by <I>Eirenaeus Philalethes, 
</I>but nothing is known about these to-day, and in conclusion it behoves only 
to cite the more important of those things by the alchemist which were issued in 
book form: <I>Medulla Alchymiae </I>(London, <B>1664</B>), <I>Experimenta de 
Praeperatione Mercurii Sophici </I>(Amsterdam, <B>1668</B>) and <I>Enarratio 
Methodica trium Gebri Medicinarurn </I>(Amsterdam, <B>1668</B>.)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Philosopher's Stone :</B> A substance which enabled adepts in alchemy to 
compass the transmutation of metals. <I>(See </I>Alchemy.) It was imagined by 
the alchemists that some one definite substance was essential to the success of 
the transmutation of metals. By the application or admixture of this substance 
all metals might he transmuted into gold or silver. It was often designated the 
Powder of Projection. Zosimus, who lived at the commencement of the fifth 
century is one of the first who alludes to it. He says that the stone is a 
powder or liquor formed of diverse metals, infusioned under a favourable 
constellation. The <I>Philosopher's Stone </I>was supposed to contain the secret 
not only of transmutation, but of health and life, for through its agency could 
be distilled the Elixir of Life. It was the touchstone of existence. The author 
of a <I>Treatise on Philosophical and Hermetic Chemistry, </I>published in Paris 
in <B>1725</B> says : &quot; Modern philosophers have extracted from the 
interior of mercury a fiery spirit, mineral, vegetable and mutliplicative, in a 
humid concavity in which is found the primitive mercury or the universal 
quintessence. In the midst of this spirit resides the spiritual fluid This is 
the mercury of the philosophers, which is not solid like a metal, nor soft like 
quicksilver, hut between the two. They have retained for a long time this 
Secret, which is the commencement, the middle, and the end of their work. It is 
necessary then to proceed first to purge the mercury with salt and with ordinary 
salad vinegar, to sublime it with vitriol and saltpetre, to dissolve it in 
aqua-fortis, to sublime it again, to calcine it and fix it, to put away part of 
it in salad oil, to distill this liquor for the purpose of separating the 
spiritual water, air, and fire, to fix the mercurial body in the spiritual water 
or to distill the spirit of liquid mercury found in it, to putrefy all, and then 
to raise and exalt the spirit with non-odorous white sulphur that is to say, 
sal-ammoniac-to dissolve this sal-ammoniac in the spirit of liquid mercury which 
when distilled becomes the liquor known as the Vinegar of the Sages, to make it 
pass from gold to antimony three times and afterwards to reduce it by heat, 
lastly to steep this warm gold in very harsh vinegar and allow it to putrefy. On 
the surface of the vinegar it will raise itself in the form of fiery earth of 
the colour of oriental pearls. This is the first operation in the grand work. 
For the second operation; take in the name of God one part of gold and two parts 
of the spiritual water, charged with the sal-ammoniac, mix this noble confection 
in a vase of crystal of the shape of an egg : warm over a soft but continuous 
fire, and the fiery water will dissolve little by little the gold ; this forms a 
liquor which is called by the sages &quot;chaos&quot; containing the elementary 
qualities-cold, dryness, heat and humidity. Allow this composition to putrefy 
until it becomes black; this blackness is known as the ' crow's head' and the ' 
darkness of the sages,' and makes known to the artist that he is on the right 
track. It was also known as the ' black earth.' It must be boiled once more in a 
vase as white as snow; this stage of the work is called the ' swan,' and from it 
arises the white liquor, which is divided into two parts - one white for the 
manufacture of silver, the other red for the manufacture of gold. Now you have 
accomplished the work, and you possess the <I>Philosopher's Stone.</I></P>
<P>&quot;In these diverse operations, one finds many byproducts ; among these is 
the ' green. lion ' which is called also 'azoph,' and which draws gold from the 
more ignoble elements; the ' red lion' which converts the metal into gold; the ' 
head of the crow,' called also the ' black veil of the ship of Theseus,' which 
appearing forty days before the end of the operation predicts its success ; the 
white powder which transmutes the white metals to fine silver; the red elixir 
with which gold is made; the white elixir which also makes silver, and which 
procures long life-it is also called the ' white daughter of the 
philosophers.'</P>
<P>In the lives of the various alchemists we find many notices of the Powder of 
Projection in connection with those adepts who were supposed to have arrived at 
the solution of the grand arcanum. Thus in the <I>Life of Alexander Seton 
</I>(q.v.), a Scotsman who came from Port Seton, near Edinburgh, we find that on 
his various travels on the continent he employed in his alchemical experiments a 
blackish powder, the application of which turned any metal given him into gold. 
Numerous instances are on record of Seton's projections, the majority of which 
are verified with great thoroughness. On one occasion whilst in Holland, he went 
with some friends from the house at which he was residing to undertake an 
alchemical experiment at another house near by. On the way thither a quantity of 
ordinary zinc was purchased, and this Seton succeeded in projecting into pure 
gold by the application of his powder. A like phenomenon was undertaken by him 
at Cologne, and elsewhere throughout Germany, and the extremist torture could 
not wring from him the secret of the quintessence he possessed. His pupil or 
assistant, Sendivogius, made great efforts to obtain the secret from him before 
he died, hut all to no purpose. However, out of gratitude Seton bequeathed him 
what remained of his marvellous powder, which was employed by his Polish 
successor with the same results as had been achieved in his own case. The 
wretched Sendivogius fared badly, however, when the powder at last came to an 
end. He had used it chiefly in liquid form, and into this he had dipped silver 
coins which immediately had become the purest gold. Indeed it is on record that 
one coin, of which he had only immersed the half, remained for many years as a 
signal instance of the claims of alchemy in a museum or collection somewhere in 
South Germany. The half of this doubloon was gold, while the undipped portion 
had remained silver; but the notice concerning it is scarcely of a satisfactory 
nature. When the powder gave out, Sendivogius was driven to the desperate 
expedient of gilding the coins, which, report says, he had heretofore transmuted 
by legitimate means, and this very naturally brought upon him the wrath of those 
who had trusted him. <I>(See </I>Seton.)</P>
<P>In the <I>Tale of the Anonymous Adept </I>we also find a powder in use, and 
indeed the powder seems to have been the favoured form of the transmuting 
agency. The term <I>Philosopher's Stone </I>probably arose from some Eastern 
talismanic legend. Yet we find in Egyptian alchemy-the oldest-the idea of the 
black powder-the detritus or oxide of all the metals mingled. <I>(See 
</I>Egypt.)</P>
<P>The <I>Philosopher's Stone </I>had a spiritual as well as a material 
conception attached to it, and indeed spiritual alchemy is practically 
identified with it ; but we do not find the first alchemists, nor those of 
medieval times, possessed of any spiritual ideas ; their hope was to manufacture 
real gold. and it is only in later times that we find the altruistic idea 
creeping in, to the detriment of the physical one. Symbolic language was largely 
used by both schools, however, and we must not imagine that because an 
alchemical writer employs symbolical figures of speech that he is of the 
transcendental school, as his desire was merely to be understanded of his 
brother adepts, and to conserve his secret from the vulgar. <I>(See

<P>Phreno-Mesmerism</B> (or Phrenopathy) <B>:</B> An application of the 
principles of <I>Mesmerism </I>to the science of phrenology. <I>Mesmerism 
</I>and phrenology had for some time been regarded by the English mesmerists as 
related sciences when it was discovered that a somnambule whose 
&quot;bumps&quot; were touched by the fingers of the operator would respond to 
the stimulus by exhibiting every symptom of the mental trait corresponding to 
the organ touched. Thus signs of joy, grief, destructiveness, combativeness, and 
friendship might be exhibited in rapid succession by the entranced patient. 
Among those who claimed to have discovered the new science were Dr. Collyer, a 
pupil of Dr. Elliotson's and the Rev. Laroy Sunderland, though the former 
afterwards repudiated it. As time went on enterprising phreno-mesmerists 
discovered many new cerebral organs as many as a hundred and fifty being found 
beside those already mapped out by Spurzheim and Gall. Among its supporters 
<I>phreno-mesmerism </I>numbered the distinguished hypnotist Braid, who 
expressed himself fully satisfied of its reality. He has recorded a number of 
cases in which the patient correctly indicated by his actions the organs 
touched, though demonstrably ignorant of phrenological laws, and inaccessible to 
outside information. Braid himself offers but a very halting and inadequate 
physiological explanation, and since he may be supposed to have been fully alive 
to the factors of suggestion and hyperaesthesia, it would seem advisable to 
admit the possibility of mental suggestion, or telepathy, by means of which the 
expectation of the operator, reproducing itself in the mind of the patient, 
would give rise to the corresponding reactions.</P>

<P>Phrygian Cap :</B> Hargrave Jennings, in his <I>Rosicrucians. Their Rites and 
Mysteries, </I>says that the <I>Phrygian Cap, </I>the classic Mithraic Cap, 
sacrificial Cap, and mitre all derive from one common ancestor. The Mithraic or 
<I>Phrygian Cap </I>is the origin of the priestly mitre in all faiths. It was 
worn by the priest in sacrifice. When worn by a male, it had its crest, comb. or 
point, set jutting forward ; when worn by a female, it bore the same prominent 
part of the cap in reverse, or on the nape of the neck, as in the instance of 
the Amazon's helmet, displayed in all old sculptures, or that of Pallas-Athene, 
as exhibited in the figures of Minerva, The peak, pic, or point, of caps or hats 
(the term &quot; cocked hat&quot; is a case in point) all refer to the same 
idea. This point had a sanctifying meaning afterwards attributed to it, when it 
was called the christa, crista, or crest, which signifies a triumphal top, or 
tuft. The &quot; Grenadier Cap,&quot; and the loose black Hussar Cap, derive 
remotely from the same sacred, Mithraic, or emblematical bonnet, or high 
pyramidal cap. It, in this instance, changes to black, because it is devoted to 
the illustration of the &quot; fire-workers&quot; (grenadiers) who, among modern 
military, succeed the Vulcanists, Cyclopes, classic &quot; smiths,&quot; or 
servants of Vulcan, or Mulciber, the artful worker among the metals in the fire, 
or amidst the forces of nature. This idea will be found by a reference to the 
high cap among the Persians, or Fire-worshippers; and to the black cap among the 
Bohemians, and in the East. All travellers in Eastern lands will remember that 
the tops of the minarets reminded them of the high-pointed black caps of the 
Persians.</P>
<P>The <I>Phrygian Cap </I>is a most recondite antiquarian form; the symbol 
comes from the highest antiquity. It is displayed on the head of the figure 
sacrificing in the celebrated sculpture, called the &quot; Mithraic 
Sacrifice&quot; (or the Mythical Sacrifice) in the British Museum. This loose 
cap, with the point protruding, gives the original form from which all helmets 
or defensive headpieces, whether Greek or Barbarian, deduce. As a <I>Phrygian 
Cap, </I>or Symbolising Cap, it is always sanguine in its colour. It then stands 
as the&quot; Cap of Liberty&quot; a revolutionary form; also, in another way, it 
is even a civic or incorporated badge. It is always masculine in its meaning. It 
marks the &quot; needle &quot; of the obelisk, the crown or tip of the phallus, 
whether &quot; human&quot; or representative. It has its origin in the rite of 
circumcision-unaccountable as are both the symbol and the rite.</P>
<P>The real meaning of the bonnet rouge, or cap of liberty, has been involved 
from time immemorial in deep obscurity, notwithstanding that it has always been 
regarded as the most important hieroglyph or figure. It signifies the 
supernatural simultaneous &quot;sacrifice&quot; and &quot;triumph.&quot; It has 
descended from the time of Abraham, and it is supposed to emblem the strange 
mythic rite of the &quot; circumcisio preputii,&quot; The loose <I>Phrygian 
</I>bonnet conique, or &quot; cap of liberty,&quot; may be accepted as figuring, 
or standing for, that detached integument or husk, separated from a certain 
point or knob, which has various names in different languages, and which 
supplies the central idea of this sacrificial rite - the spoil or refuse of 
which (absurd and unpleasant as it may seem) is borne aloft at once as a 
&quot;trophy'.' and as the&quot; cap of liberty.&quot; It is now a magic sign, 
and becomes a talisman of supposedly inexpressible power-from what particular 
dark reason it may be difficult to say. The whole is a sign of &quot; 
initiation,&quot; and of baptism of a peculiar kind. The <I>Phrygian Cap, 
</I>ever after this first inauguration, has stood as the sign of the 
&quot;Enlightened.&quot; The heroic figures in most Gnostic Gems, have caps of 
this kind. The sacrificer in the sculptured group of the &quot; Mithraic 
Sacrifice,&quot; among the marbles in the British Museum, has a <I>Phrygian Cap 
</I>on his head, whilst in the act of striking the bull with the poniard-meaning 
the office of the immolating priest. The bonnet conique is the mitre of the Doge 
of Venice.</P>
<P>Cinteotl, a Mexican god of sacrifice, wears such a cap made from the 
thigh-skin of an immolated virgin. This head-dress is shaped like a cock's 
comb.</P>
<P>Besides the bonnet rouge, the Pope's mitre-nay, all mitres or conical 
head-coverings-have their name from the terms &quot;Mithradic,&quot; or &quot; 
Mithraic,&quot; The origin of the whole class of names is Mittra, or Mithra. The 
cap of the grenadier, the shape of which is alike all over Europe, is related to 
the Tartar lambskin caps, which are dyed black; and it is black also from its 
associations with Vulcan and the &quot; Fire-worshippers &quot; (Smiths). The 
Scotch Glengarry cap will prove on examination to be only a &quot;cocked&quot; 
<I>Phrygian. </I>All the black conical caps, and the meaning of this strange 
symbol, came from the East. The loose black fur cap derives from the 
Tartars.</P>
<P>The &quot; Cap of Liberty&quot; (Bonnet Rouge), the Crista or Crest (Male), 
and the Female (Amazon) helmet, all mean the same idea ; in the instance of the 
female crest the knob is, however, depressed.</P>

<P>Physical World :</B> Formerly known as the Sthula Plane - is in the 
theosophic scheme of things the lowest of the seven worlds, the world in which 
ordinary man moves and is conscious under normal conditions. It is the limit of 
the ego's descent into matter, and the matter which composes the appropriate 
physical body, is the densest of any of these worlds. Physical matter has the 
seven divisions of solid, liquid, gas, ether, super-ether, sub-atom and atom, in 
common with the matter of the other worlds. Besides the physical body, familiar 
to ordinary vision, there is a finer body, the etheric double, which plays a 
very important part in collecting vitality from the sun for the use of the 
denser physical body, and reference is made to the articles on the Etheric Body, 
and Chaksams. At death, the physical body and the etheric double are cast aside 
and slowly resolve into their components. <I>(See </I>Worlds, Planes or Spheres,

<P>Piper, Mrs. :</B> A famous trance medium, whose discourses and writings 
present the best evidence extant for the actuality of spirit communication. A 
native of America, it was there that <I>Mrs. Piper </I>first became entranced, 
while consulting a professional clairvoyant in <B>1884</B>. Numerous spirits 
purported to control her in these early days-Mrs. Siddons, Longfellow, Bach, to 
mention only the most celebrated-but in <B>1885</B>, when she came under the 
observation of the Society for Psychical Research, her principal control was Dr. 
Phinuit. From that time forward her trance utterances and writings-for after 
<B>1890</B> the communications were generally in writing-were carefully recorded 
and analysed by members of the S.P.R., chiefly under the direction of Dr. 
Hodgson. In <B>1889</B>-<B>90</B> <I>Mrs. Piper </I>visited this country and 
gave many stances, most of which seemed to display supernormal powers in the 
medium. It is impossible in a limited space to detail her remarkable trance 
impersonations. On his death in <B>1905</B> Dr. Hodgson became one of her 
controls; Mr. Myers and Mr. Gurney also controlled her. But perhaps the most 
life-like and convincing impersonation or spirit-manifestation-whichever it may 
have been-was that of George Pelham, a young American author and a friend of Dr. 
Hodgson, who had died suddenly in <B>1892</B>. <I>(See </I><B>Trance 
Personalities.</B>) The information given by this control, his recognition of 
friends, and so on, were <B>50</B> accurate as to convince many that it was 
indeed &quot; G.P.&quot; who spoke.</P>
<P>From that time until <B>1896</B> the stances were especially productive, but 
in the latter year the medium underwent an operation. Phinuit, who often acted 
as a go-between for other controls and the sitter, now took his departure, and a 
band of other spirits, led by the &quot; Imperator&quot; of Stainton Moses, took 
control of <I>Mrs. Piper's </I>organism. The trance writings and utterances 
became fewer, and the spirits recommended that the number of sittings be cut 
down on account of the medium's health. Nevertheless some excellent tests were 
subsequently got with the Piper-Hodgson, Piper-Myers, and Piper-Gurney controls. 
<I>Mrs. Piper </I>was also one of those who took part in the &quot; 
cross-correspondences&quot; sittings held in <B>1906</B> and onwards, the other 
mediums being Mrs. Thompson, Mrs. Verrall, Miss Verrall, Mrs. Holland, Mrs. 
Forbes, etc. </P><I>
<P>(See <B></I>Spiritualism, </B><I>and<B> </I>Cross-Correspondences.</B>) It 
seems clear that in <I>Mrs. Piper's </I>trance phenomena there are evidences of 
some supernormal faculty, at the best, of telepathy, though to the writer even 
that hypothesis seems to be inadequate. It would, for example, be a very 
complicated form of telepathy, that would enable some of these automatic 
cross-correspondence &quot; scripts to be written, in which, say, the scripts 
contain allusions unintelligible to the writers, and requiring a key provided by 
a third script to make them plain. Such a case inevitably suggests that one and 
the same intelligence directs all three mediums. <I>Mrs. Piper's 
</I>impersonation of George Pelham, again, calls for some explanation, since it 
would seem that all the information could hardly have been culled from the 
sitter's minds. <I>(See </I><STRONG>Spiritualism.</STRONG>)</P>

<P>Planchette :</B> An instrument designed for the purpose of communication with 
spirits. It consists of a thin-heart-shaped piece of wood, mounted on two small 
wheel-castors and carrying a pencil, point downwards, for the third support. The 
hand is placed on the wood and the pencil writes automatically, or presumably by 
spirit control operating through the psychic force of the medium.</P>
<P>In <B>1853</B>, a well-known French spiritualist, M. Planchette, invented 
this instrument to which he gave his name. For quite fifteen years it was used 
exclusively by French spiritualists. Then in the year <B>1868</B> a firm of 
toy-makers in America took up the idea and flooded the booksellers' shops with 
great numbers of <I>planchettes. </I>It became a popular mania, and the 
instrument sold in thousands there and in Great Britain. It was, and is, largely 
used simply as a toy and any results obtained that may be arresting and 
seemingly inexplicable are explained by Animal Magnetism or traced to the power 
of subconscious thought.</P>
<P>Amongst spiritualists it has been used for spirit communication. Automatic 
writing has often been developed by use of the <I>planchette, </I>some mediums 
publishing books which, they claimed, were written wholly by their 
spirit-controls through the use of <I>planchettes. </I>Dr. Ashburnes, in his 
<I>Spiritualism Chemically Explained </I>says that the human body is a 
condensation of gases, which constantly exude from the skin in invisible vapour 
- otherwise electricity; that the fingers coming in contact with the 
<I>planchette </I>transmit to it an &quot; odic force,&quot; and thus set it in 
motion. He goes on to say that some people have phosphorous in excess in their 
system and the vapour &quot;thus exuded forms a positively living, thinking, 
acting body, capable of directing a pencil.&quot; There are variations on the 
<I>planchette </I>form such as the <I>dial-planchette </I>which consists of a 
foundation of thick cardboard nine inches square on the face of which the 
alphabet is printed and also the numerals one to ten. There are the words 
&quot;Yes,&quot; &quot; No,&quot; &quot; Goodbye&quot; and &quot; Don't 
know.&quot; These letters, words, and numerals are printed on the outer edge of 
a circle, the diameter of which is about seven inches. In the centre of this 
circle, and firmly affixed to the cardboard, is a block of wood three inches 
square. The upper surface of this block has a circular channel in it and in this 
run balls. Over the balls is placed a circular piece of hard wood, five inches 
in diameter. and attached to the outer edge of this a pointer. The upper piece 
of wood is attached to the lower by an ordinary screw, upon which the upper 
plate revolves when used for communication. Another form is the <I>Ouija 
</I>board on which in a convenient order the letters of the alphabet are printed 
and over which a pointer easily moves under the direction of the hand of the 
person or persons acting as mediums. It is stated that a form of this &quot; 
mystic toy&quot; was in use in the days of Pythagoras, about <B>540</B> B.C. In 
a French history of Pythagoras, the author describing his celebrated school of 
philosophy, asserts that the brother-hood held frequent seances on circles at 
which a mystic table, moving on wheels, moved towards signs inscribed on the 
surface of a stone slab on which the moving-table worked. The author states that 
probably Pythagoras, in his travels among the Eastern nations, observed some 
such apparatus in use amongst them and adapted his idea from them. Another trace 
of some such &quot;communicating mechanism&quot; is found in the legend told by 
the Scandinavian Blomsturvalla how the people of Jomsvikingia in the twelfth 
century had a high priest, one Volsunga, whose predictions were renowned for 
their accuracy throughout the length and breadth of the land. He had in his 
possession a little ivory doll that drew with &quot; a pointed instrument&quot; 
on parchment or &quot; other substance,&quot; certain signs to which the priest 
had the key. The communications were in every case prophetic utterances, and it 
is said in every case came true. The writer who recounts the legend thought it 
probable that the priest had procured the doll in China. In the National Museum 
at Stockholm there is a doll of this description which is worked by mechanism, 
and when wound up walks round and round in circles and occasionally uses its 
right arm to make curious signs with a pointed instrument like a stylo which is 
held in the hand. Its origin and use have been connected with the legend 
recounted above.</P>

<P>Poltergeist :</B> The name given to the supposed supernatural causes of 
outbreaks of rappings, inexplicable noises, and similar disturbances, which from 
time to time have mystified men of science as well as the general public. The 
term <I>poltergeist (i.e., Polter Geist, </I>rattling ghost) is sufficiently 
indicative of the character of these beings, whose manifestations are, at the 
best, puerile and purposeless tricks, and not infrequently display an openly 
mischievous and destructive tendency. The <I>poltergeist </I>is by no means 
indigenous to any one country, nor has he confined his attentions to any 
particular period. Lang mentions several cases belonging to the Middle Ages, and 
one at least which dates so far back as <B>856</B> B.C. In both savage and 
civilised countries this peculiar form of haunting is well known, and it is a 
curious fact that the phenomena are almost identical in every case, The 
disturbances are always observed to be particularly active in the neighbourhood 
of one person, generally a child or a young woman, and preferably an epileptic 
or hysterical subject. According to the theory advanced by spiritualists, this 
centre of the disturbances is a natural medium, through whom the spirits desire 
to communicate with the world of living beings. In earlier times such a person 
was regarded as a witch, or the victim of a witch, whichever supposition was 
best fitted to the circumstances. The <I>poltergeist </I>is represented as a 
development from witch-craft, and the direct forerunner of modern spiritualism, 
and is, in fact, a link between the two.</P>
<P>Turning our attention first to some of the earlier records, we may consider 
briefly the case of the Drummer of Tedworth (<B>1661</B>), and the Epworth Case 
(<B>1716</B>). In both of these instances the manifestations witnessed were of 
the usual order. The spirits, if spirits they were, sought to attract attention 
by familiar childish tricks, and communicated by means of the same cumbrous 
process of knocking. The circumstances of the first-named instance are as 
follow: In <B>1661</B> a' vagrant drummer was, at the instance of Mr. Mompesson 
of Tedworth, taken before a Justice of the Peace, and deprived of his drum, 
which instrument finally found a resting-place in the house of Mr. Mompesson, 
during that gentleman's absence from home. Immediately violent disturbances 
broke out in the house. Loud knockings and thumpings were heard, and the beating 
of an invisible drum. Articles flew recklessly about the rooms, and the 
bedsteads (particularly those in which the younger children lay) were violently 
shaken. After a time the drummer was transported, when the manifestations 
abruptly ceased, but a recurrence of the outbreak synchronised with his return. 
Contemporary opinion put the case down to witchcraft on the part of the drummer, 
but Mr. Podmore and other moderns incline to the belief that the &quot; two 
little modest girls in the bed &quot; had more than a little to do with the 
mysterious knockings and scratchings of the <I>poltergeist. </I>In the famous 
Epworth Case, where the phenomena is well attested by the whole Wesley family, 
and described in numerous contemporary letters, the disturbances comprised all 
the ordinary manifestations of levitations, loud and terrifying noises, and 
rappings, together with apparitions of rabbits, badgers, and so on. Podmore is 
of the opinion that one of the daughters, Hetty, was in some way implicated in 
the affair. She alone did not give an account of the manifestations, though she 
had promised to do so. The <I>poltergeist </I>showed a decided partiality for 
her company - a circumstance which, though not unobserved, does not seem to have 
held any special significance for her family. A more recent case in which a 
charge of witchcraft is involved, is the Cideville case, described by Mr. Lang 
in his <I>Cock Lane and Common Sense, </I>under the heading, ' A Modern Trial 
for Witchcraft.&quot; In <B>1849</B> the Cure of Cideville, Seine Inferieure, 
was summoned to court by a shepherd named Thorel, who alleged that the Cure had 
denounced him for sorcery. In his defence the Cure stated that Thorel himself 
had confessed to having produced by means of sorcery certain mysterious 
manifestations which had disturbed the inmates of the Abbey. During the trial it 
transpired that the Cure, when visiting a sick parishioner, had driven from the 
bedside a man of notorious character, with an evil reputation for sorcery, who 
was about to treat the patient. The sorcerer retired, vowing vengeance on the 
Cure, and was shortly afterwards sent to prison. Later when two little boys. 
pupils of the Cure, were at an auction, they were approached by Thorel, who was 
known as a disciple of the sorcerer. He placed his hand on the head of one of 
the children, and muttered some strange words. When the boys returned to the 
Abbey the <I>poltergeist </I>performances commenced. Violent blows on the walls 
seemed about to demolish them, one of the children complained that he was 
followed <I>by </I>a man's shadow, and other witnesses declared that they had 
seen a grey hand and wreaths of smoke. Some of those who visited the Abbey were 
able to hold a conversation with the spirits by means of knocking. It was agreed 
that sharp-pointed irons should be driven into the walls, and on this being 
done, smoke and flames were seen to issue from the incisions. At last Thorel 
sought the Cure' and confessed that the disturbances were the work of his 
master, the sorcerer. The plaintiff was non-suited, and the judge, in summing 
up, said that the cause of the ' extraordinary facts &quot; of this case &quot; 
remained unknown.' In February, <B>1851</B>, the boys were removed from the 
Abbey, and the disturbances ceased.</P>
<P>Of those instances where a spiritualistic explanation has been offered 
perhaps the most outstanding is the case of the Cock Lane Ghost, almost too 
well-known to call for recapitulation. In <B>1761</B>-<B>2</B> raps and 
scratches were heard in a house in Cock Lane, generally occurring near the bed 
of the little daughter of the house, Elizabeth Parsons. Very soon the 
manifestations became so pronounced that people from all parts of the city were 
crowding to witness them. A code of raps was agreed upon, through which it was 
ascertained that the spirit was that of a lady named &quot;Fanny,&quot; who 
declared that she had been poisoned by her deceased sister's husband, with whom 
she had lodged in the Cock Lane house some two years previously, and expressed a 
wish that he might be hanged. It is, indeed, quite a common thing for the 
<I>poltergeist </I>to reveal a crime, real or imaginary - and more often the 
latter, which is entirely in keeping with the character of the spirit. In the 
Cock Lane affair the manifestations followed the girl when she was removed to 
another house, and she trembled strongly, even in her sleep, on the approach of 
the ghost. The case which presents the most formidably array of evidence, 
however, is that of the Joller family in Switzerland. In <B>1860</B> - two 
serious disturbances broke out in Stans, in the home of M. Joller, a prominent 
lawyer, and a man of excellent character. Knocks were first heard by a 
servant-maid, who also averred that she was haunted by strange grey shapes, and 
the sound of sobbing. In the autumn of <B>1861</B>, she was dismissed and 
another maid engaged. For a time there was peace, but in the summer of 
<B>1862</B> they commenced with redoubled vigour. The wife and seven children of 
M. Joller heard and saw many terrifying sights and sounds, but M. Joller himself 
remained sceptical. At length, however, even he was convinced that neither 
trickery nor imagination would suffice as an explanation of the phenomena. 
Meanwhile the manifestations became more and more outrageous, and continued in 
full view of the thousands of persons who were attracted by curiosity to the 
house, including the Land-Captain Zelger, the Director of Police Jaun, the 
President of the Court of Justice, and other prominent people, some of whom 
suggested that a commission be appointed to examine the house thoroughly. Three 
of the heads of police were deputed to conduct the enquiry. They demanded the 
withdrawal of M. Joller and his family, and remained in the house for six days 
without witnessing anything abnormal, and drew up a report to this effect. 
Directly the Joller family entered the house the interruptions were renewed. M. 
Joller became the butt of ridicule to all, even his political and personal 
friends, and was finally compelled to quit his ancestral home. This is 
undoubtedly one of the most striking cases of <I>poltergeist </I>haunting on 
record. Here, as in almost every instance, there are children evidently and 
Intimately bound up with the manifestations. It is his choice of a medium which 
has directed most suspicion to the <I>poltergeist. </I>and it on this that Mr. 
Podmore bases his assumption that all <I>poltergeist </I>visitations are 
traceable to the cunning tricks of &quot; naughty little girls.&quot; He 
suggests that with the &quot; medium &quot; under careful control it is more 
than probable that the <I>poltergeist </I>will turn shy, and refuse to perform 
his traditional functions There is much to be said for this theory. The medium 
of the spiritualistic seance is frequently credited with the loftiest 
utterances, and the production of literary, musical, and artistic compositions. 
The <I>poltergeist </I>indulges in such futilities as the breaking of crockery, 
the throwing about of furniture, and the materialization of coal and carrots in 
the drawing-room. Why, if they are mature spirits, as they purport to be, should 
they practise such feats of mystification as would seem to be impelled either by 
the foolish vanity of a child, or the cunning impulses of a deranged mind? Then 
there is often a curious hesitancy on the part of the medium, as in the case of 
Hetty Wesley, a trembling on the approach of the phenomena, and a tendency to 
such physical disturbances as epileptic and other fits. And sometimes the 
<I>poltergeist </I>confesses, as did the maid-servant Ann at Stockwell, to 
having manipulated the disturbing occurrences with the aid of wires and 
horsehair. But in such a case as that of the Joller family, the theory of &quot; 
naughty little girls &quot; is childishly inadequate. It is all but impossible 
to believe that children could produce the manifestations in full view of 
hundreds of people. It is still more difficult to understand how children and 
ignorant persons, with presumably no knowledge of previous instances, could fix 
upon exactly the same phenomena which has been produced by the <I>poltergeists 
</I>of every age and clime. And in the Joller case, there is the evidence of 
many spectators that the most violent disturbances were witnessed when the whole 
family were assembled outside the house and thus not in a position to assist the 
manifestations, which included the throwing open of all windows, doors, 
cupboards and drawers,. the materialization of the &quot;thin grey cloud,&quot; 
noises and apparitions. In short, it must be admitted that there is an element 
of mystery which calls for elucidation, and which the most scientific and 
critical minds have hitherto failed to make clear.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Polynesia :</B> Magic in <I>Polynesia </I>is the preserve of the priestly and 
upper classes, although lesser sorcery is practised by individuals not of these 
castes. There is a prevailing belief in what is known as <I>mana, </I>or 
supernatural power, which is resident in certain individuals. The method of 
using this power is twofold. One of these is practised by a society known as the 
<I>Iniat, </I>where certain rites are carried out which are supposed to bring 
calamity upon the enemies of the tribe. The ability to exercise magic is known 
as <I>agagara, </I>and the magician or wizard is <I>tena agagara. </I>If the 
wizard desires to cast magic upon another man, he usually tries to secure 
something that that person has touched with his mouth, and to guard against 
this, the natives are careful to destroy all food-refuse that they do not 
consume, and they carefully gather up even a single drop of blood when they 
receive a cut or scratch, and burn it or throw it into the sea, so that the 
wizard may not obtain it. The wizard having obtained something belonging to the 
person whom he wishes to injure, buries it in a deep hole, together with leaves 
of poisonous plants and sharp-pointed pieces of bamboo, accompanying the action 
by suitable incantations. If he chances to be a member of the <I>Iniat 
</I>society, he will place on the top of the whole one of their sacred stones, 
as they believe that so long as the stone is pressing down the article which has 
been buried in the hole the man to whom it belonged will remain sick. 
Immediately a man falls sick, he sets enquiries on <I>foot </I>as to who has 
bewitched him. and there is always someone to acknowledge the soft impeachment. 
If he does not succeed in having the spell removed he will almost certainly 
succumb. but if he succeeds in having lt taken away, he begins to recover almost 
immediately ; and the strange thing is that he evinces no enmity towards the 
person or persons who &quot; bewitched him,-indeed it is taken as a matter of 
course, and he quietly waits the time when be will be able to return the 
compliment !</P>
<P>These remarks apply for the most part to New Britain, and its system of magic 
is practically the same as that known in Fiji as <I>vakadraunikau </I>concerning 
which very little is known. In ins work <I>Melanesians and Polynesians </I>the 
Rev. Dr. George Brown, the well-known pioneer missionary and explorer, gives an 
interesting account of the magical systems of these people, in which he 
incorporates several informative letters from brother missionaries, which are 
well worth quotation. For example, the Rev. W. E. Bromilow says that at Dobu in 
south-eastern <I>New </I>Guinea :-</P>
<P>&quot;<I>Werabana </I>(evil spirits) are those which inhabit dark places, and 
wander in the night, and give witches their power to smite all round. <I>Barau 
</I>is the wizardry of men, who look with angry eyes out of dark places, and 
throw small stones, first spitting on them, at men, women, and even children, 
thus causing death. A tree falls, it is a witch who caused it to do so, though 
the tree may be quite rotten, or a gust of wind may break it off. A man meets 
with an accident, it is the <I>werabana. </I>He is getting better through the 
influence of the medicine-man, but has a relapse; this is the <I>barau </I>at 
work, as we have ascertained from the terrified shouts of our workmen, as some 
sleeper has called out in a horrid dream. These medicine-men, too, have great 
power, and no wonder, when one of our girls gets a little dust in her eye, and 
the doctor takes a big stone out of it; and when a chief has a pain in the 
chest, and <I>to obaoba </I>takes therefrom a two-inch nail.</P>
<P>&quot;The people here will have it that all evil spirits are female. 
<I>Werabana </I>is the great word, but the term is applied to witches as well, 
who are called the <I>vesses </I>of the <I>werabana, </I>but more often the 
single word is used. I have the names of spirits inhabiting the glens and 
forests, but they are all women or enter into women, giving them terrible 
powers. Whenever any one is sick, it is the <I>werabana </I>who has caused the 
illness, and any old woman who happened to be at enmity with the sick person is 
set down as the cause. A child died the other day, and the friends were quite 
angry because the witches had not heeded the words of the <I>lotu, i.e., </I>the 
Christian religion <I>Taparoro, </I>and given up smiting the little ones. These 
are times of peace, said they, why should the child die then ? ' We, of course, 
took the opportunity and tried to teach them that sickness caused death without 
the influence of poor old women.</P>
<P>&quot;Sorcerers are <I>barau, </I>men whose powers are more terrible than 
those of all the witches. I was talking to a obaoba medicine-man-the other day, 
and I asked him why his taking a stone out of a man's chest did not cure him. 
&lsquo;Oh,' said he, 'he must have been smitten by a <I>barau.' </I>A very 
logical statement this. Cases the <I>to obaoba </I>cannot cure are under the 
fell stroke of the <I>barau, </I>from which there is no escape, except by the 
sorcerer's own incantations.</P>
<P>&quot;The Fijian sorcery of <I>drau-ni-kau </I>appears here in another form 
called <I>sumana </I>or rubbish. The sorcerer obtains possession of a small 
portion of his victim's hair, or skin, or food left after a meal, and carefully 
wraps it up in a parcel, which he sends off to as great a distance as is 
possible. In the meantime he very cunningly causes a report of the <I>sumana 
</I>to be made known to the man whom he wishes to kill, and the poor fellow is 
put into a great fright and dies.&quot;</P>
<P>The Rev. S. B. Fellows gives the following account of the beliefs of the 
people of Kiriwina (Trobiands group):-</P>
<P>&quot;The sorcerers, who are very numerous, are credited with the power of 
creating the wind and rain, of making the gardens to be either fruitful or 
barren, and of causing sick-ness which leads to death. Their methods of 
operation are legion. The great chief, who is also the principal sorcerer, 
claims the sole right to secure a bountiful harvest every year. This function is 
considered of transcendent importance by the people.</P>
<P>&quot;Our big chief, Bulitara, was asking me one day if I had these occult 
powers. When I told him that I made no such claim, he said, Who makes the wind 
and the rain and the harvest in your land? ' I answered, ' God.' 'Ah,' said he, 
' that's it. God does this work for your people, and I do it for our people. God 
and I are equal.' He delivered this dictum very quietly, and with the air of a 
man who had given a most satisfactory explanation.</P>
<P>&quot;But the one great dread that darkens the life of every native is the 
fear of the <I>bogau, </I>the sorcerer who has the power to cause sickness and 
death, who, in the darkness of the night, steals to the house of his 
unsuspecting victim, and places near the doorstep a few leaves from a certain 
tree, containing the mystic power which he, by his evil arts, has imparted to 
them. The doomed man, on going out of his house next morning, unwittingly steps 
over the fatal leaves and is at once stricken down by a mortal sickness. 
Internal disease of every kind is set down to this agency. Bulitara told me the 
mode of his witchcraft. He boils his decoctions, containing numerous 
ingredients, in a special cooking-pot on a small fire, in the secret recesses of 
his own house, at the dead of night; and while the pot is boiling he speaks into 
it an incantation known only to a few persons. The bunch of leaves dipped in 
this is at once ready for use. Passing through the villages the other day, I 
came across a woman, apparently middle-aged, who was evidently suffering from a 
wasting disease, she was so thin and worn. I asked if she had any pain, and her 
friends said 'No.' Then they explained that some bogau was sucking her blood. I 
said, ' How does he do it? ' &lsquo; Oh,' they said, 'that is known only to 
herself. He manages to get her blood which makes him strong, while she gets 
weaker every day, and if he goes on much longer she will die.'</P>
<P>&quot;Deformities at birth, and being born dumb or blind, are attributed to 
the evil influence of disembodied spirits, who inhabit a lower region called 
<I>Tuma. </I>Once a year the spirits of the ancestors visit their native village 
in a body after the harvest is gathered. At this time the men perform special 
dances, the people openly display their valuables, spread out on platforms, and 
great feasts are made for the spirits. On a certain night, when the moon named 
<I>Namarama </I>is at the full, all the people - men, women and children-join in 
raising a great shout, and so drive the spirits back to <I>T'uma.</I></P>
<P>&quot;A peculiar custom prevails of wearing, as charms, various parts of the 
body of a deceased relative. On her breast, suspended by a piece of string round 
her neck, a widow wears her late husband's lower jaw, the full set of teeth 
looking ghastly and grim. The small bones of the arms and legs are taken out 
soon after death, and formed into spoons, which are used to put lime into the 
mouth when eating betel-nut. Only this week a chief died in a village three 
miles from us, and a leg and an arm, for the above purpose, were brought to our 
village by some relatives as their portion of their dead friend.</P>
<P>&quot;An evidence of the passionate nature of this people is seen in the 
comparatively frequent attempts at suicide. Their method is to climb into the 
top branches of a high tree, and, after tying the ankles together, to throw 
them-selves down. During the last twelve months two attempts near our home were 
successful, and several others were prevented. In some cases the causes were 
trivial. One young man allowed his anger to master him because his wife had 
smoked a small piece of tobacco belonging to him; he fell from the tree across a 
piece of root, which was above ground and broke his neck. A woman, middle-aged 
and childless, who had become jealous, climbed into a tree near her house, and 
calling out &quot; Good-bye' to her brother in the village, instantly threw 
herself down. Falling on her head she died in a few hours; the thick skin on the 
scalp was cut, but so far as I could see the skull was not broken.&quot;</P>
<P>Some of the minor magical customs of <I>Polynesia </I>are worthy of note. 
Natives of the Duke of York group believe that by persistent calling upon a man 
whom they wish to get hold of he will by their call be drawn to them, even from 
a great distance. The natives will not eat or drink when at sea. In New Guinea 
and Fiji the custom prevails of cutting off a finger joint in token of mourning 
for a near relative, as do the bushmen of South Africa. <I>(See </I>Magic, 
Prehistoric.) They firmly believe in mermaids, tailed men and dwarfs; and 
regarding these they are most positive in their assertions. The natives of the 
Duke of York group in fact declared to a missionary that they had caught a 
mermaid, who had married a certain native, and that the pair had several of a 
family; but unfortunately,&quot; says the relater of this story, &quot; I could 
never get to see them.&quot; Like many other races, the Polynesians work 
themselves into a great state of terror whenever an eclipse takes place, and 
during the phenomenon they beat drums, shout and invoke their gods.</P>
<P>In Samoa magic is not practised to such an extent as in other Melanesian 
groups, although the sorcerer still exists. He is, however, much more 
sophisticated, and instead of asking merely for any trifling object connected 
with the person whom he desires to bewitch, he demands property, such as 
valuable mats and other things which are of use to him. His <I>modus operandi 
</I>was to get into communication with his god, who entered the sorcerer's body, 
which became violently contorted and convulsed. The assembled natives would then 
hear a voice speaking from behind a screen, probably a ventriloquial effort, 
which asserted the presence of the god invoked. Sickness was generally believed 
to be caused by the anger of some god, who could thus be concealed by the priest 
or wizard and duly placated. The &quot;god&quot; invariably required some 
present of substantial value, such as a piece of land, a canoe, or other 
property, and if the priest happens to know of a particularly valuable object 
belonging to the person who supposed himself bewitched, he stipulates that it 
shall be given up to him. This caste of priests is known as <I>taula-aitu, 
</I>and also act as medicine-men.</P>

<P>Polytrix :</B> This is almost the only example of an inauspicious stone. It 
caused the hair to fall off the head of anyone who had it about his person.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Pontica :</B> A blue stone with red stars, or drops and lines like blood. It; 
compels the devil to answer questions, and puts him to flight.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Poppy Seeds :</B> Divination by smoke was sometimes practised by magicians. A 
few jasmine or poppy seeds were flung upon burning coals, for this purpose; if 
the smoke rose lightly and ascended straight into the heavens, it augured well; 
but if it hung about it was regarded as a bad omen.</P>

<P>Postel, Guillaume :</B> A visionary of the sixteenth Century, born in the 
diocese of Avranches. He was so precocious that at fourteen years of age he was 
made master of a school. It is said that he was in the habit of reading the most 
profound works of the Jewish rabbis, and the vivacity of his imagination threw 
him into constant troubles, from which he had the greatest difficulty in 
extricating himself. He believed that he had been called by God to re-unite all 
men under one law, either by reason or the sword. The pope and the king of 
France were to be the civil and religious heads of his new republic. He was made 
Almoner to a hospital at Venice, where he came under the influence of a woman 
called Mere Jeanne, who had visions which had turned her head. Because of his 
heterodox preachings, <I>Postel </I>was denounced as a heretic, but latterly was 
regarded as merely mad. After having travelled somewhat extensively in the East, 
and having written several works in which he dealt with the visions of his 
coadjutor, he retired to the priory of St. Martin-des-Champs at Paris, where he 
died penitent in <B>1581</B>.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Posthumous Letters :</B> Many investigators of psychic science, members of 
the Society for Psychic Research and others, have left sealed letters, whose 
contents are known only to the writer. On the death of the writer, and before 
the letter shall have been opened, an attempt is made by a medium to reveal the 
contents. By this means it is hoped to prove the actuality or otherwise of 
spirit communication, for, since only the writer knows what the letter contains, 
it is presumed that on his death this knowledge can only be communicated through 
his discarnate spirit. This hypothesis certainly overlooks the fact that the 
information might be telepathically acquired during the writer's lifetime by a 
still living person, and so conveyed to the medium. As yet, however, hypotheses 
are premature, for no attempt of the kind has met with striking success.</P>

transmutation of base metal into pure gold. <I>(See </I><B>Seton.</B>)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Powder of Sympathy :</B> A remedy which, by its application to the weapon 
which had caused a wound, was supposed to cure the hurt. This method was in 
vogue during the reigns of James I. and Charles I., and its chief exponent was a 
gentleman named Sir Keneim Digby. An abstract of his theory, contained in an 
address given before an assembly of nobles and learned men at Montpellier in 
France, may be seen in Pettigrew's <I>Superstitions connected with Medicine and 
Surgery. </I>The following is the recipe for the powder :-&quot; Take Roman 
vitriol six or eight ounces, beat it very small in a mortar, sift it through a 
fine sieve when the sun enters Leo; keep it in the heat of the sun by day, and 
dry by night.&quot; This art has been treated by some authors with belief, and 
by others with unbelieving wit:- Wrenfels says :-&quot; If the superstitious 
person be wounded. by any chance, he applies the salve, not to the wound, but, 
what is more effectual to the weapon by which he received it.&quot;</P>

<P>Precipitation of Matter :</B> One of the phenomena of spiritualism which 
least admits of a rational explanation is that known as the ' passing of solids 
through solids.&quot; The statement of the hypothetical fourth dimension of 
space is an attempt at a solution of the problem; so also is the theory of 
&quot; precipitation of matter.&quot; The latter suggests that before one solid 
body passes through another it is resolved into its component atoms, to be 
precipitated in its original form when the passage is accomplished. M. Camille 
Flammarion found a parallel to this process in the passage of a piece of ice 
solid-through a napkin. The ice passes through the napkin in the form of water, 
and may afterwards be re-frozen. This is matter passing through matter, a solid 
passing through a solid, after it has undergone a change of condition. And we 
are only carrying out M. Flammarion's inference in suggesting that it is 
something analogous to this process which occurs in all cases of solids passing 
through solids.</P>

<P>Prelati :</B> <I>(See </I><B>Gillis de Laval.</B>)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Premonition :</B> An impressional warning of a future event. Premonitions may 
range from vague feelings of disquiet, suggestive of impending disaster, to 
actual hallucinations, whether visual or auditory. Dreams are frequent vehicles 
of premonitions, either direct or symbolical, and there are countless instances 
of veridical dreams. In such cases it is hard to say whether the warning may 
have come from an external source, as spiritualists aver, or whether the 
portended catastrophe may have resulted, in part, at least, from 
auto-suggestion. The latter is plainly the explanation of another form of 
<I>premonition-i.e., </I>the predictions made by patients in the magnetic or 
mediumistic trance with regard to their maladies. The magnetic subject who 
prophesied that his malady would reach a crisis on a certain date several weeks 
ahead, probably himself attended subconsciously to the fulfilling of his 
prophecy. Might not the same thing happen in&quot; veridical&quot; dreams and 
hallucinations ? We know that a subject obeying a post-hypnotic suggestion will 
weave his action quite naturally into the surrounding circumstances, though the 
very moment of its performance may have been fixed months before. That the 
dreamer and hallucinated subject also might suggest and fulfil their 
<I>premonitions, </I>either directly or by telepathic communication of the 
suggestion to another agent, does not seem very far-fetched or improbable. Then 
there is, of course, coincidence. It is impossible but that a certain proportion 
of verified <I>premonitions </I>should be the result of coincidence. Possibly, 
also, such impressions, whether they remain vague forebodings or are embodied in 
dreams or otherwise, must at times be subconscious inferences drawn from an 
actual, if obscure, perception of existing facts. As such, indeed, they are not 
to be lightly treated. Yet very frequently <I>premonitions </I>prove to be 
entirely groundless, even the most impressive ones, where the warning is 
emphasized by a ghostly visitant.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Prenestine Lots, The :</B> or <I>Sortes Prenestinae. </I>A method of 
divination by lots, in vogue in Italy. The letters of the alphabet were placed 
in an urn which was shaken, and the letters then turned out on the floor; the 
words thus formed were received as omens. In the East this method of divination 
is still common.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Pretu</B> (a departed ghost) <B>:</B> The form which the Hindus believe the 
soul takes after death. This ghost inhabits a body of the size of a man's thumb, 
and remains in the keeping of Yumu, the judge of the dead. Punishment is 
inflicted on the <I>Pretu, </I>whose body is enlarged for this purpose and is 
strengthened to endure sorrow. At the end of a year the soul is delivered from 
this state by the performance of the Shraddhu, and is translated to the heaven 
of the Pitrees, where it is rewarded for its good deeds. Afterwards, in a 
different body, the soul enters its final abode. The performance of the Shraddhu 
is absolutely necessary to escape from the <I>Pretu </I>condition.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Prophecy :</B> In an early state of society, the prophet and shaman were 
probably one and the same, as is still the case among primitive peoples. It is 
difficult to say whether the offices of the prophet are more truly religious or 
magical. He is usually a priest, hut the ability to look into the future and 
read its portents can scarcely be called a religious attribute. In many 
instances <I>prophecy </I>is merely utterances in the ecstatic condition. We 
know that the pythonesses attached to the oracles of ancient Greece uttered 
prophetic words under the influences of natural gases or drugs ; and when the 
medicine-men of most savage tribes attempt to peer into the future, they usually 
attain a condition of ecstasy by taking some drug, the action of which is well 
known to them. But this was not always the case; the shaman often summoned a 
spirit to his aid to discover what portents and truths lie in the future but 
this cannot be called prophecy. . Neither is divination <I>prophecy </I>in the 
true sense of the term, as artificial aids are employed, and it is merely by the 
appearance of certain objects that the augur can pretend to predict future 
events. We often find <I>prophecy </I>disassociated from the ecstatic condition, 
as for example among the prophets of Israel, who occupied themselves in great 
measure with the calm statement of future political events, or those priests of 
the Maya Indians of Central America known as <I>Chilan Balam, </I>who at stated 
intervals in the year made certain statements regarding the period which lay 
immediately before them. Is <I>prophecy </I>then to be regarded as a direct 
utterance of the deity, taking man as his mouthpiece, or the statement of one 
who seeks inspiration from the fountain of wisdom ? Technically, both are true 
of <I>prophecy, </I>for we find it stated in scripture that when the deity 
desired to communicate with man he chose certain persons as his mouthpieces. 
Again individuals (often the same as those chosen by God) applied to the deity 
for inspiration in critical moments. <I>'Prophecy </I>then may be the utterances 
of God by the medium of the practically unconscious shaman or seer, or the 
inspired utterance of that person after inspiration has been sought from the 
deity.</P>
<P>In ancient Assyria the prophetic class were called <I>nabu, </I>meaning 
&quot;to call&quot; or &quot;announce,' '-a name probably adopted from that of 
the god, Na-bi-u, the speaker or proclaimer of destiny, the tablets of which he 
inscribed. Among the ancient Hebrews the prophet was called <I>nabhia, </I>a 
borrowed title probably adopted from the Canaanites. That is not to say, 
however, that the Hebrew <I>nabhiim </I>were indebted to the surrounding peoples 
for their prophetic system, which appears to have been of a much loftier type 
than that of the Canaanite peoples. Prophets appear to have swarmed in Palestine 
in biblical times, and we are told that four hundred prophets of Baal sat at 
Jezebel's table. The fact that they were prophets of this deity would almost go 
to prove that they were also priests. We find that the most celebrated prophets 
of Israel belonged to the northern portion of that country, which was more 
subject to the influence of the Canaanites. Later, distinct prophetic societies 
were formed,-the chief reason for whose existence appears to have been the 
preservation of nationality; and this class appears to have absorbed the older 
castes of seers and magicians, and to some extent to have taken over their 
offices. Some of the later prophets,-Micah, for example-appear to have regarded 
some of these lesser seers as mere diviners, who were in reality not unlike the 
prophets of Baal. With Amos may he said to have commenced a new school of 
<I>prophecy-the </I>canonical prophets, who were also authors and historians, 
and who disclaimed all connection with mere professional prophets. The general 
idea in Hebrew Palestine was that Yahveh, or God, was in the closest possible 
touch with the prophets, and that he would do nothing without revealing it to 
them. The greatest importance was given to their utterances, which more than 
once determined the fate of the nation. Indeed no people has lent so close an 
ear to the utterance of their prophetic class as did the Jews of old times.</P>
<P>In ancient Greece, the prophetic class were generally found attached to the 
oracles, and in Home were represented by the augurs. In Egypt the priests of Ra 
at Memphis acted as prophets, as, perhaps, did those of Hekt. Among the ancient 
Celts and Teutons, <I>prophecy </I>was frequent, the prophetic agent usually 
placing him or herself in the ecstatic condition. The Druids were famous 
practitioners of the prophetic art, and some of their utterances may be still 
extant in the so-called Prophecies of Merlin. In America, as has been stated, 
prophetic utterance took practically the same forms as in Europe and Asia. 
Captain Jonathan Carver, an early traveller in North America, cites a peculiar 
instance where the seers of a certain tribe stated that a famine would be ended 
by assistance being sent from another tribe at a certain hour on the following 
day. At the very moment mentioned by them a canoe rounded a headland, bringing 
news of relief. A strange story was told in the <I>Atlantic Monthly </I>some 
years ago by a traveller among the Plains tribes, who stated that an Indian 
medicine-man had prophesied the coming of himself and his companions to his 
tribe two days before their arrival among them.</P>

<P>Psychic :</B> A sensitive, one susceptible to <I>psychic </I>influences, A 
<I>psychic </I>is not necessarily a medium, unless he is sufficiently sensitive 
to be controlled by disembodied spirits. The term <I>psychic </I>includes the 
somnambule, the magnetic or mesmeric subject, anyone who is in any degree 
sensitive, According to one view, all men a-e in some measure susceptible to 
spiritual influences, and to that extent deserve the name of <I>psychic.</I></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Psychic Body :</B> A spiritualistic term variously applied to an impalpable 
body which clothes the soul on the &quot;great dissolution,&quot; or to the soul 
itself. Sergeant Cox in his <I>Mechanism of Man </I>declares that the soul-quite 
distinct from mind, or intelligence, which is only a function of the brain-is 
composed of attenuated matter, and has the same form as the physical body, which 
it permeates in every part. From the soul radiates the psychic force, by means 
of which all the wonders of spiritualism are performed. Through its agency man 
becomes endowed with telekinetic and clairvoyant powers, and with its aid he can 
affect such natural forces as gravitation. When free of the body the soul can 
travel at a lightning speed, nor is it hindered by such material objects as 
stone walls or closed doors, The <I>psychic body </I>is also regarded as an 
intermediary between the physical body and the soul, a sort of envelope, more 
material than the soul itself, which encloses it at death. It is this envelope, 
the <I>psychic body </I>or <I>nervengeist, </I>which becomes visible at a 
materialisation by attracting to itself other and still more material particles. 
In time the <I>psychic body </I>decays just as did the physical, and leaves the 
soul free. During the trance the soul leaves the body, but the vital functions 
are continued by the <I>psychic body.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P></I><B>
<P>Psychical Research :</B> A term covering all scientific investigation into 
the obscure phenomena connected with the so-called &quot;supernatural,&quot; 
undertaken with a view to their elucidation. Certain of these phenomena are 
known all over the world, and have remained practically unaltered almost since 
prehistoric times. Such are the phenomena of levitation, the fire-ordeal, 
crystal-gazing, thought-reading and apparitions, and whenever these were met 
with there was seldom lacking the critical enquiry of some psychical researcher, 
not borne away on the tide of popular credulity, but reserving some of his 
judgment for the impartial investigation of the manifestations. Thus Gaule, in 
his <I>Select Cases of Conscience touching Witches and Witchcraft </I>(London, 
<B>1646</B>), says : &quot; But the more prodigious or Stupendous (of the feats 
mentioned in the witches' confessions) are effected meerly by the devill the 
witch all the while either in a rapt ecstasie, a charmed sleepe, or a melancholy 
dreame; and the witches' imagination, phantasie, common sense, only deluded with 
what is now done, or pretended.&quot; And a few other writers of the same period 
arrived at a similar conclusion. The result of many of these medieval records 
was to confirm the genuineness of the phenomena witnessed, but here and there, 
even in those days, there were sceptics who refused to see in them any 
supernatural significance. Poltergeist disturbances, again, came in for a large 
share of attention and investigation, to which, indeed, they seemed to lend 
themselves. The case of the Drummer of Tedworth was examined by Joseph Glanvil, 
and the results set forth in his <I>Sadducisimus Triumphatus, </I>published in 
<B>1668</B>. The Epworth Case, which occurred in the house of John Wesley's 
father, called forth many comments, as did also the Cock Lane Ghost. the 
Stockwell Poltergeist and many others. The Animal Magnetists and their 
successors the Mesmerists may, in a manner, be considered psychical researchers, 
since these variants of hypnosis were the fruits of prolonged investigation into 
the phenomena which indubitably existed in connection with the trance state. If 
their speculations were wild and their enquiries failed to elicit the truth of 
the matter, it was but natural, at that stage of scientific progress, that they 
should be so. And here and there even in the writings of Paracelsus and Mesmer 
we find that they had glimpses of scientific truths which were in advance of 
their age, foreshadowings of scientific discoveries which were to prove the 
triumph of future generations. The former, for example, states in his writings ' 
By the magic power of the will, a person on this side of the ocean may make a 
person on the other side hear what is said on this side..... The ethereal body 
of a man may know what another man thinks at a distance of <B>100</B> miles and 
more.&quot; This reads uncommonly like an anticipation of telepathy, which has 
attained to such remarkable prominence in recent years, though it is not now 
generally attributed to &quot;the ethereal body of a man.&quot; Such things as 
these would seem to entitle many of the mesmerists and the older mystics to the 
designation of &quot; psychical researchers.&quot;</P>
<P>As knowledge increased and systematised methods came into use these enquiries 
became ever more searching and more fruitful in definite results. The 
introduction of modern spiritualism in <B>1848</B> undoubtedly gave a remarkable 
impetus to <I>psychical research. </I>The movement was so widespread. its 
effects so apparent, that it was inevitable but that some man of science should 
be drawn into an examination of the alleged phenomena, Thus we find engaged in 
the investigation of spiritualism Carpenter, Faraday and De Morgan, and on the 
Continent Count de Gasparin, M. Thury and Zollner. One of the most important of 
individual investigators was undoubtedly Sir William Crookes, who worked 
independently for some time before the founding of the Society for <I>Psychical 
Research.</I></P>
<P>However, although much good work was done by independent students of psychic 
science,&quot; as it came to be called, and by such societies as the Dialectical 
Society (q.v.) and the Psychological Society (q.v.), it was not until 
<B>1882</B> that a concerted and carefully-organised attempt was made to 
elucidate those obscure problems which had so long puzzled the wits of learned 
and simple. In that year was founded the Society for <I>Psychical Research, 
</I>with the object of examining in a scientific and impartial spirit the realm 
of the supernatural. The following passage from the Society's original 
prospectus, quoted by Mr. Podmore in his <I>Naturalisation of the Supernatural, 
</I>indicates with sufficient clearness its aim and proposed methods:-</P>
<P>&quot;It has been widely felt that the present is an opportune time for 
making an organised and systematic attempt to investigate that large group of 
debatable phenomena designated by such terms as mesmeric, psychical, and 
spiritualistic.</P>
<P>&quot;From the recorded testimony of many competent witnesses, past and 
present, including observations recently made by scientific men of eminence in 
various countries, there appears to be, amid much delusion and deception, an 
important body of remarkable phenomena, which are <I>prima facie 
</I>inexplicable on any generally recognised hypothesis, and which, if 
incontestably established, would be of the highest possible value.</P>
<P>&quot;The task of examining such residual phenomena has often been undertaken 
by individual effort, but never hitherto by a scientific society organised on a 
sufficiently broad basis.&quot;</P>
<P>The first president of the Society was Professor Henry Sidgwick, and among 
later presidents were Professor Balfour Stewart, Professor William James, Sir 
William Crookes, Mr. A. J. Balfour, Professor Richet and Sir Oliver Lodge, while 
prominent among the original members were Frank Podmore, F. W. H. Myers, Edmund 
Gurney, Professor Barrett, Rev. Stainton Moses and Mrs. Sidgwick. Lord Rayleigh 
and Andrew Lang were also early members of the Society. Good work was done in 
America in connection with the Society by Dr. Hodgson and Professor Hyslop. On 
the continent Lombroso, Maxwell, Camille Flammarion, and Professor Richet - all 
men of the highest standing in their respective branches of science - conducted 
exhaustive researches into the phenomena of spiritualism, chiefly in connection 
with the Italian medium Eusapia Palladino.</P>
<P>At first the members of the Society for <I>Psychical Research </I>found it 
convenient to work in concert, but as they became more conversant with the broad 
outlines of the subject, it was judged necessary for certain sections or 
individuals to specialise in various branches. The original plan sketched 
roughly in <B>1882</B> grouped the phenomena under five different heads, each of 
which was placed under the direction of a separate Committee.</P>
<P><B>1</B>.-An examination of the nature and extent of any influence which may 
be exerted by one mind upon another, apart from any generally recognised mode of 
perception. (Hon. Sec. of Committee, Professor W. F. Barrett.)</P>
<P><B>2</B>.-The study of hypnotism, and the forms of so-called mesmeric trance, 
with its alleged insensibility to pain; clairvoyance, and other 
allied-phenomena. (Hon. Sec. of Committee, Dr. G. Wyld.)</P>
<P><B>3</B>.-A critical revision of Reichenbach's researches with certain 
organisations called &quot;sensitive,&quot; and an inquiry whether such 
organisations possess any power of perception beyond a highly-exalted 
sensibility of the recognised sensory organs. (Hon. Sec. of Committee, Walter H. 
Coffin.)</P>
<P><B>4</B>.-A careful investigation of any reports, resting on strong 
testimony, regarding apparitions at the moment of death, or otherwise, or 
regarding disturbances in houses reputed to be haunted. (Hon. Sec. of Committee, 
Hensleigh Wedgwood.)</P>
<P><B>5</B>.-An enquiry into the various physical phenomena commonly called 
spiritualistic with an attempt to discover their causes and general <I>laws. 
</I>(Hon. Sec., Dr. C. Lockhart Robertson.)</P>
<P>Besides these there was a Committee appointed to consider the literature of 
the subject, having as its honorary secretaries Edmund Gurney and Frederic W. H. 
Myers, who, with Mr. Podmore, collected a number of historic instances. Of the 
various heads, however, the first is now generally considered the most 
important, and is certainly that which has yielded the best results to 
investigators. In the case of hypnotism it is largely through the exertions of 
psychical researchers that it has been admitted to the sphere of legitimate 
physiology, whereas it was formerly classed among doubtful phenomena, even at 
the time the Society was founded. The examination of Reichenbach's claims to 
having discovered a new psychic fluid or force-odyle (q.v.)-which issued like 
flame from the points of a magnet or the human finger-tips, was at length 
abandoned, nothing having been found to verify his conclusions which, however, 
previous to this had been largely accepted. The investigations in connection 
with apparitions and haunted houses, and with the spiritualistic phenomena, are 
still proceeding, though on the whole no definite conclusion has been arrived 
at. Though the members of the Society undertook to carry out their 
investigations in an entirely unbiased spirit, and though those members who 
joined the Society originally as avowed spiritualists soon dropped out, yet 
after prolonged and exhaustive research the opinion of the various investigators 
often showed marked divergence. So far from being pledged to accept a spirit, or 
any other hypothesis, it was expressly stated in a note appended to the 
prospectus that ' Membership of this Society does not imply the acceptance of 
any particular explanation of the phenomena investigated, nor any belief as to 
the operation, in the physical world, of forces other than those recognised by 
Physical Science.&quot; Nevertheless Mr. Myers and Sir Oliver Lodge, to take two 
notable instances, found the evidence sufficient to convince them of the 
operation in the physical world of disembodied intelligences, who manifest 
themselves through the organism of the &quot;medium&quot; or 
&quot;sensitive.&quot; Mr. Podmore, on the other hand, was the exponent of a 
telepathic theory. Any phase of the&quot; manifestations &quot; which was not 
explicable by means of such known physiological facts as suggestion and 
hyperaesthesia, the so-called &quot;subconscious whispering,&quot; exaltation of 
memory and automatism, or the unfamiliar but presumably natural telepathy, must, 
according to him, fall under the grave suspicion of fraud. His theory of 
poltergeists, for example, by which he regards these uncanny disturbances as 
being the work of naughty children, does not admit the intervention of a 
mischievous disembodied spirit. In coincident hallucination, again, he considers 
telepathy a suitable explanation, as well as in all cases of 
&quot;personation&quot; by the medium. His view - one that was shared by Andrew 
Lang and others-was that if telepathy were once established the spirit 
hypothesis would not only be unnecessary, but impossible of proof.</P>
<P>The most important of telepathic experiments were those conducted by 
Professor and Mrs. Sidgwick in <B>1889</B>-<B>91</B>. The percipients were 
hypnotised by Mr. G. A. Smith, who also acted as agent, and the matter to be 
transmitted consisted at first of numbers and later of mental pictures. The 
agent and percipient were generally separated by a screen, or were sometimes in 
different rooms, though the results in the latter case were perceptibly less 
satisfactory. On the whole, however, the percentage of correct guesses was far 
above that which the doctrine of chance warranted, and the experiments did much 
to encourage a belief that some hitherto unknown mode of communication existed. 
More recently the trance communication of Mrs. Piper would seem to point to some 
such theory, though Mr. Myers, Dr. Hodgson and Dr. Hyslop, who conducted a very 
profound investigation into those communications, were inclined to believe that 
the spirits of the dead were the agencies in this case. Telepathy cannot yet be 
considered as proved. At the best it is merely a surmise, which, if it could be 
established, would provide a natural explanation for much of the so-called 
occult phenomena. Even its most ardent protagonists admit that its action is 
extremely uncertain and experiment correspondingly difficult. Nevertheless, each 
year sees an increasing body of scientific and popular opinion favourable to the 
theory, so that we may hope that the surmised mode of communication may at last 
be within a reasonable distance of becoming an acknowledged fact. The machinery 
of telepathy is generally supposed to be in the form of ethereal vibrations, or 
' brain waves,&quot;acting in accordance with natural laws, though Mr. Gerald 
Balfour and others incline to an entirely metamorphosed theory, urging, <I>e.g., 
</I>that the action does not conform to the law of inverse squares.</P>
<P>The subject of hallucinations, coincidental or otherwise, has also been 
largely investigated in recent years, and has been found to be closely connected 
with the question of telepathy. Apparitions were in former times regarded as the 
&quot; doubles &quot; or &quot; ethereal bodies&quot; of the persons they 
represented, but they are not now considered to be other-wise than subjective. 
Nevertheless the study of &quot; coincidental hallucinations <I>&quot;-i.e., 
</I>hallucinatory apparitions which coincide with the death of the person 
represented, or with some other crises in his life - raises the question as to 
whether the agent may not produce such an hallucination in the mind of the 
percipient by the exercise of telepathic influence, which may be judged to be 
more powerful during an emotional crisis. Now hallucinations have been shown to 
be fairly common among sane people, about one person in ten having experienced 
one or more. But the chances that such an hallucination should coincide with the 
death of the person it represents are about, <B>1</B> in <B>19</B>,<B>000</B> ; 
that is, if no other factor than chance determines their ratio. With a view to 
ascertaining whether coincidental hallucinations did actually bear a higher 
proportion to the total number of hallucinations than chance would justify, the 
Society for <I>Psychical Research </I>took a census in <B>1889</B> and the three 
or four years immediately following. Professor Sidgwick and a committee of 
members of the Society conducted the investigations and printed forms were 
distributed among <B>410</B> accredited agents of the Society, including, 
besides its own members, many medical men and others belonging to the 
professional classes, all of whom gave their services without fee in the 
interests of science. In all some <B>17</B>,<B>000</B> persons were questioned, 
and negative as well as affirmative answers were sent in just as they were 
received, the agents being specially instructed to make no discrimination 
between the various replies. Out of <B>8372</B> men <B>655</B> had had an 
hallucination, and <B>1029</B> out of <B>8628</B> women-<B>9</B>. <B>9</B> % of 
the total. When ample allowance had been made for defects of memory with regard 
to early hallucinations by multiplying the <B>322</B> recognised and definite 
cases by <B>4</B>, it was found that <B>62</B> coincided with a death; but, 
again making allowances, this number was reduced to <B>30</B>. Thus we find 
<B>1</B> coincidental hallucination in <B>43</B> where, there being no causal 
connection we should expect I in <B>19</B>,<B>000</B>. Clearly, then, if these 
figures be taken, there must be some causal connection between the death and the 
apparition, whether it be a spiritualistic or telepathic theory that may be 
used. Though it be true that memory plays strange tricks, yet is it difficult to 
understand how persons of education and standing could write down and attest 
minutes and dated records of events that never happened.</P>
<P>Apart from telepathy, which because it postulates the working of a hitherto 
unknown natural law, takes premier place, perhaps the most interesting field of 
research is that of automatism. Trance writings and utterances have been known 
since the earliest times, when they were attributed to demoniac possession, or, 
sometimes, angelic possession. By means of planchette, ouija, and such 
contrivances many people are able to write automatically and divulge information 
which they themselves were unaware of possessing. But here again the phenomena 
are purely subjective, and are the result of cerebral dissociation, such as may 
be induced in hypnosis. In this state exaltation of the memory may occur, and 
thus account for such phenomena as the speaking in foreign tongues with which 
the agent is but ill-acquainted. Or, conceivably, cerebral dissociation may 
produce a sensitiveness to telepathic influences, as would seem apparent in the 
case of Mrs. Piper, whose automatic productions in writing and speaking have 
supplied investigators with plentiful material of recent years, and have done 
inure, perhaps, than anything else to stimulate an interest in so-called 
spiritualistic phenomena. In connection with the,' physical&quot; 
phenomena-probably no less the result of automatism than the 
&quot;subjective,&quot; though in a different direction-the Italian medium 
Eusapia Palladino has been carefully studied by many eminent investigators both 
in Great Britain and on the Continent, with the result that Camille Flammarion, 
Professor Richet, Sir Oliver Lodge-to mention only a few-have satisfied 
themselves with regard to the genuineness of some of her phenomena.</P>
<P>On the whole, even if <I>psychical research </I>has not succeeded in 
demonstrating such matters as the immortality of the soul or the possibility of 
communication between the living and the dead, it has done good work in widening 
the field of psychology and therapeutics and in gaining admission for that 
doctrine of suggestion which since the time of Bertrand and Braid had never been 
openly received and acknowledged by the medical profession. Many of the obscure 
phenomena attending mesmerism, magnetism, witchcraft, poltergeists, and kindred 
subjects have been brought into line with modern scientific knowledge. Little 
more than thirty years has elapsed since the Society for <I>Psychical Research 
</I>was founded, and probably in time to come it will accomplish still more, 
both in conducting experiments and investigations in connection with psychic 
phenomena, and in educating the public in the use of scientific methods and 
habits of thought in their dealings with the&quot; supernatural.&quot;</P>

<P>Psychograph :</B> An instrument to facilitate automatic writing. It is 
composed of a rotating disc, on which the medium's finger-tips are placed, thus 
carrying an index over the alphabet. A similar contrivance was used by Professor 
Hare in his spiritualistic experiments.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Psychography :</B> Writing produced without human contact, and supposed to be 
the work of the spirits.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Psychological Society, The :</B> The <I>Psychological Society </I>came into 
being in April, <B>1875</B>, having as its founder and president Sergeant Cox, 
and numbering among its members the Rev. William Stainton Moses, Mr. Walter H. 
Coffin, and Mr. C. C. Massey. The avowed aim of the Society, as set forth in the 
president's inaugural address, was the elucidation of those, spiritualistic and 
other problems now grouped under the term &quot; psychical research,&quot; and 
to which the Society somewhat loosely attached the designation of psychology. To 
this end they proposed to collect and consider the available material bearing on 
psychic phenomena, but in reality they accomplished little of any practical 
value, as may be seen from their published <I>Proceedings </I>(London, 
<B>1878</B>). The president himself had not the necessary scientific 
qualifications for an investigator of such phenomena. In November, <B>1879</B>, 
on the death of its president, the Society came to an end. But though the 
<I>Psychological Society </I>regarded the psychic phenomena from a more or less 
popular standpoint, and conducted its investigations in a somewhat superficial 
manner, nevertheless it contained that germ of scientific enquiry into the 
domain of psychic science which, a few years later, in the Society for Psychical 
Research, was to raise the study to a level where it became worthy of the 
attention of philosopher and scientist. Hitherto those who were satisfied of the 
genuineness of the spiritualistic marvels had for the most part been content to 
accept the explanation of spirit intervention, but the <I>Psychological Society 
</I>was the crystallisation of a small body of&quot; rationalist&quot; opinion 
which had existed since the days of Mesmer. Sergeant Cox, in his work, <I>The 
Mechanism of </I>Man states that &quot; spirit &quot; is refined matter, or 
molecular matter split into its constituent atoms, which thus become 
imperceptible to our physical organism; a view which was possibly shared by the 
<I>Psychological Society.</I></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Psychomancy :</B> Divination by spirits or the art of evoking the dead. </P>
<P><I>(See<B> </I>Necromancy.</B>)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Psychometry :</B> A term used by spiritualists to denote the faculty, 
supposed to be common among mediums, of reading the characters, surroundings, 
etc. of persons by holding in the hand small objects, such as a watch or ring, 
which they have had in their possession. The honour of having discovered the 
psychometric faculty belongs to Dr. J. R. Buchanan, who classed it among the 
sciences, and gave it the name it bears. His theory is based on the belief that 
everything that has ever existed, every object, scene, event, that has occurred 
since the beginning of the world, has left on the ether or astral light a trace 
of its being, indelible while the world endures; and not only on the ether, but 
likewise on more palpable objects, trees and stones and all manner of things. 
Sounds also, and perfumes leave impressions on their surroundings. Just as a 
photograph may be taken on a plate and remain invisible till it has been 
developed, so may those psychometric&quot; photographs&quot; remain impalpable 
till the developing process has been applied. And that which is to bring them to 
light is-the mind of the medium. All mediums are said to possess the 
psychometric faculty in a greater or less degree. One authority, Professor 
William Denton, has declared that he found it in one man in every ten, and four 
women in ten. Dr. Buchanan's earliest experiments, with his own students, showed 
that some of them were able to distinguish the different metals merely by 
holding them in their hands. On medical substances being put into their hands 
they exhibited such symptoms as might have been occasioned if the substances 
were swallowed. Later he found that some among them could diagnose a patient's 
disease simply by holding his hand. Many persons of his acquaintance, on 
pressing a letter against their forehead, could tell the character and 
surroundings of the writer, the circumstances under which the letter was written 
and other particulars. Some very curious stories are told of fossilised bones 
and teeth revealing to the sensitives the animals they represent in the midst of 
their prehistoric surroundings. Professor Denton gave to his wife and 
mother-in-law meteoric fragments and other substances, wrapped in paper and 
thoroughly mixed to preclude the possibility of telepathy, which caused them to 
see the appropriate pictures. Many mediums who have since practised psychometry 
have become famous in their line. As has been said, the <I>modus </I>is to hold 
in the hand or place against the forehead some small object, such as a fragment 
of clothing, a letter, or a watch, when the appropriate visions are seen. 
Psychometrists may he entranced, but are generally in a condition scarcely 
varying from the normal. The psychometric pictures, printed presumably on the 
article to be psychometrised, have been likened to pictures borne in the memory, 
seemingly faded, yet ready to start into vividness when the right spring is 
touched. We may likewise suppose that the rehearsal of bygone tragedies so 
frequently witnessed in haunted houses, is really a psychometric picture which 
at the original occurrence impressed itself on the room. The same may be said of 
the sounds and perfumes which haunt certain houses.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Psylli :</B> A class of persons in Ancient Italy who had the power of 
charming serpents. This name is given by other writers to the snake-charmers of 
Africa, and it is said that the serpents twist round the bodies of these 
<I>Psylli </I>without doing them any injury, although the reptiles have not had 
their fangs extracted or broken. In Kahira when a viper enters a house, the 
charmer is sent for, and he entices it out by the use of certain words. At other 
times music is used, and it is believed that the serpents understand what is 
said to them by the snake-charmers, so obedient are they.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Purrah, The :</B> A secret society of the Tulka-Susus, an African tribe who 
dwell between the Sierra Leone river and Cape mount. The Tulka consist of five 
small communities which together form a description of republic. Each group has 
its own chiefs and council, but all are under a controlling-power which is 
called the <I>Purrah. </I>Each of the five communities has also its own 
<I>purrah, </I>from which is formed the great or general <I>purrah, </I>which 
holds supreme sway over the five bodies. Before a native can join a district 
<I>purrah, </I>he must be thirty years of age, and ere he can be received into 
membership of the great <I>purrah, </I>he must have reached the age of fifty. 
Thus the oldest members of each district <I>purrah </I>are members of the head 
<I>purrah. </I>On desiring admittance to the examination for the district 
<I>purrah, </I>the relations of the candidate must swear td kill him if he does 
not stand the test, or if he reveals the mysteries and the secrets of the 
society. Froebenius says :-&quot; In each district belonging to a <I>purrah 
</I>there is a sacred grove to which the candidate is conducted, and where he 
must stay in a place assigned to him, living for several months quite alone in a 
hut, whither masked persons bring him food. He must neither speak nor leave his 
appointed place of residence.</P>
<P>&quot;Should he venture into the surrounding forest, he is as good as dead. 
</P>
<P>&quot;After several months the candidate is admitted to stand his trial, 
which is said to be terrible. Recourse is had to all the elements in order to 
gain satisfaction as to his firmness and courage. We are even assured that at 
these mysteries use is made of fettered lions and leopards, that during the time 
of the tests and enrolment the sacred groves echo with fearful shrieks, that 
here great fires are seen at night, that formerly the fire flared up in these 
mysterious woods in all directions, that every outsider who through curiosity 
was tempted to stray into the woods was mercilessly sacrificed, that foolish 
people who would have penetrated into them disappeared and were never heard of 
again.</P>
<P>&quot;If the candidate stands all the tests, he is admitted to the 
initiation. But he must first swear to keep all the secrets and without 
hesitation carry out the decisions of the <I>purrah </I>of his community and all 
the decrees of the great head <I>purrah. </I>If a member of the society betrays 
it or revolts against it, he is condemned to death, and the sentence is often 
carried out in the bosom of his family. When the criminal least expects it, a 
disguised, masked and armed warrior appears and says to him</P>
<P>&quot;&rsquo;The great <I>purrah </I>sends thee death!&rsquo;</P>
<P>&quot;At these words everybody stands back, no one dares to offer the least 
resistance, and the victim is murdered.</P>
<P>&quot;The Court of each district <I>purrah </I>consists of twenty-five 
members, and from each of these separate courts five persons are chosen, who 
constitute the great <I>purrah, </I>or the High Court of the general 
association. Hence this also consists of twenty-five persons, who elect the head 
chief from their own body.</P>
<P>&quot;The special <I>purrah </I>of each community investigates the offences 
committed in its district, sits in judgment on them, and sees that its sentences 
are carried out. It makes peace between the powerful families, and stops their 
wranglings.</P>
<P>&quot;The great <I>purrah </I>meets only on special occasions, and pronounces 
judgment on those who betray the mysteries and secrets of the order, or on those 
who show themselves disobedient to its mandates. But usually it puts an end to 
the feuds that often break out between two communities belonging to the 
confederacy. When these begin to fight, after a few months of mutual 
hostilities, one or other of the parties, when they have inflicted sufficient 
injury on each other, usually wants peace. The commune repairs secretly to the 
great <I>purrah, </I>and invites it to become the mediator and put an end to the 
strife.</P>
<P>&quot;Thereupon the great <I>purrah </I>meets in a neutral district, and when 
all are assembled announces to the communes at war that it cannot allow men who 
should live together as brothers, friends and good neighbours, to wage war, to 
waste each others' lands, to plunder and burn; that it is time to put an end to 
these disorders ; that the great <I>purrah </I>will inquire into the cause of 
the strife ; that it requires that this should cease and decrees that all 
hostilities be forthwith arrested.</P>
<P>&quot;A main feature of this arrangement is that, as soon as the great 
<I>purrah </I>assembles to put a stop to the feud, and until its decision is 
given, all the belligerents of the two districts at war are forbidden to shed a 
drop of blood this always carries with it the penalty of death. Hence everybody 
is careful not to infringe this decree, and abstains from all hostilities.</P>
<P>&quot;The session of the High Court lasts one month, during which it collects 
all necessary information to ascertain which commune caused the provocation and 
the rupture. At the same time it summons as many of the society's fighting-men 
as may be required to carry out the decision. When all the necessary particulars 
are brought in, and everything is duly weighed, it settles the question by 
condemning the guilty commune to a four days' sack.</P>
<P>&quot;The warriors who have to give effect to this decision are all chosen 
from the neutral districts ; they set out by night from the place where the 
great <I>purrah </I>is assembled. All are disguised, the face being covered with 
an ugly mask, and armed with lighted torches and daggers. They divide into bands 
of forty, fifty, or sixty, and all meet unexpectedly before dawn in the district 
that they have to pillage, proclaiming with fearful shouts the decision of the 
High Court. On their approach men, women, children and old people, all take to 
flight, that is, take refuge in their houses, and should anyone be found in the 
fields, on the highway, or in any other place, he is either killed or carried 
off and no more is ever heard of him.</P>
<P>&quot;The booty obtained by such plundering is divided into two parts, one of 
which is given to the injured commune, the other to the great <I>purrah, 
</I>which shares it with the warriors that have executed its decree. This is the 
reward for their zeal, their obedience and loyalty. </P>
<P>&quot;If one of the families in a commune subject to the <I>purrah 
</I>becomes too powerful and too formidable, the great <I>purrah </I>meets, and 
nearly always condems it to unexpected sack, which is carried out by night and, 
as usual, by masked and disguised men. Should the heads of such a dangerous 
family offer any resistance, they are killed, or carried off, and conveyed to 
the depths of a sacred and lonely grove where they are tried by the <I>purrah 
</I>for their insubordination they are seldom heard of again.</P>
<P>&quot;Such, in part, is the constitution of this extraordinary institution. 
Its existence is known ; the display of its power is felt ; it is dreaded yet 
the veil covering its intentions, decisions and decrees is impenetrable, and not 
till he is about to be executed does the outlaw know that he has been condemned. 
The power and reputation of the <I>purrah </I>is immense, not only in the 
homeland, but also in the surrounding districts. It is reported to be in league 
with the spirits (instead of the devil).</P>
<P>&quot;According to the general belief the number of armed men who are members 
and at the disposal of the <I>purrah </I>exceeds <B>6</B>,<B>000</B>. Moreover, 
the rules, the Secrets and the mysteries of this society are strictly obeyed and 
observed by its numerous associated members, who understand and recognise each 
other by words and signs.&quot;</P>

<P>Pyromancy :</B> or divining by fire, has been alluded to in Extispicy. The 
presage was good when the flame was vigorous and quickly consumed the sacrifice; 
when it was clear of all smoke, transparent, neither red, nor dark in colour 
when it did not crackle, but burnt silently in a pyramidal form. On the 
contrary, if it was difficult to kindle, if the wind disturbed it, if it was 
slow to consume the victim, the presage was evil. Besides the sacrificial fire, 
the ancients divined by observing the flames of torches, and even by throwing 
powdered pitch into a fire; if it caught quickly, the omen was good. The flame 
of a torch was good if it formed one point, bad if it divided into two; but 
three was a better omen than one. Sickness for the healthy, and death for the 
sick, was presaged by the bending of the flame, and some frightful disaster by 
its sudden extinction. The vestals in the Temple of Minerva at Athens were 
charged to make particular observations on the light perpetually burning 
there.</P>
