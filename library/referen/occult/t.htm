<P>Table-turning :</B> A form of psychic phenomena in which a table is made to 
rotate, tilt, or rise completely off the ground by the mere contact of the 
operator&rsquo;s finger-tips, and without the conscious exercise of muscular 
force, The <I>modus operandi </I>is exceedingly simple. The sitters take their 
places round a table, on which they lightly rest their finger-tips, thus forming 
a &quot;chain.&quot; In a few moments the table begins to rotate, and may even 
move about the room, seemingly carrying the experimenters with it. It was, and 
is, in high favour among spiritualists as a means of communicating with the 
spiritual world. The alphabet was slowly repeated, or a pencil was run down the 
printed alphabet, the table tilting at the letter which the spirits desired to 
indicate. Thus were dictated sermons, poems, information regarding the 
spirit-world, and answers to questions put by the sitters. <I>Table-turning, 
</I>in common with most spiritualistic phenomena, originated in America. It 
rapidly spread to Europe, and early in <B>1853</B> reached Britain, where it 
soon became immensely popular, and for the time replaced the earlier method of 
communication by means of raps. It commended itself to the public mainly because 
the services of an expensive professional medium were not required. In all parts 
of the country and in every grade of society the popular craze was practised 
with enthusiasm, and in this case as in others the results increased 
proportionately with the credibility of the sitters. In these earlier stages of 
the proceedings the gyrations of the table were attributed entirely to spirit 
agencies. So serious did matters become at last that men of science could no 
longer ignore the &quot;manifestations,&quot; and were forced to turn the light 
of scientific knowledge on the phenomenon of <I>table-turning </I>and endeavour 
to explain it on rational grounds. Foremost among these distinguished 
investigators was the chemist Faraday, who showed by means of simple apparatus 
of his own devising that the movements of the table were due to unconscious 
muscular action on the part of the sitters, who were thus themselves the 
automatic authors of the messages purporting to come from the spirit world. 
Faraday&rsquo;s apparatus consisted of two thin wooden boards with little glass 
rollers between, the whole bound together with rubber bands, and so contrived 
that the slightest lateral pressure on the upper board would cause it to slip a 
little way over the other. A haystalk or a scrap of paper served to indicate any 
motion of the upper board over the lower. The conclusion drawn from these 
experiments was that when the sitters believed themselves to be pressing 
<I>downwards, </I>they were really pressing obliquely, in the direction they 
expected the table to rotate. Other investigators also held that the expectation 
of the operators had a good deal to do with the motions of the table. Braid 
pointed out in the appendix to his <I>Hypnotic Therapeutics </I>that some one 
generally announced beforehand the direction in which the table would rotate, 
and so encouraged the expectation of the operators. Another authority, Dr. W. B. 
Carpenter, shared the same view, as did a committee of four medical men who 
published their experiences of <I>table-turning </I>in the <I>Medical Times and 
Gazette </I>Among the earliest investigators of the phenomena of 
<I>tablet-turning </I>were count de Gasparin and Professor Thury of Geneva, who 
held <I>seances, </I>and were satisfied that the movements resulted from a force 
radiating from the operators, to which they gave the name of&quot; ectenic 
force.&quot; There were others, however, who were less rational in their 
attempts to explain the phenomenon. The public were on the whole indisposed to 
accept the conclusions of Faraday and the rest. They preferred the more popular 
spiritualistic explanations or the pseudo-scientific theories of such men as Dr. 
Koch, who believed that the &quot; chain of operators formed a sort of electric 
battery which supplied the table with vital energy or, as it was called, &quot; 
electro-odyllic&quot; force, and made it respond to the will as though it were a 
part of the human body. Other explanations offered were odic force, galvanism, 
animal magnetism, and, strangest notion of all, the rotation of the earth! In an 
anonymous pamphlet published during the <I>table-turning </I>epidemic and 
entitled <I>Table-turning considered in connection with the dictates of reason 
and common sense, </I>the conclusions of Faraday are ridiculed, and an 
electrical theory advanced, in such a way, however, as to show that the writer 
is quite ignorant of his subject. Another pamphlet, also anonymous, entitled 
<I>Table-turning by Animal Magnetism demonstrated </I>ascribes the phenomenon to 
magnetism, and bases it&rsquo;s suppositions on the results of some experiments 
in which the table was isolated by glass or gutta-percha. Dr. Elliotson and the 
other believers in a mesmeric &quot; fluid&quot; which would affect inanimate 
objects as well as living beings, saw in <I>table-turning </I>a support for 
their views. The Rev. G. Sandby and the Rev. C. H. Townshend, claimed to have 
experienced a feeling of fatigue after a <I>table-turning </I>seance as though 
they had been hypnotising someone. They also felt a tingling sensation in their 
finger-tips, and Townshend suggested that spirit rappings may be caused by a 
&quot;disengagement of Zoogen from the System.&quot; Dr. Elliotson himself 
followed with an admission that the phenomenon was not explicable within the 
bounds of muscular force. There was another set, mainly composed of Evangelical 
clergymen, who credited the whole business to Satanic agency. The Rev. N. S. 
Godfrey, the Rev. E. Gillson, and others held <I>seances </I>in which the &quot; 
spirits &quot; confessed themselves to be either the spirit&rsquo;s of worthless 
persons of evil inclination, or devils, both of which confessions caused the 
reverend gentlemen to denounce the whole practice of <I>table-turning. </I>One 
of them remarks, apropos of Faraday&rsquo;s experiments, that the phenomena 
&quot;appear to be whatever the investigator supposes them to be,&quot; a saying 
which aptly characterises their own attitude.</P>
<P>Camille Flammarion, whose exhaustive experiments and scientific attainments 
give to his opinion considerable weight, has offered an explanation of the 
various phases of <I>table-turning </I>phenomena. Simple rotation of the table 
he ascribes to an unconscious impulse given by the operators and other movements 
(;f the table while the fingers of the sitter&rsquo;s rest upon it are ascribed 
to similar causes. The tilting of the table on the side furthest away from the 
operator can also be explained by muscular action. But vibrations in the wood of 
the table, or its levitation under the fingers, or, to a still greater extent, 
its rotation without contact of the operator&rsquo;s hands, he attributes to a 
force emanating from the body, and, in the latter case, capable of acting at a 
distance by means of ether-waves. This force, the result of a cerebral 
disturbance, is greater than that of the muscles, as is seen by the levitation 
of tables so weighted that the combined muscular strength of the operators would 
not suffice to lift it. To the dictating of meessages and other intelligent 
manifestations he would also give an origin in this psychic force, which is 
perhaps identical with Thury&rsquo;s &quot; ectenic&quot; force, or &quot; 
psychode,&quot; and which is obedient to the will and desires, or even, in some 
cases; the subconscious will of the operator. The hypothesis of spirits he does 
not consider necessary. It is possible, however, that fraud may have crept into 
the <I>seances </I>of M. Flammarion, as it has done in so many other cases. And 
there are those among the most profound students of psychic research who find in 
unconscious muscular action and deliberate fraud a satisfactory explanation of 
the phenomena.</P>

<P>Taboo, Tabu or Tapu :</B> A Polynesian word meaning &quot;prohibited &quot; 
and signifying a prohibition enforced by religious or magical power, which has 
come to be applied to similar usages among savage peoples all over the world. 
<I>Taboo, </I>or prohibition is enforced in the cases of sacred things and 
unclean things. In the first instance, the <I>taboo </I>is placed on the object 
because of the possession by it of inherent mysterious power. But, <I>taboo 
</I>may be imposed by a chief or priest. It aims at the protection of important 
individuals; the safeguarding of the weak, women, children and slaves from the 
magical influence of more highly-placed individuals; against danger incurred by 
handling or coming in contact with corpses; or eating certain foods; and the 
securing of human beings against the power of supernatural agencies, or the 
depredations of thieves. <I>Taboo </I>may also be sanctioned by social use or 
instinct. The violation of a <I>taboo </I>makes the offender himself <I>taboo, 
</I>for it is characteristic of the <I>taboo </I>that it is transmissible, but 
can be thrown off by magical or purificatory ceremonies. It may last for a short 
period, or be imposed in perpetuity. It may be said, generally speaking, that 
the practice of <I>taboo </I>was instituted through human instinct for human 
convenience. This applies of course merely to the most simple type of <I>taboo. 
</I>It is, for example, for bidden to reap or steal the patch of corn dedicated 
to an agricultural deity, for the simple reason that his wrath would be incurred 
by so doing. Similarly it is <I>taboo </I>to devour the flesh of the totem 
animal of the tribe, except in special circumstances with the object of 
achieving communion with him. It is <I>taboo </I>to interfere in any manner with 
the affairs of the shamans or medicine-men: this again is a type of the imposed 
<I>taboo </I>for the convenience of a certain caste. It is prohibited to marry a 
woman of the same totem as oneself, as all the members of a totemic band are 
supposed to be consanguineous, and such a union might incur the wrath of the 
patron deity. A very strict <I>taboo </I>is put upon the beholding of certain 
ritual instruments belonging to some barbarian tribes, but this only applies to 
women and uninitiated men: the reason for such <I>taboo </I>would be that it was 
considered degradation for women to behold sacred implements. <I>Taboo, </I>if 
it does not spring directly from the system known as totemism, was strongly 
influenced by it-that is, many intricate <I>taboos </I>arose from the totemic 
system. We have also the <I>taboo </I>of the sorcerer, which in effect is merely 
a spell placed upon a certain object, which makes it become useless to others. 
<I>Taboo, </I>or its remains, is still to be found in strong force even in the 
most civilised communities, and from its use the feeling of reverence for 
ancient institutions and those who represent them is undoubtedly derived.</P>

<P>Taigheirm :</B> A magical sacrifice of cats to the infernal spirits, formerly 
practised in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland. It is believed to have been 
originally a ceremony of sacrifice to the subterranean gods, imported from more 
northern lands, which became in Christian times an invocation of infernal 
spirits. The word &quot; Taigheirm signifies either an armoury, or the cry of a 
cat, according to the sense in which it is used. A description of the ceremony, 
which must be performed with black cats, is given in Horst&rsquo;s Deuteroscopy 
: &quot; After the cats were dedicated to all the devils. and put into a 
magico-sympathetic condition by the shameful things done to them, and the agony 
occasioned them, one of them was at once put upon the spit, and, amid terrific 
howlings, roasted before a slow fire. The moment that the howls of one tortured 
cat ceased in death, another was put upon the spit, for a minute of interval 
must not take place if they would control hell; and this continued for the four 
entire days and nights. If the exorcist could hold it out still longer, and even 
till his physical powers were absolutely exhausted, he must do so.&quot; When 
the horrible rites had been continued for a time the demons began to appear in 
the shape of black cats, who mingled their dismal cries with those of the 
unfortunate sacrifices. At length a cat appeared of larger size and more 
frightful aspect than the others, and the time had come for the exorcist to make 
known his demands. Usually he asked for the gift of second sight, but other 
rewards might be asked for and received. The last <I>Taigheirm </I>was said to 
have been held in Mull about the middle of the seventeenth century. The 
exorcists were Allan Maclean and his assistant Lachlain Maclean, both of whom 
received the second sight. Of this particular ceremony Horst says: &quot;The 
infernal spirits appeared some in the early progress of the sacrifices, in the 
shape of black cats. The first who appeared during the sacrifice, after they had 
cast a furious glance at the sacrifices, said Lachlain Oer, that is, Injurer of 
Cats. Allan, the chief operator, warned Lachlain, whatever he might see or hear, 
not to waver, but to keep the spit incessantly turning. At length the cat of 
monstrous size appeared and after it had set up a horrible howl, said to 
Lachlain Oer, that if he did not cease before their largest brother came he 
would never see the face of God. Lachlain answered that he would not cease till 
he had finished his work if all the devils in hell came. At the end of the 
fourth day, there sat on the end of the beam in the roof of the barn a black cat 
with fire-flaming eyes, and there was heard a terrific howl quite across the 
straits of Mull into Mowen.&quot; By this time the elder of the two men was 
quite exhausted, and sank down in a swoon, but the younger was sufficiently 
self-possessed to ask for wealth and prosperity, which both received throughout 
their life-time. Shortly before this, Cameron of Lochiel received at a 
<I>Taigheirm </I>a small silvershoe which, put on the foot of a new-born son of 
his family, would give courage and fortitude to the child. One boy, however, had 
at his birth, a foot too large for the shoe, <I>a </I>defect inherited from his 
mother, who was not a Cameron. His lack of the magically bestowed courage was 
apparent at Sheriffmuir, where he fled before the enemy.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Talisman :</B> An inanimate object which is supposed to possess a 
supernatural capacity of conferring benefits or powers in contradistinction to 
the amulet (q.v.), the purpose of which is to ward off evil. It was usually a 
disc of metal or stone engraved with astrological or magical figures. 
<I>Talismans </I>were common in ancient Egypt and Babylon. The virtues of 
astrological <I>talismans </I>were as follows : The astrological figure of 
Mercury, engraven upon silver, which is the corresponding metal, and according 
to the prescribed rites, gave success in Merchandise ; that of Mars gave victory 
to the soldier that of Venus, beauty, and so of the rest. All such <I>talismans 
</I>likewise are more powerful in the hour of their planets ascendency. There 
are three general varieties of these potent charms : <B>1</B>. The astronomical, 
having the characters of the heavenly signs or constellations. <B>2</B>. The 
magical, with extraordinary figures, superstitious words, or the names of 
angels. <B>3</B>. The mixed, engraven with celestial signs and barbarous words. 
To these, Fosbrook, in his <I>Encyclopaedia of Antiquities, </I>adds two others 
-<B>4</B>. The <I>sigilla planetarum, </I>composed of Hebrew numeral letters, 
used by astrologers and fortune-tellers; and <B>5</B>. Hebrew names and 
characters. As an example of the most powerful of the latter, may be mentioned 
the sacred name of Jehovah. The famous tephillin or phylacteries, used in Jewish 
devotion, and which were bound on the head, the arm, and the hand, may be 
regarded as <I>talismans, </I>and they were the subject of many traditional 
ceremonies. We may also mention the mezuzoth or schedules for door-posts, and 
another article of this description mentioned in the following quotation from 
the <I>Talmud :-&quot; </I>Whoever has the telphillin bound to his head and arm, 
and the tsitsith thrown over his garments, and the mezuza fixed on his 
door-post, is protected from sin.&quot;</P>
<P>Writing of <I>talismans </I>in his <I>Occult Sciences, </I>Mr. A. E. Waite 
says</P>
<P>&quot;I. The <I>Talisman </I>of the Sun must be composed of a pure and fine 
gold, fashioned into a circular plate, and well polished on either side. A 
serpentine circle, enclosed by a pentagram must be engraved on the obverse side 
with a diamond-pointed graving tool. The reverse must bear a human head in the 
centre of the six-pointed star of Solomon, which shall itself be surrounded with 
the name of the solar intelligence Pi-Rhe, written in the characters of the 
Magi. This <I>talisman </I>is supposed to insure to its bearer the goodwill of 
influential persons. It is a preservative against death by heart disease, 
syncope, aneurism, and epidemic complaints. It must be composed on a Sunday 
during the passage of the moon through Leo, and when that luminary is in a 
favourable aspect with Saturn and the Sun. The consecration consists in the 
exposure of the <I>talisman </I>to the smoke of a perfume composed of cinnamon, 
incense, saffron, and red sandal, burnt with laurel-wood, and twigs of 
dessicated heliotrope, in a new chafing-dish, which must be ground into powder 
and buried in an isolated spot, after the operation is finished. The <I>talisman 
</I>must be afterwards encased in a satchel of bright yellow silk, which must be 
fastened on the breast l)y an interlaced ribbon of the same material, tied in 
the form of a cross. In all cases the ceremony should be preceded by the 
conjuration of the Four, to which the reader has already been referred. The form 
of consecration, accompanied by sprinkling with holy water, may be rendered in 
the following manner</P>
<P>&quot;In the name of Elohim, and by the spirit of the living waters, be thou 
unto me as a sign of light and a seal of will.</P>
<P>&quot;Presenting it to the smoke of the perfumes -By the brazen serpent 
before which fell the serpents of fire, be thou unto me as a sign of light and a 
seal of will.</P>
<P>&quot;Breathing seven times upon the <I>talisman </I>-By the firmament and 
the spirit of the voice, be thou unto me as a sign of light and a seal of will. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Lastly, when placing some grains of purified earth or salt upon the 
pentacle -In the name of the salt of the earth and by virtue of the life 
eternal, be thou unto me as a sign of light and a seal of will.</P>
<P>&quot;II. The <I>Talisman </I>of the Moon should be composed of a circular 
and well-polished plate of the purest silver, being of the dimensions of an 
ordinary medal. The image of a crescent, enclosed in a pentagram, should be 
graven on the obverse side. On the reverse side, a chalice must be encircled by 
the duadic seal of Solomon, encompassed by the letters of the lunar genius 
Pi-Job. This <I>talisman </I>is considered a protection to travellers, and to 
sojourners in strange lands. It preserves from death by drowning, by epilepsy, 
by dropsy, by apoplexy, and madness. The dangers of a violent end which is 
predicted by Saturnian aspects in horoscopes of nativity, may be removed by 
it&rsquo;s means. It should be composed on a Monday, when the moon is passing 
through the first ten degrees of Capricornus or Virgo, and is also well aspected 
with Saturn. Its consecration consists in exposure to a perfume composed of 
white sandal, camphor, aloes, amber, and pulverised seed of cucumber, burnt with 
dessicated stalks of mugwort, moonwort, and ranunculus, in a new earthen 
chafing-dish, which must be reduced, after the operation, into powder, and 
buried in a deserted spot. The <I>talisman </I>must be sewn up in a satchel of 
white silk, and fixed on the breast by a ribbon of the same colour, interlaced 
and tied in the form of a cross.</P>
<P>&quot;III. The <I>Talisman </I>of Mars must be composed of a well-polished 
circular plate of the finest iron, and of the dimensions of an ordinary medal. 
The symbol of a sword in the centre of a pentagram must be engraved on the 
obverse side. A lions head surrounded by a six-pointed star must appear on the 
reverse face, with the letters of the name Erotosi, the planetary genius of 
Mars, above the outer angles. This <I>talisman </I>passes as a preservative 
against all combinations of enemies. It averts the chance of death in brawls and 
battles, in epidemics and fevers, and by corroding ulcers. It also neutralizes 
the peril of a violent end as a punishment for crime when it is foretold in the 
horoscope of the nativity.</P>
<P>&quot;This <I>talisman </I>must be composed on a Tuesday, during the passage 
of the moon through the ten first degrees of Aries or Sagittarius, and when, 
moreover, it is favourably aspected with Saturn and Mars. The consecration 
consists in its exposure to the smoke of a perfume composed of dried absinth and 
rue, burnt in an earthen vessel which has never been previously used, and which 
must be broken into powder, and buried in a secluded place, when the operation 
is completed. Finally, the <I>talisman </I>must be sewn up in a satchel of red 
silk, and fastened on the breast with ribbons of the same material folded and 
knotted in the form of a cross.</P>
<P>&quot;IV. The <I>Talisman </I>of Mercury must be formed of a circular plate 
of fixed quicksilver, or according to another account of an amalgam of silver, 
mercury, and pewter, of the dimensions of an ordinary medal, well-polished on 
both sides. A winged caduceus, having two serpents twining about it, must be 
engraved in the centre of a pentagram on the obverse side. The other must bear a 
dog&rsquo;s head within the star of Solomon, the latter being surrounded with 
the name of the planetary genius, Pi-Hermes, written in the alphabet of the 
Magi. This <I>talisman </I>must be composed on a Wednesday, when the moon is 
passing through the ten first degrees of Gemini or Scorpio, and is well aspected 
with Saturn and Mercury. The consecration consists in its -exposure to the smoke 
of a perfume composed of benzoin, macis, and storax, burnt with the dried stalks 
of the lily, the narcissus, fumitory, and marjolane, placed in a clay 
chafing-dish which has never been devoted to any other purpose, and which must, 
after the completion of the task, be reduced to powder and buried in an 
undisturbed place. The <I>Talisman </I>of Mercury is judged to be a defence in 
all species of commerce and business industry. Buried under the ground in a 
house of commerce, it will draw customers and prosperity. It preserves all who 
wear it from epilepsy and madness. It averts death by murder and poison; it is a 
safeguard against the schemes of treason and it procures prophetic dreams when 
it is worn on the head during sleep. It is fastened on the breast by a ribbon of 
purple silk folded and tied in the form of a cross, and the <I>talisman </I>is 
itself enclosed in a satchel of the same material.</P>
<P>&quot;V. The <I>Talisman </I>of Jupiter must be formed of a circular plate of 
the purest English pewter, having the dimensions of an ordinary medal, and being 
highly polished on either side. The image of a four-pointed crown in the centre 
of a pentagram must be engraved on the obverse side. On the other must be the 
head of an eagle in the centre of the six-pointed star of Solomon, which must be 
surrounded by the name of the planetary genius Pi-Zeous, written in the arcane 
alphabet.</P>
<P>&quot;This <I>talisman </I>must be composed on a Thursday, during the passage 
of the moon through the first ten degrees of Libra, and when it is also in a 
favourable aspect with Saturn and Jupiter. The consecration consists in its 
exposure to the smoke of a perfume composed of incense, ambergris, balm, grain 
of Paradise, saffron, and macis, which is the second coat of the nutmeg. These 
must be burnt with wood of the oak, poplar, fig tree, and pomegranate, and 
placed in a new earthen dish, which must be ground into powder, and buried in a 
quiet spot, at the end of the ceremony. The <I>talisman </I>must be wrapped in a 
satchel of sky-blue silk, suspended on the breast by a ribbon of the same 
material, folded and fastened in the form of a cross.</P>
<P>&quot;The <I>Talisman </I>of Jupiter is held to attract to the wearer the 
benevolence and sympathy of everyone. It averts anxieties, favours honourable 
enterprises, and augments well-being in proportion to social condition. It is a 
protection against unforeseen accidents, and the perils of a violent death when 
it is threatened by Saturn in the horoscope of nativity. It also preserves from 
death by affections of the liver, by inflammation of the lungs, and by that 
cruel affection of the spinal marrow, which is termed <I>tabes dorsalis </I>in 
medicine.</P>
<P>&quot;VI. The <I>Talisman </I>of Venus must be formed of a circular plate of 
purified and well-polished copper. It must be of the ordinary dimensions of a 
medal, perfectly polished on both its sides. It must bear on the obverse face 
the letter G inscribed in the alphabet of the Magi, and enclosed in a pentagram. 
A dove must be engraved on the reverse, in the centre of the six-pointed star, 
which must be surrounded by the letters which compose the name of the planetary 
Genius Suroth. This <I>talisman </I>must be composed on a Friday, during the 
passage of the moon through the first ten degrees of Taurus or Virgo, and when 
that luminary is well aspected with Saturn and Venus. Its consecration consists 
in its exposure to the smoke of a perfume composed of violets and roses, burnt 
with olive wood in a new earthen chafing-dish, which must be ground into powder 
at the end of the operation and buried in a solitary spot. The <I>talisman 
</I>must, finally, be sewn up in a satchel of green or rose-coloured silk, which 
must be fastened on the breast by a band of the same material, folded and tied 
in the form of a cross.</P>
<P>&quot;The <I>Talisman </I>of Venus is accredited with extraordinary power in 
cementing the bonds of love and harmony between husbands and wives. It averts 
from those who wear it the spite and machinations of hatred. It preserves women 
from the terrible and fatal diseases which are known as cancer. It averts from 
both men and women all danger of death, to which they may be accidentally or 
purposely exposed. It counterbalances the unfortunate presages which may appear 
in the horoscope of nativity. Its last and most singular quality is its power to 
change the animosity of an enemy into a love and devotion which will be proof 
against every temptation, and it rests on the sole condition that such a person 
should be persuaded to partake of a liquid in which the <I>talisman </I>has been 
dipped.</P>
<P>&quot;VII. The <I>Talisman </I>of Saturn must be composed of a circular plate 
of refined and purified lead, being of the dimensions of an ordinary medal, 
elaborately polished. On the obverse side must be engraven with the 
diamond-pointed tool which is requisite in all these talismanic operations, the 
image of a sickle enclosed in a pentagram. The reverse side must bear a 
bull&rsquo;s head, enclosed in the star of Solomon, and surrounded by the 
mysterious letters which compose, in the alphabet of the Magi, the name of the 
planetary Genius Tempha. The person who is intended to wear this <I>talisman 
</I>must engrave it himself, without witnesses, and without taking any one into 
his confidence.</P>
<P>&quot;This <I>talisman </I>must be composed on a Saturday when the moon is 
passing through the first ten degrees of Taurus or Capricorn, and is favourably 
aspected with Saturn. It must be consecrated by exposure to the smoke of a 
perfume composed of alum, assa-foetida, cammonee, and sulphur, which must be 
burnt with cypress, the wood of the ash tree, and sprays of black hellebore, in 
a new earthen chafing-dish, which must be reduced into powder at the end of the 
performance, and buried in a deserted place. The <I>talisman </I>must, finally, 
be sewn up in a satchel of black silk and fastened on the breast with a ribbon 
of the same material, folded and tied in the form of a cross. The <I>Talisman 
</I>of Saturn was affirmed to be a safeguard against death by apoplexy and 
cancer, decay in the bones, consumption, dropsy, paralysis, and decline; it was 
also a preservative against the possibility of being entombed in a trance, 
against the danger of violent death by secret crime, poison, or ambush. If the 
head of the army in war-time were to bury the <I>Talisman </I>of Saturn in a 
place which it was feared might fall into the hands of the enemy, the limit 
assigned by the presence of the <I>talisman </I>could not be overstepped by the 
opposing host, which would speedily withdraw in discouragement, or in the face 
of a determined assault.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>(See

<P>Talmud, The :</B> From the Hebrew <I>lamad, </I>to learn; the name of the 
great code of Jewish civil and canonical law. It is divided into two 
portions-the <I>Mishna </I>and the <I>Gemara; </I>the former constituted the 
text and the latter was a commentary and supplement. But besides being the basis 
of a legal code, it is also a collection of Jewish poetry and legend. The 
<I>Mishna </I>is a development of the laws contained in the Pentateuch. It is 
divided into six <I>sedarim </I>or orders, each containing a number of 
tractates, which are again divided into <I>peraqim </I>or chapters. The 
<I>sedarim </I>are : </P>
<P>(<B>1</B>) <I>Zeraim, </I>which deals with agriculture (<B>2</B>) <I>Moed, 
</I>with festivals and sacrifices ; (<B>3</B>) <I>Nashim, </I>with the law 
regarding women ; (<B>4</B>) <I>Nezaqin, </I>with civil law (<B>5</B>) 
<I>Qodashim, </I>with the sacrificial law ; and (<B>6</B>) <I>Tohoroth </I>or 
<I>Tak, </I>with purifications. The <I>Mishna </I>was supposed to have been 
handed down by Ezra and to be in part the work of Joshua, David or Solomon, and 
originally communicated orally by the Deity in the time of Moses. There are two 
recensions-the <I>Talmud </I>of Jerusalem, and the <I>Talmud </I>of Babylon; 
which latter besides the <I>sedarim </I>mentioned contains seven additional 
treatises which are regarded as extra-canonical. The first is supposed to have 
been finally edited towards the close of the fourth century A.D., and the second 
by Rabbi Ashi, President of the Academy of Syro in Babylon, somewhere in the 
fourth century. Though revised from time to time before then, both versions have 
been greatly corrupted through the interpolation of gross traditions. The 
rabbinical decisions in the <I>Mishna </I>are entitled <I>helacoth </I>and the 
traditional narratives <I>haggadah. </I>The cosmogony of the <I>Talmud 
</I>assumes that the universe has been developed by means of a series of 
cataclysms world after world was destroyed until the Creator made the present 
globe and saw that it was good. In the wonderful treatise on the subject by 
Deutsch which first appeared in the <I>Quarterly Review </I>in <B>1867</B>, and 
is reprinted in his <I>Literary Remains, </I>the following passage appears:-</P>
<P>&quot;The <I>how </I>of the creation was not mere matter of speculation. The 
co-operation of angels, whose existence was warranted by Scripture, and a whole 
hierarchy of whom had been built up under Persian influences, &quot;as 
distinctly denied. In a discussion about the day of their creation, it is agreed 
on all hands that there were no angels at first, lest men might say, Michael 
spanned out the firmament on the south, and Gabriel to the north. There is a 
distinct foreshadowing of the Gnostic Demiurgos-that antique link between the 
Divine Spirit and the world of matter-to be found in the <I>Talmud. </I>What 
with Plato were the Ideas, with Philo the Logos, with the Kabalists the World of 
Aziluth, what the Gnostics called more emphatically the wisdom (sophia), or 
power (dunamis), and Plotinus the nous, that the Talmudical authors call 
Metation. There is a good deal, in the post-captivity <I>Talmud, </I>about the 
Angels, borrowed from the Persian. The Archangels or Angelic princes are seven 
in number, and their Hebrew names and functions correspond almost exactly to 
those of their Persian prototypes. There are also hosts of ministering angels, 
the Persian <I>Yazatas, </I>whose functions, besides that of being messengers, 
were two-fold- to praise God and to be guardians of man. In their first capacity 
they are daily created by God&rsquo;s breath out of a stream of fire that rolls 
its waves under the supernal throne. In their second, two of them accompany 
every man, and for every new good deed man acquires a new guardian angel, who 
always watches over his steps. When a righteous man died, three hosts of angels 
descend from the celestial battlements to meet him. One says (in the words of 
Scripture), He shall go in peace ; the second takes up the strain and says, Who 
has walked in righteousness; and the third concludes, Let him come in peace and 
rest upon his bed. In like manner, when the wicked man passes away, three hosts 
of wicked angels are ready to escort him, but their address is not couched in 
any spirit of consolation or encouragement.&quot;</P>
<P>It would be impossible in this place to give a resume of the traditional 
matter contained in the <I>Talmud. </I>Suffice it to say that it is of great 
extent. It has been considered by some authorities that a great many of the 
traditional tales have a magical basis, and that magical secrets are contained 
in them; but this depends entirely upon the interpretation put upon them, and 
the subject is one which necessitates the closest possible study.</P>

<P>Tannhauser :</B> A medieval German legend which relates how a minstrel and 
knight of that name, passing by the Horselberg, or Hill of Venus, entered 
therein in answer to a call, and remained there with the enchantress, living an 
unholy life. After a time he grew weary of sin, and longing to return to clean 
living, he for swore the worship of Venus and left her. He then made a 
pilgrimage to Rome, to ask pardon of the Pope, but when he was told by Urban 
IV., himself that the papal staff would as soon blossom as such a sinner as 
<I>Tannhauser </I>be forgiven, he returned to Venus. Three days later, the 
Pope&rsquo;s staff did actually blossom, and he sent messengers into every 
country to find the despairing minstrel, but to no purpose, <I>Tannhauser 
</I>had disappeared. The story has a mythological basis which has been laid over 
by medieval Christian thought, and the original hero of which has been displaced 
by a more modern personage, just as the Venus of the existing legend is the 
mythological Venus only in name. She is really the Lady Holda, a German 
earth-goddess. <I>Tannhauser </I>was a &quot; minnesinger &quot; or 
love-minstrel of the middle of the thirteenth century. He was very popular among 
the minnesingers of that time and the restless and intemperate life he led 
probably marked him out as the hero of such a legend as has been recounted. He 
was the author of many ballads of considerable excellence, which are published 
in the second part of the &quot; Minnesinger&quot; (Von der Hagen, Leipsic, 
<B>1838</B>) and in the sixth volume of Haupt&rsquo;s <I>Zeitschrift fur 
deutsches Althertum. </I>The most authentic version of this legend is given in 
Uhland&rsquo;s <I>Alte hock und niederdeuteche Volhslieder </I>(Stuttgart, 
<B>1845</B>).</P>

<P>Tappan-Richmond, Mrs. Cora L. V. :</B> Perhaps the best known of all the 
inspirational speakers who have appeared since the beginning of the 
spiritualistic movement. As a child <I>Mrs. Tappan-Richmond-then </I>Miss 
Scott-spent some time in the Hopedale Community (q.v.), so that she was early 
initiated into the mysteries of spiritualism. At the age of sixteen she went to 
New York, and became an inspired &quot; lecturer on spiritualism, in which 
capacity she soon became famous throughout America. Coming to Britain in 
<B>1873</B> she was warmly received by the spiritualists in this country, and 
for a number of years gave frequent trance discourses, characterised by their 
rhythm and fluency, and the comparative clarity of their ideas.</P>

<P>Tarot, or Tarots :</B> is the French name for a species of playing-cards, 
originally used for the purpose of divination, and still employed by 
fortune-tellers. <I>Tarot </I>cards, however, form part of an ordinary pack in 
certain countries of southern Europe, whence the name of <I>tarocchi </I>given 
to an Italian game. The derivation of the word is uncertain. One suggestion is 
that these cards were so called because they were <I>tarotees </I>on the back; 
that is, marked with plain or dotted lines crossing diagonally. Confirmation of 
this theory may be found in the German form of the word a <I>tarock-karie 
</I>being a card chequered on the back. Not improbably, however, there is here a 
confusion between cause and effect.</P>
<P>De l&rsquo; Hoste Ranking, who dismisses as &quot; obviously worthless&quot; 
the explanations of Count de Gebelin, Vaillant and Mathers, refers the name to 
the Hungarian Gipsy <I>tar, </I>a pack of cards, and thence to the Hinddustani 
<I>taru. </I>The figures on these cards are emblematic, and are believed by many 
to embody the esoteric religion of ancient Egypt and India; but on this subject 
there is much difference of opinion.</P>
<P>&quot;The <I>tarot </I>pack most in use,&quot; observes Ranking, &quot; 
consists of seventy-eight cards, of which twenty-two are more properly known as 
the <I>tarots, </I>and are considered as the keys of the <I>tarot </I>; these 
correspond with the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet, or, according to 
Falconnier and to Margiotta, with the alphabet of the Magi. The suits are four : 
<I>wands, sceptres, </I>or <I>clubs, </I>answering to diamonds ; <I>cups, 
chalices, </I>or <I>goblets, </I>answering to hearts ; <I>swords, </I>answering 
to spades ; <I>money, circles, </I>or <I>pentacles, </I>answering to clubs. Each 
suit consists of fourteen cards, the ace, and nine others, and four court cards: 
king, queen, knight, and knave. The four aces form the keys of their respective 
suits.&quot; As already indicated, the twenty-two &quot; keys of the 
<I>tarot,&quot; </I>which consist of various emblematic figures, are assumed to 
be hieroglyphic symbols of the occult meanings of the letters of the Hebrew 
alphabet; or, alternatively, &quot; the alphabet of the Magi.&quot; &quot; 
Immense antiquity is claimed for these symbols,&quot; observes Ranking. &quot; 
Alliette or (by transposition) Etteilla, a French mystic of the beginning of the 
nineteenth century, ascribed their origin to Hermes Trismegistus, under the name 
of <I>The Book of Thoth, </I>or <I>The Golden Book of Hermes. </I>Others have 
sought to identify the <I>tarot </I>with the sibylline leaves.&quot; Raymond 
Lully (<B>1235</B>-<B>1315</B>) is said to have based his great work, <I>Ars 
Generalis sive Magna, </I>on the application of the occult philosophy contained 
in the <I>tarot.</I></P>
<P>The idea that the <I>tarot </I>was introduced into Europe by the Gypsies 
appears to have been first broached by Vaillant, who had lived for many years 
among the Gypsies, by whom he was instructed in their traditional lore. Much of 
the information thus obtained is incorporated in <I>Les Romes, histoire vraie 
des vrais Bohemiens </I>(c. <B>1853</B>), <I>La Bible des Bohemiens 
</I>(<B>1860</B>), and <I>La Clef Magique de la Fiction et du Fait 
</I>(<B>1863</B>). Vaillant&rsquo;s theory has been fully accepted by a French 
writer, &quot; Papus,&quot; who published in <B>1889</B> <I>Le Tarot des 
Bohimiens : Le Plus Ancien Livre du Monde </I>describing it as &quot; <I>la clef 
absolue de la science occulte.&quot;</I></P>
<P>&quot;The Gypsies possess a Bible,&quot; he asserts ; &quot; yes, this card 
game called the <I>Tarot </I>which the Gypsies possess is. the Bible of Bibles. 
It is a marvellous book, as Count de Gebelin and especially Vaillant have 
realized. Under the names of <I>Tarot, </I>Thora, Rota, this game has formed 
successively the basis of the synthetic teaching of all the ancient 
peoples.&quot;</P>
<P>Although it may not be possible to accept this dictum in its entirety, it is 
of interest to note that Ranking concludes that these and all other 
playing-cards were introduced into Europe by the Gypsies. &quot; I would submit, 
he says, writing in <B>1908</B>, that from internal evidence we may deduce that 
the <I>tarots </I>were introduced by a race speaking an Indian dialect; that the 
form of the Pope (as portrayed in the <I>tarots) </I>shows they had been long in 
a country where the orthodox Eastern Church predominated; and the form of 
head-dress of the king, together with the shape of the eagle on the shield, 
shows that this was governed by Russian Grand Dukes, who had not yet assumed the 
Imperial insignia. This seems to me confirmatory of the widespread belief that 
it is to the Gypsies we are indebted for our knowledge of playing-cards.&quot; 
It will be seen that this conclusion is based upon independent judgment. As 
early, however, as <B>1865</B> - two years after the appearance of 
Vaillant&rsquo;s last book-H. S. Taylor supported the same hypothesis in his 
<I>History of Playing Cards. </I>Willshire <I>(Descriptive Catalogues of Cards 
in the British Museum, </I><B>1877</B>) controverts Taylor&rsquo;s conclusion, 
on the ground that &quot;whether the Zingari be of Egyptian or Indian origin, 
they did not appear in Europe before <B>1417</B>, when cards had been known for 
some time.&quot; But this objection is nullified by the fact that the presence 
of Gypsies, in Europe is now placed at a date considerably anterior to 
<B>1417</B>. There was, for example, a well-established <I>feudum Acinganorum, 
</I>or Gypsy barony, in the island of Corfu in the fourteenth century.</P>
<P>To examine in detail the various emblematic figures of the <I>tarot </I>would 
demand a disproportionate amount of space. Ranking&rsquo;s reference to the Pope 
and the King points to two of these twenty-two figures. The others are : the 
Female Pope, the Queen, Osiris Triumphant, The Wheel of Fortune, Justice, 
Prudence, Temperance, Strength, Marriage, The Philosopher, The Juggler, Death, 
The Devil, The Fool, The Lightning-struck Tower, The Sun, The Moon, The Star, 
The Universe, The Last Judgment. There is great diversity of opinion, even among 
initiates,&quot; as to the meaning of these symbols. They are very fully 
discussed in the work of Papus&quot;. already cited ; to which the reader is 
specially referred. On the whole, there is much to be said in favour of the 
theory that the origin of the <I>tarot </I>is traceable to the esoteric 
philosophy of the schools of ancient Egypt and Chaldea, by whatever means it has 
found its way into Europe. In addition to the works already cited, <I>see Le

<P>Telekinesis :</B> A term denoting the hypothetical faculty of moving material 
objects by thought alone. The movement of objects without contact-a frequent 
phenomenon of the seance-room, including in its wider sense rappings, 
table-tiltings, levitations, the conveyance of <I>apports, </I>practically all 
material phenomena, with the possible exception of materialisation-is exceeding 
difficult of explanation on rational grounds, and the attempt to explain it 
thus, without the intervention of discarnate spirits, has given rise to the 
telekinetic theory, which holds that all these varied feats are accomplished by 
the thoughts of medium and sitters, independent of muscular energy, whether 
direct or indirect. How thought can possibly act in this immediate way on 
inanimate matter is beyond comprehension in our present state of knowledge. The 
evidence for <I>telekinesis </I>is very much less than, say, that for telepathy. 
The telekinetic theory is akin to that offered by the magnetists, who regarded a 
fluidic or energetic emanation as the cause of the movements.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Telepathy :</B> Of the various branches of psychic phenomena there is none 
which engages more serious attention at the present day than <I>telepathy </I>or 
thought transference. The idea of inter-communication between brain and brain, 
by other means than that of the ordinary sense-channels, is a theory deserving 
of the most careful consideration, not only in its simple aspect as a claimant 
for recognition as an important scientific fact, but also because there is 
practically no department of psychic phenomena on which it has not some bearing. 
To take one instance-a few decades ago the so-called &quot;rationalist&quot; 
view of ghosts was simply that supernatural phenomena did not exist, but now a 
telepathic explanation is offered, more or less tentatively, by an 
ever-increasing body of intelligent opinion. There are those who, while 
admitting the genuineness of psychic phenomena are yet satisfied that pure 
psychology provides a field sufficiently wide for their researches, and who are 
loath to extend its boundaries to include an unknown spirit-world where research 
becomes a hundred-fold more difficult. To such students the theory of 
<I>telepathy </I>affords an obvious way of escape from that element of the 
supernatural to which they are opposed, since it is generally agreed that in 
seeking an explanation of thought transference it is a physical process which 
must be looked for. In the words of Sir William Crookes : &quot; It is known 
that the action of thought is accompanied by certain molecular movements in the 
brain, and here we have physical vibrations capable from their extreme 
minuteness of acting direct on individual molecules, while their rapidity 
approaches that of the internal and external movements of the atoms 
themselves.&quot;</P>
<P>There is therefore nothing to render the theory of thought-vibrations 
impossible, or even improbable, though the difficulty of proving it has yet to 
be overcome. We have, however, to contend with the fact that in many cases on 
record the most vivid impressions have been transmitted from a distance, thus 
showing that the distinctness of the impression does not necessarily decrease in 
proportion as the distance becomes greater. In this case we must either conclude 
that there are other factors to be taken into account, such as the varying 
intensity of the impression, and the varying degrees of sensitiveness in the 
percipient, or we must conclude, as some authorities have done, that telepathic 
communication goes direct from one mind to another, irrespective of distance, 
just as thought can travel to the opposite side of the globe with as much ease 
as it can pass to the next room. Other authorities claim that the transmission 
of thought is on a different plane from any physical process, though, as the 
action of thought itself has a physical basis, it is difficult to understand why 
a supernatural explanation should be thought necessary in the case of 
<I>telepathy. </I>In the former connection it may be remarked that trivial 
circumstances can be transmitted to a percipient near at hand, while as a rule 
only the more intense and violent impressions are received from a distance. The 
question whether the telepathic principle is diffusive, and spreads equally in 
all directions, or whether it can be projected directly toward one individual, 
is still a vexed one. If it be in the form of ethereal vibrations, it would 
certainly seem easier to regard it as diffusive. On the other hand, practical 
experience has shown that in many instances, even when acting from a distance, 
it affects only one or two individuals. However, this might be explained 
naturally enough by the assumption that each transmitter requires a special 
receiver-i.e., a mind in sympathy with itself. But as yet no explanation is 
forthcoming, and the most that can be done is to suspend judgment for the 
present, knowing that only the possibility, or, at most, the likelihood, of such 
a mode of communication has been proved, and that of its machinery nothing can 
be said beyond the vaguest surmise.</P>
<P>The theory of thought transference is no new one. Like gravitation, it is a 
daughter of the hoary science of astrology, but while gravitation is a 
full-grown fact, universally accepted of science, <I>telepathy, </I>in its 
scientific aspect, is as yet an infant, and a weakling at that. However, it is 
not difficult to understand how both should spring from astrology, nor to trace 
the connection between them. The wise men of ancient days supposed the stars to 
radiate an invisible influence which held them together in their course, and 
which affected men and events on our planet, receiving in their turns some 
subtle emanation from the earth and its inhabitants. From this idea it was but a 
step to assume that a radiant influence, whether magnetic or otherwise, passed 
from one human being to another. The doctrine of astral influence was shared by 
Paracelsus and his alchemistic successors until the epoch of Sir Isaac Newton, 
whose discovery of the law of gravitation brought the age of astrology to a 
close. To the conception of magnetic influence colour was lent by the practices 
of Mesmer, and his followers, who ascribed to the &quot;magnetic fluid &quot; 
the phenomena of hypnosis. The analogy between the mysterious and inexplicable 
force binding worlds together and the subtle influence joining mind with mind is 
sufficiently obvious, but the difficulty is that while gravitation may be 
readily demonstrated, and never fails to give certain definite results, 
experiments in <I>telepathy </I>reveal the phenomena only in the most spasmodic 
fashion and cannot be depended upon to succeed even under the most favourable 
conditions. Nevertheless such systematized experiments as have been conducted 
from time to time have more than justified the interest which has been displayed 
in <I>telepathy. </I>Science, which had so long held herself aloof from 
hypnosis, was not desirous of repeating her error in a new connection. In 
<B>1882</B> the Society for Psychical Research (q.v.) came into being. numbering 
among its members some of the most distinguished men in the country. It had for 
its object the elucidation of the so-called supernatural&quot; phenomena which 
were exciting so much popular interest and curiosity; and foremost among these 
was the phenomenon of thought transference, or, as it has since been christened, 
<I>telepathy. </I>Viewing their subject in a purely scientific light, trained in 
the handling of evidence, and resolved to pursue truth with open and unbiassed 
minds, they did much to bring the study of psychic phenomena into a purer and 
more dignified atmosphere. They recognized the untrustworthiness of human nature 
in general, and the prevalence of fraud even where no object was to be gained 
but the gratification of a perverted vanity, and their experiments were 
conducted under the most rigid conditions, with every precaution taken against 
conscious or unconscious deception. Among the most valuable evidence obtained 
from experimental thought transference was that gleaned by Professor and Mrs. 
Sidgwick (q.v.) from their experiments at Brighton in <B>1889</B>-<B>95</B>. In 
this series the percipients-clerks and shop assistants-were hypnotized. 
Sometimes they were asked to visualize, on a blank card, an image or picture 
chosen by the agent. At other times the agent would choose one of a bundle of 
cards numbered from so to <B>90, </B>and the percipient was required to state 
the number on the picked card, which was done correctly in a surprising number 
of cases. We find, curiously enough, that the results varied in proportion as 
the agent and percipient were near or far apart, and were materially affected by 
the intervention of a door, or even a curtain, between the two, but this was 
ascribed to a lack of confidence on the part of the percipient, or to such 
physical causes as fatigue or ennui, rather than to the limited scope of the 
telepathic principle. On the whole we are justified in thinking that chance 
alone would not account for the number of correct replies given by the 
hypnotised subject.</P>
<P>Towards the end of the century a criticism was levelled at these experiments 
by Messrs. Hansen and Lehmann, of Copenhagen, whose belief it was that the 
phenomenon known as &quot; subconscious whispering,&quot; together with 
hyperaesthesia on the part of the percipient, would suffice to produce the 
results obtained by the Sidgwicks. This suggested explanation, while it does not 
cover the entire ground has some right to our consideration. If hypnotism 
reveals so marvellous a refinement of the perceptions, may not some elements of 
hyperaesthesia linger in the subconsciousness of the normal individual? If 
dreams contain in the experience of almost everyone, such curious examples of 
deduction, may not the mental under-current follow in waking moments a process 
of reasoning of which the higher consciousness knows nothing ? It may, and it 
does. That &quot; other self,&quot; which is never quite so much in the 
background as we imagine, sees and hears a thousand things of which we are 
unconscious, and which come to the surface in dreams, it may be long afterwards; 
and there is no reason to suppose that it might not see and hear indications too 
slight to be perceived in a grosser sphere of consciousness, and thus account 
for some cases of &quot;thought transference.&quot; On the other hand, we have 
evidences of <I>telepathy </I>acting at a distance where sub-conscious 
whispering and hyperaesthesia are obviously out of the question. Though 
hyperaesthesia may be advanced as a plausible explanation in some - or, indeed, 
in many-instances of <I>telepathy, </I>it cannot be accepted as a complete 
explanation unless it covers <I>all </I>cases, and that it certainly does not. 
So we must look elsewhere for the explanation, though it is not without 
reluctance that we quit a theory so admirably adapted to known conditions that 
it scarcely requires a stretching of established physiological laws to make 
<I>telepathy </I>fit as naturally as wireless telegraphy into the scheme of 
things.</P>
<P>As has been earlier mentioned, practically every branch of psychic phenomena 
would be vitally affected by the scientific proof of <I>telepathy. 
</I>Coincident dreams might, in the majority of cases, be easily explained away. 
The visions of the crystal-gazer, the trance-utterances of the medium, could be 
accounted for in the same manner, together with the occasional apparitions 
visiting the normal individual. Apparitions of the dead, however, do not so 
readily submit themselves to a telepathic explanation. If they are genuine 
apparitions, and not meaningless hallucinations, we must either admit that the 
impulse directing the impression comes from the surviving spirit of the deceased 
agent, or that it was transmitted while he was yet alive. In the latter case we 
are confronted with a difficulty-how to account for the time which may elapse 
between the death of the agent and the appearance of the vision. To bridge the 
gap thus formed Mr. Podmore (q.v.), in his work on <I>Telepathic Hallucinations, 
</I>has produced his theory of <I>latent impressions, </I>which successfully 
overcomes the difficulty. According to Mr. Podmore, impressions transmitted from 
one mind to another may remain latent for a considerable time awaiting a 
favourable opportunity for development. Thus the apparition of one who been dead 
for some time may result from an impression transmitted during his lifetime, 
which the percipient has retained, until a chance combination of ideas brings it 
into the upper stratum of consciousness in the form of a hallucination. 
Obviously the theory of latent impressions may bear on other phenomena than that 
of apparitions, and serve to fill in gaps which might otherwise remain 
blank.</P>
<P>It is interesting to compare the tone of criticisms pronounced on 
<I>telepathy </I>in the last quarter of the nineteenth century with that which 
characterises later utterances on the subject. Science is no longer ashamed to 
pursue her researches in psychic phenomena thought transference no longer 
appears to intellectual people as a doubtful by-path of psychology, and the 
change argues that at least a fair attempt will be made to reach the truth of 
the matter.</P><I>

remote spot and become a hermit.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Templars :</B> The Knights <I>Templars </I>of the Temple of Solomon were a 
military order, founded by a Burgundian, Hugues de Payns, and Godeffroi de St. 
Omer, a French Knight, in <B>1119</B>, for the purpose of protecting pilgrims 
journeying into the Holy Land. They were soon joined by other knights, and a 
religious chivalry speedily gathered around this nucleus. Baldwin I., King of 
Jerusalem, gave them as headquarters a portion of his palace, contiguous to a 
mosque which tradition asserted was part of the Temple of Solomon, and from this 
building they took their designation. One of the purposes of the Society was to 
convert and render useful knights of evil life, and so many of these entered the 
order, as to bring it under the suspicion of the Church, but there is every 
reason to believe that its founders were instigated by motives of the deepest 
piety, and that they lived in a condition akin to poverty, notwithstanding the 
numerous gifts that were showered upon them, is the best proof of this. They had 
properly constituted officials, a Grand Master, knights, chaplains, sergeants, 
craftsmen, sensechals, marechals, and commanders. The order had its own clergy 
exempt from the jurisdiction of diocesan rule, and its chapters were held as a 
rule in secret. The dress of the brotherhood was a white mantle with a red cross 
for unmarried knights, and a black or brown mantle with a red cross for the 
others. The discipline was of the very strictest description and the food and 
clothing stipulated were rough and not abundant. By the middle of the twelfth 
century, the new order had got a footing in nearly all the Latin kingdoms of 
Christendom. It&rsquo;s power grew apace, and it&rsquo;s organisation became 
widespread. It formed, as it were, a nucleus of the Christian effort against the 
paganism of the east, and it&rsquo;s history may be said to he that of the 
crusades. Moreover it became a great trading corporation, the greatest 
commercial agency between the east and west, and as such amassed immense wealth. 
On the fall of the Latin kingdom in Palestine, the <I>Temples </I>had perforce 
to withdraw from that country, and although they continued to harass the Saracen 
power they made but little headway against it, and in reality appear to have 
undertaken commercial pursuits in preference to those of a more warlike 
character. When the Temple was at the apogee of its power, its success aroused 
the envy and avarice of Philip IV. of France, who commenced a series of attacks 
upon it. The election of Pope Clement V., who was devoted to his interests, and 
a denunciation of the order for heresy and immorality gave Philip his chance. 
For several generations before this time, strange stories had been circulating 
concerning the secret rites of the <I>Templars </I>which were assisted by the 
very strict privacy of these meetings, which were usually held at day-break with 
closely-guarded doors. It was alleged that the most horrible blasphemies and 
indecencies took place at these meetings, that the cross was trampled under foot 
and spat upon, and that an idol named Baphomet (q.v.) <I>(Baphe metios, 
</I>baptism of wisdom) was adored, or even the Devil in the shape of a black 
cat. Other tales told of the roasting of children, and the smearing of the idol 
with their burning fat, and other nonsense was wildly promulgated by the 
credulous and ignorant. A certain Esquian de Horian, pretended to betray the 
secret &quot; of the <I>Templars </I>to Philip, and they were denounced to the 
Inquisition ; and Jacques do Molay, the Grand Master, who had been called from 
Cyprus to France, was arrested with one hundred and forty of his brethren in 
Paris and thrown into prison. A universal arrest of the <I>Templars 
</I>throughout France followed. The wretched knights were tortured <I>en masse, 
</I>and as was usually the case, under such compulsion, confessed to the most 
grotesque crimes, and the most damning confession of all, was that of the Grand 
Master himself, who confessed that he had been guilty of denying Christ and 
spitting upon the Cross, but repudiated all charges of immorality in indignant 
terms.</P>
<P>The process dragged on slowly during more than three years, in consequence of 
the jealousies which arose among those who were more or less interested in its 
prosecution. The pope wished to bring it entirely under the jurisdiction of the 
church, and to have it decided at Rome. The king, on the other hand, mistrusting 
the pope, and resolved on the destruction of the order, and that none but 
himself should reap advantage of it, decided that it should be judged at Paris 
under his own personal influence. The prosecution was directed by his ministers, 
Nogaret, and Enguerrand de Marigny. The <I>Templars </I>asserted their 
innocence, and demanded a fair trial; but they found few advocates who would 
undertake their defence, and they were subjected to hardships and tortures which 
forced many of them into confessions dictated to them by their persecutors. 
During this interval, the popes orders were carried into other countries, 
ordering the arrest of the <I>Templars, </I>and the seizure of their goods, and 
everywhere the same charges were brought against them, and the same means 
adopted to procure their condemnation, although they were not everywhere 
subjected to the same severity as in France. At length, in the spring of 
<B>1316, </B>the grand process was opened in Paris, and an immense number of 
<I>Templars, </I>brought from all parts of the kingdom, under-went a public 
examination. A long act of accusation was read, some of the heads of which were, 
that the <I>Templars, </I>at their reception into the order, denied Christ (and 
sometimes they denied expressly all the saints) declaring that he was not God 
truly, but a false prophet, a man who had been punished for his crimes ; that 
they had no hope of salvation through him ; that they always, at their 
initiation into the order, spit upon the cross, and trod it under foot that they 
did this especially on Good Friday; that they worshipped a certain cat, which 
sometimes appeared to them in their congregation ; that they did not believe in 
any of the sacraments of the church ; that they took secret oaths which they 
were bound not to reveal; that the brother who officiated at the reception of a 
new brother kissed the naked body of the latter, often in a very unbecoming 
manner; that each different province of the order had its idol, which was a 
head, having sometimes three faces, and at others only one; or sometimes a human 
skull; these idols they worshipped in their chapters and congregations, 
believing that they had the power of making them rich, and of causing the trees 
to flourish, and the earth to become fruitful; that they girt themselves with 
cords, with which these idols had been superstitiously touched ; that those who 
betrayed the secrets of their order, or were disobedient, were thrown into 
prison, and often put to death; that they held their chapters secretly and by 
night, and placed a watch to prevent them from any danger of interruption or 
discovery; and that they believed the Grand Master alone had the power of 
absolving them from their sins. The publication of these charges, and the 
agitation which had been designedly got up, created such a horror throughout 
France, that the <I>Templars </I>who died during the process were treated as 
condemned heretics, and burial in consecrated ground was refused to their 
remains.</P>
<P>When we read over the numerous examinations of the <I>Templars, </I>in other 
countries, as well as in France, we cannot hut feel convinced that some of these 
charges had a degree of foundation, though perhaps the circumstances on which 
they were founded were misunderstood. A very great number of knights agreed to 
the general points of the formula of initiation, and we cannot but believe that 
they did deny Christ, and that they spat and trod upon the cross. The words of 
the denial were, <I>Je reney Deu</I> <I>Je reney Jhesu, </I>repeated thrice ; 
but most of those who confessed having gone through this ceremony, declared that 
they did it with repugnance, and that they spat beside the cross, and not on it. 
The reception took place in a secret room, with closed doors ; the candidate was 
compelled to take off part or all of his garments (very rarely the latter), and 
then he was kissed on various parts of the body. One of the knight&rsquo;s 
examined, Guischard de Marzici, said he remembered the receptlon of Hugh de 
Marhaud, of the diocese of Lyons, whom he saw taken into a small room, which was 
closed up so that no one could see or hear what took place within ; but that 
when, after some time, he was let out, he was very pale, and looked as though he 
were troubled and amazed <I>(fuit valde pallidus et quasi turbatus et 
stupefactus.) </I>In conjunction, however, with these strange and revolting 
ceremonies, there were others that showed a reverence for the Christian church 
and its ordinances, a profound faith in Christ, and the consciousness that the 
partaker of them was entering into a holy vow.</P>
<P>M. Michelet, who has carefully investigated the materials relating to the 
trial of the <I>Templars, </I>has suggested at least an ingenious explanation of 
these anomalies. He imagines that the form of reception was borrowed from the 
figurative mysteries and rites of the early church. The candidate for admission 
into the order, according to this notion, was first presented as a sinner and 
renegade, in which character, after the example of St. Peter, he denied Christ. 
This denial was a sort of pantomime, in which the novice expressed his reprobate 
state by spitting on the cross. The candidate was then stripped of his profane 
clothing, received through the kiss of the order into a higher state of faith, 
and re-dressed with the garb of its holiness. Forms like these would, in the 
middle ages, be easily misunderstood, and their original meaning soon 
forgotten.</P>
<P>Another charge in the accusation of the <I>Templars </I>seems to have been to 
a great degree proved by the depositions of witnesses; the idol or head which 
they were said to have worshipped, but the real character or meaning of which we 
are totally unable to explain. Many <I>Templars </I>confessed to having seen 
this idol, but as they described it differently, we must suppose that it was not 
in all cases represented under the same form. Some said it was a frightful head, 
with long beard and sparkling eyes; others said it was a man&rsquo;s skull; some 
described it as having three faces ; some said it was of wood, and others of 
metal; one witness described it as a painting <I>(tabula picta) </I>representing 
the image of a man, <I>(imago hominis), </I>and said that when it was shown to 
him, he was ordered to&quot; adore Christ his creator.&quot; According to some 
it was a gilt figure, either of wood or metal ; while others described it as 
painted black and white. According to another deposition, the idol had four 
feet-two before and two behind ; the one belonging to the order at Paris was 
said to be a silver head, with two faces and a beard. The novices of the order 
were told always to regard this idol as their saviour. Deodatus Jaffet, a knight 
from the south of France, who had been received at Pedenat, deposed that the 
person who in his case performed the ceremonies of reception, showed him a head 
or idol, which appeared to have three faces, and said, &quot; You must adore 
this as your saviour, and the saviour of the order of the Temple,&quot; and that 
he was made to worship the idol, saying, &quot; Blessed be he who shall save my 
soul.&quot; Cettus Ragonis, a knight received at Rome in a chamber of the palace 
of the Lateran, gave a somewhat similar account. Many other witnesses spoke of 
having seen these heads, which, however, were, perhaps, not shown to everybody, 
for the greatest number of those who spoke on this subject, said that they had 
heard speak of the bead, but that they had never seen it themselves; and many of 
them declared their disbelief in its existence. A friar minor deposed in England 
that an English <I>Templar </I>had assured him that in that country the order 
had four principal idols, one at London in the sacristy of the Temple, another 
at Bristeham, a third at Brueria (Bruern in Lincolnshire). and a fourth beyond 
the Humber.</P>
<P>Some of the knights from the south added another circumstance in their 
confessions relating to this head. A <I>Tempter </I>of Florence declared that, 
in the secret meetings of the chapters, one brother said to the others, showing 
them the idol, Adore this head. This head is your God, and your Mahomet.&quot; 
Another, Gauserand de Montpesant, said that the idol was made in the figure of 
Baffomet <I>(in figuram Baffometi); </I>and another Raymond Rubei, described it 
as a wooden head, on which was painted the figure of Baphomet, and he adds, 
&quot;that he worshipped it by kissing its feet, and exclaiming, <I>Yalla,&quot; 
</I>which he describes as &quot;a word of the Saracens &quot; <I>(verbum 
Saracenorum). </I>This has been seized upon by some as a proof that the 
<I>Tempters </I>had secretly embraced Mahometanism. As Baffomet or Baphomet is 
evidently a corruption of Mahomet; but it must not be forgotten that the 
Christians of the West constantly used the word Mahomet in the mere 
signification of an idol, and that it was the desire of those who conducted the 
prosecution against the <I>Tempters </I>to show their intimate intercourse with 
the Saracens. Others, especially Von Hammer, gave a Greek derivation of the 
word, and assumed it as a proof that Gnosticism was the secret doctrine of the 
Temple.</P>
<P>The confessions with regard to the mysterious cat were much rarer and more 
vague. Some Italian knights confessed that they had been present at a secret 
chapter of twelve knights held at Brindisi, at which a grey cat suddenly 
appeared amongst them, and that they worshipped it. At Nismes, some <I>Templars 
</I>declared that they had been present at a chapter at Montpellier, at which 
the demon appeared to them in the form of a cat, and promised them worldly 
prosperity; and added, that they saw devils in the shape of women. Gilletus de 
Encreyo, a <I>Templar </I>of the diocese of Rheims, who disbelieved in the story 
of the cat, deposed that he had heard say, though he knew not by whom, that in 
some of their battles beyond sea, a cat had appeared to them. An English knight, 
who was examined at London, deposed, that in England they did not adore the cat 
or the idol to his knowledge, but he had beard it positively stated that they 
worshipped the cat and the idol in parts beyond sea. English witnesses deposed 
to other acts of idolatry.&quot; It was of course the demon, who presented 
himself in the form of the cat. A lady, named Agnes Lovecote, examined in 
England, stated that she had heard that, at a chapter held in Dines-lee 
(Dynnesley, in Hertfordshire), the devil appeared to the <I>Templars </I>in a 
monstrous form, having precious stones instead of eyes, which shone so bright 
that they illuminated the whole chapter ; the brethren, in succession, kissed 
him on the posteriors, and marked there the form of the cross. She was told that 
one young man, who refused to go through this ceremony, was thrown into a well, 
and a great stone cast upon him. Another witness, Robert de Folde, said that he 
had heard twenty years ago, that in the same place, the devil came to the 
chapter once a year, and flew away with one of the knights, whom he took as a 
sort of tribute. Two others deposed that certain <I>Templars </I>confessed to 
them that at a grand annual assembly in the county of York, the <I>Templars 
</I>worshipped a calf. All this is mere hearsay, but it shows the popular 
opinion of the conduct of the order. A <I>Templar </I>examined in Paris, named 
Jacques de Treces, who said that he had been informed that at secret chapters 
held at midnight, a head appeared to the assembled brethren, added, that one of 
them &quot;had a private demon, by whose council he was wise and rich.&quot;</P>
<P>The aim of King Philippe was secured; he seized upon the whole treasure of 
the temple in France, and became rich. Those who ventured to speak in defence of 
the order were browbeaten, and received little attention the torture was 
employed to force confessions ; fifty-four <I>Templars </I>who refused to 
confess were carried to the wind-mill of St. Aritoine, in the suburbs of Paris, 
and there burnt; and many others, among whom was the Grand Master himself, were 
subsequently brought to the stake. After having lasted two or three years, the 
process ended in the condemnation and suppression of the order, and its estates 
were given in some countries to the knights of St. John. It was in France that 
the persecution was most cruel; in England, the order was suppressed, but no 
executions took place. Even in Italy, the severity of the judges was not 
everywhere the same; in Lombardy and Tuscany, the <I>Templars </I>were 
condemned, while they were acquitted at Ravenna and Bologna. They were also 
pronounced innocent in Castile, while in Arragon they were reduced by force, 
only because they had attempted to resist by force of arms; and both in Spain 
and in Portugal they only gave up their own order to be admitted into others. 
The pope was offended at the lenity shown towards them in England, Spain, and 
Germany. The order of the temple was finally dissolved and abolished, and its 
memory branded with disgrace. Some of the knights are said to have remained 
together, and formed secret societies. The result, in effect, was the same 
everywhere. Convicted of heresy, sorcery, and many other abominations, the 
wretched <I>Templars </I>were everywhere punished with death by fire, 
imprisonment, and their goods escheated to the various crowned heads of Europe, 
nearly all of whom followed the avaricious example of Philip of France. Jacques 
de Molay, the Grand Master, brought out on to a scaffold erected in front of 
Notre Dame in Paris, and asked to repeat his confession and receive sentence of 
perpetual imprisonment, flared into sudden anger, recanted all he had said, and 
protested his innocence. He was burnt, and summoned the Pope and the King with 
his dying breath, to meet him before the bar of Heaven. Both of these 
dignatories shortly afterwards died, and it remained in the public mind that the 
outcome of the Grand Masters summons had proved his innocence.</P>
<P>As has been said, there is every reason to believe that there was some 
foundation for the charges of heresy made against the <I>Templars. </I>Their 
intimate connection with the East, and the long establishment of the order 
therein had in all probability rendered their Christianity not quite so pure as 
that of Western Europe. Numerous treatises have been written for the purpose of 
proving and disproving the Temple heresy, to show that it followed the doctrines 
and rites of the Gnostic Ophites of Islam (Baphomet being merely a corruption of 
Mahomet), and it has been collated with various other eastern systems. Hans 
Prutz, in his <I>Geheimlehre </I>furthered the view of the rejection of 
Christianity in favour of a religion based on Gnostic dualism, and at once 
raised up a host of critics. But many defenders of the order followed, and it 
was proved in numerous instances the confessions wrung from the <I>Templars 
</I>were the result of extreme torture. In not a few cases were they acquitted, 
as in Castile, Aragon, Portugal, and at many German and Italian centres. It has 
also been shown that the answers of a number of the knights under torture were 
practically dictated to them. In England, out of eighty <I>Templars 
</I>examined, only four confessed to the charge of heresy, and of these two were 
apostates. The whole question may perhaps he summed up as follows. The 
<I>Templars, </I>through long association with the East, may have become more 
tolerant of paganism, more broadminded, in their outlook, than their bigoted 
stay-at-home countrymen. Expressions as regards the worthiness of Saracen 
nations, among whom the <I>Templars </I>had many friends, would be regarded 
askance in France, Spain and England, and habits acquired by residence in the 
East would probably add to the growing body of suspicion regarding the loyalty 
of the order to Christianity. It is even possible that the <I>Templars 
</I>introduced into their rites practices which savoured of Gnosticism or 
Mahomedanism, but that is unlikely. They were, in short, the victims of their 
own arrogance, their commercial success, and the superstitious ignorance of 
their contemporaries.</P>
<P>It has frequently been asserted that on the death of Jacques de Molay a 
conspiracy was entered into by the surviving <I>Templars </I>which had for its 
objects the destruction of papacy and the several kingdoms of Europe, and that 
this tradition was handed on through generations of initiates through such 
societies as the Illuminati and the Freemasons, who in the end brought about the 
French Revolution and the downfall of the French throne. Such a theory, however 
enticing to the pseudo-occultist, the defender of the theory that occult 
tradition has descended to us through a direct line of adepts, or the 
fictioneer, can receive no countenance here, and must be dismissed as a mere 
figment of enthusiasm or imagination.</P>

<P>Temple Church, London :</B> Hargrave Jennings in his <I>Rosicrucians, their 
Rites and Mysteries, </I>says The <I>Temple Church, London, </I>presents many 
mythic figures, which have a Rosicrucian expression. In the spandrels of the 
arches of the long church, besides the &quot; Beauseant&quot; which is repeated 
in many places, there are the armorial figures following; &quot; Argent, on a 
cross gules, the Agnus Dei, or Paschal Lamb, or, &quot; Gules the Agnus Dei, dis 
playing over the right shoulder the standard of the <I>Temple; </I>or, a banner, 
triple cloven, bearing a cross gules ; &quot; Azure, a cross prolonged potent 
issuant out of the crescent moon argent, horns, upwards, on either side of the 
cross, a star or.&quot; This latter figure signifies the Virgin Mary, and 
displays the cross as rising like the pole, or mast of a ship (argha) out of the 
midst of the crescent moon or navis biprora, curved at both ends ; &quot; azure, 
semme of estoiles or.&quot; The staff of the Grand Master of the Templars 
displayed a curved cross of four splays, or blades, red upon white. The 
eight-pointed red Buddhist cross was also one of the Templar ensigns. The 
<I>Temple </I>arches abound with brandished estoiles, or stars, with wavy or 
crooked flames. The altar at the east end of the <I>Temple Church </I>has a 
cross flourie, with lower limb prolonged, or, on a field of estoiles, wavy; to 
the right is the Decalogue, surmounted by the initials, A.O. (Alpha and Omega), 
on the left are the monograms of the Saviour, I. C., X. C.; beneath, is the 
Lords Prayer. The whole altar displays feminine colours and emblems, the 
<I>Temple Church </I>being dedicated to the Virgin Maria. The winged horse, or 
Pegasus, argent, in a field gules, is the badge of the Templars. The tombs of 
the Templars, disposed around the circular church in London, are of that early 
Norman shape called dos dane; their tops are triangular; the ridge-moulding 
passes through the temples and out of the mouth of a mask at the upper end, and 
issues out of the horned skull, apparently of some purposely trodden creature. 
The head at the top is shown in the &quot;honour-point&quot; of the cover of the 
tomb. There is an amount of unsuspected meaning in every curve of these Templar 
tombs.</P>

<P>Teutons :</B> The Teutonic or &quot; Germanic&quot; nations, embracing the 
peoples of High and Low German speech, Dutch, Danes, and Scandinavians, have 
always displayed and still display a marked leaning towards the study and 
consideration of the occult. We are, however, concerned here with their attitude 
towards the hidden sciences in more ancient times, and must refer the reader to 
the article on &quot; Germany&quot; and the other countries alluded to for 
information upon medieval and modern occultism in them.</P>
<P>But little can he gleaned from the writings of classical authors upon the 
subject, and it is not until we approach the middle ages, the contemporary 
manuscripts concerning the traditions of an earlier day, and the works of such 
writers as Snorre Sturluson and Saemund (The <I>Eddas) </I></P>
<P>Saxo-Grammaticus, and such epics or pseudo-histories as <I>The Nibelungenlied 
</I>that we find any light thrown upon the dark places of Teutonic magical 
practice and belief. From the consideration of such authorities we arrive at 
several basic conclusions (<B>1</B>) That magic with the <I>Teutons </I>was 
non-hierophantic, and was not in any respect the province of the priesthood, as 
with the Celtic Druids ; <B>(2) </B>That women were its chief conservators ; 
(<B>3</B>) That it principally resided in the study and elucidation of the runic 
script, in the same manner as in early Egypt it was part and parcel of the 
ability to decipher the hieroglyphic characters. Passing from the first 
conclusion, which is self-evident, as we discover all sorts and conditions of 
people dabbling in magical practice, we find that to a great extent sorcery-for 
efforts seem to have been confined mostly to black magic-was principally the 
province of women. This is to be explained, perhaps, by the circumstance that 
only those who could read the runes-that is, those who could read at all-were 
able to undertake the study of the occult, and that therefore the unlettered 
warrior, too restless for the repose of study, was barred from all advance in 
the subject. We find women in all ranks of life addicted to the practice of 
sorcery, from the queen on the throne to the wise-woman or witch dwelling apart 
from the community. Thus the mother-in-law of Siegfried bewitches him by a 
draught, and scores of similar instances could be adduced. At the same time the 
general type of ancient Teutonic magic is not very high, it is greatly hampered 
by human considerations, and is much at the mercy of the human element on which 
it acts, and the very human desires which call it forth. Indeed in many cases it 
is rendered nugatory by the mere cunning of the object upon which it is wreaked. 
In fine it does not rise very much above the type of sorcery in vogue among 
barbarian peoples at the present day. It is surprising, however, with all these 
weaknesses, how powerful a hold it contrived to get upon the popular 
imagination, which was literally drenched with the belief in supernatural 
science.</P><I>
<P>Runes.-(German, rune </I>; Anglo-Saxon <I>run; </I>Icelandic <I>run). </I>The 
word is derived from an old Low German word <I>raunen </I>to cut&quot; or to 
carve,&quot; and as the runes in more ancient times were invariably carved and 
not written, it latterly came to designate the characters them-selves. As has 
been said, comparatively few were able to decipher them, and the elucidation was 
left to the curious, the ambitious among the female sex, and the leisured few in 
general, those perhaps including priests and lawmen. Consequently we find the 
power to decipher them an object of mysterious veneration among the ignorant and 
a belief that the ability to elucidate them meant the possession of magical 
powers. The possessors of this ability would in no wise minimise it, so that the 
belief in their prowess would flourish. Again, it is clear that a certain amount 
of patience and natural ability were necessary to the acquirement of such an 
intricate script. The tradition that they were connected with sorcery has 
scarcely yet died out in some parts of Iceland. In later times the word runes 
came to be applied to all the alphabetical systems employed by the Teutonic 
peoples before the introduction of Christianity. Their origin is obscure, some 
authorities denying that it is Teutonic, and asserting that they are merely a 
transformation or adaptation of the Greek characters, and others that they have 
a Phoenician or even cuneiform ancestry. That they are of non-Teutonic origin is 
highly probable, as may be inferred from their strong resemblance to other 
scripts and from the circumstance that it is highly unlikely that they could 
have been separately evolved by the Teutonic race in the state of comparative 
barbarism in which it was when they first came into general use. They have been 
divided into three systems - English, German, and Scandinavian-but the 
difference between these is merely local. They were not employed in early times 
for literary purposes, but for inscriptions only, which are usually found on 
stone monuments, weapons, implements, and personal ornaments and furniture. In 
England runic inscriptions are found in the north only, where Scandinavian 
influence was strongest. The first symbols of the runic alphabet have the powers 
of the letters f, u, th, o, r, c, for which reason the order of the runic 
letters is called not an alphabet but a <I>futhorc. </I>The system is symbolic. 
Thus its first quantity or letter pictures the head and horns of an ox, and is 
called <I>feoh </I>after that animal, the second is called <I>ur, </I>after the 
word for &quot; bull,&quot; the third <I>thoru, </I>a tree, the others following 
<I>Os, </I>a door; <I>rad, </I>a saddle,; <I>caen, </I>a torch, all because of 
some fancied resemblance to the objects, or, more properly speaking, because 
they were probably derived or evolved from a purely pictorial system in which 
the pictures of the animals or objects enumerated above stood for the letters of 
the alphabet. Since these were cut. some connection may be permitted between 
Anglo-Saxon <I>secgan, </I>to say, and Latin <I>secare, </I>to cut, especially 
when we find secret signatures made of old by merely cutting a chip from the 
bark manuscript. In spelling, for example, the old sense of &quot;spell&quot; 
was a thin chip or shaving. Tacitus mentions that in Teutonic divination a rod 
cut from a fruit-bearing tree was cut into slips, and the slips, having marks on 
them, were thrown confusedly on a white garment to be taken up with prayer to 
the gods and interpreted as they were taken. A special use of light cuttings for 
such fateful cross-readings or &quot; Virgilian lots,&quot; may have given to 
&quot;spells &quot; their particular association with the words of the 
magician.</P><I>
<P>Belief in Nature Spirits.-The </I>scope of this work is entirely without the 
consideration of mythology proper, that is to say that the greater deities of 
the many human religious systems receive no treatment save in several special 
circumstances. But the lesser figures of mythology, those who enter into direct 
contact with man and assist him, or are connected with him, in magical practice, 
receive special and separate notice. Thus the <I>duergar, </I>or dwarfs trolls, 
undines, nixies, and all the countless host of Teutonic folk-lore are alluded to 
under their separate headings, and we have here only to consider their general 
connection with Teutonic man in his magical aspect. His belief in them was 
distinctly of an animistic character. The dwarfs and trolls inhabited the 
recesses of the mountains, caves, and the underworld. The nixies and undines 
dwelt in the lakes, rivers, pools, and inlets of the sea. In general these were 
friendly to man, but objected to more than an occasional intercourse with him. 
Though not of the class of supernatural being who obey the behests of man in 
answer to magical summonses, these, especially the dwarfs, often acted as his 
instructors in art-magic, and many instances of this are to be met with in tales 
and romances of early Teutonic origin. The dwarfs were usually assisted by 
adventitious aids in their practice of magic, such as belts which endowed the 
wearer with strength, like that worn by King Laurin, shoes of swiftness, 
analogous to the seven-league boots of folk-tale, caps of invisibility, and so 
forth.</P>
<P>Witchcraft.-Witchcraft, with its accompaniment of diabolism was much more in 
favour among the northern <I>Teutons </I>than it was in Germany, and this 
circumstance has been attributed to their proximity to the Finns (q.v.), a race 
notorious for its magical propensities. In Norway, Orkney, and Shetland, we find 
the practice of sorcery almost exclusively in the hands of women of Finnish 
race, and there is little doubt that the Finns exercised upon the <I>Teutons 
</I>of Scandinavia the mythic influence of a conquered race, that is, they took 
full advantage of the terror inspired in their conquerors by an alien and 
unfamiliar religion and ritual, which partook largely of the magical. The 
principal machinery of Teutonic witchcraft was the raising of storms, the 
selling of pieces of knotted rope, each knot representing a wind, divination and 
prophecy, acquiring invisibility, and such magical practices as usually 
accompany a condition of semi-barbarism. In the North of Scotland the Teutonic 
and Celtic magical systems may be said to have met and fused, but not to have 
clashed, as their many points of resemblance outweighed their differences. As 
the sea was the element of the people, we find it the chief element of the witch 
of the northern <I>Teutons. </I>Thus we discover in the saga of <I>Frithjof, 
</I>the two sea-witches Heyde and Ham riding the storm and sent by Helgi to 
raise a tempest which would drown Frithjof, and taking the shape of a bear and a 
storm-eagle. In the saga of <I>Grettir the Strong </I>we find a witch-wife, 
Thurid, sending adrift a magic log which should come to Grettir&rsquo;s island, 
and which should lead to his undoing. Animal transformation plays a considerable 
part in Teutonic magic and witchcraft. In early Germany the witch (hexe) seems 
to have been also a vampire.</P><I>
<P>Second Sight.-It </I>was, however, in prophecy and divination that the 
<I>Teutons </I>excelled, and this was more rife among the more northern branches 
of the people than the southern. Prophetic utterance was usually induced by 
ecstasy. But it was not the professional diviner alone who was capable of 
supernatural vision. Anyone under stress of excitement, and particularly if near 
death, might become &quot;fey,&quot; that is prophetic, and great attention was 
invariably paid to utterances made whilst in this condition.</P><I>

<P>Theomancy :</B> The part of the Jewish <I>Kabala </I>which studies the 
mysteries of the divine majesty and seeks the sacred names. He who possesses 
this science knows the future, commands nature, has full power over angels and 
demons, and can perform miracles. The Rabbis claimed that it was by this means 
that Moses performed so many marvels; that Joshua was able to stop the sun; that 
Elias caused fire to fall from heaven, and raised the dead ; that Daniel closed 
the mouths of the lions ; and that the three youths were not consumed in the 
furnace. However, although very expert in the divine names, the Jewish rabbis no 
longer perform any of the wonders done by their fathers.</P>

<P>Theosophical Society :</B> was founded in <B>1875</B> by Helena Petrovna 
Blavatsky and Henry Steele Olcott. They met in America in <B>1874</B> where 
Colonel Olcott was engaged in spiritualistic investigation at the house of the 
Eddy Brothers in Vermont. Madame Blavatsky was, of course, deeply read in every 
thing pertaining to the occult and similarity of tastes very-naturally drew them 
together. Scientific materialism was then engaging general attention and making 
no little progress, and since theosophy is the antithesis of materialism of any 
kind, it was decided that some society should be formed to combat this movement. 
In May, <B>1875</B>, a Miracle Club was formed, but it was a failure. Later in 
the same year, in the month of September, a fresh attempt was however, agreed on 
and this was made in November with Col. Olcott as president, and Madame 
Blavatsky as corresponding secretary, and a membership of twenty. This attempt 
seemed also to be doomed to failure, many members dropping off because no 
phenomena were manifested and indeed only Col. Olcott and Madame Blavatsky 
remained with two of the founders of the society and a few other members. Not 
discouraged by this, however, they decided to amalgamate with the Indian 
Society, but even this met with no more success, and it was not till by a happy 
inspiration the society was removed to India, that it began to attract attention 
and make headway. From that time its success was assured and, whatever opinions 
may be held of the soundness of <I>theosophical </I>teaching, no doubt can be 
entertained of the extent and influence of the society, which has numerous 
members in lands so far apart and so different in spirit as America and India, 
besides every other civilised country in the world. In accordance with the 
spirit of theosophy, no dogma is demanded of members save acceptance of the 
belief in the brotherhood of man, so that Christian and Mohammedan may meet on 
equal terms without any necessity of varying their peculiar religious beliefs. 
Its activities include study of everything germane to theosophy, religion, 
philosophy, laws of nature whether patent to all mankind as in the domain of 
science, or hidden as yet from all but those with special knowledge, as in the 
domain of the occult. <I>(See </I><B>Theosophy.</B>)</P><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Theosophical Society of Agrippa :</B> Agrippa (q.v.) established in Paris and 
other centres a secret <I>theosophical society, </I>the rites of admission to 
which were of a peculiar character. The fraternity also possessed signs of 
recognition. Agrippa visited London in <B>1510, </B>and whilst there he 
established a branch of the order in that city. A letter of Landulph&rsquo;s is 
extant in which he introduces to Agrippa a native of Nuremberg resident at 
Lyons, and whom he hopes &quot; may be found worthy to become one of the 
brotherhood.&quot;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Theosophy :</B> From the Greek <I>theos, </I>god, and <I>sophia, </I>wisdom; 
a philosophical-religious system which claims absolute knowledge of the 
existence and nature of the deity, and is not to be confounded with the later 
system evolved by the founders of the Theosophical Society. This knowledge, it 
is claimed, may be obtained by special individual revelation, or through the 
operation of some higher faculty. It is the transcendent character of the 
godhead of theosophical systems which differentiates them from the philosophical 
systems of the speculative or absolute type, which usually proceed deductively 
from the idea of God. God is conceived in theosophical systems as the 
transcendant source of being, from whom man in his natural state is far removed. 
<I>Theosophy </I>is practically another name for speculative mysticism. Thus the 
Kabalistic and Neoplatonic conceptions of the divine emanations are in reality 
theosophical, as are the mystical systems of Boebme and Baader.</P><I>
<P>Theosophy </I>has also come to signify the tenets and teachings of the 
founders of the Theosophical Society. This Society was founded in the United 
States in <B>1875</B> by Madame H. P. Blavatsky (q.v.), Col. H. S. Olcott (q.v.) 
and others. Its objects were to establish a nucleus of the Universal Brotherhood 
of Humanity, to promote the study of comparative religion and philosophy and to 
investigate the mystic powers of life and matter. The conception of the 
Universal Brotherhood was based upon the oriental idea of One Life-that ultimate 
oneness which underlies all diversity, whether inward or outward. The study of 
comparative religion was materialised into a definite system of belief, the 
bounds of which were dogmatically fixed. It is set forth in the Theosophical 
system that all the great religions of the world originated from one supreme 
source and that they are merely expressions of a central Wisdom Religion&quot; 
vouchsafed to various races of the earth in such a manner as was best suited to 
time and geographical circumstances. Underlying these was a secret doctrine or 
esoteric teaching which it was stated, had been the possession for ages of 
certain <I>Mahatmas, </I>or adepts in mysticism and occultism. With these Madame 
Blavatsky claimed to be in direct communication, and she herself manifested 
occult phenomena, producing the ringing of astral bells, and so forth. On 
several occasions these efforts were unmasked as fraudulent, but that is no 
justification for believing that Madame Blavatsky was entirely a person of 
deceitful character. There can be very little doubt that she was one of those 
rare personalities who possess great natural psychic powers, which at times 
failing her, she was driven in self-protection to adopt fraudulent methods. The 
evidence for the existence of the Great White Brotherhood &quot; of Mahatmas, 
the existence of which she asserted, is unfortunately somewhat feeble. It rests, 
for the most part, on the statements of Madame Blavatsky, Col. Olcott, Mr. 
Sinnet, Mr. Leadbeater, and others, who claimed to have seen or communicated 
with them. With every desire to do justice to these upholders of the 
Theosophical argument, it is necessary to point out that it has been amply 
proved that in occult, or pseudo-occult experiences. the question of 
self-hallucination enters very largely <I>(See </I><B>Witchcraft.</B>), and the 
ecstatic condition may be answerable for subjective appearances which seem real 
enough to the visionary. Again the written communications of the Mahatmas give 
rise to some doubt. It is pointed out for instance that one of them employed the 
American system of spelling, and this was accounted for by the circumstance that 
his English had been sophisticated by reading American books.</P>
<P>The revelations of Madame Blavatsky were in reality no more than a <I>melange 
</I>of Buddhistic, Brahministic and Kabalistic matter; but the Theosophical 
Society has numbered within its members several persons of very high ability, 
whose statement and exegesis of their faith has placed it upon a much higher 
level and more definite foundation. If the system is intensely dogmatic, it is 
also constructed in a manner akin to genius, and evolved on most highly 
intricate lines. This system was to a great extent pieced together after the 
death of the original founder of the society, on which event a schism occurred 
in the Brotherhood through the claims to leadership of William Q. Judge, of New 
York, who died in <B>1896</B>, and who was followed by Mrs. Katherine Tingley, 
the founder of the great theosophical community at Point Loma, California. Col. 
Olcott became the leader of the remaining part of the original Theosophical 
Society in America and India, being assisted in his work by Mrs. Annie Besant, 
but a more or less independent organisation was founded in England.</P>
<P>A brief outline of the tenets of <I>Theosophy </I>may be attempted. It posits 
absolute belief in its views instead of blind faith. It professes to be the 
religion which holds the germs of all others. It has also its aspect as a 
science-a science of life and of the soul. The facts which it was to lay before 
humanity are as follow :-&quot; There are three truths which are absolute, and 
which cannot be lost, but yet may remain silent for lack of speech. The soul of 
man is immortal and its future is the future of the thing, whose growth and 
splendour has no limit. The principle which gives life dwells in us and without 
us, is undying and eternally beneficent, is not heard, or seen, or smelt, but is 
perceived by the man who desires perception. Each man is his own absolute 
law-giver, the dispenser of glory or gloom to himself, decreer of his life, his 
reward, his punishment.&quot;</P>
<P>Although <I>Theosophy </I>posits the existence of an Absolute, it does not 
pretend to knowledge of its attributes. In the Absolute are innumerable 
universes, and in each universe countless solar systems. Each solar system is 
the expression of a being called the <I>Logos, </I>the Word of God, or Solar 
Deity, who permeates it and exists above it and outside it. Below this Solar 
Deity are his seven ministers, called Planetary Spirits, whose relation to him 
is like that of the nerve centres to the brain, so that all his voluntary acts 
come through him to them. <I>(See </I><B>Kabala.</B>) Under them are vast hosts 
or orders of spiritual beings called <I>devas, </I>or angels, who assist in many 
ways. This world is ruled by a great official who represents the Solar Deity, 
which is in absolute control of all the evolution that takes place upon this 
planet. When a new religion is to be founded, this being either comes himself or 
sends one of his pupils to institute it. In the earlier stages of the 
development of humanity, the great officials of the hierarchy are provided from 
more highly evolved parts of the system, but whenever men can be trained to the 
necessary level of power and wisdom these offices are held by them. They can 
only be filled by adepts, who in goodness, power and wisdom are immeasurably 
greater than ordinary men, and have attained the summit of human evolution. 
These advance until they themselves become of the nature of deities. There are 
many degrees and many lines of activity among these, but some of them always 
remain within touch of the earth and assist in the spiritual evolution of 
humanity. This body it is which is called the Great White Brotherhood.&quot; Its 
members do not dwell together, but live separately apart from the world and are 
in constant communication with one another and with their head. Their knowledge 
of higher forces is so great that they have no necessity for meeting in the 
physical world, but each dwells in his own country, and their power remains 
unsuspected among those who live near them. These adepts are willing to take as 
apprentices those who have resolved to devote themselves utterly to the service 
of mankind, and anyone who will may attract their attention by showing himself 
worthy of their notice. Such an apprentice was Madame Blavatsky. One of these 
masters has said In order to succeed the pupil must leave his own world and come 
into ours.</P>
<P>The formation of a solar system and the cosmogonic operation of the 
theosophical conception has been treated in several separate articles ; as have 
the various planes on which the personality of a man dwells in its long journey 
from earth to the final goal of <I>Nirvana. </I>The theosophical conception of 
the constitution of man is that he is in essence a spark of the divine fire 
belonging to the Monadic world (q.v.). For the purposes of human evolution this 
monad manifests itself in lower worlds. Entering the Spiritual World it 
manifests itself there as the triple spirit having its three aspects. one of 
which always remains in the Spiritual Sphere. The second aspect manifests itself 
in the Intuitional World ; and the third in the Higher Mental World ; and these 
two are collated with intuition and intelligence. These three aspects combined 
make up the <I>ego </I>which is man during the human stage of evolution. The way 
or path towards enlightenment and emancipation is known as <I>karma. </I>The 
human personality is composed of a complex organisation consisting of seven 
principles which are united and interdependent, yet divided into certain groups, 
each capable of maintaining a kind of personality. Each of these principles is 
composed of its own form of matter and possesses its own laws of time, space and 
motion. The most gross of those, the physical body, is known as <I>rupa, 
</I>which becomes more and more refined until we reach the universal self 
<I>atma </I>; but the circumstance which determines the individual's powers, 
tests and advantages, or in short his character, is his <I>karma, </I>which is 
the sum of his bodily, mental and spiritual growth and is spread over many lives 
past and future; in short, as man soweth, so must he reap; and if in one 
existence he is handicapped by any defect, mental or physical, it may be 
regarded as the outcome of past delinquencies. This doctrine is practically 
common to both Buddhism and Brahminism.</P>
<P>After this digression, which was entered into for the purpose of affording a 
fuller view of the theosophic conception of human personality, we return to the 
constitution of man. The <I>ego </I>existing in the Higher Mental World cannot 
enter the Physical World until it has drawn around itself a veil composed of the 
matter of these spheres nor can it think in any but an abstract manner without 
them-its concrete ideas being due to them. Having assumed the astral and 
physical bodies, it is born as a human being; and having lived out its 
earth-life sojourns for a time in the Astral World, until it can succeed in 
throwing off the shackles of the astral body. When that is achieved man finds 
himself living in his mental body. The stay in this sphere is usually a long 
one-the strength of the mental constitution depending upon the nature of the 
thoughts to which he has habituated himself. But he is not yet sufficiently 
developed to proceed to higher planes, and once more he descends into the denser 
physical sphere to again go through the same round. Although he come from on 
high into these lower worlds, it is only through that descent that a full 
recognition of the higher worlds is developed in him.</P>
<P>In the Higher Mental World, the permanent vehicle is a causal body, which 
consists of matter of the first, second and third sub-divisions of that world. 
As the <I>ego </I>unfolds his latent possibilities in the course of his 
evolution, this matter is greatly brought into action; but it is only in the 
perfect man, or adept, that it is developed to its fullest extent. In the causal 
body none of the possibilities of the grosser bodies can manifest 
themselves.</P>
<P>The mental body is built up of matter of the four lower sub-divisions of the 
Mental World, and expresses man's concrete thoughts. Its size and shape are 
determined by those of the causal vehicle.</P>
<P>While on earth the personality wears the physical, mental, and astral bodies 
all at once. It is the astral which connects him with the Astral World during 
sleep or trance <I>(See </I><B>Astral Plane.</B>) It is easy to see how the 
doctrine of reincarnation arose from this idea. The <I>ego </I>must travel from 
existence to existence, physical, astral, mental, until it transcend the Mental 
World and enter the higher spheres.</P>
<P>We have in this sketch attempted as far as possible to eschew the oriental 
verbiage of the older theosophical teachers, which it is understood is now 
replaced by more modern terms, but this we have retained in some of the lesser 
articles dealing with <I>Theosophy.</I></P>
<P>The theosophic path to the goal of <I>Nirvana </I>is practically derived from 
Buddhistic teaching, but there are also other elements in it,-Kabalistic and 
Greek. The path is the great work whereby the inner nature of the individual is 
consciously transformed and developed. A radical alteration must be made in the 
aims and motives of the ordinary mortal. The path is long and difficult, and as 
has been said extends over many existences. Morality alone is insufficient to 
the full awakening of the spiritual faculty, without which progress in the path 
is impossible. Something incomparably higher is necessary. The physical and 
spiritual exercises recommended by <I>Theosophy </I>are those formulated in the 
Hindu philosophical system known as <I>Raja Yoga. </I>The most strenuous efforts 
alone can impel the individual along the path, and thus to mount by the practice 
of <I>Vidyd, </I>that higher wisdom which awakens the latent faculties and 
concentrates effort in the direction of union with the Absolute. The way is 
described as long and difficult, but as the disciple advances he becomes more 
convinced of his ultimate success, by the possession of transcendental faculties 
which greatly assist him to overcome difficulties. But these must not be sought 
for their own sake, as to gain knowledge of them for evil purposes is tantamount 
to the practice of Black Magic.</P>
<P>It is not pretended that in this brief sketch the whole of the theosophical 
doctrine has been set forth, and the reader who desires further information 
regarding it is recommended to the many and excellent handbooks on the subject 
which now abound.</P>

<P>Thomas the Rhymer :</B> Scottish Soothsayer (circa, <B>1220</B>.) It is 
impossible to name the exact date which witnessed the advent of the Scottish 
soothsayer, <I>Thomas the Rhymer, </I>who is well known on account of his 
figuring in a fine old ballad, duly included in Sir Walter Scott's <I>Minstrelsy 
of the Scottish Border. </I>But <I>Thomas </I>is commonly supposed to have lived 
at the beginning of the thirteenth century, that period being assigned because 
the name, &quot;Thomas Rimor de Ercildun,&quot; is appended as witness to a 
deed, whereby one &quot; Petrus de Haga de Bemersyde&quot; agrees to pay half a 
stone of wax annually to the Abbot of Melrose, and this &quot; Petrus&quot; has 
been identified with a person of that name known to have been living about 
<B>1220</B>. Ercildun is simply the old way of spelling Earlston, a village in 
the extreme west of Berwickshire, hard by the line demarking that county from 
Roxburgh; and it would seem that <I>Thomas </I>held estates in this region, for 
he is mentioned as a landed-proprietor by several early writers, most of whom 
add that he did not hold his lands from the Crown, but from the Earls of Dunbar. 
Be that as it may, <I>Thomas </I>probably spent the greater part of his life in 
and around Earlston, and a ruined tower there, singularly rich in ivy, is still 
pointed out as having been his home, and bears his name; while in a wall of the 
village church there is a lichened stone with the inscription:-</P>
<P>&quot;Auld Rhymour's Race </P>
<P>Lies in this Place.&quot;</P>
<P>and, according to local tradition, this stone was removed to its present 
resting place from one in a much older church, long since demolished. Nor are 
these things the only relics of the soothsayer, a lovely valley some miles to 
the west of Earlston being still known as &quot;Rhymer's Glen&quot; and it is 
interesting to recall that Turner painted a watercolour of this place, and no 
less interesting to remember that Sir Walter Scott, when buying the lands which 
eventually constituted his estate of Abbotsford, sought eagerly and at last 
successfully to acquire the glen in question. Naturally he loved it on account 
of its associations with the shadowy past, and Lockhart tells that many of the 
novelist's happiest times were spent in this romantic place ; while he relates 
how Maria Edgworth visited it in <B>1823</B>, and that thenceforth Sir Walter 
used always to speak of a certain boulder in the glen as the &quot; Edgworth 
stone,&quot; the lady writer whom he admired so keenly having rested here for a 
space. It seems probable, however, that the glen was so named by Scott 
himself.</P>
<P>It is thought that <I>Thomas </I>died about <B>1297</B>, and it is clear that 
he had achieved a wide fame as a prophet, many references to his skill in this 
relation being found in writers who lived comparatively soon after him. A 
Harleian manuscript in the British Museum, known to have been written before 
<B>1320</B>, discloses the significant phrase, &quot;La Comtesse de Donbar 
demanda a <I>Thomas </I>de Essedoune quant la guere descoce prendreit fyn:&quot; 
but the lady in question was not a contemporary of the prophet. In Barbour's 
<I>Bruce, </I>composed early in the fourteenth century, we find the poet 
saying:-</P>
<P>&quot;Sikerly</P>
<P>I hop <I>Thomas </I>prophecy</P>
<P>Off Hersildoune sail weryfied be.&quot;</P>
<P>Andro of Winton, in the <I>Originale Cronykil of Scotland, </I>also makes 
mention of <I>Thomas </I>as a redoubtable prophet; while Walter Bower, the 
continuator of Fordun's <I>Scoticronicon, </I>recounts how once Rhymer was asked 
by the Earl of Dunbar what another day would bring forth, whereupon he foretold 
the death of the king, Alexander III., and the very next morning news of his 
majesty's decease was noised abroad. Blind Harry's <I>Wallace', </I>written 
midway through the fifteenth century, likewise contains an allusion to Thomas's 
prophesying capacities; while coming to later times, Sir Thomas Gray, Constable 
of Norham, in his Norman-French <I>Scalacronica, </I>compiled during his 
captivity at Edinburgh Castle in <B>1555</B>, speaks of the predictions of 
Merlin, which like those of Banaster ou de Thomas de Ercildoune. . . . furount 
ditz en figure.&quot; A number of predictions attributed to <I>Thomas </I>the 
Rhymer are still current, for instance that weird verse which Sir Walter Scott 
made the motto of <I>The Bride' of Lammermuir; </I>and also a saying concerning 
a Border family with which, as we have seen, the soothsayer was at one time 
associated:-</P>
<P>&quot;Betide, betide, whate'er betide,</P>
<P>There'll aye be Haigs at Bemersyde.&quot;</P>
<P>It will be observed that both the foregoing are couched in metre, yet there 
is really no sure proof that the soothsayer was a poet. It is usually supposed 
that he acquired the sobriquet of <I>Rhymer </I>because he was a popular 
minstrel in his day, but the fact remains that Rymour was long a comparatively 
common surname in Berwickshire, and, while it may have originated with 
<I>Thomas, </I>the assumption has but slight foundation. Again, the prophet of 
Earlston has been credited with a poem on the story of Sir Tristram, belonging 
to the Arthurian cycle of romance, and the Advocate's Library contains a 
manuscript copy of this, probably written so early as <B>1300</B>. However, 
while Sir Walter Scott and other authorities believed in this ascription, it is 
quite likely that the poem is but a paraphrase from some French troubadour. For 
generations, however, the Scottish peasantry continued to be influenced by the 
sayings attributed to True Thomas,&quot; as they named him, as is witnessed by 
the publication during comparatively modern times of books containing the 
prophecies which he is said to have uttered.</P>

<P>Thought-Reading :</B> A term somewhat loosely applied to various forms of 
<I>apparent </I>thought-transference, even where the method employed is 
muscle-reading or actual fraud. It must not be confused with telepathy, for, 
though both terms are sometimes used synonymously, the latter implies the direct 
action of one mind on another, independent of the ordinary sense-channels, while 
no such restrictions are contained in the term &quot; thought-reading.&quot; In 
early times, when outbursts of ecstatic frenzy were ascribed to demoniac 
possession, we find the ecstatics credited with the power to read thoughts; 
witches were supposed to be endowed with the same faculty ; Paracelsus and the 
early magnetists recognised its existence. The advent of spiritualism gave to 
<I>thought-reading </I>a new impetus. It was now the spirits who read the 
thoughts of the sitters and replied to them with raps and table-turnings. Until 
quite recently, however, <I>thought-reading </I>was attributed either to 
occultism or fraud. Not only was the &quot; ethereal vibration&quot; theory 
unthought of, but the phenomena of hyperaesthesia and subconscious 
whispering&quot; were very imperfectly understood in their bearing on 
<I>thought-reading. </I>Yet it is probable that these last offered a 
satisfactory explanation in many cases, especially when the subject was 
entranced. Professional thought-readers who performed on public platforms 
indulged largely in fraud. <I>(See </I><B>Telepathy.</B>)</P>

<P>Tibet :</B> In this country, the stronghold of Buddhism, all superstition 
circles around the national religion, which at the same time has absorbed into 
itself the aboriginal beliefs and demonology. Nowhere perhaps has such a vast 
amount of pure superstition crystallised around the kernel of Buddhism,-the pure 
doctrines of which were found by the Hindu conquerors of the Tibetans to be 
totally unsuited to the Hunnish aborigines of the country, who before the advent 
of Buddhism were in the aministic stage of religion. This was allowed to revive 
and rites and ceremonies, charms and incantations, of the very nature which 
Buddha had so strongly condemned, clustered quickly around his philosophy in 
<I>Tibet. </I>From this sprang the <I>tantra </I>system, which is almost a 
purely magical one. It was founded by Asanga. a monk of Peshawar, who composed 
its gospel, the <I>Yogachchara Bhumi Sastra </I>in the sixth century A.D. Basing 
his pantheon upon the debased system of Buddhism then prevalent, Asanga 
reconciled it to native requirements by placing a number of Saivite devil-gods 
and goddesses in the lower Buddhistic heavens. These he made subservient to the 
Buddha. His religion was speedily adopted by the barbarian tribes of <I>Tibet, 
</I>who sacrificed readily to the deities of this new religion. Very naturally 
they exaggerated the magical side of it, their main object being to obtain 
supernatural power by means of spoken spells and words of power. A very 
considerable literature sprang up in connection with the new faith, which has 
been scathingly commented upon by disciples of the purer Buddhism as being 
nothing more or less than mere barbarian sorcery. Of course the monkish class of 
lamas found it impossible altogether to ignore the tantra system, but Tsongkapa 
in the middle of the fourteenth century unhesitatingly condemned the whole 
system. The lamas had and have an esoteric form of Buddhism, which has but 
little in common with the tantra system of the people, but we find them at 
festivals and so on unbending so far as to represent the various devils and 
fiends of this faith. As literature, the tantras may be considered as a later 
development of the <I>puranas, </I>but they are without any poetic value. They 
are regarded as gospels by the Saktas, or worshippers of Kali, Durga or Purvati 
the wife of Siva, or some other creative agency. They abound in magical 
performances and mystic rites-a great many of which are of a quite unspeakable 
character. They usually take the form of a dialogue between Siva and his wife. 
There were originally sixty-four tantras, but as yet no satisfactory scholarly 
examination has been made of them.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Timaeus of Locris :</B> The earliest known writer on the doctrines of magic. 
The <I>Timoean </I>theory of God, the Universe, and the World-soul is thus set 
forth by Busching: &quot; God shaped the eternal unformed matter by imparting to 
it His being. The inseparable united itself with the separable; the unvarying 
with the variable; and, moreover, in the harmonic conditions of the Pythagorean 
system. To comprehend all things better, infinite space was imagined as divided 
into three portions, which are,-the centre, the circumference, and the 
intermediate space. The centre is most distant from the highest God, who 
inhabits the circumference ; the space between the two contains the celestial 
spheres. When God descended to impart His being, the emanations from Him 
penetrated the whole of heaven, and filled the same with imperishable bodies. 
Its power decreased with the distance from the source, and lost itself gradually 
in our world in minute portions, over which matter was still dominant. From this 
proceeds the continuous change of being and decay below the moon, where the 
power of matter predominates ; from this, also, arise the circular movements of 
the heaven and the earth, the various rapidities of the stars, and the peculiar 
motion of the planets. By the union of God with matter, a third being was 
created, namely, the world-soul, which vitalizes and regulates all things, and 
occupies the space between the centre and the circumference.&quot;</P>

<P>Tongues, Speaking and Writing In :</B> The <I>speaking and writing in foreign 
tongues, </I>or in unintelligible outpourings mistaken for such, is a very old 
form of psychic phenomenon. It was a frequent accompaniment of the epidemic 
ecstasy which was so common in medieval Europe. Thus the Nuns of Loudon (q.v.) 
are declared to have understood and replied to questions put to them in Latin, 
Greek, Spanish, Turkish, and other even less-known languages. The Tremblers of 
the Cevennes (q.v.) spoke in excellent French, whereas French was to them a 
foreign language. And practically every epidemic of the kind was characterised 
by the speaking in <I>tongues, </I>which seemed to be infectious, and spread 
rapidly through whole communities. In these early cases the phenomenon was 
ascribed to the power of supernatural agencies, whether demons or angels, who 
temporarily controlled the organism of the &quot;possessed.&quot; But analogous 
instances are to be found in plenty in the annals of modern spiritualism, where 
they are of course regarded as manifestations of the spirits of the deceased 
through the material organism of the medium. Comparatively early in the movement 
there are evidences of speaking and writing in Latin, Greek, French, Swiss, 
Spanish, and Red Indian languages. Judge Edmonds, the well-known American 
Spiritualist, testified to these faculties in his daughter and niece, who spoke 
Greek, Spanish, Polish, and Italian at various times, as well as Red Indian and 
other languages. Some of these cases are well attested. Two professional mediums 
(J. V. Mansfield and A. D. Ruggles) are known to have written automatically in 
many languages, including Chinese and Gaelic, but whether or not they had any 
previous acquaintance with these languages remains at least a matter of doubt. 
In still more modern times speaking in <I>tongues </I>has been practised, 
notably by Helene Smith, who invented the &quot; Martian language.&quot; On the 
whole, we may take it that the so-called foreign <I>tongues </I>were generally 
no more than a meaningless jumble of articulate sounds, of which the spirits 
themselves sometimes purported to offer a translation. Where there is good 
evidence to show that the writings were actually executed in a foreign language, 
as in the case of the professional mediums mentioned above, there is generally 
some reason to suppose a former acquaintance with the language, which the 
exaltation of memory incidental to the trance state might revive. When unknown 
<I>tongues </I>were written they were seldom found to correspond with any real 
language.</P>

<P>Tower of London : </B>The jewel-room of the <I>Tower of London </I>is 
reported to be haunted, and, in <B>1860</B>, there was published in <I>Notes and 
Queries </I>by the late Edmund Lenthal Swifte, Keeper of the Crown Jewels the 
account of a spectral illusion witnessed by himself in the <I>Tower. </I>He says 
that in October, <B>1817</B>, he was at supper with his wife, her sister, and 
his little boy, in the sitting-room of the jewel-house. To quote his own words: 
&quot;I had offered a glass of wine and water to my wife, when, on putting it to 
her lips, she exclaimed, ' Good God what is that ' I looked up and saw a 
cylindrical figure like a glass tube, seemingly about the thickness of my arm, 
and hovering between the ceiling and the table ; its contents appeared to be a 
dense fluid, white and pale azure. This lasted about two minutes, when it began 
to move before my sister-in-law; then, following the oblong side of the table, 
before my son and myself, passing behind my wife, it paused for a moment over 
her right shoulder. Instantly crouching down, and with both hands covering her 
shoulder, she shrieked out, &lsquo;O Christ! it has seized me! ' &quot; &quot; 
It was ascertained,&quot; adds Mr. Swifte, &quot; that no optical action from 
the outside could have produced any manifestation within, and hence the mystery 
has remained unsolved.&quot; Speaking of the <I>Tower, </I>we learn from the 
same source how &quot; one of the night sentries at the jewel-house was alarmed 
by a figure like a huge bear issuing from underneath the jewel-room door. Pie 
thrust at it with his bayonet which stuck in the door. He dropped in a fit and 
was carried senseless to the guard-room. . . . In another day or two the brave 
and steady soldier died.&quot;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Trance :</B> An abnormal state, either spontaneous or induced, bearing some 
analogy to the ordinary sleep-state, but differing from it in certain marked 
particulars. The term is loosely applied to many varied pathologic 
conditions-<I>e.g., </I>hypnosis, ecstasy, catalepsy, somnambulism, certain 
forms of hysteria, and the mediumistic <I>trance. </I>Sometimes, as in 
catalepsy, there is a partial suspension of the vital functions ; generally, 
there is insensibility to pain and to any stimulus applied to the sense-organs 
while the distinguishing feature of the <I>trance </I>is that the subject 
retains consciousness and gives evidence of intelligence, either his own normal 
intelligence or, as in cases of possession and impersonation, some foreign 
intelligence. In hypnosis the subject, though indifferent to sensory stimuli 
applied to his own person, has been known to exhibit a curious sensitiveness to 
such stimuli applied to the person of the hypnotist. <I>(See </I>Community' of 
Sensation.) In Ecstasy, which is frequently allied with hallucination, the 
subject remains in rapt contemplation of some transcendental vision, deaf and 
blind to the outside world. It was formerly considered to indicate that the soul 
of the ecstatic was viewing some great event distant in time or place or some 
person or scene from the celestial sphere. Now-a-days such a state is believed 
to be brought about by intense and sustained emotional concentration on some 
particular mental image, by means of which hallucination may be induced.</P>
<P>The mediumistic <I>trance </I>is recognised as having an affinity with 
hypnosis, for the hypnotic trance, frequently induced, may gradually become 
spontaneous, when it exhibits strong resemblances to the <I>trance </I>of the 
medium. This latter is, among spiritualists, The Trance <I>&quot; par 
excellence, </I>and they object to the term being applied in any case where 
there is no sign of spirit possession.&quot; The entranced medium-who seems able 
to produce this state at will-frequently displays an exaltation of memory 
(hypermesia), of the special senses (hyperaesthesia), and even of the 
intellectual faculties. Automatic writing and utterances are generally produced 
in the <I>trance </I>state, and often display knowledge of which the medium 
normally knows nothing, or which, according to some authorities. gives evidence 
of telepathy. Such are the <I>trance </I>utterances of Mrs. Piper, whose 
automatic phenomena have in recent years provided a wide field for research for 
many men of science both in Britain and on the Continent. Naturally these 
phenomena. and those of all <I>trance </I>mediums, are referred by spiritualists 
to the agency of disembodied intelligences-the spirits of the dead-acting 
through the medium's physical organism, a notion which is akin to the old idea 
of demoniac possession, to which spontaneous <I>trance </I>was referred. 
Moreover, the <I>trance </I>messages themselves purported to come from the 
spirits of deceased persons and there are many who see no reason to disbelieve 
the emphatic assertion of the intelligence,&quot; especially when that assertion 
is supplemented by an exact representation of the voice, appearance, and known 
opinions of the deceased friend or relative whose spirit it claims to be. Such 
<I>trance </I>impersonations supply a large part of the evidence on which the 
structure of spiritualism rests. There is, however, nothing to show that the 
information concerning the deceased, thus reproduced, may not have been obtained 
by normal means, or, at the most, telepathically from the minds of the 
sitters.</P><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Trance Personalities :</B> Trance messages purporting to come from the 
medium's spirit control do not as a rule reveal a very definite personality. The 
control reflects the thoughts and opinions of the medium and the sitters, 
possesses little knowledge that they do not possess, and is in general a 
somewhat colourless creature. Yet not infrequently a trance medium is controlled 
by a spirit of distinct, not to say distinguished, personality, whose education 
and culture are on a much higher plane than the medium's own, and whose ideas 
and opinions are quite independent. Such spirits are generally given 
distinguishing names. They often control the medium alternately with other 
controls. On the other hand, the medium has generally a monopoly of one or more 
of these spirits, though sometimes one control may be shared by a number of 
mediums. Among those who may justly be regarded as the common property of the 
mediumistic fraternity are the spirits of certain great men-Virgil, Socrates, 
Shakespeare, Milton, Benjamin Franklin, Victor Hugo, Swedenborg, and so on. The 
messages delivered through their control seldom resemble anything they wrote 
during their lives. It would indeed be ludicrous to hold these great men 
responsible for the feeble outpourings delivered in their name. But these 
spirits come and go it is perhaps hardly accurate to call them <I>trance 
personalities </I>at all. Among the best known of the latter class are the 
spirits who purported to control the late Mr. Stainton Moses-Imperator, Rector, 
Mentor, Prudens, and others. What the real names of these controls may be is not 
known, for Mr. Moses only revealed the secret to a few of his most intimate 
friends. Imperator and Rector were among the controls of Mrs. Piper in still 
more recent years, and indeed much of her automatic discourse did not come 
directly from the communicating spirits, but was dictated by them to Rector. It 
is suggested, however, by Sir Oliver Lodge and other authorities, that the 
controls of Mrs. Piper are not identical with those of Stainton Moses, by whom 
were written through his hand the well-known <I>Spirit Teachings, </I>but are 
merely masqueraders. But Mrs. Piper has several interesting <I>trance 
personalities </I>of her own, without borrowing from anybody. One of her 
earliest controls was Sebastian Bach, but ere long he gave place to a spirit 
calling himself Dr. Phinuit,&quot; who held sway for a considerable time, but 
gave place in his turn to George Pelham-&quot; G.P.&quot; Pelham was a young 
author and journalist who died suddenly in <B>1892</B>. Soon after his death he 
purported to control Mrs. Piper, and gave many striking proofs of his identity. 
He constantly referred, with intimate knowledge, to the affairs of Pelham, 
recognised his friends, and gave to each his due meed of welcome. Not once, it 
is said, did he fail to recognise an acquaintance, or give a greeting to one 
whom he did not know. Many of Pelham's old friends did not hesitate to see in 
him that which he claimed to he. Only on one occasion, when asked for the names 
of two persons who had been associated with him in a certain enterprise, 
G.P.&quot; refused, saying that as there was present one who knew the names, his 
mentioning them would be referred to telepathy Later, however, he gave the 
names-incorrectly. When &quot;G.P.&quot; ceased to take the principle part in 
the control of Mrs. Piper, his place was taken by Rector and Imperator, as 
mentioned above. Another well-known medium, Mrs. Thompson, had as her chief 
control' Nelly,&quot; a daughter of hers who had died in infancy; also a Mrs. 
Cartwright, and others. These controls of Mrs. Thomson are said not to have 
shown any very individual characteristics, but to resemble Mrs. Thomson herself 
very strongly both in voice and manner of speech, though Mrs. Verrall has stated 
that the impersonations gave an impression of separate identity to the sitter. 
Mrs. Thomson's early trance utterances were controlled by another band of 
spirits, with even less individuality than those mentioned. Frequently the 
mediums and investigators themselves, on reaching the discarnate plane, become 
controls in their turn. The late Mr. Myers, Mr. Gurney, Dr. Hodgson, and 
Professor Sidgwick purported to speak and write through many mediums, notably 
through Mrs. Piper and Mrs. Thompson, Mrs. Verrall and Mrs. Holland. Many of the 
statements made by these controls were correct, and some matters revealed which 
were apparently outside the scope of the medium's normal knowledge, but at the 
same time several fatal discrepancies were found to exist between the controls 
and those they were supposed to represent. Thus the script produced by Mrs. 
Holland contained grave warnings, purporting to come from Myers, against Eusapia 
Palladino and her physical phenomena, whereas Myers was known to hold in his 
lifetime opinions favourable to the physical manifestations. On the whole these 
<I>trance personalities </I>show themselves decidedly coloured by the 
personality of the medium. In cases where the latter was acquainted with the 
control the <I>trance personality </I>is proportionately strong, whereas when 
there was no personal acquaintance it is often of a neutral tint, and sometimes 
bad guesses are made, as when Mrs. Holland represented the Gurney control as of 
a brusque and almost discourteous temperament. But such instances must not be 
taken as impeaching the medium's good faith. Even where the <I>trance 
personality </I>is patently the product of the medium's own consciousness, there 
is no reason to suppose that there is any intentional deception. While in some 
of the most definite cases the evidence for the operation of a discarnate 
intelligence is very good indeed, and has proved satisfactory to many prominent 
investigators.</P>

Alchemy-to restore man to his primordial condition of grace, strength,

mystics believed would, literally, achieve this renewal of youth, and therefore 
immortality. Endless receipts for this medicine have been given, and some 
honestly believed they had attained it; but all to no purpose, and the great 
secret still remains hidden from human eyes.</P>

<P>Tree Ghosts :</B> Indian tree spirits. Says Mr. Crookes in his <I>Popular 
Religion of Northern India. &quot; </I>These <I>tree ghoss </I>are, it is 
needless to say, very numerous. Hence most local shrines are constructed under 
trees ; and in one particular tree, the Bira, the jungle tribes of Mirzapur 
locate Bagheswar, the tiger godling, one of their most dreaded deities. In the 
Konkan, according to Mr. Campbell, the medium or Bhagat who becomes possessed is 
called <I>Jhad, </I>or 'tree,' apparently because he is a favourite 
dwelling-place for spirits. In the Dakkhin it is believed that the spirit of the 
pregnant woman of Churel lives in a tree, and the Abors and Padams of East 
Bengal believe that spirits in trees kidnap children. Many of these tree spirits 
appear in the folk-tales. Thus, Devadatta worshipped a tree which one day 
suddenly clave in two and a nymph appeared who introduced him inside the tree, 
where was a heavenly palace of jewels, in which, reclining on a couch, appeared 
Vidyatprabha, the maiden daughter of the king of the Yakshas; in another story 
the mendicant hears inside a tree the Yaksha joking with his wife. So Daphne is 
turned into a tree to avoid the pursuit of her lover.&quot;</P>

<P>Tree of Life, The, and The Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil :</B> Two

manifestation of God, and the latter of the worldly wisdom to which our human 
nature is too apt to incline.</P>

<P>Tremblers of the Cevennes :</B> A Protestant caste of convulsonaires, who 
during the sixteenth century spread themselves from their centre in the Cevennes 
over almost the whole of Germany. They possessed many points of resemblance with 
cases of possession (q.v.), and are said to have been insensible to thrusts and 
blows with pointed sticks and iron bars, as well as to the oppression of great 
weights. They had visions, communicated with good and evil spirits, and are said 
to have performed many miraculous cures similar to the apostolic miracles. They 
made use of very peculiar modes of treatment called <I>grandes secours </I>or 
<I>secours meurtriers, </I>which are authenticated by the reports of 
eye-witnesses and by judicial documents. Although they were belaboured by the 
strongest men with heavy pieces of wood and bars of iron weighing a? least 
thirty pounds, they complained of no injury, but of experiencing a sensation of 
pleasure. They also were covered with boards, on which as many as twenty men 
stood without its being painful to them. They even bore as many as <B>100</B> 
blows with a twenty-pounds weight, alternately applied to the breast and the 
stomach with such force that the room trembled, and they begged that the blows 
might be laid on harder, as light ones only increased their sufferings. Indeed 
only those who laid on the heaviest and most strenuous blows were thanked by 
their sick. It seemed that it was only when the power of these blows had 
penetrated to the most vital parts that they experienced real relief Ennemoser 
explains this insensibility to pain by stating that in his experience 
&quot;spasmodic convulsions maintain themselves against outward attempts, and 
even the greatest violence, with almost superhuman strength, without injury to 
the patient, as has often been observed in young girls and women, where anyone 
might have almost been induced to believe in supernatural influence. The tension 
of the muscles increases in power with the insensibility of the power, so that 
no outward force is equal to it; and when it is attempted to check the paroxysm 
with force, it gains in intensity, and according to some observers not less 
psychical than physical. I have observed the same manifestations in children, in 
Catholics, Protestants and Jews, without the least variation, on which account I 
consider it to be nothing more than an immense abnormal and inharmonic <I>lusus 
naturae.&quot;</I></P>

<P>Trevisan, Bernard :</B> This Italian alchemist's life was a curious and 
intensely pathetic one. Bent on discovering the philosopher's stone, he began at 
an early age to lavish huge sums of money on the pursuit; but again and again he 
was baffled, and it was only when old age was stealing upon him, and he had 
disbursed a veritable fortune, that his labours were crowned with some measure 
of success.</P><I>
<P>Bernard Trevisan, </I>Comte de la Marche, was born in the year <B>1406</B> at 
Padua, a town whose inhabitants were famous for erudition throughout many 
centuries in the middle ages. His father was a doctor of medicine, so it is 
probable that <I>Bernard </I>received his initial training in science at home 
while ere he was out of his teens he began to devote himself seriously to 
alchemy, having been lured thereto by reading the works of the famous Eastern 
philosophers, Geber and Rhasis. <I>Bernard's </I>father was rich, and 
accordingly, whenever it was known that the young man was minded to dabble in 
gold-seeking, he found himself surrounded by charlatans offering counsel; and 
his very first experiments resulted in his spending upwards of three thousand 
crowns, the bulk <B>6</B>&pound; which sum went into the pockets of the youth's 
fraudulent advisers. He was not discouraged, however; and, finding new henchmen, 
and at the same time augmenting his learning by a close study of the writings of 
Sacrobosco and Rupecissa, he proceeded to make a new series of attempts, But 
these also proved futile, once more the alchemist did no more than enrich his 
assistants, and in consequence he vowed that henceforth he would prosecute his 
researches single-handed.</P><I>
<P>Bernard </I>now engaged in a long course of sedulous reading, while he also 
began to give much time to prayer, thinking by this means to gain his desired 
end; and anon he started fresh experiments, expending on these some six thousand 
crowns. But again his devotion and </P>
<P>extravagance went unrewarded, year after year went by in this fashion, and 
betimes <I>Bernard </I>realised that he was past the prime of life, yet had 
achieved nothing whatsoever. His bitter disappointment engendered an illness, 
but scarcely was he restored to health era he heard that one Henry, a German 
priest, had succeeded in creating the philosopher's stone; and thereupon 
<I>Bernard </I>hastened to Germany, accompanied by various other alchemists. 
After some difficulty they made the acquaintance of the cleric in question, who 
told them he would disclose all would they but furnish a certain sum of money to 
procure the necessary tools and materials; so they paid as desired, yet having 
devoted much time to watching the German at work they found themselves no nearer 
the goal than before.</P>
<P>This last piece of quackery opened <I>Bernard's </I>eyes, and he proclaimed 
his decision of eschewing hermetic philosophy altogether in the future-a 
decision which was warmly applauded by his relatives, for already his researches 
had cost a king's ransom. But it soon transpired that the alchemist was quite 
incapable of clinging to his resolution, and, growing more ardent than ever, he 
visited Spain and Great Britain, Holland and France, trying in each of these 
countries to enlarge his stock of learning, and to make the acquaintance of 
others who were searching like himself. Eventually he even penetrated to Egypt, 
Persia and Palestine, while subsequently he travelled in Greece, where he 
witnessed many alchemistic researches ; yet all proved vain, and ultimately 
<I>Bernard </I>found himself impoverished, and was forced to sell his parental 
estates. Being thus without so much as a home, he retired to the Island of 
Rhodes, intending to live there quietly for the rest of his days; but even here 
his old passion continued to govern him, and, chancing to make the acquaintance 
of a priest who knew something of science, the thwarted and ruined alchemist 
proposed that they should start fresh experiments together. The cleric professed 
himself willing to give all the help in his power, so the pair borrowed a large 
sum of money to admit of their purchasing the necessary paraphernalia; and it 
was here, then, in this secluded island, and while in a literally bankrupt 
condition, that <I>Bernard </I>made the wonderful discovery with which he is 
traditionally credited. Doubtless the tradition has little foundation in fact, 
yet at least the philosopher deserved some reward for his indomitable if 
foolhardy perseverance, and it is pathetic to recall that his death occurred 
soon after the day of his triumph.</P>
<P>In contradistinction to the majority of his brother-alchemists, <I>Bernard 
</I>appears to have loved actual experiments much better than writing about 
them. It is probable however, that he was at least partly responsible for an 
octavo volume published in <B>1643</B>, <I>Le' Bernard d'Alchmague, cum Bernard 
Treveso ; </I>while he is commonly credited with another work also, <I>La 
Philosophic Naturelle des Metaux. </I>Herein he insists on the necessity of much 
meditation on the part of the scientist who would create the philosopher's 
stone, and this rather trite observation is followed by a voluminous alchemistic 
treatise, most of it sadly obscure, and demonstrating the author no great 
expert.</P>

<P>Triad Society :</B> An ancient esoteric society of China. The candidate 
scantily clothed, is brought into a dark room by two members, who lead him to 
the President, before whom he kneels. He is given a living cock and a knife, and 
in this posture he takes a complicated oath to assist his brethren in any 
emergency, even at the risk of his life. He then cuts off the head of the cock, 
and mingles it with his own, the three assisting individuals adding some of 
their own blood. After being warned that death will be his portion should he 
divulge the secrets of the society, he is initiated into them, and is entrusted 
with the signs of recognition which are in triads. For example a member must 
lift any object with three fingers only. This society, originally altruistic, is 
now of a political character.</P>

<P>Trithemius :</B> The son of a German vine-grower, named Heidenberg, received 
his Latinized appellation from Trittheim, a village in the electorate of Treves, 
where he was born in <B>1462</B>. He might reasonably be included among those 
earnest and enthusiastic souls who have persevered in the pursuit of knowledge 
under difficulties; for his mother, marrying a second time, had no love for the 
offspring of her first marriage. The young <I>Trithemius </I>was ill-fed, 
ill-clothed, and over-worked. All day he toiled in the vineyards ; but the 
nights he was able to devote to the acquisition of knowledge, and then he stole 
away from his miserable home, and perused what books he could beg or borrow, by 
the light of the moon. As his mind expanded he became sensible of the vast 
stores of learning to which his circumstances denied him access. He could not 
rest content with the few grains of sand he had picked up on the seashore. 
Extorting his small share of the patrimony bequeathed by his father, he wandered 
away to Treves, entered himself a student of its celebrated University, and 
assumed the name of <I>Trithemius. </I>His progress was now as rapid as might be 
inferred probable from the intensity of his aspirations and the keenness of his 
intellect. At the age of twenty lie had acquired the reputation of a scholar-a 
reputation which was of greater advantage in the <B>15</B>th than it is in the 
<B>20</B>th century. He was now desirous of once more seeing the mother whom he 
did not love the less because she had ill-used him, and in. the winter of 
<B>1482</B> he quitted the cloistered shade of Treves on a solitary journey to 
Trittheim. It was a dark day, ending in a gloomy, fast-snowing night, and the 
good student, on his arrival near Spannheim, found the roads impassable. He 
sought refuge in a neighbouring monastery. There the weather imprisoned him for 
several days. The imprisonment proved so much to the liking of <I>Trithemius, 
</I>that he voluntarily took the monastic vows, and retired from the world. In 
the course of two years he was elected abbot, and devoting all his little 
fortune to the repair and improvement of the monastery, he gained the love and 
reverence of the brotherhood, whom he inspired with his own love of learning. 
But after a rule of one-and-twenty years, the monks forgot all his benefits, and 
remembered only the severity of his discipline. They broke out in revolt, and 
elected another abbot. The deposed <I>Trithemius </I>quitted Spannheim, and 
wandered from place to place, until finally elected Abbot of St. James of 
Wurzburg. where he died in <B>1516</B>.</P>
<P>His fame as a magician rests on very innocent foundations He devised a 
species of short-hand called <I>steoganographia, </I>which the ignorant 
stigmatized as a cabalistical and necromantic writing, concealing the most 
fearful secrets. He wrote a treatise on the subject ; another upon the supposed 
administration of the world by its guardian angels-a revival of the good and 
evil geniuses of the Ancients-which William Lilly translated into English in 
<B>1647</B>; a third upon Geomancy, or divination by means of lines and circles 
on the ground; a fourth upon Sorcery; and a fifth upon Alchemy. In his work upon 
Sorcery he makes the earliest mention of the popular story of Dr. Faustus, and 
records the torments he himself occasionally suffered from the malice of a 
spirit named Hudekin. He is said to have gratified the Emperor Maximilian with a 
vision of his deceased wife, the beautiful Mary of Burgundy, and was reputed to 
have defrayed the expenses of his monastic establishment at Spannheim by the 
resources which the Philosopher's Stone put at his disposal. His writings show 
him to have been an amiable and credulous enthusiast but his sincere and ardent 
passion for knowledge may well incline us to forgive the follies which he only 
shared with most of the scholars and wise men of his age.</P>

<P>Tumah :</B> According to the <I>Kabala, </I>physical or moral uncleanness. 
The latter is divided into three main divisions-idolatry, murder, and 
immorality. Sin, says the same authority, not only rendered imperfect man 
himself, but also affected the whole of nature, even to the sphere of angels, 
and the Divinity himself. In physical uncleanness there is a coarser and a more 
subtle form. The latter causes a dimness in the soul which is most keenly felt 
by those who are nearest to sacred things. Organic things which come into 
contact with the human body are more liable to the <I>Tumah </I>than remoter 
things. The human corpse is more unclean than that of the lower animals, because 
its more complex nature involves a more repulsive decay. Thus the corpse of a 
holy man is most unclean of all.</P>
