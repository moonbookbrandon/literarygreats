<P>Ba :</B> The Egyptian conception of the soul, which in the form of a 
man-headed bird left the body after death and winged its flight to the gods. It 
returned at intervals to the mummy for the. purpose of comforting it and 
reassuring it concerning immortality. Sometimes it grasps the <I>ankh </I>(q.v.) 
and the <I>nif </I>(q.v.) and is occasionally represented as flying down the 
tomb-shaft to the deceased, or perched on the breast of the mummy. It was 
sometimes carved on the lid of mummy cases. In the Book of <I>the Dead </I>a 
chapter promises abundance of food to the <I>Ba, </I>so that the conception does 
not appear to have been entirely spiritual.</P><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Baalberith :</B> According to Wierius. a demon of the second order; master of 
the infernal Alliance. He is said to be secretary and keeper of the archives of 
Hell.</P><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Baalzeohon :</B> Captain of the guard and sentinels of Hell, according to 
Wierius.</P><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Baaras :</B> A marvellous plant known to the Arabs as the &quot;Golden 
Plant,&quot; and which is supposed to grow on Mount Libanus, underneath the road 
which leads to Damascus. It is said to flower in the month of May, after the 
melting of the snow, At night it can be seen by torchlight, but through the dav 
it is invisible. It was held to be of great assistance to alchemists in the 
transmutation of metals. It is alluded to by Josephus. (Lib. VIIl., Chap. 
<B>25</B>.)</P><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Babau :</B> A species of ogre with which the nurses in the central parts of 
France used to frighten their charges.. He was supposed to devour naughty 
children in salad. The ending &quot;au suggests a Celtic origin. For example, 
&quot; Y Mamau,&quot; the Welsh for &quot; fairies,&quot;</P><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Bablagora :</B> Certain lakes of a gloomy nature. which lie between Hungary 
and Poland. which have figured in various stories of witchcraft, Pools, such as 
these, are often used for purposes of divination, as by gazing down into clear 
water the mind is disposed to contemplation. often of a melancholy character. 
This form of divination is termed Hydromancy&quot; (q.v.) and is similar to 
crystal-gazing. </P><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Babylonia: </B>The conservative element in the religion of Babylonia was one 
of its most marked and interesting features. All the deities retained, even 
after they reached their highest development. traces of their primitive demoniac 
characters. and magic was never divorced from religion. The most outstanding 
god. were Ea, Anu and Enlil, the eider Bel. These formed a triad at the dawn of 
history. and appear to have developed from an animistic group of world spirits. 
Although Ea became specialised as a god of the deep. Anu as a god of the sky, 
and Enlil as an earth god, each had also titles which emphasised that they had 
attributes overlapping those of the others. Thus Ea was Enki, earth lord, and as 
Aa was a lunar deity, and he had also solar attributes. In the legend of Etana 
and the Eagle, his heaven is stated to be in the sky. Anu and Enlil as deities 
of thunder, rain and fertility. linked closely with Ea, as Dagan, of the 
flooding and fertilising Euphrates. Each of these deities were accompanied by 
demon groups. The spirits of disease were the &quot; beloved sons of Bel&quot;; 
the fates were the seven daughters of Anu the seven storm demons, including the 
dragon and serpent, were of En's brood. In one of the magical incantations 
translated by Mr. R. C. Thompson, occurs the following description of En's 
primitive monster form:</P>
<P>The head is the head of a serpent.</P>
<P>From his nostrils mucus trickles,</P>
<P>The mouth is beslavered with water:</P>
<P>The ears are those of a basilisk,</P>
<P>His horns are twisted into three curls,</P>
<P>He wears a veil in his head-band,</P>
<P>The body is a sun-fish full of stars,</P>
<P>The base of his feet are claws,</P>
<P>The sole of his foot has no heel;</P>
<P>His name is Sassu-wunnu,</P>
<P>A sea monster, a form of Ea.</P>
<P>En was &quot;the great magician of the gods&quot;; his sway over the forces 
of nature was secured by the performance of magical rites, and his services were 
obtained by mankind, who performed requisite ceremonies and repeated appropriate 
spells. Although he might be worshipped and propitiated in his temple at Eridu, 
he could also be conjured in reed huts. The latter indeed appear to have been 
the oldest holy places. In the Deluge myth, he makes a revelation in a dream to 
his human favourite, Pir-napishtim, the Babylonian Noah, of the approaching 
disaster planned by the gods. by addressing the reed hut in which he slept: 
&quot;O, reed hut, hear; O, wall, understand.&quot; The sleeper received the 
divine message from the reeds. The reeds were to the Babylonian what rowan 
branches were to northern Europeans: they protected them against demons. The 
dead were buried wrapped in reed mats.</P>
<P>When the official priesthood came into existence it included two classes of 
magicians, the ' Ashipu.&quot; who were exorcists, and the 
&quot;Mashmashu,&quot; the &quot;purifiers.&quot; The Ashipu priests played a 
prominent part in ceremonies, which had for their object the magical control of 
nature: in times of storm, disaster, and eclipse they were especially active. 
They also took the p art of &quot;witch doctors.&quot; Victims of disease were 
supposed to be possessed of devouring demons:</P>
<P>Loudly roaring above, gibbering below,</P>
<P>They are the bitter venom of the gods.</P>
<P>Knowing no care, they grind the land like corn: Knowing no mercy, they rage 
against mankind, They spill their blood like rain,</P>
<P>Devouring their flesh and sucking their veins. (Thompson's translation.)</P>
<P>It was the business of the Ashipu priests to drive out the demon. Before he 
could do so he had to identify it. Having done so, he required next to bring it 
under his influence. This he accomplished by reciting its history and detailing 
its characteristics. The secret of the magician's power was his knowledge. To 
cure toothache. for instance, it was necessary to know the &quot;Legend of the 
Worm,&quot; which, vampire-like, absorbed the blood of victims, but specialised 
in gums. The legend relates that the worm came into existence as follows: Anu 
created the heaven, the heavens created the earth, the earth created the rivers, 
and the rivers created the canals, then the canals created marshes, and the 
marshes created the &quot;.worm.&quot; In due time the worm appeared before 
Shamash, the sun god, and Ea, god of the deep, weeping and hungry. &quot;What 
will you give me to eat and drink?&quot; it cried. The gods promised that it 
would get dried bones and scented wood. Apparently the worm realised that this 
was the &quot;food of death,&quot; for it made answer: &quot;What are dry bones 
to me? Set me upon the gums that I may drink the blood of the teeth and take 
away the strength of the gums.&quot; When the worm heard this legend repeated, 
it came under the magician's power, and was dismissed to the marshes, while Ea 
was invoked to smite it, Different demons were exorcised by different processes. 
A fever patient might receive the following treatment:</P>
<P>Sprinkle this man with water, </P>
<P>Bring unto him a censer and a torch, </P>
<P>That the plague demon which resteth in the body of the man, </P>
<P>Like water may trickle away.</P>
<P>Another method was to fashion a figure of dough, wax, clay or pitch. This 
figure might be placed on a fire or mutilated, or placed in running water to be 
washed away. As the figure suffered, so did the demon it represented.</P>
<P>By the magic of the word of Ea. </P>
<P>A third method was to release a raven at the bedside of the</P>
<P>sick man so that It would conjure the demon of fever to take</P>
<P>flight likewise, Sacrifices were also offered, as substitutes</P>
<P>for patients, to provide food for the spirit of the disease.</P>
<P>A kid was slain and the priest muttered: </P>
<P>&quot;The kid is the substitute for mankind; </P>
<P>He hath given the kid for his life, </P>
<P>He hath given the head of the kid for the head of the man.</P>
<P>A pig might be offered:</P>
<P>&quot;Give the pig in his stead</P>
<P>And give the flesh of it for his flesh, The blood of it for his blood, 
etc.&quot;</P>
<P>The cures were numerous and varied. After the patient recovered the house was 
purified by the &quot;mashmashu&quot; priests. The ceremony entailed the 
sprinkling of sacred water, the burning of incense, and the repetition of 
magical charms. Houses were also protected against attack, by placing certain 
plants over the doorways and windows. An ass's halter seems to have been used, 
as horse-shoes have been in Europe, to repel witches and evil spirits.</P>
<P>The purification ceremonies suggest the existence of taboo. For a period a 
sick man was &quot;unclean&quot; and had to be isolated. To each temple was 
attached a &quot;House of Light&quot; in which fire ceremonies were performed, 
and a &quot;House of Washing&quot; where patients bathed in sacred water. Oil 
was also used as anointment to complete the release from uncleanness, floods 
were also tabooed at certain seasons, It was unlawful for a man to eat pork on 
the <B>30</B>th of Ab (July-August) or the <B>27</B>th of Tisri, and other 
dates. Fish, ox flesh, bread, etc. were similarly tabooed on specific dates. A 
man's luck depended greatly on his observance of these rules, But although he 
might observe all ceremonies, he might still meet with ill-fortune on unlucky 
days. On the festival day of Marduk (Merodach) a man must not change his clothes 
nor put on white garments, nor offer up sacrifices. Sure disaster would overcome 
a king if he drove out in a chariot, or a physician if he laid hands on the 
sick, or a priest who sat in judgment, and so on. On lucky days good fortune was 
the heritage of everyone. Good fortune meant good health in many cases, and it 
was sometimes assured by worshipping the dreaded spirit of disease called Ura. A 
legend related that this demon once made up his mind to destroy all mankind, His 
counsellor Ishun, however, prevailed upon him to change his mind, and he said, 
&quot;Whoever will laud my name I will bless with plenty. No one will oppose the 
person who proclaims the glory of my valour. The worshipper who chants the hymn 
of praise to me will not be afflicted by disease and he will find favour in the 
eyes of the King and his nobles.&quot;</P><I>
<P>Ghosts-Among </I>the spirits who were the enemies of mankind the ghosts of 
the dead were not the least virulent, and especially the ghosts of those who had 
not been properly buried. These homeless spirits (the grave was the home of the 
dead) wandered about the streets searching for food and drink, or haunted 
houses. Not infrequently they did real injury to mankind. Of horrible aspect, 
they appeared before children and frightened them to death. They waylaid 
travellers and mocked those who were in sorrow. The screech-owl was a mother who 
had died in childbed and walled her grief nightly in solitary places. 
Occasionally she appeared in monstrous form and slew wayfarers. Adam's 
&quot;first wife Lilith&quot; was a demon who had once been beautiful and was in 
the habit of deceiving lovers, and working ill against them. A hag, Labartu, 
haunted mountains and marshes and children had to be charmed against her 
attacks. She also had a human history. The belief that the spirits of the dead 
could be conjured from their graves to make revelations was also prevalent in 
<I>Babylonia. </I>In the Gilgamesh epic, the hero visits the tomb of his old 
friend and fellow-warrior Ea-Bani. The ghost rises like a &quot;weird gust&quot; 
and answers the various questions addressed to it with great sadness. Babylonian 
outlook on the future life was tinged by profound gloom and pessimism. It was 
the fate of even the ghosts of the most fortunate and ceremonially buried dead 
to exist in darkness and amidst dust. The ghost of EaBani said to Gilgamesh:</P>
<P>&quot;Were I to inform thee the law of the underworld which I have 
experienced,</P>
<P>Thou wouldest sit down and shed tears all day long.&quot;</P>
<P>Gilgamesh lamented:</P>
<P>&quot;The sorrow of the underworld hath taken hold upon thee.&quot;</P>
<P>Priests who performed magical ceremonies had to be clothed in magical 
garments. They received inspiration from their clothing. Similarly the gods 
derived power from the skins of animals with which they were associated from the 
earliest time. Thus En was clad in the skin of the fish-probably the fish totem 
of the En tribe.</P>
<P>The dead were not admitted to the heavens of the gods. When a favoured human 
being, like Utnapishtim, the Babylonian Noah, joined the company of the gods, he 
had assigned to him an island Paradise where Gilgamesh visited him. There he 
dwelt with his wife. Gilgamesh</P>
<P>was not permitted to land, and held converse with his immortal ancestor, 
sitting in his boat. The deities secured immortality by eating the &quot;food of 
life&quot; and drinking the &quot;water of life.&quot; DONALD MACKENZIE.</P><B>

<P>Bacon, Roger :</B> was born near Ilchester in Somerset, in <B>1214</B>. In 
his boyhood he displayed remarkable precocity, and in due time, having entered 
the order of St. Francis, he studied mathematics and medicine in Oxford and 
Paris. Returning to England, he devoted attention to philosophy and also wrote 
Latin, Greek, and Hebrew Grammars. He was a pioneer of astronomy and was 
acquainted with the properties of lenses, so that he may have foreshadowed the 
telescope. In the region of the mechanical sciences, his prophecies are 
noteworthy since he not only speaks of boats which may be propelled without 
oars, but of cars which may move without horses, and even of machines to fly in 
the air. To him we are indebted for important discoveries in the science of pure 
chemistry. His name is for ever associated with the making of gunpowder. and if 
the honour cannot be wholly afforded him, his experiments with nitre were at 
least a far step towards the discovery. His study of alchemical subjects led 
him, as was natural, to a belief in the philosopher's stone by which gold might 
be purified to a degree impossible by any other means, and also to a belief in 
the elixir of life whereby on similar principles of purification, the human body 
might be fortified against death itself. Not only might man become practically 
immortal by such means but, by knowledge of the appropriate herbs, or by 
acquaintance with planetary influences, he might attain the same consummation. 
As was natural in an ignorant age, Bacon was looked on with considerable 
suspicion which ripened into persecution. The brethren of his order practically 
cast him out, and he was compelled to retire to Paris, and to submit himself to 
a regime of repression. A prolific penman, he was forbidden to write, and it was 
not till <B>1266</B> that Guy de Foulques, the papal legate in 
England-subsequently Pope Clement IV.-hearing of <I>Bacon's </I>fame, invited 
him to break his enforced silence. <I>Bacon </I>hailed the opportunity and in 
spite of hardship and poverty, finished his <I>Opus Majus, Opus Minus </I>and 
<I>Opus Tertium. </I>These works seem to have found favour with Clement, for the 
writer was allowed to return to Oxford, there to continue his scientific studies 
and the composition of scientific works. He essayed a compendium of philosophy 
of which a part remains, but its subject-matter was displeasing to the ruling 
powers and <I>Bacon's </I>misfortunes began afresh. His books were burned and 
again be was thrown into prison, where he remained for fourteen years, and 
during that period it is probable that he continued to write, About <B>1202</B> 
he was again at liberty, and within the next few years - probably in 
<B>1294</B>-he died. <I>Bacon's </I>works were numerous and, while many still 
remain in manuscript, about a dozen have been printed at various times. Many are 
obscure treatises on alchemy and deserve little attention, but the works he 
wrote by invitation of Clement are the most important. The <I>Opus Majus is 
</I>divided into six parts treating of the causes of error, the relation between 
philosophy and theology, the utility of grammar, mathematics, perspective and 
experimental science. The <I>Opus Minus, </I>of which only part has been 
preserved, was intended to be a summary of the former work. The <I>Opus Teretium 
</I>though written after the other two, is an introduction to them, and also in 
part supplementary to them. These works, large though they be, seem to have been 
only the forerunners of a vast work treating of the principles of all the 
sciences, which, however, was probably little more than begun. Much of 
<I>Bacon's </I>work and many of his beliefs must, of course, be greatly 
discounted, but judging the man in relation to his time, the place he takes is a 
high one. His devotion to the experimental sciences was the point wherein he 
differed from most from his contemporaries, and to this devotion is to be 
accounted the fame which he then possessed and still possess.</P>
<P>But no sketch of <I>Bacon's </I>life would be complete without some account 
of the legendary material which has gathered around his name, and by virtue of 
which he holds rank as a great magician in the popular imagination. When, in the 
sixteenth century, the study of magic was pursued with increased zeal, the name 
of <I>Friar Bacon </I>became more popular, and not only were the traditions 
worked up into a popular book, entitled <I>The History of Friar Bacon, </I>but 
one of the dramatists of the age, Robert Green, founded upon them a play, which 
was often acted, and of which there are several editions. The greater part of 
the history of <I>Friar Bacon, </I>as far as it related to that celebrated 
personage, is evidently the invention of the writer, who appears to have lived 
in the time of Queen Elizabeth; he adopted some of the older traditions, and 
filled up his narrative with fables taken from the common story books of the 
age. We are here first made acquainted with two other legendary conjurers, 
Friars Bungay and Vandermast and the recital is enlivened with the pranks of 
Bacon's servant Miles.</P>
<P>According to this legendary history, <I>Roger Bacon </I>was the son of a 
wealthy farmer in the West of England, who had placed his son with the parish 
priest to gain a little scholarship. The boy soon showed an extraordinary 
ability for learning, which was encouraged by the priest, but which was 
extremely disagreeable to the father, who intended him for no other profession 
but that of the plough. Young <I>Bacon </I>fled from home, and took shelter in a 
monastery, where he followed his studies to his heart's content, and was 
eventually sent to complete them at Oxford. There he made himself a proficient 
in the occult sciences, and attained to the highest proficiency in magic. At 
length he had an opportunity of exhibiting his skill before the court. and the 
account of his exploits on this occasion may be given as a sample of tile style 
of this quaint old history.</P>
<P>The king being in Oxfordshire at a nobleman's house, was very desirous to see 
this famous friar, for he had heard many times of his wondrous things that he 
had done by his art, therefore he sent one for him to desire him to come to the 
court. <I>Friar Bacon </I>kindly thanked the king by the messenger, and said 
that he was at the king's service and would suddenly attend him, 'but, sir,' 
saith he to the gentleman, 'I pray you make haste or else I shall be two hours 
before you at the court.' For all your learning&quot;, answered the gentleman, ' 
I can hardly believe this, for scholars, old men, and travellers, may lie by 
authority.' 'To strengthen your belief' said <I>Friar Bacon, </I>I could 
presently show you the last wench that you kissed withal, but I will not at this 
time.' ' One is as true as the other,' said the gentleman, and I would laugh to 
see either.' You shall see them both within these four hours,' quoth the friar. 
'and therefore make what haste you can.' ' I will prevent that by my speed,' 
said the gentleman, and with that he rid his way; but he rode out of his way, as 
it should seem, for he had but five miles to ride, and yet was he better than 
three hours a-riding them, so that <I>Friar Bacon </I>by his art was with the 
king before he came.</P>
<P>&quot;The king kindly welcomed him, and said that he long time had desired to 
see him, for he had as yet not heard of his like. <I>Friar Bacon </I>answered 
him, that fame had belied him, and given him that report that his poor studies 
had never deserved, for h believed that art had many sons more excellent than 
himself was. The king commended him for his modesty, and told him that nothing 
could become a wise man less than boasting: but yet withal he requested him now 
to be no niggard of his knowledge, but to show his queen and him some of his 
skill &lsquo;I were worthy of neither art or knowledge,' quoth <I>Friar Bacon, 
</I>' should I deny your majesty this small request ; I pray seat yourselves, 
and you shall see presently what my poor skill can perform.' The king, queen, 
and nobles sat them all down. They having done so, the friar waved his wand, and 
presently was heard such excellent music, that they were all amazed, for they 
all said they had never heard the like. ' This is,' said the friar, ' to delight 
the sense of hearing,-I will delight all your other senses ere you depart 
hence.' So waving his wand again. there was louder music heard, and presently 
five dancers entered, the first like a court laundress, the second like a 
footman, the third like a usurer, the fourth like a prodigal, the fifth like a 
fool. These did divers excellent changes, so that they gave content to all the 
beholders, and having done their dance they all vanished away in their order as 
they came in. Thus feasted two of their senses. Then waved he his wand again, 
and there was another kind of music heard, and whilst it was playing, there was 
suddenly before them a table, richly covered with all sorts of delicacies. Then 
desired he the king and queen to taste of some certain rare fruits that were on 
the table, which they and the nobles there present did, and were very highly 
pleased with the taste; they being satisfied, all vanished away on the sudden. 
when waved he his wand again, and suddenly there was such a smell, as if all the 
rich perfumes in the whole world had been then prepared in the best manner that 
art could set them out. Whilst he feasted thus their smelling, he waved his wand 
again, and there came divers nations in sundry habits, as Russians, Polanders, 
Indians, Armenians, all bringing sundry kinds of furs, such as their countries 
yielded, all which they presented to the king and queen. These furs were so soft 
to the touch that they highly pleased all those that handled them. Then, after 
some odd fantastic dances, after their country manner, they vanished away. Then 
asked <I>Friar Bacon </I>the king's majesty if that he desired any more of his 
skill. The king answered that he was fully satisfied for that time, and that he 
only now thought of something that he might bestow on him, that might partly 
satisfy the kindness he had received. <I>Friar Bacon </I>said that he desired 
nothing so much as his majesty's love, and if that he might be assured of that, 
he would think himself happy in it. ' For that,' said the king. 'be thou ever 
sure, in token of which receive this jewel,' and withal gave him a costly jewel 
from his neck. The friar did with great reverence thank his majesty, and said, ' 
As your majesty's vassal you shall ever find me ready to do you service; your 
time of need shall find it both beneficial and delightful. But amongst all these 
gentlemen I see not the man that your grace did send for me by; sure he hath 
lost his way, or else met with some sport that detains him so long; I promised 
to be here before him, and all this noble assembly can witness I am as good as 
my word - I hear him coming. With that entered the gentleman, all bedirted, for 
he had rid through ditches, quagmires, plashes, and waters, that he was in a 
most pitiful case. He, seeing the friar there, looked full angrily, and bid a 
plague on all his devils for they had led him out of his way. and almost drowned 
him. 'Be not angry, sir,' said <I>Friar Bacon, </I>'here is an old friend of 
yours that bath more cause, for she hath tarried these three hours for 
you,'-with that he pulled up the hangings, and behind him stood a kitchen-maid 
with a basting-ladle in her hand-' now am I as good as my word with you, for I 
promised to help you to your sweetheart,-how do you like this? ' 'So ill,' 
answered the gentleman, 'that I will be avenged of you.' 'Threaten not,' said 
<I>Friar Bacon, </I>'lest I do you more shame, and do you take heed how you give 
scholars the lie again; but. because I know not how well you are stored with 
money at this time, I will bear your wench's charges home.' With that she 
vanished away.&quot;</P>
<P>This may be taken as a sort of exemplification of the class of exhibitions 
which were probably the result of a superior knowledge of natural science, and 
which were exaggerated by popular imagination. They had been made, to a certain 
degree, familiar by the performances of the skilful jugglers who came from the 
east, and who were scattered throughout Europe; and we read not unfrequently of 
such magical feats in old writers. When the Emperor Charles IV. was married in 
the middle of the fourteenth century to the Bavarian Princess Sophia in the city 
of Prague, the father of the princess brought a waggonload of magicians to 
assist in the festivities. Two of the chief proficients in the art, Zytho the 
great Bohemian sorcerer, and Gouin the Bavarian, were pitted against each other, 
and we are told that after a desperate trial of skill, Zytho, opening his jaws 
from ear to ear, ate up his rival without stopping till he came to his shoes, 
which he spit out, because, as he said, they had not been cleaned, After having 
performed this strange feat, he restored the unhappy sorcerer to life again. The 
idea of contests like this seems to have been taken from the scriptural 
narrative of the contention of the Egyptian magicians against Moses.</P>
<P>The greater number of <I>Bacon's </I>exploits are mere adaptations of 
medieval stories, but they show, nevertheless, what was the popular notion of 
the magician's character. Such is the story of the gentleman who, reduced to 
poverty and involved in debt, sold himself to the evil one, on condition that he 
was to deliver himself up as soon as his debts were paid. As may be imagined 
without much difficulty, he was not in haste to satisfy his creditors, but at 
length the time came when he could put them off no longer, and then, in his 
despair, he would have committed violence on himself had not his hand been 
arrested by <I>Bacon. </I>The latter, when he had heard the gentleman's story, 
directed him to repair to the place appointed for his meeting with the evil one, 
to deny the devil's claim, and to refer for judgment to the first person who 
should pass &quot;In the morning, after that he had blessed himself, he went to 
the wood, where he found the devil ready for him. So soon as he came near, the 
devil said: 'Nov,, deceiver, are you come? Now shall thou see that I can and 
will prove that thou hast paid all thy debts, and therefore thy soul belongest 
to me.' 'Thou art a deceiver,' said the gentleman, 'and gavest me money to cheat 
me of my soul, for else why wilt thou be thine own judge ?-let me have some 
others to judge between us.' 'Content,' said the devil, 'take whom thou wilt.' 
'Then I will have,' said the gentleman, 'the next man that cometh this way.' 
Hereto the devil agreed. No sooner were these words ended, but <I>Friar Bacon 
</I>came by, to whom this gentleman spoke, and requested that he would. be judge 
in a weighty matter between them two. The friar said he was content, so 
b<B><SUB>9</B></SUB>th parties were agreed; the devil told <I>Friar Bacon 
</I>how the case stood between them in this manner. ' Know, friar, that I seeing 
this prodigal like to starve for want of food, lent him money, not only to buy 
him victuals, but also to redeem his lands and pay his debts, conditionally that 
so soon as his debts were paid, that he should give himself freely to me to 
this, here is his hand '-showing him the bond. 'Now, my time is expired, for all 
his debts are paid, which he cannot deny.' 'This case is plain, if it be so that 
his debts are paid.' His silence confirms it,' said the devil, 'therefore give 
him a just sentence.' ' I will,' said <I>Friar Bacon, </I>'but first tell me, 
'-speaking to the gentleman-' didst thou never yet give the devil any of his 
money back, nor requite him in any ways?' 'Never had he anything of me as yet,' 
answered the gentleman. 'Then never let him have anything of thee. and thou art 
free. Deceiver of mankind,' said he, speaking to the devil, 'it was thy bargain 
never to meddle with him so long as he was indebted to any; now how canst thou 
demand of him anything when he is indebted for all that he hath to thee? When he 
payeth thee thy money, then take him as thy due; till then thou hast nothing to 
do with him, and so I charge thee to be gone.' At this the devil vanished with 
great horror, but <I>Friar Bacon </I>comforted the gentleman, and sent him home 
with a quiet conscience, bidding him never to pay the devil's money back, as he 
valued his own safety.&quot;</P><I>
<P>Bacon </I>now met with a companion, Friar Bungay, whose tastes and pursuits 
were congenial to his own, and with his assistance he undertook the exploit for 
which he was most famous. He had a fancy that he would defend England. against 
its enemies, by walling it with brass, preparatory to which they made a head of 
that metal. Their intent was to make the head speak, for which purpose they 
raised a spirit in a wood, by whose direction&quot; they made a fumigation, to 
which the head was to be exposed during a month, and to be carefully watched, 
because if the two friars did not hear it before it had ceased speaking, their 
labour would be lost. Accordingly, the care of watching over the head while they 
slept was entrusted to <I>Bacon's </I>man Miles, The period of utterance 
unfortunately came while Miles was watching. The head suddenly uttered the two 
words, &quot;Time is.&quot; Miles thought it was unnecessary to disturb his 
master for such a brief speech, and sat still, In half an hour, the head again 
broke silence with the words, &quot;Time was.&quot; Still Miles waited until, in 
another half hour, the head said, &quot;Time is past,&quot; and fell to the 
ground with a terrible noise. Thus, through the negligence of Miles, the labour 
of the two friars was thrown away.</P>
<P>The king soon required <I>Friar Bacon's </I>services, and the latter enabled 
him, by his perspective and burning-glasses, to take a town which he was 
besieging. In consequence of this success, the kings of England and France made 
peace, and a grand court was held, at which the German conjurer, Vandermast, was 
brought to try his skill against <I>Bacon. </I>Their performances were something 
in the style of <I>Bacon's </I>former exhibition before the king and queen. 
Vandermast, in revenge, sent a soldier to kill <I>Bacon., </I>but. in vain. Next 
follow a series of adventures which consist of a few medieval stories very 
clumsily put together among which are that known as the Friar and the Boy, that 
which appeared in Scottish verse, under the title of <I>The Friars of Berwick, 
</I>a tale taken from the Gesta Romanorum, and some others. A contention in 
magic between Vandermast and Bungay, ended in the deaths of both. The servant 
Miles next turned conjurer, having got hold of one of <I>Bacon's </I>books, and 
escaped with a dreadful fright, and a broken leg. Everything now seemed to go 
wrong. <I>Friar Bacon </I>&quot; had a glass which was of that excellent nature 
that any man might behold anything that he desired to see within the compass of 
fifty miles round about him.&quot; In this glass he used to show people what 
their relations and friends were doing, or where they' were. One day two young 
gentlemen. of high birth came to look into the glass, and they beheld their 
fathers desperately fighting together, upon which they drew their swords and 
slew each other. Bacon was so shocked that he broke his glass, and hearing about 
the same time of the deaths of Vandermast and Bungay, he became melancholy, and 
at length he burnt his books of magic, distributed his wealth among poor 
scholars and others, and became an anchorite. Thus ended the life of <I>Friar 
Bacon, </I>according to &quot;the famous history,&quot; which probably owed most 
of its incidents to the imagination of the writer.</P><B>

<P>Balaslus :</B> To describe this stone in fewer words than I,eonardus has used 
would be impossible. It is &quot;of a purple or rosy colour, and by some is 
called the placidus or pleasant. Some think it is the carbuncle diminished in 
its colour and virtue ; just as the virtue of the female differs from that of 
the male. It is often found that the external part of one and the same stone 
appears a <I>balasius, </I>and the internal a carbuncle, from whence comes the 
saying that the <I>balasius </I>is the carbuncle's house. The virtue of the 
<I>balasius </I>is to overcome and repress vain thoughts and luxury; to 
reconcile quarrels among friends; and it befriends the human body with a good 
habit of health. Being bruised and drunk with water, it relieves infirmities in 
the eyes, and gives help in disorders of the liver; and what is still more 
surprising, if you touch the four corners of a house, garden or vineyard, with 
the <I>balasius, </I>it will preserve them from lightning, tempest. and 
worms.&quot;</P><B>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Banshee :</B> An Irish supernatural being of the wraith type. The name 
implies &quot;female fairy.&quot; She is usually the possession of a specific 
family. to a member or members of whom she appears before the death of one of 
them. Mr. Thistleton Dyer, writing on the <I>Banshee </I>says:</P>
<P>&quot;Unlike, also, many of the legendary beliefs of this kind, the popular 
accounts illustrative of it are related on the evidence of all sections of the 
community. many an enlightened and well-informed advocate being enthusiastic in 
his vindication of its reality. It would seem, however, that no family which is 
not of an ancient and noble stock is honoured with this visit of the <I>Banshee, 
</I>and hence its non-appearance has been regarded as an indication of 
disqualification in this respect on the part of the person about to die. ' If I 
am rightly informed,' writes Sir Walter Scott, 'the distinction of a <I>Banshee 
</I>is only allowed to families of the pure Milesian stock, and is never 
ascribed to any descendant of the proudest Norman or the boldest Saxon who 
followed the banner of Strongbow, much less to adventurers of later dates who 
have obtained settlements in the Green Isle.' Thus, an amusing story is 
contained in an Irish elegy to the effect that on the death of one of the 
Knights of Kerry, when the <I>Banshee </I>was heard to lament his decease at 
Dingle-a seaport town, the property of those knights-all the merchants of this 
place were thrown into a state of alarm lest the mournful and ominous wailing 
should be a forewarning of the death of one of them, but, as the poet humorously 
points out, there was no necessity for them to be anxious on this point. 
Although, through misfortune, a family may be brought down from high estate to 
the rank of peasant tenants, the <I>Banshee </I>never leaves nor forgets it till 
the last member has been gathered to his fathers in the churchyard. The 
MacCarthys, O'Flahertys, Magraths, O'Neils, O'Rileys, O'Sulllvans, O'Reardons, 
have their <I>Banshees, </I>though many representatives of these names are in 
abject poverty.</P>
<P>&quot;The <I>Banshee,' </I>says Mr. McAnally, 'is really a disembodied soul, 
that of one who in life was strongly attached to the family, or who had good 
reason to hate all its members. Thus, in different instances, the <I>Banshee's 
</I>song may be inspired by different motives. When the <I>Banshee </I>loves 
those she calls, the song is a low, soft chant, giving notice, indeed, of the 
close proximity of the angel of death, but with a tenderness of tone that 
reassures the one destined to die and comforts the survivors; rather a welcome 
than a warning, and having in its tones a thrill of exultation, as though the 
messenger spirit were bringing glad tidings to him summoned to join the waiting 
throng of his ancestors.' To a doomed member of the family of the O'Reardons the 
<I>Banshee </I>generally appears in the form of a beautiful woman, 'and sings a 
song so sweetly solemn as to reconcile him to his approaching fate.' But if, 
during his lifetime the <I>Banshee </I>was an enemy of the family, the cry is 
the scream of a fiend, howling with demoniac delight over the coming death agony 
of another of his foes.</P>
<P>&quot;Hence, in Ireland, the hateful <I>'Banshee </I>' is a source of dread 
to many a family against which she has an enmity. 'It appears,' adds McAnally, 
'that a noble family, whose name is still familiar in Mayo, is attended by a 
<I>Banshee </I>of this description-the spirit of a young girl, deceived, and 
afterwards murdered by a former head of the family. With her dying breath she 
cursed her murderer, and promised she would attend him and his forever. After 
many years the chieftain reformed his ways, and his youthful crime was almost 
forgotten even by himself, when one night, as he and his family were seated by 
the fire, the most terrible shrieks were suddenly heard outside the castle 
walls. All ran out, but saw nothing. During the night the screams continued as 
though the castle were besieged by demons. and the unhappy man recognised in the 
cry of the <I>Banshee </I>the voice of the young girl he had murdered. The next 
night he was assassinated by one of his follower', when again the wild unearthly 
screams were heard exulting over his fate. Since that night the 'hateful 
<I>Banshee' </I>has, it is said, never failed to notify the family, with shrill 
cries of revengeful gladness, when the time of one of their number has 
arrived.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Among some of the recorded instances of the <I>Banshee's </I>appearance 
may be mentioned one related by Miss Lefrau, the niece of Sheridan, in the 
Memoirs of her grandmother, Mr. Frances Sheridan. From this account we gather 
that Miss Elizabeth Sheridan was a firm believer in the <I>Banshee, </I>and 
firmly maintained that the one attached to the Sheridan family was distinctly 
heard lamenting beneath the windows of the family residence before the news 
arrived from France of Mrs. Frances Sheridan's death at Blois. She added that a 
niece of Miss Sheridan made her very angry by observing that as Mrs. Frances 
Sheridan was by birth a Chamberlaine, a family of English extraction, she had no 
right to the guardianship of an Irish fairy, and that therefore the <I>Banshee 
</I>must have made a mistake. Then there is the well-known case related by Lady 
Fanshawe who tells us how, when on a visit in Ireland, she was a-wakened at 
midnight by a loud scream outside her window. On looking out she saw a young and 
rather handsome woman, with dishevelled hair, who vanished before her eyes with 
another shriek. On communicating the circumstance in the morning, her host 
replied, 'A near relation of mine died last night in the castle, and before such 
an event happens, the female spectre whom you have seen is always 
visible.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;This weird apparition is generally supposed to assume the form of a 
woman, sometimes young, but more often old. She is usually attired in a loose 
white drapery, and her long ragged locks hang over her thin shoulders. As night 
time approaches she occasionally becomes visible, and pours forth her mournful 
wail-a sound said to resemble the melancholy moaning of the wind. Oftentimes she 
is not seen. but only heard, yet she is supposed to be always clearly 
discernible to the person upon whom she specially waits. Respecting the history 
of the <I>Banshee, </I>popular tradition in many instances accounts for its 
presence as the spirit of some mortal woman whose destinies have become linked 
by some accident with those of the family she follows. It is related how the 
<I>Banshee </I>of the family of the O'Briens of Thomond was originally a woman 
who had been seduced by one of the chiefs of that race-an act of indiscretion 
which ultimately brought about her death.&quot;</P><B>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Baphomet :</B> The goat-idol of the Templars (q.v.) and the deity of the 
sorcerers' Sabbath. The name is composed of three abbreviations: Tem. ohp. Ab, 
<I>Templi omnium hominum pacis abhas, </I>&quot;the father of the temple of 
universal peace among men.&quot; Some authorities hold that the Baphomet was a 
monstrous head, others that it was a demon in the form of a goat. An account of 
a veritable Baphometic idol is as follows: &quot;A pantheistic and magical 
figure of the Absolute. The torch placed between the two horns, represents the 
equilbrating intelligence of the triad. The goat's head, which is synthetic, and 
unites some characteristics of the dog, bull, and ass, represents the exclusive 
responsibility of matter and the expiation of bodily sins in the body. The hands 
are human, to exhibit the sanctity of labour; they make the sign of esotericism 
above and below, to impress mystery on initiates, and they point at two lunar 
crescents, the upper being white and the lower black, to explain the 
correspondences of good and evil, mercy and justice. The lower part of the body 
is veiled, portraying the mysteries of universal generation, which is expressed 
solely by the symbol of the caduceus. The belly of the goat is scaled and should 
be coloured green, the semicircle above should be blue; the plumage, reaching to 
the breast, should be of various hues. The goat has female breasts, and thus its 
only human characteristics are those of maternity and toil, otherwise the signs 
of redemption. On its forehead, between the horns and beneath the torch, is the 
sign of the microcosm, or the pentagram with one beam in the ascendant, symbol 
of human intelligence, which, placed thus below the torch, makes the flame of 
the latter an image of divine revelation. This Pantheos should be seated on a 
cube, and its footstool should be a single ball, or a ball and a triangular 
stool.&quot;</P>
<P>Wright <I>(Narratives of Sorcery and Magic), </I>writing on the Baphomet says 
:-&quot; Another charge in the accusation of the Templars seems to have been to 
a great degree proved by the depositions of witnesses; the idol or head which 
they are said to have worshipped, but the real character or meaning of which we 
are totally unable to explain. Many Templars confessed to having seen this idol, 
but as they described it differently, we must suppose that it was not in all 
cases represented under the same form. Some said it was a frightful head, with 
long beard and sparkling eyes; others said it was a man's skull; some described 
it as having three faces; some said it was of wood, and others of metal; one 
witness described it as a painting <I>(tabula picta) </I>representing the image 
a man <I>(imago hominis) </I>and said that when it was shown to him, he was 
ordered to 'adore Christ, his creator.' According to some it was a gilt figure, 
either of wood or metal; while others described it as painted black and white. 
According to another deposition, the idol had four feet, two before and two 
behind; the one belonging to the order at Paris, was said to be a silver head, 
with two faces and a beard. The novices of the order were told always to regard 
this idol as their saviour. Deodatus Jaffet, a knight from the south of France, 
who had been received at Pedenat, deposed that the person who in his case 
performed the ceremonies of reception, showed him a head or idol, which appeared 
to have three faces, and said, 'You must adore this as your saviour, and the 
saviour of the order of the Temple' and that he was made to worship the idol, 
saying, 'Blessed be he who shall save my soul.' Cettus Ragonis, a knight 
received at Rome in a chamber of the palace of the Lateran, gave a somewhat 
similar account. Many other witnesses spoke of having seen these heads, which, 
however, were, perhaps, not shown to everybody, for the greatest number of those 
who spoke on this subject, said that they had heard speak of the head, but that 
they had never seen it themselves; and many of them declared their disbelief in 
its existence. A friar minor deposed in England that an English Templar had 
assured him that in that country the order had four principal idols, one at 
London, in the Sacristy of the Temple, another at Bristelham, a third at Brueria 
(Bruern in Lincolnshire), and a fourth beyond the Humber.</P>
<P>&quot;Some of the knights from the south added another circumstance in their 
confessions relating to this head. A templar of Florence, declared that, in the 
secret meetings of the chapters, one brother said to the others, showing them 
the idol, 'Adore this head. This head is your God and your Mahomet.' Another, 
Gauserand de Montpesant, said that the idol was made in the. figure of Baffomet 
<I>(in </I>figuram <I>Baffometi); </I>and another, Raymond Rubei, described it 
as a wooden head, on which was painted the figure of <I>Baphomet, </I>and he 
adds, 'that he worshipped it by kissing its feet, and exclaiming <I>Xalla,' 
</I>which he describes as 'a word of the Saracens' <I>(verbum Saracenorum). 
</I>This has been seized upon by some as a proof that the Templars had secretly 
embraced Mahometanism, as <I>Baffomet </I>or <I>Baphomet </I>is evidently a 
corruption of Mahomet; but it must not be forgotten that the Christians of the 
West constantly used the word Mahomst in the mere signification of an idol, and 
that it was the desire of those who conducted the prosecution against the 
Templars to show their intimate intercourse with the Saracens. Others, 
especially Von Hammer, gave a Greek derivation of the word, and assumed it as a 
proof that gnosticism was the secret doctrine of the temple </P><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Baptism :</B> It was said that at the witches' Sabbath children and toads 
were baptised with certain horrible rites. This was called the <I>baptism </I>of 
the devil.</P><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Baptism of the line :</B> A curious rite is performed on persons crossing the 
equator for the first time. The sailors who are to carry it out dress themselves 
in quaint costumes. The <I>Father of the Line </I>arrives in a cask, accompanied 
by a courier, a devil, a hair-dresser, and a miller. The unfortunate passenger 
has his hair curled, is liberally sprinkled with flour, and then has water 
showered upon him, if he is not ducked. The origin of this custom is not known, 
nor is it quite clear what part the devil plays in it. It is said, however, that 
it may be averted by tipping the sailors.</P><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Baquet :</B> A large circular tub which entered largely into the treatment 
which D'Eslon, the friend and follower of Mesmer, prescribed for his patients. 
Puysegur tells us in his book Du <I>Maqnitisme Animal, </I>that in the <I>baquet 
</I>were placed some bottles, arranged in a particular manner, and partly 
covered with water. It was fitted with a lid in which were several holes, 
through which parsed iron rods, connecting the patients, who sat round the 
contrivance, with the interior of the tub. The operator was armed with a shorter 
iron rod. While the patients waited for the symptoms of the magnetic treatment, 
someone played upon a pianoforte, a device which is frequently adopted at 
seances. The symptoms included violent convulsions, cries, laughter, and 
vomiting. This state they called the <I>crisis, </I>and it was supposed to 
hasten the healing process. A commission appointed in <B>1794</B> by the French 
government through the <I>Faculte de Medecine </I>and the <I>Societe royale de 
Medecine, </I>reported that such practices were exceedingly dangerous, and in 
nowise proved the existence of the magnetic fluid. Dr. Bell a &quot; professor 
of animal magnetism&quot; set up a similar institution in England in 
<B>1795</B>, using a large oak <I>baquet.</I></P><B>

information on the Continent. He subsequently went to Paris, where for some 
years he taught mathematics in the University. He returned to Scotland in 
<B>1562</B>. The prevailing belief of that age, particularly in France, was a 
belief in judicial astrology. In his way home through England, as we learn from 
Sir James Melville's Memoirs, he met with his brother, Sir Robert Melville, who 
was at that time engaged, on the part of the unfortunate Mary, in endeavouring 
to effect a meeting between her and Elizabeth; when he predicted that all his 
efforts would be in vain; &quot; for, first, they will never meit together, and 
next, there will neuer be bot discembling and secret hattrent (hatred) for a 
whyle, and at length captivity and utter wrak for our Quen by England.&quot; 
Melville's answer was, that he could not credit such news, which he looked upon 
as &quot;false, ungodly, and unlawful;&quot; on which <I>Bassantin </I>replied, 
&quot;Sa far as Melanthon, wha was a godly thologue, has declared and written 
anent the naturall scyences, that are lawfull and daily red in dyvers Christian 
Universities; in the quhilkis,<B> </B>as in all other artis, God gives to some 
less, to some mair and clearer knawledge than till othirs; be the quhilk 
knawledge I have also that at length, that the kingdom of England sall of rycht 
fall to the crown of Scotland, and that ther are some born at this instant that 
sall bruik lands and heritages in England. Bot, alace, it will cost many their 
lyves, and many bluidy battailes will be fouchen first, and the Spaniatris will 
be helpers, and will take a part to themselves for their labours.&quot; The 
first part of <I>Bassantin's </I>prediction, which he might very well have 
hazarded from what he may have known of Elizabeth's character and disposition, 
and also from the fact that Mary was the next heir to the English throne, proved 
true. <I>Bassantin </I>was a zealous Protestant and a supporter of the Regent 
Moray. He died in <B>1569</B>. His principal work is a Treatise or Discourse on 
Astronomy, written in French, which was translated into Latin by John 
Tornasesius (M. de Tournes), and published at Geneva in <B>1599</B>. He wrote 
four other treatises. Although well versed for his time in what are called the 
exact sciences, <I>Bassantin, </I>or, as his name is sometimes spelt, 
<I>Bassantoun, </I>had received no part of a classical education. Vossius 
observes, that his <I>Astronomical Discourse </I>was written in very bad French, 
and that the author knew neither Greek nor Latin, but only Scots.&quot; 
<I>Bassantin's </I>Planetary System was that of Ptolemy.</P><B>
<P>Bat :</B> There is an Oriental belief that the bat is specially adapted to 
occult uses. In the Tyrol it is believed that the man who wears the left eye of 
a bat may become invisible, and in Hesse he who wears the heart of a bat bound 
to his arm with red thread will always be lucky at 
cards.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<P>Battle of Loquifer, The</B> : a tale incorporated in the Charlemagne saga, 
supposed to have been written about the twelfth century. Its hero is Renouart, 
the giant brother-in-law of William of Orange, and the events take place on the 
sea. Renouart and his barons are on the shore at Porpaillart, when a Saracen 
fleet is seen. He is persuaded to enter one of the ships, which immediately set 
sail; and he is told by Isembert, a hideous monster, that the Saracens mean to 
flay him alive. Renouart, armed only with a huge bar of wood, kills this 
creature, and makes the Saracens let him go, while they return to their own 
country. It is arranged that Renouart will fight one Loquifer, a fairy giant and 
leader of the Saracens; and on the issue of this combat the war will depend. 
They meet on an island near Porpaillart. Loquifer is-in possession of a magical 
balm, which heals all his wounds immediately, and is concealed in his club; but 
Renouart, who is assisted by angels, at length succeeds in depriving Loquifer of 
his club, so that his strength departs. Renouart slays him, and the devil 
carries off his soul. The romance goes on to tell of a duel between William of 
Orange and Desrame, Renouart's father, in which the latter is slain. Renouart is 
comforted by fairies, who bear him to Avalon where he has many adventures. He is 
finally wrecked, but is rescued by mermaids, and awakes to find himself on the 
sands at Porpaillart, from which spot he had been taken to Avalon.</P><B>

<P>Bauer, George :</B> who Latinized his name (a boor or husbandman) into 
&quot;Agricola,&quot; was born in the province of Misnia, in <B>1494</B>. An 
able and industrious man, he acquired a considerable knowledge of the principles 
of medicine, which led him, as it led his contemporaries, to search for the 
<I>elixir </I>vitae and the Philosopher's Stone. A treatise on these interesting 
subjects, which he published at Cologne in <B>1531</B>, secured him the favour 
of Duke Maurice of Saxony, who appointed him the superintendent of his 
silver-mines at Chemnitz. In this post he obtained a practical acquaintance with 
the properties of metals which dissipated his wild notions of their possible 
transmutation into gold; but if he abandoned one superstition he adopted 
another, and from the legends of the miners imbibed a belief in the existence of 
good and evil spirits in the bowels of the earth, and in the creation of 
explosive gases and fire-damp by the malicious agency of the latter. <I>Bauer 
</I>died in <B>1555</B>.</P><B>

</I>most mighty, who reigneth towards the western parts, I call upon thee and 
invoke thy name in the name of the Divinity. I command thee in the name of the 
Most High to present thyself before this circle, thee and the other spirits who 
are thy subjects. in the name of Passiel and Rosus, for the purpose of replying 
to all that which I demand of thee. If thou dost not come I will torment thee 
with a sword of heavenly fire. I will augment thy pains and burn thee. Obey, O

<P>Bealings Bells :</B> In February, <B>1934</B>, a mysterious outbreak of 
bell-ringing was heard at the residence of Major Moor, F. R.S.,-Bealings, near 
Woodbridge, Suffolk. From the <B>2</B>nd of February to the <B>27</B>th of March 
the bells of the house rang at frequent intervals, and without any visible 
agency. The Major meanwhile took careful note of the condition of the 
atmosphere, state of the wires, and any physical cause which might affect the 
bells, but, as Mr. Podmore justly points out, he omitted to take precautions 
against trickery in his own household, and has not even left on record the names 
of its members, or any facts concerning them.</P><B>

<P>Beans :</B> A forbidden article of diet. The consumption of beans was 
prohibited by Pythagoras and Plato to those who desire veracious dreams, as they

it be the stomach and not the mind with which one dreams?</P><B>

<P>Beaumont, John :</B> Author of a Tretise on Spirits, Apparitions, etc., 
published in <B>1705</B>. He is described as &quot;a man of hyprochondriacal 
disposition, with a considerable degree of reading, but with a strong bias to 
credulity.&quot; Labouring under the affection, he saw hundreds of imaginary men 
and women about him, though, as he adds. he never saw anything in the 
night-time, unless by fire or candlelight, or in the moonshine. &quot;I had two 
spirits,&quot; he says, &quot;who constantly attended me, night and day. for 
above three months together, who called each other by their names; and several 
spirits would call at my chamber door, and ask whether such spirits lived there, 
and they would answer they did. As for the other spirits that attended me, I 
heard none of their names mentioned only I asked one spirit, which came for some 
nights together, and rung a little bell in my ear, what his name was, who 
answered <I>Ariel. </I>The two spirits that constantly attended myself appeared 
both in women's habit, they being of a brown complexion, about three feet in 
stature; they had both black loose net-work gowns, tied with a black sash about 
the middle, and within the net-work appeared a gown of a golden colour, with 
somewhat of a light striking through it. Their heads were not dressed in 
top-knots, but they had white linen caps on, with lace on them about three 
fingers' breadth, and over it they had a black loose net-work hood.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I would not,&quot; he says, &quot;for the whole world, undergo what I 
have undergone, upon spirits coming twice to me; their first coming was most 
dreadful to me, the thing being then altogether new, and consequently most 
surprising, Bees though at the first coming they did not appear to me but only 
called to me at my chamber-windows, rung bells, sung to me, and played on music, 
etc.; but the last coming also carried terror enough; for when they came, being 
only five in number, the two women before mentioned, and three men (though 
afterwards there came hundreds), they told me they would hill me if I told any 
person in the house of their being there, which put me in some consternation; 
and I made a servant sit up with me four nights in my chamber, before a fire, it 
being in the Christmas holidays, telling no person of their being there. One of 
these spirits, in women's dress, lay down upon the bed by me every night; and 
told me, if I slept, the spirits would kill me, which kept me waking for three 
nights. In the meantime, a near relation of mine went (though unknown to me) to 
a physician of my acquaintance, desiring him to prescribe me somewhat for 
sleeping, which he did, and a sleeping potion was brought me; but I set it by, 
being very desirous and inclined to sleep without it. The fourth night I could 
hardly forbear sleeping; but the spirit, lying on the bed by me, told me again, 
I should be killed if I slept; whereupon I rose and Sat by the fireside, and in 
a while returned to my bed; and so I did a third time, but was still threatened 
as before; whereupon I grew impatient, and asked the spirits what they would 
have? Told them I had done the part of a Christian, in humbling myself to God, 
and feared them not; and rose from my bed. took a cane, and knocked at the 
ceiling of my chamber, a near relation of mine then lying over me, who presently 
rose and came down to me about two o'clock in the morning to whom I said, 
&quot;You have seen me disturbed these four days past, and that I have not 
slept: the occasion of it was, that five spirits, which are now in the room with 
me, have threatened to kill me if I told any person of their being here, or if I 
slept; but I am not able to forbear sleeping longer, and acquaint you with it, 
and now stand in defiance of them; and thus I exerted myself about them and 
notwithstanding their continued threats I slept very well the next night, and 
continued to do so, though they continued with me above three months, day and 
night.&quot; </P><B>

<P>Beausoleil, Jean du Chatelot, Baron de :</B> German mineralogist and 
alchemist, who lived during the first half of the seventeenth century. He 
travelled over most European countries looking for metals with the aid of a 
divining ring. In <B>1626</B> his instruments were seized under the pretext 
thatthey were bewitched, and he himself imprisoned in the Bastille, where he 
died in <B>1645</B>. In <B>1617</B> he published a work entitled <I>Diorisinus, 
id est definitis verae philisophiae de materia prima lapidis philosophalis.

<P>Bed :</B> Graham's Magnetic A magnetic contrivance made use of by one Graham, 
physician and magnetist of Edinburgh. His whole house, which he termed the 
Temple of Hygeia, was of great magnificence, but particularly did splendour 
prevail in the room wherein was set the <I>magnetic bed. </I>The <I>bed 
</I>itself rested on six transparent pillars ; the mattresses were soaked with 
oriental perfumes; the bedclothes were of satin, in tints of purple and 
sky-blue. A healing stream of magnetism, as well as fragrant and strengthening 
medicines, were introduced into the sleeping apartment through glass tubes and 
cylinders. To these attractions were added the soft strains of hidden flutes, 
harmonicons, and a large organ. Permission to use this celestial couch, so 
soothing to shattered nerves, was accorded only to those who sent a written 
application to its owner, inclosing &pound;<B>50 </B>sterling.</P><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Bees :</B> It is maintained by certain demonologists that if a sorceress ate 
a queen-bee before being captured, she would be able to sustain her trial and 
tortures without making a confession. In some parts of Brittany it is claimed 
for these insects that they are very sensitive to the fortunes and misfortunes 
of their master, and will not thrive unless he is careful to tie a piece of 
black cloth to the hive when a death occurs in the family, and a piece of red 
cloth when there is any occasion of rejoicing. So Linus writes that there are no 
bees in Ireland, and even if a little Irish earth be taken to another country. 
and spread about the hives, the bees will be forced to abandon the place, so 
fatal to them is the earth of Ireland. The same story is found in the 
<I>Origines </I>of Isodore. &quot;Must we seek,&quot; says Lebrun, &quot;the 
source of this calumny of Irish earth? No; for it is sufficient to say that it 
is a fable, and that many bees are to be found in Ireland.&quot;</P><B>

<P>Belli Paaro :</B> A secret society of Liberia, Africa, the cult of which 
consists in a description of brotherhood with departed spirits. Dapper, an early 
author, says of this society: &quot;They have also another custom which they 
call <I>Belti Paaro, </I>of which they say it is a death, a new birth and an 
incorporation in the community of spirits or soul with whom the common folk 
associate in the bush, and help to eat the offerings prepared for the 
spirits.&quot; This description is far from clear, but it is obvious enough that 
those who join the society desire to be regarded as spiritualised, or as having 
died and having been brought to life again; and that their society is nothing 
more than a con-fraternity of all those who have passed through this training in 
common.</P><B>

to repair to the sabbatic meetings of Satan in the winter of the year 
<B>1609</B>, that she was there presented to the Devil who kissed her, a mark of 
approbation which he bestowed upon the greatest sorcerers only. She related that

and they continued its use though forbidden by the Koran. Another method 
deserves mention. This was to throw a certain number of arrows into the air, and 
the direction in which the arrow inclined as it fell, pointed out the course to 
be taken by the inquirer. Divination by arrows is the same in principle as 
Rhabdomancy (q.v.).</P><B>

<P>Benedict IX.:</B> At a time when the papacy was much abused - about the tenth 
and eleventh centuries, the papal crown was more than once offered for sale. 
Thus the office fell into the hands of a high and ambitious family who held it 
for a boy of <I>twelve - Benedict IX. </I>As he grew older the boy lost no 
opportunity of disgracing his position by his depraved mode of life. But, like 
his predecessors in the papal chair, he excelled in sorcery and various forms of 
magic. One of the most curious stories concerning him tells how he made the 
Roman matrons follow him over hill and dale, through forests and across rivers, 
by the charm of his magic, as though he were a sort of Pied Piper.</P><B>

him. The king of Calicut had a temple wholly filled with awful figures of the 
devil, and which was lighted only with the gleam of many lamps. In the centre 
was a copper throne, on which was seated a devil,. made of the same metal, with 
a large tiara on his head, three huge horns and four others which come out of 
his forehead. On his tongue and in his hand were two figures-souls, which the

<P>Bensozia :</B> According to Don Martin in his <I>Religion de Gaulois, &quot;

twelfth and thirteenth centuries. She was, he says, the Diana of the ancient 
Gauls, and was also called Nocticula, Herodias, and &quot;The Moon.&quot; One 
finds in the manuscripts of the church at Couserans. that the ladies of the 
fourteenth century were said to go on horseback to the nocturnal revelries of 
Bensozia. All of them were forced to inscribe their names in a Sabbatic 
catalogue along with those of the sorcerers proper, and after this ceremony they 
believed themselves to be fairies. There was found at Montmorillon in Poitou, in 
the eighteenth century, a portion of an ancient temple, a bas-relief with the 
figure of a naked woman carved upon it, and it is not unlikely, thinks Collin de 
Plancy, that this figure was the original deity of the <I>Bensozia 
</I>cult.</P><B>

<P>Beowulf</B> : an Anglo-Saxon saga of great interest. The events in this poem 
probably took place about the fifth century. <I>Beowulf, </I>himself, was most 
likely one of the Sons of Light or Men of the Sun, whose business it was to 
light the powers of darkness until they themselves fell. It is related in this 
legend how <I>Beowulf </I>fought the monster, Grendel, and succeeded in 
defeating him-the giant escaping only by leaving his arm in <I>Beowulf&rsquo;s 
</I>grip. But Grendel's mother, a mer-woman, came to revenge him and slew many 
people. <I>Beowulf, </I>hearing of this, took up the quarrel, and diving to the 
bottom of the sea, where her palace lay, killed her after a fierce fight. Later 
on <I>Beowulf </I>was made regent of Gothland, and afterwards king, and he 
reigned for about forty years. He was poisoned by the fangs of a dragon during a 
mighty struggle, and died from the effects.- He was. buried on a hill named 
Hronesnas, and was deeply mourned by his people.</P><B>

<P>Berigard</B> <B>of</B> <B>Pisa</B> : Alchemist. (<B>1579</B> ? - 
<B>1664</B>). Owing to his residing for many years at Pisa, this alchemist is 
commonly known by the appellation given above: but in reality he was not an 
Italian but a Frenchman, and his name was <I>Claude Guillermet de Berigard, 
</I>or, as it is some-times spelt, <I>Beauregard. </I>The date of his birth is 
uncertain, some authorities assigning it to <B>1579</B>, and others placing it 
considerably later; but they are agreed in saying that Moulins was his native 
town, and that, while a young man, he evinced a -keen love for science in its 
various branches, and began to dabble in alchemy. He appears to have studied for 
a while at the Sorbonne, at Paris; and, having acquired some fame there on 
account of his erudition, he was appointed professor of natural philosophy at 
the University of Pisa. This post he held until the year <B>1640</B>, whereupon 
he was assigned an analogous position at Padua, and it was probably in the 
latter town that his death occurred in <B>1664</B>. His. most important 
contribution to scientific literature is <I>Dubitationes in Dialogum Ealilaei 
pro Terrae immobilitate, </I>a quarto published at Florence in <B>1632</B>;<B> 
</B>but he was likewise author of <I>Circulus Pisanus, </I>issued at Udine in 
<B>1643</B>, wherein he concerns himself chiefly with commenting on Aristotle's 
ideas on physics. <I>Berigarde's </I>writings are virtually forgotten nowadays, 
but they are interesting as documents illustrating the progress of scientific 
knowledge throughout the seventeenth century.</P><B>

Bea-Methodius, a contraction for <I>Beatus Methodivo, </I>which was misprinted 
&quot;Bermechobus.&quot; The work is of the nature of a prophetic Apocalypse, 
and foretells the history of the world. It was handed down by the Gnostics and 
was printed in the <I>Liber Mirabilis </I>(q.v.). There are no grounds, however. 
for the supposition that the work should be referred to either of the saints 
above mentioned. It recounts how Seth sought a new country in the east and came 
to the country of the initiates, and how the children of Cain instituted a 
system of black magic in India. The author identifies the Ishmaelites with those 
tribes who overthrew the Roman power, and tells of a powerful northern people 
whose reign will be over-turned by Anti-Christ. A universal kingdom will 
thereafter be founded, governed by a prince of French blood, after which a 
prolonged period of justice will supervene. </P><B>

<P>Bezoar</B> : (red). A precious stone supposed to be possessed of magical 
properties, and found in the bodies of certain animals. At one time these stones 
would fetch ten times their weight in gold, being used as a remedy against 
poison and contagion; and for this purpose they were both taken internally, and 
worn round the neck. It is said that there are nine varieties of <I>bezoar 
</I>differing greatly in composition; but they may be generally divided into 
those which consist mainly of mineral and those which consist of organic matter. 
A strange origin was assigned to this stone by some of the early naturalists. It 
is said that the oriental stags when oppressed with years fed upon serpents, 
which renewed their youth. In order to counteract the poison which was absorbed 
into their system, they plunged into a running stream keeping their heads only 
above water. This caused a viscous fluid to be distilled from their eyes, which 
was indurated by the heat of the sun, and formed the <I>bezoar.</I></P><B>

<P><STRONG>Bible of the Devil :</STRONG> This was without doubt a grimoire 
(q.v.) or some such work. But Delancre says that the Devil informed sorcerers 
that he possessed a bible consisting of sacred books, having a theology of its 
own, which was dilated upon by various professors. One great magician, continues 
Delancre, who was brought before the Parliament of Paris, avowed that there 
dwelt at Toledo sixty-three masters in the faculty of Magic who took for their 
text-book the Devil's Bible.</P><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Bibliomancy</B> : A method of discovering whether or not a person was 
innocent of sorcery, by weighing him against the great Bible in the Church. If 
the person weighed less than the Bible, he was

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Bifrons</B> : A demon of monstrous guise who, according to Wierius, often 
took the form of a man well versed in Astrology and planetary influences. He 
excels in geometry, is acquainted with the virtues of herbs, precious stones and 
plants, and it is said that he is able to transport corpses from one place to 
another. He is also the one who lights the strange corpse-lights above the tombs 
of the dead. Twenty six of the infernal regions obey his behests.</P><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Bigois</B> <B>or</B> <B>Bigotis</B> : A sorcerer of Tuscany who, it is said, 
composed a learned work on the nature of prognostications, especially those 
connected with thunder and lightning. The book is said to be irretrievably lost. 
It is thought that <I>Bigois </I>is the same as Bagoe (q.v.), a sibly of

battle in Hell on the occasion of the marriage of Cerberus with Cardine (Paris, 
<B>1595</B> and '<B>597</B>.) It is a satire on the demonography of the times. 
Didot reprinted the work in <B>1793</B>. The author was a nephew of a Chancellor 
of France, Rene de Biragues.</P><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Birds</B> : It is a common belief among savage tribes that the souls of the 
dead are conveyed to the land of the hereafter by <I>birds. </I>Among some West 
African peoples, for instance, a <I>bird </I>is bound to the body of the 
deceased and then sacrificed, so that it may carry the man's soul to the 
after-world. The Bagos also offer up a <I>bird </I>on the corpse of a deceased 
person for the same reason. The South Sea Islanders, again, bury their dead in 
coffins shaped like the <I>bird </I>which is to bear away their spirits, while 
the natives of Borneo represent Tempon-Telon's Ship of the Dead (q.v.) as having 
the form of a <I>bird. </I>The Indian tribes of North-West America have rattles 
shaped like ravens, with a large face painted on the breast. The probable 
significance is that the raven is to carry the disembodied soul to the region of 
the sun.</P><B>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Black</B> <B>Magic </B>: Middle Ages. <I>Black Magic </I>as practised in 
medieval times may be defined as the use of supernatural knowledge for the 
purposes of evil, the invocation of diabolic and infernal powers that they may 
become the slaves and emissaries of man's will; in short, a perversion of 
legitimate mystic science. This art and its attendant practices can be traced 
from the time of the ancient Egyptians and Persians, from the Greeks and Hebrews 
to the period when it reached its apogee in the Middle Ages, thus forming an 
unbroken chain; for in medieval magic may be found the perpetuation of the 
popular rites of paganism - the ancient gods had become devils, their mysteries 
orgies, their worship sorcery.</P>
<P>Some historians have tried to trace the areas in Europe most affected by 
these devilish practices. Spain is said to have excelled all in infamy, to have 
plumbed the depths of the abyss. The south of France next became a hotbed of 
sorcery, whence it branched northwards to Paris and the countries and islands 
beyond, southward to Italy, finally extending into the Tyrol and Germany.</P>
<P>In <I>Black Magic </I>human perversity found the means of ministering to its 
most terrible demands and the possible attainment of its darkest imaginings. To 
gain limitless power over god, demon and man; for personal aggrandisement and 
glorification; to cheat, trick and mock; to gratify base appetites; to aid 
religious bigotry and jealousies ; to satisfy private and public enmities; to 
further political intrigue; to encompass disease, calamity and death-these were 
the ends and aims of <I>Black Magic </I>and its followers.</P>
<P>So widespread, so intense was the belief in the Powers of Evil that it may 
truly be said the Devil reigned supreme, if the strength and fervour of a 
universal fear be weighed against the weak and wavering manifestations of love 
and goodwill, peace and charity enjoined by religion in the worship of God.</P>
<P>Under the influence of this belief the world became to the mind and 
imagination of man a place of dread. At set of sun, at midnight, in twilight of 
dawn and eve, the legions of evil were abroad on their mission of terror. A 
running stream, a lake, or thick forest, held each its horde of malevolent 
spirits lying in wait for the lonely wayfarer, while the churchyard close to the 
House of God, the place of the gallows away from the habitation of man, the 
pestilential marsh, wilderness and mysterious cavern, the barren slopes and 
summits of mountains, were the dread meeting-places of the Devil and his 
myrmidons, the scenes of their infamous orgies, the temples of their blasphemous 
rites.</P>
<P>And the night was troubled by evil and ominous winds blowing from the 
Netherworld, heavy with the beating of the innumerable wings of the birds of 
ill-omen presaging woe; the darkness was faintly lit by the flitting 
phosphorescent forms of sepulchral larvae, waiting to batten on the souls arid 
bodies of man; of stryges infesting the tombs and desecrating the dead; of 
incubi and succubi surrounding the homes of the living to bring dishonour and 
madness to sleeping man and woman and beget monstrous and myriad life of 
ravenous vampires in search of victims for their feast of blood. Moon and stars 
might illumine the darkness, but in their beams were spells and enchantments, in 
their rising and waning the inexorable workings of Fate, while against their 
light could be seen the dishevelled or naked forms of warlock and witch passing 
overhead to their diabolical Sabbaths. The familiar happenings and actions of 
life might be nothing but the machinations of sorcery-to eat and drink might be 
to swallow evil; to look upon beauty in any form, the sesame to malign 
influence; to laugh, but to echo infernal mockery and mirth.</P>
<P>In this fruitful soil of superstition and grotesque ignorance, <I>Black Magic 
</I>sowed and reaped its terrible harvest of evil, persecution, madness and 
death. Such a state of mind must, of necessity, have induced a weakness of will 
and imagination specially prone to the influence of hypnotic suggestion by a 
stronger 'sill, and even more ready to fall an easy prey to self-hypnotism, 
which must have often been the result of such an atmosphere of foreboding and 
dread.</P>
<P>The simplest ailments or most revolting diseases, catalepsy and somnambulism, 
hysteria, and insanity, all these were traced to the power of <I>Black Magic, 
</I>caused through the conjurations of sorcery. It followed that curative 
medicine was also a branch of magic, not a rational science, the cures being 
nothing if not fantastic in the last degree-incantations and exorcisms, amulets 
and talismans of precious stones, metals or weird medicaments rendered powerful 
by spells; philtres and enchanted drinks, the cure of epilepsy by buried 
peach-blossoms, and though in the use of herbs and chemicals was laid the 
foundation of the curative science of to-day, it was more for their enchanted 
and symbolic significance that they were pre scribed by the magicians.</P>
<P>History shows us that the followers of the Black Art swarmed everywhere. In 
this fraternity as in others there were grades, from the pretenders, charlatans 
and diviners of the common people, to the various secret societies and orders of 
initiates, amongst whom were kings and queens, and popes, dignitaries of church 
and state, where the knowledge and ritual were carefully cherished and preserved 
in manuscripts, some of which are extant at the present day, ancient grimoires 
(q.v.), variously termed the Black, the Red, the Great Grimoire, each full of 
weird rites, formulae and conjurations, evocations of evil malice and lust in 
the names of barbaric deities; charms and bewitchments clothed in 
incomprehensible jargon, 'and ceremonial processes for the fulfillment of 
imprecations of misfortune, calamity, sin and death.</P>
<P>The deity who was worshipped, whose powers were invoked in the practice of 
<I>Black Magic, </I>was the Source and Creator of Evil, Satanas, Belial, the 
Devil, a direct descendant of the Egyptian Set, the Persian Ahriman, the Python 
of the Greeks, the Jewish Serpent, Baphomet of the Templars, the Goat-deity of 
the Witches' Sabbath. He was said to have the head and legs of a goat, and the 
breasts of a woman.</P>
<P>To his followers he was known by many names, among these being debased names 
of forgotten deities, also the Black One, the Black He-goat, the Black Raven, 
the Dog, the Wolf and Snake, the Dragon, the Hell-hound, Hell-hand, and 
Hell-bolt. His transformations were unlimited, as is indicated by many of his 
names; other favourite and familiar forms were a cat, a mouse, a toad, or a 
worm, or again, the human form, especially as a young and handsome man when on 
his amorous adventures. The signs by which he might be identified, though not 
invariably, were the cloven hoof, the goat's beard, cock's feathers, or ox's 
tail.</P>
<P>In all his grotesquery are embedded ancient mysteries and their symbols, the 
detritus of dead faiths and faded civilizations. The Greek Pan with the goat 
limbs masquerades as the Devil, also the goat as emblematic of fire and symbol 
of generation, and perhaps traces of the Jewish tradition where two goats were 
taken, one pure, the other impure, the first offered as sacrifice in expiation 
of sin, the other, the impure burdened with sins by imprecation and driven into 
the wilderness, in short, the scapegoat. In the Hebrew Kabala, Satan's name is 
that of Jehovah reversed. He is not a devil, but the negation of deity.</P>
<P>Beneath the Devil's sway were numberless hordes and legions of demons and 
spirits, ready and able to procure and work any and every evil or disaster the 
mind of man might conceive and desire. In one Grimoire it tells of nine orders 
of evil spirits, these being False Gods, Lying Spirits, Vessels of Iniquity, 
Revenge led by Asmodeus, Deluders by the Serpent, Turbulents by Merigum, Furies 
by Apollyon, Calumniators by Astaroth, and Tempters by Mammon. These demons 
again are named separately, the meaning of each name indicating the possessor's 
capacity, such as destroyer, devastator, tumult, ravage, and so forth.</P>
<P>Again each earthly vice and calamity was personified by a demon, Moloch, who 
devours. infants; Nisroch, god of hatred, despair, fatality; Astarte, Lilith and 
Astaroth, deities of debauchery and abortion; Adramelek, of murder, and Belial, 
of red anarchy.</P>
<P>According to the Grimoires, the rites and rules are multifarious, each demon 
demanding special invocation and procedure. The ends that may be obtained by 
these means are sufficiently indicated in the headings of the chapters : To take 
possession of all kinds of treasure; to live in opulence; to ruin possessions to 
demolish buildings and strongholds; to cause armed men to appear; to excite 
every description of hatred, discord, failure and vengeance; to excite tempests; 
to excite love in a virgin, in a married person; to procure adulteries; to cause 
enchanted music and lascivious dances to appear; to learn all secrets from those 
of Venus to Mars; to render oneself invisible; to fly in the air and travel; to 
operate under water for twenty-four hours; to open every kind of lock without a 
key, without noise and thus gain en-trance to prison, larder or charnel-house; 
to innoculate the walls of houses with plague and disease; to bind familiar 
spirits; to cause a dead body to revive to transform one's self; to transform 
men into animals or animals into men.</P>
<P>These rites fell under the classification of divination, bewitchments and 
necromancy. The first named was carried out by magical readings of fire, smoke, 
water or blood; by letters of names, numbers, symbols, arrangements of dots; by 
lines of hand or finger nails; by birds and their flight or their entrails; by 
dice or cards, rings or mirrors.</P>
<P>Bewitchments were carried out by means of nails, animals, toads or waxen 
figures and mostly to bring about suffering or death. In the first method nails 
were consecrated to evil by spells and invocations, then nailed crosswise above 
the imprint of the feet of the one who is destined for torment. The next was by 
selection of some animal supposed to resemble the intended victim and attaching 
to it some of his 'lair or garments. They gave it the name and then proceeded to 
torture it, in whole or part according to the end desired, by driving nails, 
red-hot pins and thorns into the body to the rhythm of muttered maledictions. 
For like purpose a fat toad was often selected, baptised, made to swallow a 
host, both consecrated and execrated, tied with hairs of the victim upon which 
the sorcerer had previously spat, and finally buried at the threshold of the 
bewitched one's door, whence it issued as nightmare and vampire for his 
undoing.</P>
<P>The last and most favoured method was by the use of waxen images. Into the 
wax was mixed baptismal oil and ash of consecrated hosts, and out of this was 
fashioned a figure resembling the one to be bewitched. It was then baptised, 
receiving the persons name in full; received the Sacraments, and next subjected 
to curses, torture by knives or fire; then finally stabbed to the heart. It was 
also possible to bewitch a person by insufflation, breathing upon them, and so 
causing a heaviness of their will and corresponding compliance to the 
sorcerer.</P>
<P>Necromancy (q.v.) was the raising of the dead by evocations and sacrilegious 
rites, for the customary purposes of evil. The scene of operation might be about 
pits filled with blood and resembling a shambles, in a darkened and suffocating 
room, in a churchyard or beneath swinging gibbets, and the number of ghosts so 
summoned and galvanized into life might be one of legion.</P>
<P>For whatever end, the procedure usually included profanation of Christian 
ritual, such as diabolical masses and administration of polluted sacraments to 
animals and reptiles ; bloody sacrifices of animals, often of children; of 
orgiastic dances, generally of circular formation, such as that of the Witches' 
Sabbath in which undreamed-of evil and abominations, all distortions and 
monstrosities of reality and imagination took part, to end in a nightmare of 
obscene madness.</P>
<P>For paraphernalia and accessories the sorcerers scoured the world and the 
imagination and mind of man, bending all things, beautiful or horrible to their 
service. The different planets ruled over certain objects and states and 
invocations, for such were of great potency if delivered under their auspices. 
Mars favoured wars and strife, Venus love, Jupiter ambition and intrigue, Saturn 
malediction and death.</P>
<P>Vestments and symbols proper to the occasion must be donned. The electric 
furs of the panther, lynx and cat added their quota of influence to the 
ceremonial. Colours also must be observed and suitable ornaments. For operations 
of vengeance the robe must be the hue of leaping flame, or rust and blood, with 
belt and bracelets of steel, and crown of rue and wormwood. Blue, Green and Rose 
were the colours for amorous incantations; whilst for the encompassing of death 
black must be worn, with belt of lead and wreath of cypress, amid loathsome 
incense of sulphur and assafoetida.</P>
<P>Precious stones and metals also added their influence to the spells. 
Geometrical figures, stars, pentagrams, columns, triangles, were used; also 
herbs, such as belladonna and assafoetida; flowers, honeysuckle, being the 
witches' ladder, the arum, deadly nightshade and black poppies; distillations 
and philtres composed of the virus of loathsome diseases, venom of reptiles, 
secretions of animals, poisonous sap and fungi and fruits, such as the fatal 
manchineel, pulverised flint, impure ashes and human blood. Amulets and 
talismans were made of the skins of criminals, wrought from the skulls of hanged 
men, or ornaments rifled from corpses and thus of special virtue, or the pared 
nails of an executed thief.</P>
<P>To make themselves invisible the sorcerers used an unguent compounded from 
the incinerated bodies of new-born infants and mixed with the blood of 
night-birds. For personal preparation a fast of fifteen days was observed. When 
that was past, it was necessary to get drunk every five days, after sundown, on 
wine in which poppies and hemp had been steeped.</P>
<P>For the actual rites the light must be that of candles made from the fat of 
corpses and fashioned in the form of a cross; the bowls to be of skulls, those 
of parricides being of greatest virtue; the fires must be fed with cypress 
branches, with the wood of desecrated crucifixes and bloodstained gibbets; the 
magic fork fashioned of hazel or almond, severed at one blow; the ceremonial 
cloth to be woven by a prostitute, whilst round about the mystic circle must be 
traced with the embers of a polluted cross. Another potent instrument of magic 
was the mandragore to be unearthed from beneath gallows where corpses are 
suspended, by a d<B>6</B>g tied to the plant. The dog is killed by a mortal blow 
after which its soul will pass into the fantastic root, attracting also that of 
the hanged man.</P>
<P>The history of the Middle Ages is shot through with the shadows cast by this 
terrible belief in <I>Black Magic. </I>Machinations and counter-machinations in 
which church and state, rich and poor, learned and ignorant were alike involved 
; persecutions and prosecutions where the persecutor and judge often met the 
fate they dealt to the victim and condemned-a dreadful phantasmagoria and 
procession where we may find the haughty Templars, the blood-stained Gilles de 
Laval, the original of Bluebeard; Catherine de Medici and Marshals of France; 
popes. princes and priests. In literature also we find its trace, in weird 
legends and monstrous tales: in stories of spells and enchantments; in the tale 
of Dr. Faustus and his pact with the Devil, his pleasures and their penalty when 
his soul must needs pass down to Hell in forfeit; we may find its traces in lewd 
verses and songs. Art, too, yields her testimony to the infernal influence in 
pictures, sculptures and carvings, decorating palace and cathedral; where we may 
find the Devil's likeness peeping out from carven screen and stall, and his 
demons made visible in the horde of gargoyles grinning and leering from niche 
and corner, and clustering beneath the 
eaves.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; K.

<P>Black</B> <B>Mass</B> : It is known from the confessions of witches sorcerers 
that the devil also has mass said at his Sabbath. Pierre Aupetit, an apostate 
priest of the village of Fossas, in Limousine, was burned for having celebrated 
the mysteries of the Devil's mass. Instead of speaking the holy words of 
consecration the frequenters of the Sabbath said: &quot;Beelzebub, Beelzebub, 
Beelzebub.&quot; The devil in the shape of a butterfly. flew round those who 
were celebrating the mass, and who ate a black host, which they were obliged to 
chew before swallowing.</P><B>

should be set to hatch one of its own eggs, and that during the process a hood 
should be drawn over its eyes so that it cannot see. It is also to be placed in 
a box lined with black material. The chick thus hatched will have a particular

<P>Blake,</B> <B>William : </B>(<B>1757</B>-<B>1927</B>) Poet, Mystic. Painter 
and Engraver. is one of the most curious and significant figures in the whole 
history of English literature, and a man who has likewise exerted a wide 
influence on the graphic arts. He was born in London on the <B>29</B>th of 
November, <B>1757</B>. It would seem that his parents and other relatives were 
bumble folk, but little is known definitely about the family while their 
ancestry is a matter of discussion. Mr. W. B. Yeats, who is an ardent devotee of 
<I>Blake, </I>and has edited his writings, would have it that the poet was of 
Irish descent but though it is true that the name <I>Blake </I>is common in 
Ireland to this day, especially in Galway, Mr. Yeat's contention is not 
supported by much trustworthy evidence, and it is contradicted by Mr. Martin J. 
Blake in his genealogical work, <I>Blake Family Records.</P>
<P>William </I>manifested aesthetic predilections at a very early age, and his 
father and mother did not discourage him herein, but offered to place him in the 
studio of a painter. The young man demurred however, pointing out that the 
apprenticeship was a costly one, and saying generously that his numerous 
brothers and Sisters should be considered, and that it was not fair that the 
family's exchequer should be impoverished on his behalf. Thereafter engraving 
was suggested to him as a profession, not just because it necessitated a less 
expensive training than painting, but also as being more likely than the latter 
to yield a speedy financial return; and accepting this offer, <I>Blake </I>went 
at the age of fourteen to study under James Basire, an engraver whose plates are 
but little esteemed to-day, yet who enjoyed considerable reputation while alive, 
and was employed officially by the Society of Antiquaries. Previous to this a 
more noted manipulator of the burin, William Ryland, a protege of George III, 
bad been suggested as one who would probably give a capital training to the boy: 
but the latter, on being taken to see Ryland, evinced a strong dislike for him, 
and refused stoutly to accept his teaching, declaring that the man looked as 
though born to be hanged. And it is interesting to note that the future artist 
of the <I>Prophetic Books </I>was right, for only a few years later Ryland was 
convicted of forgery, and forfeited his life in consequence.</P><I>
<P>Blake </I>worked under Basire for seven years, and during the greater part of 
his time the pupil was engaged mainly in doing drawings of Westminster Abbey, 
these being destined to illustrate a huge book then in progress, the 
<I>Sepulchral Monuments </I>of Richard. Gough. It is said that <I>Blake </I>was 
chosen by his master to go and do these drawings not so much because he showed 
particular aptitude for draughtmanship. as because he was eternally quarrelling 
with his fellow-apprentices: and one may well believe, indeed, that the young 
artist was convinced of his superiority to his <I>confreres, </I>and made 
enemies by failing to conceal this conviction, Whilst at the Abbey. <I>Blake 
</I>asserted that he saw many visions. In <B>1779</B>, he entered the Royal 
Academy School, then recently founded: and here he continued his studies under 
George Moser, a chaser and enameller who engraved the first great seal of George 
III. Yet it was not to Moser that the budding visionary really looked for 
instruction, he was far more occupied with studying prints after the old 
masters, especially Michael Angelo and Raphael; and one day Rosa found him 
engaged thus, reproved him kindly but firmly, and told him he would be acting 
more wisely if he took Charles le Brun as his exemplar. He even hastened to show 
the pupil a volume of engravings after that. painter, so redolent. always of the 
worst tendencies of le <I>grand siecle; </I>and, with this incident in mind, it 
may be assumed that <I>Blake </I>was deeply grateful when, a little later he had 
shaken off the futile shackles of the Royal Academy. and began to work on his 
own account. He had to work hard, however, for meanwhile his affections had been 
engaged by a young woman, Catherine Boucher, and funds were of course necessary 
ere it was possible for the pair to marry. But <I>Blake </I>slaved manfully with 
his burin, engraving illustrations for magazines and the like; and in 
<B>1792</B> he had his reward, his marriage being solemnized in that year. His 
wife's name indicates that she was of French origin. and it would be interesting 
to know if she was related to Francois Boucher. or to the fine engraver of the 
French Empire, Boucher - Desnoyers; but waiving these speculations, it is 
pleasant to recall that the marriage proved a singularly happy one, <I>Blake's 
</I>spouse clinging to him lovingly throughout all his troubles and privations, 
and ever showing a keen appreciation of his genius. As regards Catherine's 
appearance there still exists a small pencil-drawing by <I>Blake, </I>commonly 
supposed to be a portrait of his wife; and it shows a. slim, graceful woman, 
just the type of woman predominating in <I>Blake's </I>other pictures ; so it 
may be presumed that she frequently acted as his model, or-for <I>Blake </I>had 
no fondness for drawing from nature- that her appearance gradually crystallised 
itself in his brain, and thus transpired in the bulk of his works.</P>
<P>After his marriage <I>Blake </I>took lodgings in Green Street, Leicester 
Fields; and feeling, no doubt, that engraving was but a poor staff for a married 
man to lean upon, he opened a print shop in Broad Street. He made many friends 
at this period, the most favoured among them being Flaxman, the sculptor; and 
the latter introduced him to Mr. Matthew, a clergyman of artistic tastes, who, 
manifesting keen interest in the few poems which <I>Blake </I>had already 
written, generously offered to defray the cost of printing them. The writer 
gladly accepted the offer and the result was a tiny volume, <I>Poetical Sketches 
</I>by W. B. Thus encouraged, <I>Blake </I>gave up his printselling business, 
while simultaneously he went to live in Poland Street, and soon after this 
removal he published his <I>Songs of Innocence, </I>the letterpress enriched by 
designs from his own hand. Nor was this the only remarkable thing about the 
book, for the whole thing was printed by the author himself, and by a new method 
of his own invention-a method which can scarcely be detailed here owing to lack 
of space, but which the reader will find described adequately in Mr. Arthur 
Hind's monumental <I>History of Engraving and Etching. Blake </I>lived in Poland 
Street for five years, and during this time he achieved and issued <I>The Book 
of Thel, The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, </I>and the first book of <I>The 
French Revolution. </I>In <B>1792</B> he removed to Hercules Buildings, Lambeth; 
and while staying here he war forced by dire poverty to do much commercial work, 
notably a series of illustrations to Young's <I>Night Thoughts, </I>yet he found 
leisure for original drawing and writing also, and to this period of his life 
belong the <I>Gates of Paradise </I>and <I>Songs of Experience. </I>In a while 
he tired of London however, and so he went to Felpham, near Bognor, in Sussex, 
taking a cottage there hard by where Aubrey Beardsley was to live at a later 
date, and here he composed <I>Milton, Jerusalem, </I>and a large part of the 
<I>Prophetic Books, </I>while he made a new friend, William Hayley, who 
repeatedly aided him with handsome presents of money. The Sussex scenery, beside 
- afterwards to inspire Whistler and Conder-appealed keenly to the poet, and in 
one of his lyrics he exclaims</P>
<P>&quot;Away to sweet Felpham, for Heaven is there,&quot; while to Flaxman he 
wrote :-&quot;Felpham is a sweet place for study, because it is more spiritual 
than London. Heaven opens here on all sides her golden gates; her windows are 
not obstructed by vapours, voices of celestial inhabitants are more distinctly 
heard, and their forms more distinctly seen, and my cottage is also a shadow of 
their houses.</P>
<P>Yet <I>Blake </I>tired of Sussex as he had tired of his former home, and in 
<B>1903</B> he returned to London, taking a house in South Bolton Street. Here 
again he endured much poverty, and was then forced into doing illustrations to 
Virgil, and also a series of designs for Blair's <I>Grave; </I>but later his 
financial horizon was brightened by help from John Linnell, the landscape 
painter, and shortly after-wards the artist did some of his finest things, for 
instance his <I>Spiritual Portraits, </I>and his drawings for <I>The Book of 
Job, </I>while after completing these he commenced illustrating the <I>Divine 
Comedy </I>of Dante. In <B>1921</B> he again changed his home, taking up his 
abode now in Fountain Court, Strand, and here he continued to work at the Dante 
drawings; but only seven of them were ever published, for <I>Blake's </I>health 
was beginning to fail, his energies were slackening, and he died in 
<B>1927</B>.</P>
<P>Sixteen years before his death <I>Blake </I>held a public exhibition of his 
drawings, engravings, illustrations and the like; and the affair was treated 
with haughty disdain, the only paper which saw fit to print a criticism being 
<I>The Examiner, </I>edited by Leigh Hunt. It is customary for <I>BIake's 
</I>idolators of to-day to attempt to heap scorn on those who thus expressed 
callousness towards his work, and to vituperate more particularly the many 
people among his contemporaries who showed him frank antagonism, but is not all 
this noisy blaming of his bygone enemies and critics unnecessarily severe? For 
it must be borne in mind that the artist came as a complete novelty, the 
mysticism permeating his pictures having virtually no parallel in English 
painting prior to his advent. And it should be remembered, too, that <I>Blake 
</I>as a technician has many grave limitations; and limitations which must have 
been exasperating to people accustomed to the art of that amazing century which 
begot masters like Ramsay, Gainsborough and Romney, Watteau and Fragonard, De la 
Tour and Clodion, all of them producing works eminently graceful and 
pre-emenently decorative. Now comparing him to any of there men, <I>Blake's 
</I>modelling appears sadly timid and amateurish, as witness his drawing of 
himself, or his copy of Laurence's portrait of Cowper; while passing to his 
draughtsmanship, this is frequently inaccurate, and nowhere embodies the fluency 
and charming rhythm reflected by nearly all the artists aforesaid. His colour 
again is often thin and tawdry; while as to his composition, he is admirable 
only on very rare occasions, the incontestable truth being that, in the bulk of 
his pictures, the different parts have little or no relation to one another. 
This is true especially of those of his works which include a vast assembly of 
figures, yet even in various others of simpler cast this lack of anything like 
arrangement is equally paramount, and to choose an example, one need only look 
at &quot;The Door of Death&quot; in <I>America. </I>This is two pictures rather 
than one, and the spectator's gaze wanders from side to side, fretted and 
bewildered.</P>
<P>It were injustice to <I>Blake </I>himself, to omit noting these technical 
flaws in his workmanship, yet it were no less unjust, if not actually 
ridiculous, to write at any length contrasting him with the other masters of his 
century; for his outlook and intention were wholly different from theirs, and, 
lacking their charm and decorative value, he transcends these men withal in 
divers respects. He is a prince among mystics, his finest drawings are flushed 
with weirdness and mystery, and he reincarnates visions and phantasies as no one 
else has done in line and colour, not even Rosetti. For <I>Blake </I>contrived 
to remain a child throughout the whole of his life, and so, for him, dreams were 
an actuality, the things he saw in his trances were real and living, and he 
perpetuated all these things with just that obvious and definite symbolism which 
a child would naturally use. When he wants to express &quot;Vain Desires' he 
draws a man trying to reach the stars with the aid of an enormous ladder; in the 
&quot;Resurrection of the Dead&quot; he delineates actual bodies soaring 
heavenwards, and when his topic is morning, he shows a nude form shining from 
the dusky mountain tops; while for <I>Blake </I>&quot;The Door of Death&quot; is 
an actual stone portal, and when illustrating the text in Job, &quot;With dreams 
upon my bed Thou scarest me,&quot; he is not content to depict a sleeper with a 
frightened expression on his face, but draws all around the sleeper the 
imaginary horrors which tormented him - serpents, chains, and distorted human 
creatures. Now in the hands of most men all this sort of thing would yield 
nothing but the laughable, yet somehow <I>Blake's </I>drawings, even those which 
are weakest technically, invariably possess just that curious air of distinction 
which is the dominant characteristic of all truly great pictures. In fine, he 
expressed the outlook of a child with a sublime mastery never vouchsafed to 
children.</P>
<P>If <I>Blake </I>the draughtsman and illustrator was a fierce iconoclast, 
turning his back resolutely on the styles current in his time, most assuredly 
<I>Blake </I>the poet, enacted a kindred <I>role, </I>evincing a sublime 
contempt for the trammels of Augustanism, and thus making straight the way for 
Burns, for Wordsworth, and for the divine Shelley. Yet just as Burns was tinged 
slightly by the typical failings of the pastoral century, so also <I>Blake 
</I>would seem to have found it difficult originally to break his shackles: for 
occasionally one finds him employing expletives, and this suggests that at first 
he thought with Pope and his school that verse is futile unless precise; while 
some of his pictures of child life in <I>Songs of Innocence </I>are unduly 
pretty and idyllic, almost as idyllic as the scenes in Goldsmith's <I>Deserted 
Village. </I>Unlike Lowry and Mr. Kenneth Grahame those exquisite adepts in the 
delineation of children, <I>Blake </I>shows only one side of child-life : for 
his children are nearly all out for a holiday, they are seldom vexed, or cross, 
or angry, and their eyes are hardly ever dim with tears. At least, however, they 
are prone to dream dreams and see visions: and it is significant that, in one 
poem, the writer describes a child unto whom are revealed things hidden from his 
</P>
<P>father's eyes :-</P>
<P>Father, O father! what do we here,</P>
<P>In this land of unbelief and fear ?</P>
<P>The land of dreams is better far</P>
<P>Above the light of the morning star.&quot;</P>
<P>That verse and many others besides, charm at once by a fusion of complete 
naturalness with rare beauty: and the genius of <I>Blake </I>in his earlier 
poems is really this, that with the simple language of childhood, and out of the 
simple events of child-life, he makes a noble and enduring art-an art, charged 
as surely as his own drawings with an air of distinction.</P>
<P>Had <I>Blake </I>contented himself with writing his <I>Poetical Sketches, 
</I>his <I>Songs of Innocence </I>and the subsequent <I>Songs of Experience, 
</I>the charge of madness could not well have been levelled at him by his 
contemporaries. It was his later writings like <I>The Book of Thel </I>and the 
<I>Prophetic Books </I>which begot this imputation, for in these later poems the 
writer casts his mantle of simplicity to the winds, he sets himself to give 
literary form to visions, and he is so purely spiritual and ethereal, so far 
beyond the realm of normal human speech, that mysticism frequently devolves into 
crypticism. His rhythm, too, is often so subtle that it hardly seems rhythm at 
all; yet even in his weirdest flights <I>Blake </I>is still the master, he still 
embodies that curious something which differentiates great art from the rank and 
file of asthetic products. And if, as observed before, the colouring in many of 
his water-colour drawings is sadly thin and poor, the very reverse is true, and 
true abundantly of the poems written towards the close of his life. Glowing and 
gorgeous tones are omnipresent in these, they have the barbaric pomp of 
Gautier's finest prose, the glitter and opulence of Berlioz&rsquo; or Wagner's 
orchestration, nay the richness and splendour of a sunset among towering 
mountains.</P>
<P>No account of <I>Blake </I>would be complete without some account of the 
literature which has grown up around his name, a literature whereof many items 
are more than worthy of the topic they celebrate. The earliest systematic 
biography of the master is that by Alexander Gilchrist, <B>1963</B>, a book, the 
more valuable inasmuch as it contains many reproductions of <I>Blake's 
</I>drawings, notably the whole of the Job set : and since Gilchrist's day the 
artist's life has been rewritten by Alfred I. Story, <B>1993</B>, and by Edwin 
J. Ellis, <B>1907</B>, while his letters have been collected and annotated by 
Frederick Tatham, <B>1906</B>. Much interesting and important matter concerning 
<I>Blake </I>is contained in <I>The Life and Letters of Samuel Palmer, by </I>A. 
W. Palmer, <B>1992</B> in <I>A Memoir of Edward Calvert </I>by Samuel Calvert, 
<B>1993</B>, and in <I>The Life of John Linnell </I>by A. T. Story, <B>1992</B>, 
while as regards critical studies of the master, perhaps the best is Swinburne's 
eloquent tribute, <B>1969</B>, and further works of note are those of Richard 
Garnett, Mr. Arthur Symons and M. Basil de Selincourt. The student should also 
consult <I>Ideas of Good and Evil </I>by W. B. Yeats, <B>1903</B>, and <I>The 
Rosetti Papers </I>by W. M Rossetti, <B>1903</B>, while he will find it 
advisable to look also at an edition of the <I>Job </I>illustrations containing 
an able introduction by Mr. Laurence Binyon, <B>1906</B>. To speak finally of 
editions of <I>Blake's </I>own writings these are of course numerous, but the 
only one which is really complete is that edited by E. J Ellis, 
<B>1906</B>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<P>Blavatsky, Helena Petrovna :</B> was born at Ekaterinoslav Russia, on the 
<B>31</B>st of July, <B>1931</B>. She was the daughter of Colonel Peter Hahn, a. 
member of a Mecklenburg family settled in Russia. She married, at the age of 
seventeen Nicephore Blavatsky, a Russian official in Caucasia, a man very much 
older than herself. Her married life was of short duration as she separated from 
her husband in a few months. The next year or so she occupied chiefly in 
travelling, Texas Mexico, Canada and India, were each in turn the scene of her 
wanderings, and she twice attempted to enter Tibet. on one occasion she managed 
to cross its frontier in disguise but lost her way, and after various adventures 
was found by a body of horsemen and escorted homewards. The period between 
<B>1949</B> and <B>1959</B>, she described as the&quot; veiled&quot; time of her 
life, refusing to divulge anything that happened to her in these ten years, save 
stray allusions to a seven years' stay in Little and Great Tibet, or in a &quot; 
Himalayan Retreat.&quot; In <B>1959</B> she returned to Russia, where she soon 
achieved distinction as a spiritualistic medium. Later on she went to the United 
States where she remained for six years, and became a naturalised citizen. She 
became prominent in spiritualistic circles in America about <B>1970</B>. It was 
there that she founded her school of Theosophy. The idea occurred to her of 
combining her spiritualistic control&quot; with Buddhistic legends about Tibetan 
sages, and she professed to have direct &quot;astral&quot; communication with 
two Tibetan mahatmas.</P>
<P>With the aid of Col. Henry Olcott, she founded in New York, in <B>1975</B>, 
the Theosophical Society with a threefold aim: <I>(<B>1</B>) </I>to form a 
universal brotherhood of man; (<B>2</B>) to study and make known the ancient 
religions, philosophies and sciences (<B>3</B>) to investigate the laws of 
nature and develop the divine powers latent in man. In order to gain converts to 
Theosophy she was obliged to appear to perform miracles. This she did with a 
large measure of success, but her &quot;methods&quot; were on several occasions 
detected as fraudulent. Nevertheless her commanding personality secured for her 
a large following, and when she died, in <B>1991</B>, she was at the head of a 
large body of believers in her teaching, numbering about <B>100</B>,<B>000</B> 
persons.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<P>Bodin, Jean :</B> a jurisconsult and student of demonology, who died of the 
plague in <B>1596</B>. An Angevin by birth, he studied law in youth and 
published his <I>Republique, </I>which La Harpe calls &quot; the rerm of the 
spirit of law,&quot; but it is his <I>Demonomanie des Sorciers </I>by which he 
is known to occultists. In this work he defended sorcery, but propagated 
numerous errors. By his <I>Colloquium heptaplomeron de abdites rerum sublimium 
varcanus </I>he aroused very unfavourable opinions regarding his religious 
views. In it. he discusses in the form of dialogue the theological opinions of 
Jews, Mussulmans, and deists to the disadvantage of the Christian faith, and 
although he died a Catholic he professed in his time the tenets of 
Protestantism, Judaism, sorcery, atheism and deism. The <I>Demonomanie </I>was 
published in Paris, in <B>1591</B>, and again under the title of <I>Fleau des 
demons et des sorciers </I>at Wiort, in <B>1616</B>. In its first and second 
books Bodin demonstrates that spirits have communication with mankind, and 
traces the various characteristics and forms which distinguish good spirits from 
evil. He unfolds the methods of diabolic prophecy and communication, and those 
of evocation of evil existences of pacts with the Devil, of journeys through the 
air to the sorcerers' Sabbath, of infernal ecstasies, of spells by which one may 
change himself into a werewolf, and of carnal communion with incubi and succubi. 
The third book speaks of the manner of preventing the work of sorcerers and 
obviating their charms and enchantments, and the fourth of the manner in which 
sorcerers may be known. He concludes his study by refuting the work of John Wier 
or Wierius (q.v.) who, he asserts, was in error in believing sorcerers to be 
fools and people of unsound mind, and states that the books of that author 
should be burned &quot;for the honour of God.&quot;</P>
<P>Sir Walter Scott says: <I>&quot;Bodin, </I>a lively Frenchman, explained the 
zeal of Wierius to protect the tribe of sorcerers from punishment, by stating 
that he himself was a conjurer and the scholar of Cornelius Agrippa, and might 
therefore well desire to save the lives of those accused of the same league with 
Satan. Hence they threw on their antagonists' the offensive names of 
witch-patrons and witch-advocates, as if it were impossible for any to hold the 
opinion of Naudseus, Wierius, Scot, etc., without patronizing the devil and the 
witches against their brethren of mortality. Assailed by such heavy charges, the 
philosophers themselves lost patience, and retorted abuse in their turn, calling 
<I>Bodin, Delrio</I>, and others who used their arguments, witch-advocates, and 
the like, as the affirming and defending the existence of the crime seemed to 
increase the number of witches, and assuredly augmented the list of executions. 
But for a certain time the preponderance of the argument lay on the side of the 
Demonologists.</P><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Boehme, Jakob:</B> (<B>1575</B>-<B>1624</B>) : German Mystic. The name of 
this illustrious mystic and philosopher, who has excited so wide and lasting an 
influence, is sometimes spelt <I>Beem </I>or <I>Behm, Behmon </I>or <I>Behmont, 
</I>while commoner still is the form used at the head of this article; but it is 
probable that <I>Jakob's </I>name was really <I>Bohme, </I>for that spelling 
savours far more of bygone Germany than any of the multifarious others do. Born 
in <B>1575</B>, at Altsteidenberg, in Upper Lusatia, the philosopher came of 
humble peasant stock, and accordingly his education consisted in but a brief 
sojourn at the village school of Seidenberg, about a mile from his own home, 
while the greater part of his childhood was spent in tending his father's flocks 
on the grassy sides of a mountain, known as the Landskrone. This profession 
doubtless appealed to a boy of speculative and introspective temperament, but 
betimes it transpired that <I>Jakob </I>was not strong enough physically to make 
a good shepherd, and consequently he left home at the age of thirteen, going to 
seek his fortune at Gorlitz, the nearest town of any size.</P>
<P>To this day Gorlitz is famous for its shoemakers, while in <I>Boehme's 
</I>time it was a very centre and stronghold of the cobbling industry; so it was 
to a cobbler that the boy went first in search of employment, and very soon he 
had found what he wanted. Unfortunately, the few authentic records of his career 
offer little information concerning his early years, but apparently he prospered 
tolerably well, it being recorded that in <B>1599</B> he became a 
master-shoemaker, and that soon afterwards he was married to Katharina, daughter 
of Hans Kantzschmann, a butcher. The young couple took a house near the bridge 
in Neiss Voistadt -their dwelling is still pointed out to the tourist-and some 
years later <I>Boehme </I>sought to improve his business by adding gloves to his 
stock in trade, a departure which sent him periodically to Prague to acquire 
consignments of the goods in question.</P>
<P>It is likely that <I>Boehme </I>began to write soon after becoming a 
master-cobbler, if not even at an earlier period, but it was not till he was 
approaching forty that his gifts became known and appreciated. About the year 
<B>1612</B>, he composed a philosophical treatise, <I>Aurora, oder die 
Morgenrote un Aufgang, </I>and, though this was not printed till much later, 
manuscript copies were passed from hand to hand, the result being that the 
writer soon found himself the centre of a local circle of thinkers and scholars, 
many of them people far above him in the social scale. These did not say that 
the cobbler should stick to his last, but realised that his intellect was an 
exceptionally keen one:</P>
<P>and <I>Boehme </I>would no doubt have proceeded to print and publish his work 
but for an unfortunate occurrence, just that occurrence which has always been 
liable to harass the man of bold and original mind. In short, a charge of heresy 
was brought against him by the Lutheran Church; he was loudly denounced from the 
pulpit by Gregorius Richter, pastor primarius of Gorlitz, and anon, the town 
council, fearing to contend with the omnipotent ecclesiastical authorities, took 
possession of the original manuscript of <I>Boehme's </I>work, and bade the 
unfortunate author desist from writing in the meantime. So far as can be 
ascertained, he obeyed instructions for a little while, perhaps fearing the 
persecution which would await him if he did otherwise, but by <B>1619</B> he was 
busy again, compiling polemical and expository treatises; while in <B>1622</B>, 
he wrote certain short pieces on repentance, resignation, and the like. These 
last were the only things from his pen which were published in book form during 
his lifetime, and with his consent, nor were they of a nature likely to excite 
clerical hostility; but a little later <I>Boehme </I>circulated a less cautious 
theological work, <I>Der Weg zu Christa, </I>and this was the signal for a fresh 
outburst of hatred on the part of the church, Richter storming from his pulpit 
once again. The philosopher, however, contrived to go unscathed, and, during a 
brief sojourn at Dresden, he had the pleasure of listening to sundry orations 
made in his praise by some of his admirers, whose number was now greatly 
increased, But <I>Boehme </I>was not destined to survive this triumph long, for, 
struck down by fever at Dresden, he was carried with great difficulty to his 
home at Gorlltz, and there he died in <B>1624</B>, his wife being absent at the 
time</P><I>
<P>Boehme's </I>literary output divides itself easily and naturally into three 
distinct sections, and indeed he himself observed this, and drew up a sort of 
specification wherein he virtually indicated his successive alms. At first he 
was concerned simply with the study of the deity, and to this period belongs his 
<I>Aurora; </I>next he grew interested in the manifestation of the divine in the 
structure of the world and of man, a predilection which resulted in four great 
works, <I>Die Drei Principien Gottlichens Wes<SUB> </SUB>Wescus, Vom Dreifachen 
Leben der Menschen, Von der Menschwerdung Christi, </I>and <I>Von der Geburt and 
Bezlichnung Aller Wescu; </I>while finally, he devoted himself to advanced 
theological speculations and researches, the main outcome being his <I>Von 
Christi Testamenten </I>and his <I>Von der Chadenwahl: Mysterium Magnum. 
</I>Other notable work&quot; from his hand, are his seven <I>Quellgeister, 
</I>and likewise his study of the three first properties of eternal nature, a 
treatise in which some of his ardent devotees have found Sir Adam Newton's 
formulae anticipated, and which certainly resembles Schelling's <I>Theogonische 
Natur.</I></P>
<P>Alchemist or not himself, <I>Boehme&rsquo;s </I>writings demonstrate that he 
studied Paracclsas closely, while they also reflect the influence of Valentine 
Weigel, and of the earliest protestant mystic, Kaspar Schwenhfeld. Nor was it 
other than natural that the latter should appeal keenly to the philosopher of 
Gorlitz, he too being essentially a stout Protestant, and having little or 
nothing in common with the mystics of other forms of Christianity. That is to 
say, he is seldom or never dogmatic, but always speculative, true Teuton that he 
was; while his writings disclose none of those religious ecstasies which <I>fill 
</I>the pages of Santa Theresa, and he never talks of holding converse with 
spirits or angels, or with bygone saints; he never refers to miracles worked on 
his behalf, practically the one exception being a passage where he tells how, 
when a shepherd boy on the Landskrone, he was vouchsafed an apparition of a pail 
of gold. At the same time, he seems to have felt a curious and constant intimacy 
with the invisible world, he appears to have had a strangely perspicacious 
vision of the <I>Urgrund, </I>as he calls it, which is, being literally 
translated, primitive cause; and it was probably his gift in these particular 
ways, and the typically German clearness with which he sets down his ideas and 
convictions, which chiefly begot his vast and wide influence over subsequent 
people inclined to mysticism. Throughout the latter half of the seventeenth 
century, his works were translated into a number of different languages, and 
found a place in the library of nearly every broadminded English theologian; 
while they proved a great and acknowledged source of inspiration to William Law, 
the author of <I>Christian Perfection </I>and <I>A Serious Call to a Devout 
Life. </I>Since then, various religious bodies, regarding <I>Boehme </I>as their 
high priest, have been founded in Great Britain and in Holland ; while in 
America, too, the sect known as Philadelphians owe their dominant tenets to the 
mystic of Gorlitz. W. S. B-M.</P><B>

boggart, bogle (Scotland), boggle, ho-guest, bar-guest, boll, boman, and bock. 
Bull-beggar is probably a form of bu and bogey allied to boll (Northern), an 
apparition.</P><B>

<P>Boguet Henri :</B> Grand Justice of the district Saint Claude, in Burgundy, 
who died in <B>1619</B>.<B> </B>He was the author of a work full of peurile and 
ferocious zeal against sorcerers. This book, published at the commencement of 
the seventeenth century, was latterly burnt because of the inhumanities which 
crowded its pages. It is entitled <I>Discours des sorciers, </I>with many 
instructions concerning how to judge sorcerers and their acts. It is, in short, 
a compilation of procedures, at the majority of which the author has himself 
presided, and which exhibit the most incredible absurdities and criminal 
credulity. In its pages we discover the proceedings against the unfortunate 
little Louise Maillat, who at the age of eight was possessed of eight demons, of 
Francoise Secretain, a sorceress, who had meetings with the said demons, and who 
had the Devil for her lover, and of the sorcerers Gros-Jacques and Willirmoz. 
Claude Gailiard and Roland Duvernois and many others figure in the dreadful role 
of the sanguinary author's dread judgments. <I>Boguet </I>details the horrible 
doings of the witches' Sabbath, how the sorcerers caused hail to fall of which 
they made a powder to be used as poison, how they used an unguent which carried 
them to the Sabbath, how a sorcerer was enabled to slay whom he would by means 
of a mere breath, and how, when arraigned before a judge they cannot shed tears. 
He further enlarges on the Devil's mark which was found on the skins of these 
unfortunates, of how all sorcerers and magicians possess the power of changing 
their forms into those of wolves, and how, for these offences they were burnt at 
the stake without sacrament, so that they were destroyed body and soul. The work 
terminates with instructions to judges of cases of sorcery, and is often known 
as the <I>Code des Sorciers.</I></P><B>

<P>Boh</B> : A magical word greatly used to frighten children. a Greek word is 
synonymous with the Latin</P>
<P>&quot;Clamor signifying our English&quot; cry;&quot; and it is possible that 
the cry of the ox &quot;boo' may have suggested this exclamation, as this sound 
would quite naturally be very terrifying to a young child. One also suspects 
some connection between this monosyllable and the &quot; Bogle-boe' or 
&quot;bwgwly&quot; of Welsh people. According to Warton, it was the name of a 
fierce Gothic general, whose name like those of other great conquerors was 
remembered as a word of terror.</P><B>

<P>Bonati</B> : A Florentine astrologer who flourished in the thirteenth 
century. H lived in a most original manner, and perfected the art of prediction. 
When the army of Martin IV, beseiged Forli, a town of the Romagna, defended by 
the Count of Montferrat, Bonati announced to the Count that he would succeed in 
repulsing the enemy, but that he would be wounded in the fray. The event 
justified his prediction, and the Count who had taken with him the necessary 
materials to staunch his wound in case the prophecy came true, became a devout 
adherent of astrology. <I>Bonati </I>became a Franciscan towards the close of 
his life, and died in <B>1300. </B>His works were published by Jacobus Cauterus 
under the title of Liber Astronomicus, at Augsberg. in <B>1491.</B></P><B>

<P>Boniface</B> <B>VIII</B>., <B>Pope</B> : who gained an unenviable notoriety 
in Dante's <I>Inferno </I>has been regarded by many as an exponent of the black 
art, and so romantic are the alleged magical circumstances connected with him 
that they are worthy of repetition. <I>Boniface, </I>a noted jurisconsult, was 
born at Anagni. about <B>1229, </B>and was elected Pope in <B>1294. </B>He was a 
sturdy protagonist of papal supremacy, and before he had been seated two years 
on the throne of St. Peter he quarrelled seriously with Phillippe le Bel, King 
of Prance, whom he excommunicated. This quarrel originated in the determination 
of the king to check in his own dominions the power and insolence of the church 
and the ambitious pretensions of the see of Rome. In <B>1303, </B>Phillippe's 
ministers and agents, having collected pretended evidence in Italy, boldly 
accused <I>Boniface </I>of heresy and sorcery, and the king called a council at 
Paris to hear witnesses and pronounce judgment. The pope resisted, and refused 
to acknowledge a council not called by himself; but the insults and outrages to 
which he was exposed proved too much for him, and he died the same year, in the 
midst of these vindictive proceedings. His enemies spread abroad a report. that 
in his last moments he had confessed his league with the demon, and that his 
death was attended with &quot;so much thunder and tempest, with dragons flying 
in the air and vomiting flames, and such lightning and other prodigies, that the 
people of Rome believed that the whole city was going to be swallowed up in the 
abyss.&quot; His successor, Benedict XI. undertook to defend his memory but he 
died in the first year of his pontificate (in <B>1304</B>), it was said by 
poison, and the holy see remained vacant during eleven months. In the middle of 
June, <B>1305</B>, a Frenchman, the archbishop of Bordeaux, was elected to the 
papal chair under the title of Clement V. </P>
<P>It was understood that Clement was raised to the papacy Boniface in a great 
measure by the king's influence, who is said to have stipulated as one of the 
conditions, that he should allow the proceedings against <I>Boniface, </I>which 
were to make his memory infamous. Preparations were again made to carry on the 
trial of <I>Boniface, </I>but the king's necessities compelled him to seek other 
boons of the supreme pontiff, in consideration of which he agreed to drop the 
prosecution, and at last, in <B>1312, </B><I>Boniface </I>was declared in the 
council of Vienne, innocent of all the offences with which he had been 
charged.</P>
<P>If we may place any faith at all in the witnesses who were adduced against 
him, <I>Boniface </I>was at bottom a freethinker, who concealed under the mitre, 
the spirit of mockery which afterwards shone forth in his country-man Rabelais, 
and that in moments of relaxation, especially among those with whom he was 
familiar, he was in the habit of speaking in bold-even in cynical-language, of 
things which the church regarded as sacred. Persons were brought forward who 
deposed to having heard expressions from the lips of the pope, which, if not 
invented or exaggerated, savour of infidelity, and even of atheism. Other 
persons deposed that it was commonly reported in Italy, that <I>Boniface </I>had 
communication with demons, to whom he offered his worship, whom he bound to his 
service by necromancy, and by whose agency be acted. They said further, that he 
had been heard to hold conversation with spirits in the night; that he had a 
certain &quot;idol&quot; in which a &quot;diabolical spirit&quot; was enclosed, 
whom he was in the habit of consulting; while others said he had a demon 
enclosed in a ring which he wore on his finger. The witnesses in general spoke 
of these reports only as things which they had heard; but one a friar, brother 
Bernard de Sorano, deposed, that when <I>Boniface </I>was a cardinal, and held 
the office of notary to Nicholas III., he lay with the papal army before the 
castle of Puriano, and he (brother Bernard) was sent to receive the surrender of 
the castle. He returned with the cardinal to Viterbo, where he was lodged in the 
palace Late one night, as he and the cardinal chamberlain were looking out of 
the window of the room he occupied, they saw Benedict of Gaeta (which was 
<I>Boniface&rsquo;s </I>name before he was made pope) enter a garden adjoining 
the palace, alone, and in a mysterious manner. He made a circle on the ground 
with a sword, and placed himself in the middle, having with him a cock, and a 
fire in an earthen pot <I>(in quadam olla terrea). </I>Having seated himself in 
the middle of the circle, he killed the cock and threw its blood in the fire, 
from which smoke immediately issued, while Benedict read in a certain book to 
conjure demons. Presently brother Bernard heard ,' great noise <I>(rumorem 
magnum) </I>and was much terrified. Then he could distinguish the voice of some 
one saying &quot;Give us the share,&quot; upon which Benedict took the cock, 
threw it out of the garden, and walked away without uttering a word. Though he 
met several persons on his way, he spoke to nobody, but proceeded immediately to 
a chamber near that of brother Bernard, and shut himself up. Bernard declared 
that, though he knew there was nobody in the room with the cardinal, he not only 
hear( him talking all night, but lie could distinctly perceive strange voice 
answering him.</P><B>

<P>Bonnevault</B>, <B>Pierre</B> <B>:</B> A sorcerer of Poitou in the 
seventeenth century, who was arrested as he was on his way to the Devil's 
Sabbath. He confessed that on the first occasion he had been present at that 
unholy meeting he had been taken thither by his parents and dedicated to the 
Devil, to whom he had promised to leave his bones after death but that he had 
not bargained to leave his infernal majesty his immortal soul. He admitted that 
he called Satan master, that the Enemy of Man had assisted him in various 
magical acts, and that he, <I>Bonnevault, </I>had slain various persons through 
Satanic agency. In the end he was condemned to death. His brother Jean, accused 
of sorcery at the same time, prayed to the Devil for assistance, and was raised 
some four or five feet from the ground and dashed back thereon, his skin turning 
at the same time to a blue-black hue. He confessed that he had met at the 
Sabbath a young man through whom he had promised one of his fingers to Satan 
after his death. He also told how he had been transported through the air to the 
Sabbath, how he had received powders to slay certain people whom he named, and 
for these crimes he received the punishment of death.</P><B>

<P>Bonnevault</B>, <B>Maturin</B> <B>de</B> : Father of the preceding also 
accused of sorcery, visited by experts who found upon his right shoulder a mark 
resembling a small rose, and when a long pin was thrust into this he displayed 
such signs of distress that it was judged that he must be a sorcerer, indeed, he 
confessed that he had espoused Berthomee de la Bedouche, who with her father and 
mother practised sorcery, and how he had gone to seek serpents and toads for the 
purposes of their sorceries. He said that the Sabbath was held four times 
yearly, at the feasts of Saint John the Baptist, Christmas, Mardi gras and 
Paques. He had slain seven persons by sorcery, and avowed that he had been a 
sorcerer since he was seven years of age. He met a like fate with his 
sons.</P><B>

<P>Book of the Dead:</B> An arbitrary title given to an Egyptian funerary work 
called <I>pert em hru, </I>the proper translation of which is: &quot;coming 
forth by day,&quot; or ' manifested in the light.&quot; There are several 
versions or recensions of this work, namely those of Heliopolis, Thebes and 
Sais, these editions differing only inasmuch as they were edited by the colleges 
of priests founded at these centres. Many papyri of the work have been 
discovered, and passages from it have been inscribed upon the walls of tombs and 
pyramids. and on sarcophagi and mummy-wrappings. It is undoubtedly of extremely 
early date: how early it would indeed be difficult to say with any exactness, 
but in the course of centuries it was greatly added to and modified. In all, 
about <B>200</B> chapters exist, but no papyrus has been found containing. all 
these. The chapters are quite independent of one another, and were probably all 
composed at different times. The main subject of the whole is the beatification 
of the dead, who were supposed to recite the chapters in order that they might 
gain power and enjoy the privileges of the new life.</P>
<P>The work abounds in magical references, and it is its magical side alone 
which we can consider here. The whole trend of the <I>Book of the Dead </I>is 
thaumatmagic, as its purpose is to guard the dead against the dangers which they 
have to face in reaching the other world. As in most mythologies, the dead 
Egyptian had to encounter malignant spirits, and was threatened by many dangers 
before reaching his haven of rest. He had also to undergo judgment by Osiris, 
and to justify himself before being permitted to enter the realms of bliss. This 
he imagined he could in great part accomplish by the recitation of various 
magical formulae, and spells, which would ward off the evil influences opposed 
to him. To this end every Egyptian of means had buried with him a papyrus of the 
<I>Book of the Dead, </I>in which was contained at least all the chapters 
necessary to his encounter with such formidable adversaries as he would meet at 
the gates of Amenti (q.v.), the Egyptian Hades, and which would assist him in 
making replies during his ceremony of justification. First amongst these spells 
were the &quot;words of power&quot; <I>(See </I>&quot;Egypt&quot;). The 
Egyptians believed that to discover the&quot; secret&quot; name of a god was to 
gain complete ascendancy over him. Sympathetic magic was in vogue in Egyptian 
burial practice, for we find in Egyptian tombs of the better sort, paintings of 
tables laden with viands of several descriptions, the inscriptions attached to 
which convey the idea of boundless liberality. Inscriptions like the following 
are extremely common-&quot; To the <I>Ka </I>or soul of so-and-so, 
<B>5</B>,<B>000</B> loaves of bread, <B>500</B> geese. and <B>5</B>,<B>000</B> 
jugs of beer.&quot; Those dedications cost the generous donors little, as they 
merely had the objects named painted upon the wall of the tomb, imagining that 
their <I>kas </I>or astral counterparts would be eatable and drinkable by the 
deceased. This of course is merely an extension of the neolithic savage 
conception that articles buried with a man had their astral counterparts and 
would be of use to him in another world.</P>
<P>Pictorial representation played a considerable part in the magical ritual of 
the <I>Book of the Dead. </I>One of the pleasures of the dead was to sail over 
Heaven in the boat of Ra, and to secure this for the deceased one must paint 
certain pictures and mutter over them words of power. On this, Budge in his 
<I>Egyptian Magic </I>says &quot;On a piece of clean papyrus a boat is to be 
drawn with ink made of green <I>abut </I>mixed with <I>anti </I>water, and in it 
are to be figures of Isis, Thoth, Shu, and Khepera, and the deceased; when this 
had been done the papyrus must be fastened to the breast of the deceased, care 
being taken that it does not actually touch his body. Then shall his spirit 
enter into the boat of Ra each day, and the god Thoth shall take heed to him, 
and he shall sail about with him into any place that he wisheth. Elsewhere it is 
ordered that the boat of Ra be painted 'in a pure place,' and in the bows is to 
be painted a figure of the deceased; but Ra was supposed to travel in one boat 
(called Atet) until noon, and another (called Sektet) until sunset, and 
provision had to be made for the deceased in both boats. How was this to be 
done? On one side of the picture of the boat a figure of the morning boat of Ra 
was to be drawn, and on the other a figure of the afternoon boat; thus the one 
picture was capable of becoming two boats, And, provided the proper offerings 
were made for the deceased on the birthday of Osiris, his soul would live for 
ever, and he would not die a second time. According to the rubric to the chapter 
in which these directions are given, the text of it is as old, at least, as the 
time of Hesepti, the fifth king of the <B>1</B>st. dynasty, who reigned about 
B.C. <B>4350</B>, and the custom of painting the boat upon papyrus is probably 
contemporaneous. The two following rubrics from Chapters CXXXIII. and CXXXIV., 
respectively, will explain still further the importance of such pictures</P>
<P>&quot;<B>1</B>. ' This chapter shall be recited over a boat four cubits in 
length. and made of green porcelain (on which have been painted) the divine 
sovereign chiefs of the cities; and a figure of heaven with its stars shall be 
made also, and this thou shalt have made ceremonially pure by means of natron 
and incense. And behold, thou shalt make an image of Pa in yellow colour upon a 
new plaque and set it at the bows of the boat. And behold, thou shalt make an 
image of the spirit which thou dost wish to make perfect (and place it) in this 
boat, and thou shalt make it to travel about in the boat (which shall be made in 
the form .of the boat) of Ra; and he shall see the form of the god Ra himself 
therein. Let not the eye of any man whatsoever look upon it, with the exception 
of thine own self, or thy father, or thy son, and guard (this) with great care. 
Then shall the spirit be perfect in the heart of Ra, and it shall give unto him 
power with the company of the gods; and the gods shall look upon him as a divine 
being like unto themselves; and mankind and the dead shall fall down upon their 
faces. and he shall be seen in the underworld in the form of the radiance of 
Ra.'</P>
<P>&quot;<B>2</B>. 'This chapter shall be recited over a hawk standing and 
having the white crown upon his head, (and over figures of) the gods Tem, Shu, 
Tefnut, Seb, Nut, Osiris, Isis, Suti, and Nephthys, painted in yellow colour 
upon a new plaque, which shall be placed in (a model of) the boat (of Ra) along 
with a figure of the spirit whom thou wouldst make perfect. These thou shalt 
anoint with cedar oil, and incense shall be offered up to then' on the fire, and 
feathered fowl shall be roasted. It is an act of praise to Pa as he journeyeth, 
and it shall cause a man to have his being along with Ra day by day, 
whithersoever the god vayageth; and it shall destroy the enemies of Ra in very 
truth regularly and continually.'&quot;</P>
<P>It was understood that the words of power were not to be spoken until after 
death. They were &quot;a great mystery&quot; but &quot;the eye of no man 
whatsoever must see it, for it is a thing of abomination for every man to know 
it. Hide it, therefore, the Book of the Lady of the Hidden Temple is its 
name.&quot; This would seem to refer to some spell uttered by Isis-Hathor which 
delivered the god Ra or Horns from trouble, or was of benefit to him, and it is 
concluded that it may be equally efficacious in the case of the deceased.</P>
<P>Many spells were included in the <I>Book of the Dead </I>for the purpose of 
preserving the mummy against mouldering, for assisting the owner of the papyrus 
to become as a god and to be able to transform himself into any shape he 
desired. Painted offerings were also provided for him in order that he might 
give gifts to the gods. Thus. we see that the <I>Book of </I>the <I>Dead </I>was 
undoubtedly magical in its character, consisting as it did of a series of spells 
or words of power, which enabled the speaker to have perfect control over all 
the powers of Amenti. The only moment in which the dead man is not master of his 
fate is when his heart is weighed by Thoth before Osiris. If it does not conform 
to the standard required for justification, he is cast out; but this excepted, 
an absolute knowledge of the <I>Book of the Dead </I>safeguarded the deceased in 
every way from the danger of damnation. So numerous are the spells and charms 
for the use of the deceased, that to merely enumerate them would be to take up a 
good deal of space. A number of the chapters consist of prayers and hymns to the 
gods. but the directions as to the magical uses of the book are equally 
numerous. and the conception of supplication is mingled with the idea of 
circumvention by sorcery in the most extraordinary manner.</P><B>

<P>Born, Josephe-Francois:</B> An alchemistical imposter of the seventeenth 
century, born at Milan, in <B>1627</B>. In youth his conduct was so wayward that 
at last he was compelled to seek refuge in a church in dread of the vengeance of 
those whom. he had wronged. However, he speedily cloaked his delinquencies under 
the cloak of imposture and hypocrisy, and he pretended that God had chosen him 
to reform mankind and to re-establish His reign below. He also claimed to be the 
champion of the Papal power against all heretics and Protestants, and wore a 
wondrous sword which he alleged Saint Michael had presented him with. He said 
that he had beheld in heaven a luminous palm-branch which was reserved for him. 
He held that the Virgin was divine in nature, that she had conceived through 
inspiration, and that she was equal to her Son, with Whom she was present in the 
Eucharist, that the Holy Spirit was incarnate in her, that the second and third 
Persons of the Trinity were inferior to the Father. According to some writers 
<I>Born </I>proclaimed himself as the Holy Spirit incarnate. He was arrested 
after the death of Innocent X by order of the Inquisition, and on <B>3</B>rd of 
January, <B>1661</B>, condemned to be burnt as a heretic. But he succeeded in 
escaping to Germany where he received much money from the Queen Christina to 
whom he claimed that he could manufacture the Philosophers' Stone. He afterwards 
fled to Copenhagen, whence he wished to sail to Turkey. But he was tracked to a 
small village hard by and arrested along with a conspirator. He was sent back to 
Rome, where he died in prison, August <B>10</B>th, <B>1695</B>. He is the author 
of a work entitled, The Key of the Cabinet of the Chevalier Born (Geneva, 
<B>1691</B>) which is chiefly concerned with elementary spirits, and it is this 
work which the Abbe de Villars has given in an abridged form as the <I>Comte de

securing one of these fairies. First, take a broad square crystal or Venetian 
glass, about tree inches in breadth and length. Lay it in the blood of a white 
hen on three Wednesdays or three Fridays. Then take it and wash it with holy 
water and fumigate it. Then take three hazel sticks a year old; take the bark 
off them; make them long enough to write on them the name of the fairy or spirit 
whom you may desire three times on each stick, which must be fiat on one side. 
Bury them under some hill haunted by fairies on the Wednesday before you call 
her; and on the Friday following dig them out, and call her at night, or three, 
or ten o'clock, which are good times for this purpose. In order to do so 
successfully one must be pure, and face toward the East. When you get her, tie 
her to the glass.</P><B>

</I>predictions was published by the late Mr. Alexander Mackenzie, Inverness, 
the author of several clan histories. Many of these alleged foretellings are of 
a trivial character. The most important prophecies attributed to Coinneach 
(Kenneth) are those which refer to the house of Seaforth Mackenzies. One, which 
is supposed to have been uttered in the middle of the seventeenth century, 
foretold that the last of the Seaforths would be deaf. It was uttered at Brahan 
Castle, the chief seat of the Seaforths, near Dingwall, after the seer had been 
condemned to death by burning, by Lady Seaforth for some offensive remark. He 
declared to her ladyship that he would go to heaven, but she would never reach 
it. As a sign of this he declared that when he was burned a raven and a dove 
would hasten towards his ashes. If the dove was the first to arrive it would be 
proved his hope was well founded. The same legend is attached to the memory of 
Michael Scott-a rather suggestive fact. According to tradition, Kenneth was 
burned on Chanonry Point, near Fortrose. No record survives of this event. The 
first authentic evidence regarding the alleged seer, was unearthed by Mr. 
William M. Mackenzie, editor of <I>Barbour's Bruce, </I>who found among the 
Scottish Parliamentary records of the sixteenth century an order, which was sent 
to the Ross-shire authorities, to prosecute several wizards, including Coinneach 
Odhar. This was many years before there was a Seaforth. It is quite probable 
that Kenneth was burned, but the legendary cause of the tale must have been 
a&quot; filling in&quot; of late tradition. Kenneth's memory apparently had 
attached to it many floating prophecies and sayings including those attributed 
to Thomas and Michael Scott. The sayings of &quot;True Thomas&quot; were hawked 
through the Highlands in Gaelic chap books, and so strongly did the bard appeal 
to the imaginations of the eighteenth century folks of Inverness, that they 
associate him with the Fairies and Fingalians (Fians) of the local fairy mound, 
Tom-na-hurich. A Gaelic saying runs, &quot;When the horn is blown, True Thomas 
will come forth.&quot;</P>
<P>Thomas took the place of Fingal (Finn or Fionn) as chief of the &quot; Seven 
Sleepers&quot; in Tom-na-hurich, Inverness. At Cromarty, which was once 
destroyed by the sea, Thomas is alleged to have foretold that it would be thrice 
destroyed. Of course, the Rhymer was never in Cromarty and probably knew nothing 
about it. As he supplanted Fingal at Inverness, so at Cromarty he appear.&quot; 
to have supplanted some other legendary individual. The only authentic 
historical fact which remains is that Coinneach Odhar war a notorious wizard, 
and of mature years, in the middle of the sixteenth century. Wizards were not 
necessarily seers. It is significant that no reference is made to Kenneth in the 
letters received by Pepys from Lord Reay, regarding second-sight in the 
seventeenth century, or in the account of Dr. Johnson's Highland tour, although 
the learned doctor investigated the problem sympathetically.</P>
<P>In the Scottish Highlands no higher compliment could be paid to the memory of 
any popular man than to attribute to him the gift of &quot;second sight.&quot; 
Rev. John Morrison, minister of Petty, near Inverness, who was a bard, was one 
of the reputed seers of this order. Many of his&quot; wonderful sayings&quot; 
were collected long after his death. Rev. Dr. Kennedy, a Dingwall Free Church 
minister, and a man of strong personality and pronounced piety, is reputed to 
have had not only the &quot;gift of prophecy&quot; but also the &quot;gift of 
healing.&quot; He was himself a believer in &quot;second sight&quot; and stated 
that his father was able to foretell events. In his <I>The Days of the Fathers 
in Ross-shire </I>(<B>1961</B>), he makes reference to several individuals who 
were similarly &quot;gifted&quot; with what he believed to be a God-given power. 
One of his seers was reputed to have foretold the &quot;Disruption&quot; of the 
Church of Scotland about sixteen years before the event took place. By this time 
the seers had acquired the piety of the people who believed in them. Even the 
notorious Kenneth, the <I>Brahan seer </I>a Pagan and a wizard, became glorified 
by doubtful tradition, like the notorious Michael Scott, one of his 
prototype&quot;.</P>
<P>References to second sight in the Highlands are made in the following 
publications: Kirk's <I>Secret Commonwealth of Elves, Fauns and Fairies 
</I>Martin's <I>Western Isles of Scotland; Deuterosophia (Second Knowledge) or a 
Brief Discourse concerning Second Sight </I>by Rev. John Frazer (Edinburgh, 
Ruddiman, Aned and Co, <B>1763</B>), <I>Miscellanies </I>by John Aubrey, F.R.S 
(London, <B>1696</B>). That there is sufficient evidence to justify the serious 
investigation of &quot;Second sight&quot; phenomena in the Scottish Highlands, 
no doubt can remain. But that is no reason why the <I>Bra Ii an Seer&quot; 
</I>legends should be accepted as genuine, especially when it is found that 
Kenneth died before the Seaforth branch of the Mackenzies came into existence. 
Whoever foretold the fall of that house. it was certainly not the 
&quot;notorious wizard&quot; of the Scottish Parliamentary records. No doubt, 
Kenneth made himself notorious by tyrannizing over a superstitious people in the 
sixteenth century, and was remembered on that account. During his lifetime he 
must have been credited with many happenings supposed to have been caused by his 
spells. After his death he gathered an undeserved reputation for prophecy and 
piety by the snowball process-a not unfamiliar happening in the past of the 
Scottish Highlands, where Sir William Wallace, St. Patrick, St. Bean, and others 
were reputed to have been giants who flung glaciated boulders from hill-top to 
hill-top across wide glens and over lochs of respectable dimensions. DONALD

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Bridge of Souls : </B>The superstition that the souls of the dead sought the 
other world by means of a bridge is pretty widely disseminated. The Rev. S. 
Baring Gould in his <I>Book of Folklore </I>says: &quot;As peoples became more 
civilised and thought more deeply of the mystery of death, they conceived of, a 
place where the souls lived on, and being puzzled to account for the rainbow, 
came to the conclusion that it was a bridge by means of which spirits mounted to 
their abode above the clouds. The Milky Way was called variously the Road of the 
Gods or the Road of Souls. Among the Norsemen, after Odin had constructed his 
heavenly palace, aided by the dwarfs, he reared the bridge Bifrost, which men 
call the rainbow, by which it could be reached. It is of three colours; that in 
the middle is red, and is of fire, to consume any unworthy souls that would 
venture up the bridge. In connection with this idea of a bridge uniting heaven 
and earth, up which souls ascended, arose the custom of persons constructing 
bridges for the good souls of their kinsfolk, On runic grave-stones in Denmark 
and Sweden we find such inscriptions as these 'Nageilfr had this bridge built 
for Anund, his good son.' 'The mother built the bridge for her only son.' 
'Holdfast had the bridge constructed for Hame, his father, who lived in Viby.' 
'Holdfast had the road made for Igul and for Urn, his dear wife.' At 
Sundbystein, in the Uplands, is an inscription showing that three brothers and 
sisters erected a bridge over a ford for their father.</P>
<P>The bridge as a means of passage for the soul from this earth to eternity 
must have been known also to the Ancients for in the cult of Demeter, the 
goddess of Death, at Eleusis, where her mysteries were gone through, in order to 
pass at once aiter death into Elyisium, there was an order of Bridge 
priestesses; and the goddess bore the name of the Lady of the Bridge. In Rome 
also the priest was a bridge-builder pontifex., as he undertook the charge of 
souls. In Austria and parts of Germany it is still supposed that children's 
souls are led up the rainbow to heaven. Both in England and among the Chinese it 
is regarded as a sin to point with the finger at the bow. With us no trace of 
the idea that it is a <I>Bridge of Souls </I>remains. Probably this was thought 
to be a heathen belief and was accordingly forbidden, for children in the North 
of England <I>to </I>this day when a rainbow appears, make a cross on the ground 
with a couple of twigs or straws, &quot;to cross out the bow.&quot; The West 
Riding recipe for driving away a rainbow is &quot;Make a cross of two sticks and 
lay four pebbles on it, one at each end.&quot;</P><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Brig</B> <B>of Dread, The : </B>There is an old belief, alluded to by Sir 
Walter Scott, that the soul, on leaving the body, has to pass over the <I>Brig 
of Dread, </I>a bridge as narrow as a thread, crossing a great gulf. If the soul 
succeed in passing it he shall enter heaven, if he falls off he is lost.</P><B>

<P>British National Association of Spiritualists :</B> A society formed in 
<B>1973</B>, mainly through the instrumentality of Mr. Dawson Rogers, to promote 
the interests of spiritualism in Great Britain. It numbered among its original 
vice-presidents and members of council the most prominent spiritualists of the 
day-Benjamin Coleman, Mrs. Makdongall Gregory, Sir Charles Isham, Messrs. 
Jacken, Dawson Rogers. and Moreli Theobald, Drs. Wyld, Stanhope Speer. and many 
others-while many eminent people of other lands joined the association as 
corresponding members. The <I>B.N.A.S. </I>in <B>1992</B> decided to change its 
name to &quot;The Central Association of Spiritualists.&quot; Among its 
committees was one for systematic research into the phenomena of spiritualism, 
in which connection some interesting scientific experiments were made in 
<B>1979</B>. Early in <B>1992</B> conferences were held at the Association's 
rooms, presided over by Professor Barrett, which resulted in the formation of 
the Society for Psychical Research. Many members of the latter society were 
recruited from the council of the B.N.A.S., such as the Rev. Stainton Moses, Dr. 
George Wyld, Messrs. Dawson Rogers, and Morell Theobald. The <I>B.N.A </I>.S. 
was at first associated with the <I>Spiritualist, </I>edited by W. H. Harrison, 
but in <B>1979</B> the reports of its proceedings were transferred to 
<I>Spiritual Notes, </I>a paper which, founded in the previous year, came to an 
end in <B>1991</B>, as did also the <I>Spiritualist. </I>in the latter year 
Dawson Rogers founded <I>Light, </I>with which the society was henceforth 
associated. From the beginning of its career, the <I>B.N.A .<B>5</B>. </I>has 
held itself apart from religious and philosophical dogmatism, and has included 
among its members spiritualists of all sects and opinions.</P><B>

popular errors in a work entitled <I>Pseudodoxia Epadinium. </I>an essay on 
popular errors,-an examination of many circumstances in his time received as 
veritable facts, and which he proved to be false or doubtful. But frequently the 
learned author replaces one error by another, if on the whole his book is 
wonderfully accurate considering the date of its composition. The work is 
divided into seven books, the first of which deals with those errors which 
spring from man's love of the marvellous; the second, errors arising from 
popular beliefs concerning plants and metals, the third, absurd beliefs 
connected with animals; the fourth book treats of errors relative to man; the 
fifth, errors recorded by pictures; the sixth deals with cosmographical and 
historical errors; and the seventh, with certain commonly accepted absurdities 
concerning the wonders of the world. For the publication of this work he was

around tombs and the places of the dead. He enriches and renders eloquent those 
who serve him. Thirty legions of the infernal army obey his call. The demons who

that the corpse was placed thus in preparation for the resurrection, when the 
dead will rise with their faces towards the east. Others think this mode of 
burial is practised in imitation of the posture of prayer.</P><B>

<P>Burma :</B> A country east of India and south of China, and a province of 
British India, inhabited by an indigenous stock of Indo-Chinese type which 
originally migrated from Western China, at different periods, and which is now 
represented by three principal divisions, the Talaings, the Shans, and the Bama, 
or Burmese proper, although groups of several other allied races are found in 
the more remote portions of the country. The civilised part of the community, 
which, roughly speaking, is perhaps one half of the population, recognizes a 
religion the constituents of which are animism (q.v.) and Indian Brahmanic 
demonolatry, modified to some extent by Buddhistic influences, and this cult is 
steadily making progress in the less enlightened and outlying tribes. We have 
here to do only with that portion of the popular belief which deals with the 
more directly occult and with superstition, and we shall refrain from any 
description of Burmese religion proper which presents similar features to those 
cults from which it takes its origin, and which are fully described 
elsewhere.</P>
<P>The Burmese believe the soul immaterial and independent of the body, to which 
it is only bound by special attraction. It can quit and return to the body at 
will, but can also be captured and kept from returning to it. After death the' 
soul hovers near the corpse as an invisible butterfly, known as <I>leippya. 
</I>A witch or demon may capture the <I>leippya </I>while it wanders during the 
hours of sleep, when sickness is sure to result. Offerings are made to the 
magician or devil to induce him to release the soul. The Kachins of the Northern 
Hills of Burma believe that persons having the evil eye possess two souls, the 
secondary soul being the cause of the malign influence.</P><I>
<P>Belief in Spirits.-Belief </I>in spirits, mostly malign, is very general in 
<I>Burma, </I>and takes a prominent place in the religious belief of the people. 
The spirits of rain, wind and the heavenly bodies are in that condition of 
evolution which usually result' in their becoming full-fledged deities, with 
whom placation gives place to worship.</P>
<P>But the spirits of the forest are true demons with well-marked animistic 
characteristics. Thus the <I>nat </I>or <I>seiktha </I>dwells in every tree or 
grove. His nature is usually malign, but occasionally we find him the tutelar or 
guardian of a village. In any case he possesses a shrine where he may be 
propiatiated by gifts of food and drink. Several of these demoniac figures have 
almost achieved godhead, so widespread have their cults become, and Hmin Nat, 
Chiton, and Wannein Nat, may be instanced as fiends of power. the dread of which 
has spread across extensive districts. The <I>nats </I>are probably of Indian 
origin, and although now quite animistic in character may at one time have been 
members of the Hindu pantheon. Many spirit families such as the <I>Seikkaso, 
Akathaso, </I>and <I>Bommaso, </I>who inhabit various parts of the jungle trees, 
are of Indian origin. The fulfillment of every wish depends upon the <I>nats 
</I>or spirits, who are all powerful as far as man is concerned. They are 
innumerable. Every house' has its complement, who swarm in its several rooms and 
take up their abode in its hearth, door-posts, verandahs, and corners. The 
<I>nats </I>also inhabit or inspire wild beasts, and all misfortune is supposed 
to emanate from them. The Burmans believe' that the more materialistic dead 
haunt the living with a malign purpose. The people have a great dread of their 
newly deceased ancestors, whom they imagine to haunt. the vicinity of their 
dwellings for the purpose of ambushing them. No dead body may be carried to a 
cemetery except by the shortest route, even should this necessitate the cutting 
a hole in the wall of the house. The spirits of those who have died a violent 
death haunt the scene of their fatality. Like the ancient Mexicans <I>(See 
</I>Ciupipiltin), the Burmans have a great dread of the ghosts of women who have 
died in childbed. The Kachins believe such women to turn. into vampires 
<I>(swawmx) </I>who are accompanied by their children when these die with them. 
The spirits of children are often supposed to inhabit the bodies of cats and 
dogs. The Burmans are' extremely circumspect as to how they speak and act 
towards the inhabitants of the spirit-world, as they believe that disrespect or 
mockery will at once bring down upon them misfortune or disease. An infinite' 
number of guardian spirits is .included in the Burman demonological system, and 
these are chiefly supposed to be Brahmanic importations. These dwell in the 
houses like the evil <I>nats, </I>and are the tutelars of village communities, 
and even of clans. They are duly propitiated, at which ceremonies rice, beer, 
and tea-salad are offered to them. Women are employed as exorcists in a case of 
driving out the evil <I>nats, </I>but at the festivals connected with the 
guardian <I>nats </I>they are not permitted to officiate.</P><I>
<P>Necromancy and Occult </I>Medicine.-Necromancy is of general occurrence among 
the Burmese. The <I>weza </I>or wizards are of two kinds, good and evil, and 
these are again each subdivided into four classes, according to the materials 
which they employ, as, for example, magic squares, mercury or iron. The native 
doctors profess. to cure the diseases caused by witchcraft, and often specialise 
in various ailments. Besides being necromantic, medicine is largely 
astrological. There is said to be in Lower Burma a town of wizards at Kale 
Thaungtot on the Chindwin River, and many journey thence to have' the effects of 
bewitchment neutralised by its chief. Sympathetic magic is employed to render an 
enemy sick. Indian and native alchemy and cheiromancy are exceedingly rife. 
Noise is the universal method of exorcism, and in casc<B>3</B> of illness the 
patient is often severely beaten, the idea being that the fiend which possesses 
him is the sufferer.</P>
<P><I>Mediums and Exorcists.-The tumsa </I>or natsaw are magicians, diviners, or 
&quot;wise&quot; men and women who practise their arts in a private' and not in 
a hierophantic capacity among the' rural Burmans. The wise man physician who 
works in iron <I>(than weza) </I>is at the head of his profession, and sells 
amulets which guard the purchasers from injury. female mediums profess to be the 
spouses of certain <I>nats, </I>and can only retain their supernatural 
connection with a certain spirit so long as they are wed to him. With the 
exorcists training is voluntary and even perfunctory. But with the mediums it is 
severe and prolonged. Among the civilised Burmans. a much more exhaustive 
apprenticeship is demanded. Indeed a thorough and intricate knowledge of some' 
departments of magical and astrological practice is necessary to recognition by 
the brotherhood, the entire art of which is medico-magical. consisting of the 
exorcism of evil spirits from human beings and animals. The methods employed are 
such as usually accompany exorcism among all semi-civilised peoples, that is, 
dancing, flagellation of the afflicted person, induction of ecstasy, oblation to 
the' fiend in possession, and noise'.</P><I>
<P>Prophecy and Divination.-These </I>are purely popular <I>in Burma, </I>and 
not hierophantic, and in some measure are controlled by the use of the 
<I>Deitton, </I>an astrological book of Indian origin. The direction in which 
the blood of a sacrificed animal flows, the knots in. torn leaves, the length of 
a split bamboo pole, and the whiteness or otherwise' of a hard-boiled egg, serve 
among others as methods of augury. But by far the most important mode of 
divination in use in Burma is that by means of the' bones of fowls. It is indeed 
universal as deciding all the difficulties of Burmese existence. Those' wing or 
thigh bones in which the' holes exhibit regularity are chosen. Pieces of bamboo 
are inserted into these holes, and the resulting slant of the stick defines the 
augury. If the stick slants outwards it decides in favour of the measure under 
test, If it slants inwards, the omen is unfavourable. Other methods of 
divination are by the entrails of animals and by the contents of blown 
eggs.</P><I>
<P>Astrology.-Burmese </I>astrology derives both from Indian and Chinese' 
sources, and powerfully affects the entire people. Every Burman is fully aware 
from his private astrologer, of the' trend of his horoscope regarding the near 
future, and while active and enterprising on his lucky days, nothing will induce 
him to undertake any form of work should the day be' <I>pyatthadane </I>or 
ominous. The' <I>Bedinsaya, </I>or astrologers proper, practise a fully 
developed Hindu astrology, but they are few in number, and are practically 
neglected for the' rural soothsayers, who follow the Chinese system known as 
<I>Hpewan, </I>almost identical with the Taoist astrological tables of Chinese' 
diviners. From this system are' derived horoscope's, fortune's, happy 
marriage's, and prognostications regarding business affairs. But in practice' 
the' system is often confounded with the Buddhist calendar and much confusion 
results. The Buddhist calendar is in popular use', whilst the' <I>Hpewan </I>is 
purely astrological. Therefore' the Burman who is ignorant of the latter must 
perforce consult an astrologer who is able' to collate the two regarding his 
lucky and unlucky days. The' chief horoscopic influences are day of birth, day 
of the week, which is represented by the' symbol of a certain animal, and the 
position of the dragon's mouth to the terminal syllables of the day-names.</P>
<P>Magic.-Burmese magic consists in the' making of charms the' manufacture of 
occult medicine which will cause' hallucination, second sight, the prophetic 
state, invisibility, or invulnerability. It is frequently 
&quot;sympathetic.&quot; <I>(See </I>Magic) and overlaps into necromancy and 
astrology. It doe's not appear to be at all ceremonial, and is to a great extent 
unsophisticated, save where it has been influenced by Indian and Buddhist monks, 
who also draw on native sources to enlarge their own knowledge.</P>

<P>Busardier :</B> An alchemist of whom few particulars are on record. He' lived 
at Prague' with a noble Courtier. Falling sick and feeling the approach of 
death, he' sent a letter to his friend Richtausen, at Vienna, asking him to 
come' and stay with him during his last moments, Richtausen set out at once but 
on arriving at Prague found that <I>Busardier </I>was dead. On inquiring if the 
adept had left anything behind him the' steward of the nobleman with whom he' 
had lived stated that only some powder had been left which the' nobleman desired 
to preserve. Richtausen by some' means got possession- of the powder and took 
his departure. On discovering this the nobleman threatened to hang his steward 
if he' did not recover the powder. The steward surmising that no one but 
Richtausen could have taken the' powder, armed himself and set out in pursuit. 
Overtaking him on the road he' at the point of the pistol, made Richtausen hand 
over the' powder. Richtausen however contrived to abstract a considerable 
quantity. Richtausen knowing the' value' of the' powder presented himself to the 
Emperor Ferdinand, himself an alchemist, and gave him a quantity of the' powder. 
The Emperor assisted by his Mine Master, Count Russe', succeeded in converting 
three' pounds of mercury into gold by means of one grain of the powder. The 
Emperor is said to have commemorated the event by having a medal struck bearing 
the effigy of Apollo with the caduceus of Mercury and an appropriate' motto.</P>
<P>Richtausen was ennobled under the title of Baron Chaos. </P>
<P>Mr. A. E. White in his <I>Lives of the Alchemists </I>states that &quot;Among 
many transformations performed by the same' powder was one by the Elector of 
Mayence, in <B>1651</B>. He made' projections with all the' precautions possible 
to a learned and skilful philosopher. The powder enclosed in gum tragacanth to 
retain it effectually, was put into the wax of a taper, which was lighted, the' 
wax being then placed at the bottom of a crucet. These preparations were 
undertaken by the Elector himself. He poured four ounces of quicksilver of the 
wax, and put the whole' into a fire covered with charcoal above, below and 
around. Then they began blowing to the utmost, and in about half an hour on 
removing the coals, they saw that the melted gold was over red, the' proper 
colour being green. The baron said the matter was yet too high and it was 
necessary to put some silver into it. The Elector took some coins out of his 
pocket, put them into the melting pot, combined the liquefied silver with the 
matter in the crucet, and having poured out the whole' when in perfect fusion 
into a lingot, he found after cooling, that it was very fine gold, but rather 
hard, which was attributed to the lingot. On again melting, it became 
exceedingly soft and the Master of the Mint declared to His Highness that it was 
more than twenty-four carats and that he had never seen so fine a quality of the 
precious metal.&quot;</P>

<P><STRONG>Butter, Witches' :</STRONG> The devil gives to the witches of Sweden 
cats which are called carriers, because they are' sent by their mistresses to 
steal in the neighbourhood. The greedy animals on such occasions cannot forbear 
to satisfy their own appetite's. Sometimes they eat to repletion and are obliged 
to disgorge their stolen meal. Their vomit is always found in kitchen gardens, 
is of a yellow colour, and is called witches' butter.</P><B>
