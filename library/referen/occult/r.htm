<P>Rahu :</B> Whose name means &quot;the tormenter,&quot; is one of the Hindoo 
devils. He is worshipped as a means of averting the attacks of evil spirits ; 
and appears to be of a truly devilish character.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Rakshasa :</B> An Indian demon. In one of the Indian folk-tales he appears 
black as soot, with hair yellow as the lightning, looking like a thunder-cloud. 
He had made himself a wreath of entrails ; he wore a sacrificial cord of hair; 
he was gnawing the flesh of a man's head and drinking blood out of a skull. In 
another story these Brahma <I>Rakshasas </I>have formidable tusks, flaming hair, 
and insatiable hunger. They wander about the forests catching animals and eating 
them. Mr. Campbell tells a Mahrata legend of a master who became a 
<I>Brahmaparusha </I>in order to teach grammar to a pupil. He haunted a house at 
Benares, and the pupil went to take lessons from him. He promised to teach him 
the whole science in a year on condition that he never left the house. One day 
the boy went out and learned that the house was haunted, and that he was being 
taught by a ghost. The boy returned and was ordered by the preceptor to take his 
bones to Gaya, and perform the necessary ceremonies for the emancipation of his 
soul. This he did, and the uneasy spirit of the learned man was laid.</P>

<P>Raphael, the Angel :</B> In the prophecy of Enoch it is said that Raphael 
presides over the spirits of men.&quot; In the Jewish rabbinical legend of the

or the Lord of hosts, passes into the sphere of the sun, giving motion, heat and 
brightness to it..</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Rapping :</B> Phenomena of knockings or <I>rappings </I>have always 
accompanied poltergeistic disturbances, even before the commencement of the 
modern spiritualistic movement. Thus they were observed in the case of the 
Drummer of Tedworth&quot; (q.v.), the &quot;Cock Lane Ghost,&quot; and other 
disturbances of the kind, and also in the presence of various somnambules, such 
as the Seeress of Prevorst (q.v.). With the &quot; Rochester Rappings &quot;-the 
famous outbreak at Hydesville in <B>1848</B>, to which may be directly traced 
the beginning of modern Spiritualism-the phenomenon took on a new importance, 
rapidly increased to an epidemic, remained throughout the earlier stages of the 
movements the chief mode of communication with the spirits. Though it was 
afterwards supplanted to some extent by more elaborate and complicated 
phenomena, it continued, and still continues, to occupy a place of some 
importance among the manifestations of the seance-room. It is apparent from 
descriptions furnished by witnesses that the raps varied considerably both in 
quality and intensity, being sometimes characterised as dull thuds, sometimes as 
clear sounds like an electric spark, and again as deep, vibrating tones. 
Doubtless the methods by which they are produced vary quite as much. It has been 
shown, in fact, that raps may be produced by the ankle-joints, knee-joints, 
shoulders, and other joints, one man-the Rev. Eli Noyes - claiming to have 
discovered seventeen different methods. There are also instances on record where 
specially constructed medium &quot; tables were responsible for the 
manifestations. Besides the frankly spiritualistic explanation and the frankly 
sceptical one of fraud, there have been other scientific or pseudo-scientific 
theories advanced, such as electricity, odyle, ectenic force, or magnetism.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Rapport :</B> A mystical sympathetic or antipathetic connection between two 
persons. It was formerly believed that for a witch to harm her victims, the 
latter must first have become <I>in rapport </I>with her, either by contact with 
her person, or by contact with some garment she has worn. A certain witch, 
Florence Newton, was accused of establishing <I>rapport </I>between herself and 
those she sought to bewitch by kissing them, whereby she was able to compass 
their destruction, In the practice of animal magnetism it was considered that 
the only invariable and characteristic symptom of the genuine trance was the 
<I>rapport </I>between patient and operator. The former was deaf, dumb, blind, 
to all save his magnetizer, and those with whom his magnetizer placed him <I>in 
rapport. </I>This condition, however, still observed in hypnotism, is referable 
to a perfectly natural cause. <I>(See </I>Hypnotism.) The term is preserved at 
the present day in Spiritualism, when it signifies a spiritual sympathy between 
the ' control&quot; and the medium or any of the sitters. The medium-or, more 
properly, the control-may be placed in <I>rapport </I>with anyone who is absent 
or dead, merely by handling something which has belonged to them. It is for a 
similar reason that the crystal is held for a few moments prior to the 
inspection by the person on whose behalf the crystal-gazer is about to examine 
it.</P>

shape on crossing running water.</P><B>

<P>Reincarnation :</B> is an extremely important part of Theosophical theory, 
and, while it is commonly regarded as a succession of lives, the proper aspect 
in which to regard it is as one single, indivisible life, the various 
manifestations in the flesh being merely small portions of the whole. The Monad, 
the Divine Spark, the Ego-whose individuality remains the same throughout the 
whole course of <I>reincarnation-is </I>truly a denizen of the three higher 
worlds, the spiritual, the intuitional and the higher mental, but in order to 
further its growth and the widening of its experience and knowledge, it is 
necessary that it should descend into the worlds of denser matter, the lower 
mental, the actual and the physical, and take back with it to the higher worlds 
what it has learned in these. Since it is impossible to progress far during one 
manifestation, it must return again and again to the lower worlds. The theory 
which underlies <I>reincarnation </I>is entirely different from that of eternal 
reward and eternal punishment which underlies, say, the teachings of 
Christianity. Every individual will eventually attain perfection though some 
take longer to do so than others. The laws of his progress, the laws which 
govern <I>reincarnation, </I>are those of evolution and of karma. Evolution 
(q.v.) decrees that all shall attain perfection and that by developing to the 
utmost their latent powers and qualities, and each manifestation in the lower 
worlds is but one short journey nearer the goal. Those who realise this law 
shorten the journey by their own efforts while those who do not realise it and 
so assist its working, of course lengthen the journey. Karma (q.v.) decrees that 
effects good or bad, follow him who was their cause. Hence, what a man has done 
in one manifestation, he must be benefited by or suffer for in another. It may 
be impossible that his actions should be immediately effective, but each is 
stored up and sooner or later will bear fruit. It may be asked how one long life 
in the lower worlds should not suffice instead of a multitude of manifestations, 
but this is explicable by the fact that the dense matter which is the vehicle of 
these bodies, becomes after a time' of progress, incapable of further alteration 
to suit the developing monad's needs and must accordingly be laid aside for a 
new body. After physical death, man passes first to the astral world, then to 
the heaven portion of the mental world, and in this latter world most of his 
time is spent except when he descends into the denser worlds to garner fresh 
experience and knowledge for his further development in preparation for passage 
into the still higher sphere. In the heaven world these experiences and this 
knowledge are woven together into the texture of his nature. In those who have 
not progressed far on the journey of evolution, the manifestations in the lower 
worlds are comparatively frequent, but with passage of time and development, 
these manifestations become rarer and more time is spent in the heaven world, 
till, at last, the great process of <I>reincarnation </I>draws to an end, and 
the pilgrims enter the Path which leads to perfection. <I>(See </I>Theosophy, 
The Path, and the articles on the various Worlds.)</P>

<P>Rhabdomancy :</B> From the Greek words meaning &quot;a rod&quot; and &quot; 
divination,&quot; is thus alluded to by Sir Thomas Brown :-&quot; As for the 
divination or decision from the staff, it is an augurial relic. and the practice 
thereof is accused by God himself: My people ask counsel of their stocks, and 
their staff declareth unto them. Of this kind was that practised by 
Nabuchadonosor in that Caldean miscellany delivered by Ezekiel.&quot; In 
<I>Brand's Antiquities </I>the following description is cited from a MS. 
Discourse on Witchcraft, written by Mr. John Bell, <B>1705</B>, p. <B>41</B> it 
is derived from Theophylact :-' They set up two staffs, and having whispered 
some verses and incantations, the staffs fell by the operation of demons. Then 
they considered which way each of them fell, forward or backward, to the right 
or left hand, and agreeably gave responses, having made use of the fall of their 
staffs for their signs.&quot; This is the Grecian method of <I>Rhabdomancy, 
</I>and St. Jerome thinks it is the same that is alluded to in the above passage 
of Hosea, and in Ezekiel xxi. <B>21</B>, <B>22</B>, where it is rendered 
&quot;arrows.&quot; Belomancy and <I>Rhabdomancy, </I>in fact, have been 
confounded in these two passages, and it is a question whether in one of the 
methods arrows and rods or stones were not used indifferently. The practice is 
said to have passed from the Chaldeans and Scythians to the German tribes, who 
used pieces from the branch of a fruit tree, which they marked with certain 
characters, and threw at hazard upon a white cloth. Something like this, 
according to one of the rabbis, was the practice of the Hebrews, only instead of 
characters, they peeled their rods on one side, and drew the presage from their 
manner of falling. The Scythians and the Alani used rods of the myrtle and 
sallow, and as the latter chose ' flue straight wands &quot; according to 
Herodotus, it may be inferred that their method was that of the Hebrews, or some 
modification of it.</P>

<P>Rhasis (or Rasi) :</B> An Arabian alchemist whose real name was 
Mohammed-Ebn-Secharjah Aboubekr Arrasi. He was born at Ray, in Trak, Khorassan, 
about <B>850</B>. In his youth he devoted himself to music and the lighter 
pastimes, and it was not till he had passed his thirtieth year that he turned 
his attention to the healing art. But having done so, he studied it to good 
purpose, and speedily became a most skilful physician. His natural goodness of 
heart induced him to turn his knowledge and skill to account in order to benefit 
his poorer brethren. The study of philosophy also claimed his attention and he 
travelled to Syria, Egypt, and Spain in search of knowledge.</P>
<P>He was exceedingly fond of experimenting in medicine and chemistry, and was 
the first to mention borax, orpiment, realgar, and other chemical compounds. The 
authorship of two hundred and twenty-six treatises is ascribed to him, and some 
of these works influenced European medicine so late as the <B>17</B>th century. 
He firmly believed in the transmutation of metals, and wrote a glowing treatise 
on the subject which he presented to Emir Almansour, Prince of Khorassan. The 
Emir showed his gratitude in a practical fashion by giving <I>Rhasis </I>a 
thousand pieces of gold, at the same time desiring to be present during the 
working of some of the experiments with which the volume was plentifully 
illustrated. <I>Rhasis </I>consented, on condition that the prince supplied the 
necessary apparatus. No expense was spared in furnishing a laboratory for the 
alchemistical experiments, but unfortunately the boasted skill of the alchemist 
failed him and the performance ended miserably. <I>Rhasis, </I>who was now well 
advanced in years, was unmercifully beaten by the angry emir, who chose the 
unlucky treatise to belabour him with. This incident is said to have caused the 
blindness with which the alchemist was afterwards afflicted.</P>
<P>He died about <B>932</B> in the deepest poverty.</P>
<P>In his studies in chemistry he has left some results of real value, 
notwithstanding the time and trouble he spent in the pursuit of the 
philosopher's stone. Another theory which he held in common with Geber and 
others was that the planets influenced metallic formation under the earth's 
surface.</P>

<P>Rinaldo des Trois Echelles :</B> A much-dreaded French sorcerer of the reign 
of Charles IX., who, at his execution, boasted before the king that he had in 
France three hundred thousand confederates, whom they could not thus commit to 
the flames-meaning, doubtless, the demons of the Sabbath.</P>

<P>Ripley, George :</B> This alchemist was born about the middle of the 
fifteenth century at Ripley, in Yorkshire, in which county his kinsfolk appear 
to have been alike powerful and numerous. Espousing holy orders, he became an 
Augustinian, while subsequently he was appointed Canon of Bridlington in his 
native Yorkshire, a priory which had been founded in the time of Henry I. by 
Walter de Ghent. <I>Ripley's </I>sacerdotal office did not prevent him 
travelling, and he prosecuted empirical studies at various places on the 
continent, while he even penetrated so far afield as the island of Rhodes, where 
he is said to have made a large quantity of gold for the knights of St. John of 
Jerusalem. Going afterwards to Rome he was dignified by the Pope, the result 
being that, when he got back to Bridlington, he found his brethren there 
intensely jealous of him. It is reported, indeed, that he even resigned his 
position and retired to a priory at Boston, but this story is probably 
unfounded, the likelihood being that <I>Ripley </I>the alchemist has been 
confounded with George Ripley, a Carmelite friar who lived at Boston in the 
thirteenth century, and wrote a biography of St. Botolph.</P><I>
<P>Ripley </I>died in England in <B>1490</B>, but his fame did not die with him, 
and in fact his name continued to be familiar for many years after his decease. 
He had been among the first to popularise the chymical writings attributed to 
Raymond Lully, which first became known in England about <B>1445</B>, at which 
time an interest in alchemy was increasing steadily among English scholars-the 
more so because the law against multiplying gold had lately been repealed while 
<I>Ripley </I>wrote a number of learned treatises himself, notably <I>Medulla 
Alchimiae, The Treatise of Mercury </I>and <I>The Compound of Alchemie, </I>the 
last-named being dedicated to King Edward IV. A collected edition of his 
writings was issued at Cassel in Germany ill <B>1649</B>, while in <B>1678</B> 
an anonymous English writer published a strange volume in London, <I>Ripley 
Revived, or </I>an <I>Exposition upon George Ripley's Hermetico-Poetical 
Works.</P>

<P>Robert the Devil :</B> was son of a Duke and Duchess of Normandy. He was 
endowed with marvellous physical strength, which he used only to minister to his 
evil passions. Explaining to him the cause of his wicked impulses, his mother 
told him that he had been born in answer to prayers addressed to the devil. He 
now sought religious advice, and was directed by the Pope to a hermit who 
ordered him to maintain complete silence, to take his food from the mouths of 
dogs, to feign madness and to provoke abuse from common people without 
attempting to retaliate. He became court fool to the Roman Emperor and three 
times delivered the city from Saracen invasions, having, in each case, been 
prompted to fight by a heavenly message. The emperor's dumb daughter was given 
speech in order to identify the saviour of the city with the court fool, but he 
refused his due recompense, as well as her hand in marriage, and went back to 
the hermit, his former confessor. The. French Romance of Robert le Diable is one 
of the oldest forms of this legend.</P>

<P>Rocail :</B> Said to have been the younger brother of Seth, the son of Adam. 
The circumstances attending his history are picturesque and unique. A Dive, or 
giant of Mount Caucasus, finding himself in difficulties, applied for aid to the 
human race. <I>Rocail </I>offered his services to the giant, and so acceptable 
did these prove that the Dive made his benefactor grand vizier. For a long 
period he governed the giant's realm with entire success, and reached a position 
of dignity and honour. However, when he felt himself growing old he desired to 
leave behind him a more lasting monument than public respect, so he built a 
magnificent palace and sepulchre. The palace he peopled with statues, which, by 
the power of magic, he made to walk and talk, and act in all ways as though they 
were living men, as, indeed, all who beheld them judged them to be. <I>(See

<P>Rochester Rappings :</B> The outbreak of rappings which occurred in 
Hydesville, near Rochester, N.Y., in <B>1848</B>, and which is popularly known 
as the <I>Rochester Rappings, </I>is of peculiar importance, not because of its 
intrinsic superiority to any other poltergeistic disturbance, but because it 
inaugurates the movement of Modern Spiritualism. Hydesville is a small village 
in Arcadia, Wayne County, N.Y., and there, in <B>1848</B>, there lived one John 
D. Fox, with his wife and two young daughters, Margaretta, aged fifteen, and 
Kate, aged twelve. Their house was a small wooden structure previously tenanted 
by one Michael Weekman, who afterwards avowed that he had frequently been 
disturbed by knockings and other strange sounds in the Hydesville house. Towards 
the end of March, <B>1848</B>, the Fox family were much disturbed by mysterious 
rappings, and on the evening of the <B>31</B>st they went to bed early, hoping 
to get some undisturbed sleep. But the rappings broke out even more vigorously 
than they had done on the previous occasions, and Mrs. Fox, much alarmed and 
excited when the raps manifested signs of intelligence, decided to call in her 
neighbours to witness the phenomenon. The neighbours heard the raps as 
distinctly as did the Foxes themselves. When the sounds had indicated that they 
were directed by some sort of intelligence it was no difficult matter to get 
into communication with the unseen. Questions were asked by the sitters &quot; 
of this informal', Seance&quot; and if the answer were in the affirmative, raps 
were heard, if in the negative, the silence remained unbroken. By this means the 
knocker indicated that he was a spirit, the spirit of a pedlar who had been 
murdered for his money by a former resident in the house. It also answered 
correctly other questions put to it, relating to the ages of those present and 
other particulars concerning persons who lived in the neighbourhood. In the few 
days immediately following hundreds of people made their way to Hydesville to 
witness the marvel. Fox's married son, David, who lived about two miles from his 
father's house, has left a statement to the effect that the Fox family. 
following the directions of the raps, which indicated that the pedlar was buried 
in the cellar, had begun to dig therein early in April, but were stopped by 
water. Later, however, hair, bones, and teeth were found in the cellar. Vague 
rumours were afloat that a pedlar had visited the village one winter, had been 
seen in the kitchen of the house afterwards tenanted by the Foxes, and had 
mysteriously disappeared, without fulfilling his, promise to the villagers to 
return next day. But of real evidence there was not a scrap, whether for the 
murder or for the existence of the pedlar, particulars of whose life were 
furnished by the raps. Soon after these happenings Kate Fox went to Auburn, and 
Margaretta to Rochester, N.Y., where lived her married sister, Mrs. Fish 
(formerly Mrs. Underhill), and at both places outbreaks of rappings occurred. 
New mediums sprang up, circles were formed, and soon Spiritualism was fairly 
started on its career.</P>

<P>Rome :</B> Magical practice was rife amongst the Romans. Magic was the motive 
power of their worship which was simply an organized system of magical rites for 
communal ends. It was the basis of their mode of thought and outlook upon the 
world, it entered into every moment and action of their daily life, it affected 
their laws and customs. This ingrained tendency instead of diminishing, 
developed to an enormous extent, into a great system of superstition, and in the 
later years led to a frenzy for strange gods, borrowed from all countries. In 
times of misfortune and disaster the Romans were always ready to borrow a god if 
so be his favours promised more than those of their own deities. Though there 
was a strong conservative element in the native character, though the &quot; 
custom of the elders&quot; was strongly upheld by the priestly fraternity, yet 
this usually gave way before the will and temper of the people. Thus, as a rock 
shows its geological history by its differing strata, so the theogony of the 
Roman gods tells its tale of the race who conceived it. There are pre-historic 
nature deities, borrowed from the indigenous tribes, gods of the Sabines, from 
whom the young colony stole its wives gods of the Etruscans, of the Egyptians, 
Greeks and Persians. The temple of Jupiter on the Capitol contained the altar of 
a primitive deity, a stone-god, Terminus, the spirit of boundaries: in the 
temple of Diana of the Grove, a fountain nymph was worshipped. Instances of this 
description are numerous.</P><I>
<P>Spirits </I>-In addition to the <I>gods, </I>there were spirits to be 
propitiated. Indeed the objects offered to the Roman for adoration were 
numberless. Apuleius gives a description of this when he tells of a country road 
where one might meet an altar wreathed with flowers, a cave hung with garlands, 
an oak tree laden with horns of cattle, a hill marked by fences as sacred, a log 
rough-hewn into shape. an altar of turf smoking with libations or a stone 
anointed with oil. Every single action of man's daily life had a presiding 
spirit ; commerce and husbandry likewise. There was eating Ednea, drinking 
Potina ; there were spirits of departure, of journeying, of approaching and 
homecoming. In commerce there was Mercurius, the spirit of gain, of money, 
Pecunia ; in farming, the spirits of cutting, grinding, sowing and bee-keeping. 
A deity presided over streets and highways ; there was a goddess of the sewers, 
Cloacina ; a spirit of bad smells, Mephitis. Spirits of evil must also be 
propitiated by pacificatory rites, such as Robigo, the spirit of mildew ; in 
Rome there was an altar to Fever and Bad Fortune. From the country came 
Silvanus, god of farms and woods, and his Fauns and nymphs with Picus, the 
wood-pecker god who had fed the twins Romulus and Remus with berries-all these 
were possessed of influences and were approached with peculiar rites. The names 
of these spirits were inscribed on tablets, <I>indigitamenta, </I>which were in 
the charge of the pontiffs, who thus knew which spirit to evoke according to the 
need. Most of these spirits were animistic in origin.</P><I>
<P>The Roman Worship </I>consisted of magical rites destined to propitiate the 
powers controlling mankind; to bring man into touch with them, to renew his life 
and that which supported it, the land with its trees, corn and cattle, to stop 
that process of degeneration constantly set in motion by evil influences. 
Everything connected with it typified this restoration. <I>The Priests </I>who 
represented the life of the community, were therefore bound by strict 
observances from endangering it in any way. Rules as to attire, eating and touch 
were numerous sacrific<I>es </I>were systematised according to the end desired 
and the deity invoked. There were rules as to whether the victim must be young 
or full-grown, male or female ; oxen were to be offered to Jupiter and Mars; 
swine to Juno, to Ceres the corn-goddess and to Silvanus. At one shrine a cow in 
calf was sacrificed and the ashes of the unborn young were of special magical 
efficacy. Human sacrifice existed within historical times. After the battle of 
Cannae the Romans had sought to divert misfortune by burying two Greeks alive in 
the cattle-market while in the time of Julius Caesar two men were put to death 
with sacrificial solemnities by the Pontiff and Flamen of Mars. Again, in the 
time of Cicero and Horace boys were killed for magical purposes. <I>Fire 
</I>possessed great virtue and was held sacred in the worship of Vesta, in early 
belief Vesta being the fire itself; it presided over the family hearth ; it 
restored purity and conferred protection. <I>Blood </I>had the same quality and 
smeared on the face of the god symbolised and brought about the one-ness of the 
deity with the community. On great occasions the Statue of Jupiter was treated 
thus the priests of Bellona made incisions in their shoulders and sprinkled the 
blood upon the image; the face of a triumphant general was painted with 
vermilion to represent blood. <I>Kneeling </I>and prostration brought one into 
direct contact with the earth of the sacred place. <I>Music </I>was also used as 
a species of incantation, probably deriving its origin in sound made to drive 
away evil spirits. <I>Dancing </I>too was of magical efficacy. In <I>Rome 
</I>there were colleges of dancers for the purposes of religion, youths who 
danced in solemn measure about the altars, who, in the sacred month of Mars took 
part in the festivals and went throughout the city dancing and singing. One 
authority states four kinds of holy solemnity &quot; ; sacrifice, sacred 
banquets, public festivals and games. Theatrical performances also belonged to 
this category, in one instance being used as a means of diverting a pestilence. 
The <I>sacred banquets </I>were often decreed by the Senate as thanks-giving to 
the gods. Tables were spread with a sumptuous repast in the public places and 
were first offered to the statues of the deities seated around. The <I>festivals 
</I>were numerous, all of a magical and symbolic nature. In the spring there was 
the <I>Parilia </I>when fires of straw were lighted, through which persons 
passed to be purified; the <I>Cerealia, </I>celebrated with sacrifice and 
offerings to Ceres, the corn-goddess, and followed by banquets. The 
<I>Lupercalia, </I>the festival of Faunus, was held in February and symbolised 
the wakening of Spring and growth. Goats were slain as sacrifice and with their 
blood the Luperci, youths clad in skins, smeared their faces. They took thongs 
of the goat-skin and laughing wildly rushed through the city striking the crowd, 
Roman matrons believing that the blows thus received rendered them prolific. 
Juno, the goddess of marriage and childbirth also had her festival, the 
<I>Matronalia, </I>celebrated by the women of <I>Rome. </I>There were the 
<I>festivals of the dead </I>when the door leading to the other world was 
opened, the stone removed from its entrance in the Comitium, and the shades 
coming forth were appeased with offerings. On these days three times in the 
year, when the gods of gloom were abroad, complete cessation from all work was 
decreed, no battle could be fought nor ship set sail neither could a man marry. 
To the <I>Sacred Games </I>were taken the statues of the gods in gorgeous 
procession, chariots of silver, companies of priests, youths singing and 
dancing. The gods viewed the games reclining on couches. The <I>Chariot races 
</I>also partook of the nature of rites. After the races in the Field of Mars 
came one of the most important Roman rites, the sacrifice of the October Horse. 
The right-hand horse of the victorious team was sacrificed to Mars, and the tail 
of the animal, running with blood, carried to the Altar of the Regia. The blood 
was stored in the temple of Vesta till the following spring and used in the 
sacrifice of the festival of Parilia. This sacrifice was essentially magical, 
all citizens present being looked upon as purified by the blood-sprinkling and 
lustral bonfire. The <I>Roman outlook upon life </I>was wholly coloured by 
magic. Bodily foes had their counterpart in the unseen world, wandering spirits 
of the dead, spirits of evil, the anger of innocently offended deities, the 
menace of the evil eye. <I>Portents </I>and <I>prodigies </I>were everywhere. In 
the heavens strange things might be seen. The sun had been known to double, even 
treble itself; its light turn to blood, or a magical halo to appear round the 
orb. Thunder and lightning were always fraught with presage; Jove was angered 
when he opened the heavens and hurled his bolts to earth. Phantoms, too, hovered 
amid the clouds; a great fleet of ships had been seen sailing over the marshes. 
Upon the Campagna the gods were observed in conflict, and afterwards tracks of 
the combatants were visible across the plain. Unearthly voices were heard amid 
the mountains and groves ; cries of portent had sounded within the temples. 
Blood haunted the Roman imagination. Sometimes it was said to have covered the 
land as a mantle, the standing corn was dyed with blood, the rivers and 
fountains flowed with it, while walls and statues were covered with a bloody 
sweat. The <I>flight and song of birds </I>might be foretelling the decrees of 
Fate; unappeased spirits of the dead were known to lurk near and steal away the 
souls of men and then they too were dead.&quot; All these happenings were 
attributable to the gods and spirits, who, if the portent be one of menace, must 
be propitiated, if one of good fortune, thanked with offerings. Down to the 
later times this deep belief in the occurrence of prodigies persisted. When Otho 
set out for Italy, <I>Rome </I>rang with reports of a gigantic phantom rushing 
forth from the Temple of Juno; of the Statue of Julius turning from east to 
west.</P>
<P><I>Augury.-Divination </I>was connected with the Roman worship. There was a 
spot on the Capitol from which the augur with veiled head read the auspices in 
the flight of birds. Augurs also accompanied armies and fleets and read the 
omens before an engagement was entered upon. <I>Divination </I>was also 
practised by reading the intestines of animals, by dreams, by divine possession 
as in the case of the Oracles wisen prophecies were uttered. These had been 
gathered together in the Sibylline books (q.v.), and were consulted as oracles 
by the State. With the worship of Fortune were connected the <I>Lots of 
Praeneste. </I>The questions put to the goddess were answered by means of oaken 
lots which a boy drew from a case made of sacred wood. The fortune-tellers also 
used a narrow-necked urn which, filled with water, only allowed one lot at a 
time to rise. <I>Astrologers </I>from Chaldea were also much sought after and 
were attached to the kingly and noble houses. Familiar things of everyday life 
were of magical import. <I>Words, Numbers, </I>odd ones specially for the 
Kalends, Nones and Ides were so arranged as to fall upon odd days; <I>touch 
</I>was binding and so recognised in the law of <I>Rome, </I>as the grasp of a 
thing sold, from a slave to a turf of distant estate; and <I>knotting </I>and 
twisting of thread was injurious so that women must never pass by cornfields 
twisting their spindles, they must not even be uncovered. There was a strange 
sympathy between the <I>trees </I>and mankind, and great honour was paid to the 
sacred trees of <I>Rome. </I>On the oak tree of Jupiter the triumphant general 
hung the shield and arms of his fallen foe ; while the hedges about the Temple 
of Diana at Nemi were covered with votive offerings. The trees also harboured 
the spirits of the dead who- came forth as dreams to the souls of men. <I>Pliny 
</I>the elder says in this matter &quot;Trees have a soul since nothing on earth 
lives without one. They are the temples of spirits and the simple countryside 
dedicates still a noble tree to some god. The various kinds of trees are sacred 
to their protecting spirits the oak to Jupiter, the laurel to Apollo, olive to 
Minerva, myrtle to Venus, white poplar to Hercules.&quot; These trees therefore 
partook of the nature of their presiding spirits and it was desirable to bring 
about communion with their magical influence, as in the spring when laurel 
boughs were hung at the doors of the flamens and pontiffs and in the temple of 
Vesta where they remained hanging till the following year. Trees and their 
leaves were also possessed of healing and purifying value; laurel was used for 
the latter quality as in the Roman triumphs the fasces of the commander, the 
spears and javelins of legionaries were wreathed with its branches to purify 
them from the blood of the enemy. <I>Man </I>himself had a presiding spirit, his 
genius, each woman her&quot; juno&quot; the Saturnalia was really a holiday for 
this &quot; other self.&quot; The Roman kept his birthday in honour of his 
genius, offering frankincense, cakes and unmixed wine on an altar garlanded with 
flowers and making solemn prayers for the coming year. City and village had 
their genii, also bodies of men from the senate to the scullions.</P><I>
<P>Death </I>was believed to be the life and soul enticed away by revengeful 
ghosts, hence death would never occur save by such agencies. The dead therefore 
must be appeased with offerings or else they wander abroad working evil among 
the living. This belief is present in Ovid's lines</P>
<P>&quot;Once upon a time the great feast of the dead was not observed and the 
manes failed to receive the customary gifts, the fruit, the salt, the corn 
steeped in unmixed wine, the violets. The injured spirits revenged themselves on 
the living and the city was encircled with the funeral fires of their victims. 
The townsfolk heard their grand-sires complaining in the quiet hours of the 
night, and told each other how the unsubstantial troop of monstrous spectres 
rising from their tombs, shrieked along the city streets and up and down the 
fields.&quot; <I>Beans </I>were used in the funeral feasts. They were supposed 
to harbour the souls of the dead, and the bean-blossom to be inscribed with 
characters of mourning.</P><I>
<P>Dreams </I>were considered of great importance by the Romans ; many 
historical instances of prophetic dreams may be found. They were thought to be 
like birds, the &quot;bronze-coloured&quot; hawks; they were also thought to be 
the souls of human beings visiting others in their sleep also the souls of the 
dead returning to earth. In Virgil much may be found on this subject; Lucretius 
tried to find a scientific reason for them; Cicero, though writing in a 
slighting manner of the prevalent belief in these manifestations of sleep, yet 
records dreams of his own, which events proved true.</P><I>
<P>Sorcery </I>in all its forms, love-magic and death-magic was rife amongst all 
classes, besides necromantic practices. There were <I>charms and spells </I>for 
everything under the sun; the rain-charm of the pontiffs consisting of the 
throwing of puppets into the Tiber; the charm against thunder-bolts compounded 
of onions, hair and sprats; the charm against an epidemic when the matrons of 
<I>Rome </I>swept the temple-floors with their hair; and many more down to the 
simple love-charm strung round the neck of the country maiden.</P><I>
<P>Witches </I>were prevalent. The poets often chose these sinister figures for 
their subjects, as when Horace describes the ghastly rites of two witches in the 
cemetery of the Esquiline. Under the light of the new moon they crawl about 
looking for poisonous herbs and bones; they call the spectres to a banquet 
consisting of a black lamb torn to pieces with their teeth, and after, these 
phantoms must answer the questions of the sorceresses. They make images of their 
victims and pray to the infernal powers for help; hounds and snakes glide over 
the ground, the moon turns to blood, and as the images are melted so the lives 
of the victims ebb away. Virgil gives a picture of a sorceress performing 
love-magic by means of a waxen image of the youth whose love she desired. Lucan 
in his Pharsalia treats of Thessaly, notorious in all ages for sorcery and draws 
a terrific figure-Erichtho. a sorceress of illimitable powers, one whom even the 
gods obeyed, to whom the forces of earth and heaven were bond-slaves; and Fate 
waiting her least command. Both Nero and Agrippina his mother were reported to 
have had recourse to the infamous arts of sorcery; while in the New Testament 
may be found testimony as to these practices in <I>Rome. </I>The attitude of the 
cultured class towards magic is illustrated by an illuminating passage to be 
found in the writings of Pliny the elder. He says &quot;The art of magic has 
prevailed in most ages and in most parts of the globe. Let no one wonder that it 
has wielded very great authority inasmuch as it embraces three other sources of 
influence. No one doubts that it took its rise in medicine and sought to cloak 
itself in the garb of a science more profound and holy than the common run. It 
added to his tempting promises the force of religion, after which the human race 
is groping, especially at this time. Further it has brought in the arts of 
astrology and divination. For everyone desires to know what is to come to him 
and believes that certainty can be gained by consulting the stars. Having in 
this way taken captive the feelings of man by a triple chain it has reached such 
a pitch that it rules over all the world and in the East, governs the King of 
Kings. K. N.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Rose :</B> From the earliest times the <I>rose </I>has been an emblem of 
silence. Eros, in the Greek mythology, presents a <I>rose </I>to the god of 
silence, and to this day sub rosa, or &quot; under the <I>rose,&quot; </I>means 
the keeping of a secret. Roses were used in very early times as a potent 
ingredient in love philters. In Greece it was customary to leave bequests for 
the maintenance of rose gardens, a custom which has come down to recent times. 
<I>Rose </I>gardens were common during the middle ages. According to Indian 
mythology, one of the wives of Vishnu was found in a <I>rose'. </I>In Rome it 
was the custom to bless the <I>rose </I>on a certain Sunday, called Rose Sunday. 
The custom of blessing the golden rose came into vogue about the eleventh 
century. The golden rose thus consecrated was given to princes as a mark of the 
Roman Pontiffs' favour. In the east it is still believed that the first <I>rose 
</I>was generated by a tear of the prophet Mohammed, and it is further believed 
that on a certain day in the year the <I>rose </I>has a heart of gold. In the 
west of Scotland if a white <I>rose </I>bloomed in autumn it was a token of an 
early marriage. The red <I>rose, </I>it was said, would not bloom over a grave. 
If a young girl had several lovers, and wished to know which of them would be 
her husband, she would take a <I>rose </I>leaf for each of her sweethearts, and 
naming each leaf after the name of one of her lovers, she would watch them till 
one after another they sank, and the last to sink would be her future husband. 
Rose leaves thrown upon a fire gave good luck'. If a rose bush were pruned on 
St. John's eve, it would bloom again in the autumn. Superstitions respecting the 
<I>rose </I>are more numerous in England than in Scotland.</P>

<P>Rosicrucians :</B> The idea of a Rosicrucian Brotherhood has probably aroused 
more interest in the popular mind than that of any other secret society of 
kindred nature : hut that such a brotherhood ever existed is extremely doubtful. 
The very name of <I>Rosicrucian </I>seems to have exercised a spell upon people 
of an imaginative nature for nearly two hundred and fifty years, and a great 
deal of romantic fiction has clustered around the fraternity: such as for 
example Lord Lytton's romance of <I>Zanoni </I>Shelley's novel <I>St. Irvyne the 
Rosicrucian, </I>Harrison Ainsworth's <I>Auriol, </I>and similar works.</P>
<P>The name <I>Rosicrucian </I>is utilised by mystics to some extent as the 
equivalent of <I>magus, </I>but in its more specific application it was the 
title of a member of a suppositious society which arose in the late sixteenth 
century. There are several theories regarding the derivation of the name. The 
most commonly accepted appears to be that it was derived from the appellation of 
the supposed founder, Christian Rosenkreuze; but as his history has been proved 
to be wholly fabulous, this theory must fall to the ground. Mosheim, the 
historian, gave it as his opinion that the name was formed from the Latin words 
<I>ros, </I>dew, <I>crux </I>a cross; on the assumption that the alchemical dew 
of the philosophers was the most powerful dissolvent of gold, while the cross 
was equivalent to light. It is more probable that the name <I>Rosicrucian </I>is 
derived from <I>rosa </I>a rose, and <I>crux </I>a cross, and we find that the 
general symbol of the supposed order was a rose crucified in the centre of a 
cross. In an old <I>Rosicrucian </I>book of the last century, we further find 
the symbol of a red cross-marked heart in the centre of an open rose, which Mr. 
A. E. Waite believes to be a development of the monogram of Martin Luther, which 
was a cross-crowned heart rising from the centre of an open rose.</P><I>
<P>History of the Supposed Brotherhood.-Practically </I>nothing definite was 
known concerning the Rosicrucian Brotherhood before the publication of Mr. 
Waite's work <I>The real</P>
<P>History of the Rosicrucians </I>in <B>1887</B>. Prior to that a great deal 
had been written concerning the fraternity, and shortly before Mr. Waite 
produced his well-known book another had made its appearance under the title of 
<I>The Rosicrucians, their Rites and Mysteries </I>by the late Mr. Hargrave 
Jennings. This book was merely a farrago of the wildest absurdities, rendered 
laughable by the ridiculous attitude of the author, who pretended to the 
guardianship of abysmal occult secrets. It was typical of most writings 
regarding the fraternity of the Rosy Cross, and as the <I>Westminster Review 
</I>wittily remarked in its notice of the volume, it deals with practically 
everything under the sun except the <I>Rosicrucians. </I>Mr. Waite's work, the 
result of arduous personal research, has gathered together all that can possibly 
be known regarding the <I>Rosicrucians, </I>and his facts are drawn from 
manuscripts, in some cases discovered by himself, and from skilful analogy. As 
it is the only authority on the subject worth speaking about, we shall attempt 
to outline its conclusions. </P>
<P>We find then that the name ', Rosicrucian&quot; was unknown previously to the 
year <B>1598</B>. The history of the movement originates in Germany, where in 
the town of Cassel in the year <B>1614</B> the professors of magic and 
mysticism, the theosophists and alchemists, were surprised by the publication of 
a pamphlet bearing the title <I>The Fama of the Fraternity of the Meritorious 
Order of the Rosy Cross Addressed to the Learned in General and the Governors of 
Europe. </I>It purported to be a message from certain anonymous adepts who were 
deeply concerned for the condition of mankind, and who greatly desired its moral 
renewal and perfection. It proposed that all men of learning throughout the 
world should join forces for the establishment of a synthesis of science, 
through which would be discovered the perfect method of all the arts. The 
squabblings and quarrellings of the literati of the period were to be forgone, 
and the antiquated authorities of the elder world to be discredited. It pointed 
out that a reformation had taken place in religion, that the church had been 
cleansed, and that a similar new career was open to science. All this was to be 
brought abbot by the assistance of the illuminated Brotherhood,-the children of 
light who had been initiated in the mysteries of the Grand Orient, and would 
lead the age to perfection.</P>
<P>The fraternity kindly supplied an account of its history. The head and front 
of the movement was one C.R.C. of Teutonic race, a magical hierophant of the 
highest rank, who in the fifth year of his age had been placed in a convent, 
where he learned the Humanities. At the age of fifteen, he accompanied one, 
Brother P. A. L, on his travels to the Holy Land ; but the brother died at 
Cyprus to the great grief of C.R.C., who, however resolved to undertake the 
arduous journey himself. Arriving at Damascus, he there obtained knowledge of a 
secret circle of theosophists who dwelt in an unknown city of Arabia called 
Damcar, who were expert in all magical arts. Turning aside from his quest of the 
Holy Sepulchre, the lad made up his mind to trace these illuminati and sought 
out certain Arabians who carried him to the city of Damcar. There he arrived at 
the age of sixteen years, and was graciously welcomed by the magi, who intimated 
to him that they had long been expecting him, and relating to him several 
passages in his past life. They proceeded to initiate him into the mysteries of 
occult science, and he speedily became acquainted with Arabic, from which tongue 
he translated the divine book M into Latin, After three years of mystic 
instruction, he departed from the mysterious city for Egypt, whence he sailed to 
Fez as the wise men of Damcar had instructed him to do. There he fell in with 
other masters who taught him how to evoke the elemental spirits. After a further 
two years' sojourn at Fez, his period of initiation was over, and he proceeded 
to Spain to confer with the wisdom of that country, and convince its professors 
of the errors of their ways. Unhappily, the scholarhood of Spain turned its back 
upon him with loud laughter, and intimated to him that it had learned the 
principles and practice of the black art from a much higher authority, namely 
Satan himself, who had unveiled to them the secrets of necromancy within the 
walls of the university of Salamanca. With noble indignation he shook the dust 
of Spain from his feet, and turned his face to other countries only, alas, to 
find the same treatment within their boundaries. At last he sought his native 
land of Germany where he pored over the great truths he had learned in solitude 
and seclusion, and reduced his universal philosophy to writing. Five years of a 
hermit's life, however, only served to strengthen him in his opinions, and he 
could not but feel that one who had achieved the transmutation of metals and had 
manufactured the elixir of life was designed for a nobler purpose than 
rumination in solitude. Slowly and carefully he began to collect around him 
assistants who became the nucleus of the Rosicrucian fraternity. When he had 
gathered four of these persons into the brotherhood they invented amongst them a 
magical language, a cipher writing of equal magical potency, and a large 
dictionary replete with occult wisdom. They erected a House of the Holy Ghost, 
healed the sick, and initiated further members, and then betook themselves as 
missionaries to the various countries of Europe to disseminate their wisdom. In 
course of time their founder, C.R.C., breathed his last, and for a hundred and 
twenty years the secret of his burial place was concealed. The original members 
also died one by one, and it was not until the third generation of adepts had 
arisen that the tomb of their illustrious founder was unearthed during the 
re-building of one of their secret dwellings. The vault in which this tomb was 
found was illuminated by the sun of the magi, and inscribed with magical 
characters. The body of the illustrious founder was discovered in perfect 
preservation, and a number of marvels were discovered buried beside him, which 
convinced the existing members of the fraternity that it was their duty to make 
these publicly known to the world. It was this discovery which immediately 
inspired the brotherhood to make its existence public in the circular above 
alluded to, and they invited all worthy persons to apply to them for initiation. 
They refused, however, to supply their names and addresses, and desired that 
those who wished for initiation could signify their intention by the publication 
of printed letters which they would be certain to notice. In conclusion they 
assured the public of the circumstance that they were believers in the reformed 
Church of Christ, and denounced in the most solemn manner all pseudo-occultists 
and alchemists.</P>
<P>This <I>Fama </I>created tremendous excitement among the occultists of 
Europe, and a large number of pamphlets were published criticising and defending 
the society and its manifesto, in which it was pointed Out there were a number 
of discrepancies. To begin with no such city as Damcar existed within the bounds 
of Arabia. Where, it was asked, was the House of the Holy Ghost, which the 
<I>Rosicrucians </I>stated had been seen by <B>100</B>,<B>000</B> persons and 
was yet concealed from the world ? C.R.C., the founder, as a boy of fifteen must 
have achieved great occult skill to have astonished the magi of Damcar. But 
despite these objections considerable credit was given to the <I>Rosicrucian 
</I>publication. After a lapse of a year appeared the <I>Confession of the 
Rosicrucian Fraternity, </I>addressed to the learned in Europe. This offered 
initiation by gradual stages to selected applicants, and discovered its 
ultra-Protestant character by what an old Scots divine was wont to call a 
&quot;dig at the Pope,&quot; whom it publicly execrated, expressing the pious 
hope that his &quot;asinine braying&quot; would finally be put a stop to by 
tearing him to pieces with nails In the following year, <B>1616</B>, <I>The 
Chymical Nuptials of Christian Rosencreutz </I>was published, purporting to be 
incidents in the life of the mysterious founder of the Brotherhood of the Rosy 
Cross. But the chymical marriage makes Christian Rosencreutz an old man when he 
achieved initiation, and this hardly squares with the original account of his 
life as given in the <I>Fama. </I>By this time, a number of persons had applied 
for initiation, but had received no answer to their application. As many of 
these believed themselves to be alchemical and magical adepts, great irritation 
arose among the brotherhood, and it was generally considered that the whole 
business was a hoax. By <B>1620</B>, the <I>Rosicrucians </I>and their 
publication had lapsed into absolute obscurity.</P>
<P>Numerous theories have been put forward as to the probable authorship of 
these manifestoes, and it has been generally considered that the theologian 
Andreae produced them as a kind of laborious jest; but this view is open to so 
many objections that it may be dismissed summarily. Their authorship has also 
been claimed for Taulerus, Joachim Junge, and AEgidius Guttmann; but the 
individual in whose 'imagination originated the Brotherhood of the Rosy Cross 
will probably for ever remain unknown. It is however, unlikely that the 
manifesto was of the nature of a hoax, because it bears upon its surface the 
marks of intense earnestness, and the desire for philosophical and spiritual 
reformation; and it is not unlikely that it sprang from some mystic of the 
Lutheran school who desired the cooperation of like-minded persons. Mr. Waite 
thinks there is fair presumptive evidence to show that some corporate body such 
as the Rosicrucian Brotherhood did exist: but as he states that the documents 
which are the basis of this belief give evidence also that the association did 
not originate as it pretended, and was devoid of the powers which it claimed, 
this hypothesis seems in the highest degree unlikely. Such a document would more 
probably emanate from one individual, and it is almost impossible to conceive 
that a body of men professing such aims and objects as the manifesto lays claim 
to could possibly have lent themselves to such a farrago of absurdity as the 
history of C.R.C. A great many writers have credited the brotherhood with 
immense antiquity; but as the publisher of the manifesto places its origin so 
late as the fifteenth century, there is little necessity to take these theories 
into consideration.</P>
<P>So far as can be gleaned from their publications, the <I>Rosicrucians, </I>or 
the person in whose imagination they existed, were believers in the doctrines of 
Paracelsus. They believed in alchemy, astrology and occult forces in nature and 
their credence in these is identical with the doctrines of the great master of 
modern magic. They were thus essentially modern in their theosophical beliefs, 
just as they were modern in their religious ideas. Mr. Waite thinks it possible 
that in Nuremburg in the year <B>1598</B> a Rosicrucian Society was founded by a 
mystic and alchemist named Simon Studion, under the title of <I>MiIitia 
Crucifera Evangelica, </I>which held periodical meetings in that city. Its 
proceedings are reported in an unprinted work of Studion's, and ill opinions and 
objects it was identical with the supposed Rosicrucian Society. ' 
&quot;Evidently,&quot; he says, &quot;the Rosicrucian Society of <B>1614</B> was 
a transfiguration or development of the sect established by Simon Studion.&quot; 
But there is no good evidence for this statement. After a lapse of nearly a 
century, the <I>Rosicrucians </I>reappeared in Germany. in <B>1710</B>, a 
certain Sincerus Racatus or Sigmund Richter, published A <I>Perfect and True 
Preparation of the Philosophical Stone according to the Secret Methods of the 
Brotherhood of the Golden and Rosy Cross, </I>and annexed to this treatise were 
the rules of the Rosicrucian Society for the initiation of new members. Mr. 
Waite is of opinion that these rules are equivalent to a proof of the society's 
existence at the period, and that they help to establish the important fact that 
it still held its meetings at Nuremburg, where it was originally established by 
Studion. In <B>1785</B>, the publication of <I>The Secret Symbols of the 
Rosicrucians of the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries </I>took place at 
Altona, showing in Mr. Waite's opinion that the mysterious brotherhood still 
existed ; but this was their last manifesto. These things are certainly of the 
nature of proof, but they are so scanty that any reasonable and workable 
hypothesis that such a society ever existed can scarcely be founded upon them. 
For all we know to the contrary they may be publications of enthusiastic and 
slightly unbalanced pseudo-mystics, and nothing definite can be gleaned from 
their existence.</P>
<P>In <B>1618</B> Henrichus Neuhuseus published a Latin pamphlet, which stated 
that the <I>Rosicrucian </I>adepts had migrated to India, and present-day 
Theosophists will have it that they exist now in the table-lands of Tibet. It is 
this sort of thing which altogether discredits occultism in the eyes of the 
public. Without the slightest shadow of proof of any kind, such statements are 
wildly disseminated; and it has even been alleged that the <I>Rosicrucians 
</I>have developed into a Tibetan Brotherhood, and have exchanged Protestant 
Christianity for esoteric Buddhism I Mr. Waite humorously states that he has not 
been able to trace the eastern progress of the Brotherhood further than the Isle 
of Mauritius, where it is related in a curious manuscript a certain Comte De 
Chazal initiated a Dr. Sigismund Bacstrom into the mysteries of the Hose Cross 
Order in <B>1794</B> but we know nothing about the Comte de Chazal or his 
character, and it is just possible that Dr. Bacstrom might have been one of 
those deluded persons who in all times and countries have been willing to 
purchase problematical honours. From the <I>Fama </I>and <I>Confessio, </I>we 
glean some definite ideas of the occult conceptions of the <I>Rosicrucians. 
</I>In these documents we find the doctrine of the Microcosmus (q.v.), which 
considers man as containing the potentialities of the whole universe. This is a 
distinctly Paracelsian belief. We also find the belief of the doctrine of 
Elemental Spirits (q.v.), which many people wrongly think originated with the 
<I>Rosicrucians ; </I>but which was probably reintroduced by Paracelsus. We also 
find that the manifestoes contain the doctrine of the <I>Signatura Rerum, 
</I>which also is of Paracelsian origin. This is the magical writing referred to 
in the <I>Fama; </I>and the mystic characters of that book of nature, which, 
according to the <I>Confessio, </I>stand open for all eyes, but can be read or 
understood by only the very few. These characters are the seal of God imprinted 
on the wonderful work of creation, on the heavens and earth, and on all beasts. 
It would appear too, that some form of practical magic was known to the 
Brotherhood. They were also, according to themselves, alchemists, for they had 
achieved the transmutation of metals and the manufacture of the elixir of 
life.</P>
<P>In England the <I>Rosicrucian </I>idea was taken up by Fludd, who wrote a 
spirited defence of the Brotherhood ; by Vaughan who translated the <I>Fama 
</I>and the <I>Confessio; </I>and by John Heydon, who furnished a peculiarly 
quaint and interesting account of the <I>Rosicrucians </I>in <I>The Wise Man's 
Crown </I>; and further treatises regarding their alchemical skill and medical 
ability in <I>El Havarevna, </I>or <I>The English Physitian's Tutor, </I>and 
<I>A New Method of Rosie Crucian Physich, </I>London <B>1658</B>. In France 
Rosicrucianism ran a like course. It has been stated by Buhle and others that 
there was much connection between the <I>Rosicrucians </I>and Freemasons.</P>
<P>A pseudo-Rosicrucian Society existed in England before the year <B>1836</B>, 
and this was remodelled about the middle of last century under the title &quot; 
The Rosicrucian Society of England.&quot; To join this it is necessary to be a 
Mason. The officers of the society consist of three magi, a master-general for 
the first and second orders, a deputy master-general, a treasurer, a secretary 
and seven ancients. The assisting officers number a precentor, organist, 
torchbearer, herald, and so forth. The society is composed of nine grades or 
classes. It published a little quarterly' magazine from <B>1868</B> to 
<B>1879</B>, which in an early number stated that the society was &quot; 
calculated to meet the requirements of those worthy masons who wished to study 
the science and antiquities of the craft, and trace it through its successive 
developments to the present time ; also to cull information from all the records 
extant from those mysterious societies which had their existence in the dark 
ages of the world, when might meant right.&quot; These objects were, however, 
fulfilled in a very perfunctory manner, if the magazine of the association is 
any criterion of its work. For this publication is filled with occult serial 
stories, reports of masonic meetings and verse. Mr. Waite states that the most 
notable circumstance connected with this society is the complete ignorance which 
seems to have prevailed among its. members generally concerning everything 
connected with Rosicrucianism. The prime movers of the association were Robert 
Went-worth Little, Frederick Hockley, Kenneth Mackenzie and Hargrave Jennings, 
and in the year <B>1872</B> they seem to have become conscious that their 
society had not borne out its original intention. By this time the Yorkshire 
College and East of Scotland College at Edinburgh, had been founded - one does 
not know with what results. &quot; This harmless association,&quot; says Mr. 
Waite, &quot; deserves a mild sympathy at the hands of the student of occultism. 
Its character,&quot; he continues, &quot; could hardly have deceived the most 
credulous of its postulants. Some of its members wrapped themselves in darkness 
and mystery, proclaimed themselves <I>Rosicrucians </I>with intent to deceive. 
These persons found a few-very few-believers and admirers. Others assert that 
the society is a cloak to something else-the last resource of cornered credulity 
and exposed imposture. There are similar associations in other parts of Europe, 
and also in America: <I>e.g., </I>the <I>Societas Rosicruciana </I>of 
Boston.&quot; But in the concluding pages of Mr. Waite's book we find the 
following passage: &quot; On the faith of a follower of Honnes, I can promise 
that nothing shall be held back from these true Sons of the Doctrine, the 
sincere seekers after light, who are empowered to preach the supreme Arcana of 
the psychic world with a clean heart and an earnest aim. True <I>Rosicrucians 
</I>and true alchemical adepts, if there be any ill existence at this day, will 
not resent a new procedure when circumstances have been radically changed.&quot; 
Mr. Waite appeals to these students of occultism who are men of method as well 
of imagination to assist him in clearing away the dust and rubbish which have 
accumulated during centuries of oblivion in the silent sanctuaries of the 
transcendental sciences, that the traditional secrets of nature may shine forth 
in the darkness of doubt and uncertainty to illuminate the straight and narrow 
avenues which communicate between the seen and the unseen.</P>

<P>Rossetti, Dante Gabriel :</B> English Author and Painter (<B>1828</B> 
-<B>1882</B>). <I>Gabriel Charles Dante Rossetti, </I>poet, painter and 
translator, and commonly known as <I>Dante Gabriel Rossetti, </I>was born in 
London in <B>1828</B>, his father being an Italian who had settled in England. 
While yet a boy <I>Rossetti </I>manifested aesthetic leanings, and accordingly 
he was sent to study drawing under no less distinguished a preceptor than 
Cotman, while shortly afterwards he entered the Royal Academy Schools, Then in 
<B>1848</B>, feeling the need of still further tuition, he commenced working at 
the studio of Ford Madox Brown, a master who undoubtedly influenced him greatly 
and while under Brown's tuition he began to show himself a painter of distinct 
individuality, while simultaneously he made his first essays in translating 
Italian literature into English, and became known among his friends as a poet of 
rare promise, Meanwhile, however, <I>Rossetti </I>was really more interested in 
the brush than in the pen, and soon after finally quitting Brown's studio he 
brought about a memorable event in the history of English painting, this being 
the founding of the pre-Raphaelite brotherhood, a body consisting of seven 
members whose central aim was to render precisely and literally every separate 
object figured in their pictures.</P>
<P>Leaving his father's house in <B>1849</B>, <I>Rossetti </I>went to live at 
Chatham Place, Blackfriars Bridge, and during the next ten years his activity as 
a painter was enormous; while the year <B>1860</B> is a notable one in his 
career, marked as it is by his marriage to Eleanor Siddal. The love between the 
pair was of an exceptionally passionate order and from it sprang <I>Rossetti's 
</I>immortal sonnet-sequence called <I>The House of Life, </I>published in 
<B>1881</B> ; but Mrs. Rossetti died in <B>1862</B>, and thereupon the poet, 
terribly cast down by his bereavement, went to live at a house in Chelsea with 
Swinburne and Meredith. Here he continued to write fitfully, while in 
<B>1871</B> he completed one of his most famous pictures, <I>Dante's Dream ; 
</I>yet the loss of his wife preyed upon him persistently, he was tortured by 
insomnia, and in consequence, he began to take occasional doses of chloral. 
Gradually this practice developed into a habit, sapping alike the physical and 
mental strength of the poet; and though he rallied for a while during a stay in 
Scotland, where he lived at Penkill Castle in Ayrshire, it soon became evident 
that his death was imminent unless he aschewed the drug. But he had not the 
strength of will necessary for this abjuration, he died in <B>1882</B> at 
Birchington, and his remains were interred in the cemetery there.</P><I>
<P>Rossetti </I>had a marked bias for mysticism in various forms. William Bell 
Scott, in his <I>Autobiography, </I>tells how the poet became at one time much 
enamoured of table-turning and the like ; while waiving his somewhat childish 
taste herein, his temperament was undoubtedly a very religious one, and once 
towards the close of his life he declared that he had &quot;seen and heard those 
that died long ago.&quot; Was it, then, a belief in the possibility of 
communicating with the dead which induced him, on his wife's death, to have some 
of his love poems enclosed in the coffin of the deceased ? while, be the answer 
to this question what it may, <I>Rossetti's </I>mysticism certainly bore good 
fruit in his art, his <I>Rose Mary </I>being among the most beautiful of English 
poems introducing the supernatural element. Nevertheless, it is by this painting 
rather than by his poetry that <I>Rossetti </I>holds a place as a great mystic ; 
for, despite his fondness for precise handling, all his pictures with the 
exception of <I>Found </I>are essentially of a mystical nature; they are not 
concerned with the tangible and visible world, but body forth the scenes and 
incidents beheld in dreams, and do this with a mastery reflected by no other 
kindred works save those of Blake.</P>

<P>Rupecissa, Johannes de :</B> This alchemist was an ancestor of Montfaucon, 
the distinguished archaeologist, and his name suggests that he was a man of 
gentle birth, while it is commonly supposed that he was a French monk of the 
order of St. Francis, and it is reported that in <B>1357</B>, presumably on 
account of his alchemistic predilections, he was imprisoned by Pope Innocent VI. 
<I>Rupecissa </I>contributed four volumes to the literature of hermetic 
philosophy : <I>Coelum Philosophorum, </I>Paris <B>1543</B>, <I>De Quinta

<P>Rusalki :</B> <I>Rusalki, </I>the lovely river nymph of Southern Russia seems 
to have been endowed with the beauty of person and the gentle characteristics of 
the Mermaids of Northern nations. Shy and benevolent, she lived on the small 
alluvial islands that stud the mighty rivers which drain. this extensive and 
thinly-peopled country, or in the detached coppices that fringe their banks, in 
bowers woven of flowering reeds and green-willow-boughs ; her pastime and 
occupation being to aid in secret the poor fishermen in their laborious and 
precarious calling. Little is known of these beautiful creatures - as if the 
mystery and secrecy which was inculcated and enforced in all affairs of 
government in this country had been extended to its fairy faith. Even Keightley, 
so learned in fairy lore, knows little of <I>Rusalki, </I>and dismisses her with 
the following brief notice</P>
<P>&quot;They are of a beautiful form, with long green hair they swim and 
balance themselves on the branches of trees, bathe in the lakes and rivers, play 
on the surface of the water, and wring their locks on the green meads at the 
water's edge. It is chiefly at Whitsuntide that they appear; and the people 
then, singing and dancing, weave garlands for them, which they cast into the 
stream.&quot;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Russia :</B> (For early history of occult matters in Russia <I>see 
</I><STRONG>Slavs</STRONG>.) Spiritualism was first introduced into Russia by 
persons who had become interested in the subject whilst abroad through 
witnessing manifestations of psychic phenomena and acquaintance with the works 
of Allan Kardec, the French exponent of Spiritualism. From the first the new 
doctrine found its followers chiefly among members of the professions and the 
aristocracy, finally including the reigning monarch of that time, Alexander II. 
with many of his family and entourage as devoted adherents. Because of the 
immense influence of such converts the progress of Spiritualism in Russia was 
made smoother than it otherwise would have been in a country where the laws of 
Church and State are nothing if not despotic and disposed to look upon anything 
new in matters religious, intellectual or merely of general interest as 
partaking of a revolutionary character. Even so, much of the spiritualistic 
propaganda, manifestations and publications were prosecuted under various ruses 
and subterfuges such as the circulation of a paper entitled &quot; The 
Rebus,&quot; professedly devoted to innocent rebuses and charades and only 
incidentally mentioning Spiritualism the real object of its being. Chief amongst 
the distinguished devotees of the subject was Prince Wittgenstein, aide-de-camp 
and trusted friend of Alexander II., who not only avowed his beliefs openly but 
arranged for various mediums to give seances before the Emperor, one of these 
being the well-known D. D. Home. So impressed was the Czar that, it is said, 
from that time onwards he consulted mediums and their prophetic powers as to the 
advisability or otherwise of any contemplated change or step in his life, 
doubtless helped or driven to such dependence on mediums by the uncertain 
conditions under which occupants of the Russian throne seem to exist.</P>
<P>&quot;Another Russian of high position socially and officially, M. Aksakof, 
interested himself in the matter in ways many and various, arranging seances to 
which he invited the scientific men of the University, editing a paper 
<I>Psychische Studien, </I>of necessity published abroad ; translating 
Swedenborg's works into Russian beside various French, American and English 
works on the same subject and thus becoming a leader in the movement. Later, 
with his friends, M. M. Boutlerof and Wagner, professors respectively of 
chemistry and zoology at the University of St. Petersburg, he specially 
commenced a series of seances for the investigation of the phenomena in an 
experimental manner and a scientific committee was formed under the leadership 
of Professor Mendleyef who afterwards issued an adverse report on the matter, 
accusing the mediums of trickery and their followers of easy credulity and the 
usual warfare proceeded between the scientific investigators and spiritual 
enthusiasts.&quot;</P>
<P>M. Aksakof's commission was reported upon unfavourably by M. Mendeleyef, but 
the former protested against the report.</P>
<P>At the other extreme of the Social scale among the peasantry and uneducated 
classes generally, the grossest superstition exists, an ineradicable belief in 
supernatural agencies and cases are often reported in the columns of Russian 
Papers of wonder-working, obsession and various miraculous happenings, all 
ascribed, according to their character, to demoniac or angelic influence, or in 
the districts where the inhabitants are still pagan to local deities and 
witchcraft.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Ruysbroeck or Ruysbrock :</B> Flemish Mystic (<B>1293</B>-<B>1381</B>), It is 
probable that this mystic derived his name from the village of Ruysbreck, near 
Brussels, for it was there that he was born in the year <B>1293</B>. Even as a 
child he showed distinct religious leanings, and before he was out of his teens 
he had steeped himself in a wealth of mystical literature. Naturally, then, he 
decided to espouse the clerical profession, and in <B>1317</B> he was duly 
ordained, while a little later he became vicar of St. Gudule, one of the 
parishes of Brussels. During his long term of acting in this capacity he became 
widely esteemed for his erudition, and for his personal piety; while his sermons 
and even his letters were passed from hand to hand, and perused with great 
admiration by many of his fellow clerics. But he was never found guilty of 
courting fame or publicity of any kind, and at the age of sixty he retired to 
Groenendale, not far from the battlefield of Waterloo, where he founded a 
monastery. There he lived until his death in <B>1381</B>, devoting himself 
chiefly to the study of mysticism, yet showing himself anything but averse to 
those charitable actions befitting a monk.</P><I>
<P>Ruysbroeck </I>was known to his disciples as &quot; the ecstatic 
teacher.&quot; As a thinker he was speculative and broad-minded, and indeed he 
was one of those who prefigured the Reformation, the result being that, though 
he won the encomiums of many famous theologians in the age immediately 
succeeding his, an attempt to beatify him was sternly suppressed. He was a 
tolerably voluminous writer, and at Cologne, in <B>1552</B>, one of his 
manuscripts found its way into book form with the title, <I>De Naptu svel de 
Ornatu Nuptiarum Spiritualium; </I>while since then a number of his further 
works have been published, notably <I>De Vera Contemplatione </I>and <I>De 
Septem Gradivus Amoris </I>(Hanover, <B>1848</B>). The central tenet of his 
teaching is that the soul finds God in its own depths,&quot; but, in 
contradistinction to many other mystics. he did not teach the fusion of the self 
in God, but held that at the summit of the ascent towards righteousness the soul 
still preserves its identity.</P><I>
<P>Ruysbroeck </I>and his teaching begot many voluminous commentaries throughout 
the middle ages, and he has attracted a number of great writers, the Abbi 
Bossuet, for example, and at a later date Maurice Maeterlinck. In <B>1891</B> 
the latter published <I>L'Ornemant des Noces Spirituelles, de Ruysbroeck 
l'admirable, </I>and an English translation of this by J. T. Stoddart was issued 
in <B>1904</B>. The reader desirous of further information should consult 
<I>Studies in Mystical Religion, </I>by Rufus M. Jones, <B>1909</B>.</P></FONT>
